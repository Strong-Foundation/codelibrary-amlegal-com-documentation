P R E A M B L E
   The City of Wheeling has been and remains an ideal locale in which to live,
to work, and to raise a family. Its excellent schools, beautiful parks, low
crime, incomparable fire department, efficient public services, and, most
important, warm and friendly residents, make Wheeling a city without equal for
its size.
   It is the mission of the Charter Review Board, elected and empowered by the
citizens of The City of Wheeling at an election held December 3, 1991, to build
upon and improve our fair city, as follows:
1.    To provide a leadership figure for the city, backed by the mandate of the
electorate, to coordinate and advance our economic rebirth;
2.    To provide for a council which is more accountable to the citizens it
represents, more efficient, and more decorous in its actions;
3.    To retain the city manager form of government to maintain the efficient
services our citizens have enjoyed;
4.    To more clearly delineate the duties, responsibilities and authorities of
the administrative and legislative branches of city government; and
5.    To retain unchanged and unaffected by political pressures the Wheeling
Park Commission, which has provided our city with successful and beautiful
parks for the enjoyment of our citizens and enrichment of our community.
   In the hope that we have fulfilled our mission and our obligation, we, the
Charter Review Board, have adopted and do propose to the electorate of The City
of Wheeling the following charter.
CHARTER OF THE CITY OF WHEELING
SECTION 1. POWERS AND RIGHTS OF CITY AS CORPORATE BODY.
   The inhabitants of the portion of the Counties of Ohio and Marshall, in the

that name, shall have perpetual succession, and may contract and be contracted
with, sue and be sued, plead or be impleaded, answer and be answered unto, and
may purchase, acquire by condemnation proceedings for public use, take,
receive, hold and use goods and chattels, lands and tenements and choses in

the City, or in trust for the benefit of any person or association therein; and
the same may grant, sell, convey, transfer and assign, let, pledge, mortgage,
charge and encumber, in any case and in any manner in which it would be lawful
for private individuals so to do, except where its powers may be limited by

pleasure; and generally shall have all the rights, franchises, capacities and
powers appertaining to municipal corporations in this State.
   All real and personal estate, and all funds, rights, titles, taxes, credits

of the public from unnecessary damages or inconveniences by reason of such
works and the maintenance or operation thereof.
   (d)    Consideration for grant. No grant of any franchise, right or
privilege shall be made without at the time of making it providing that the
City shall receive in consideration therefor proper compensation, which may be
paid in such manner as Council shall deem to be in the best interest of the
City.
   (e)    Payment of election expenses where special election required. In case
a petition for stay of ordinance is presented in accordance with section

rejecting the application for a franchise, right or privilege, the applicant
for same shall deposit with the City the amount of expenses of the election,
which shall be applied to the payment of such expenses.

fire, panic or other danger, to promote health and general welfare, to provide
adequate light and air, to prevent the crowding of land, to avoid undue
concentration of population, and to facilitate the adequate provision for
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks and other requirements. Such

character of the district and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, and

appropriate use of land throughout the City of Wheeling. Council shall provide
for the manner in which such regulations and restrictions and the boundaries of
such district shall be determined, established and enforced, and from time to
time may amend, supplement or change; provided, however, that no such
regulations, restrictions or boundaries shall become effective until after
public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties interested and citizens
shall have an opportunity to be heard. At least fifteen days' notice of the
time such regulations are to be presented shall be published in at least two
newspapers published and circulated in the City of Wheeling.

repaired, converted or maintained, or any building, structure or land is used
in violation of this section or of any ordinance or any other regulation made
under authority conferred hereby, Council in addition to other remedies may in
the name of the City bring an appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such
unlawful erection, construction, alterations, repair, conversion, maintenance

SECTION 71. ISSUANCE AND SALE OF BONDS; PENALTY; ADVISORY COMMITTEE.
    The City of Wheeling is hereby authorized to issue and sell its bonds;
provided, that the City shall not by such issue and sale of bonds cause the
aggregate of its debts of every kind whatsoever to exceed five percent of the
valuation of the taxable property therein, which value shall be ascertained by
the last assessment for State and County taxes previous to the issue of said
bonds, nor shall said City make such issue and sale without at the same time
providing for the collection of a direct annual tax of an amount sufficient to
pay the annual interest of such debt and the principal thereof within and not
exceeding thirty-four years.
   No bonds shall be issued by said City unless all questions connected with
the same shall have been first submitted to the qualified voters of said City
and have received three-fifths of all the votes cast for and against the same.
   When the Council shall deem it expedient to issue bonds, an ordinance
specifying the purpose and amount for which such bonds are to be issued, shall
be adopted by them at a regular meeting and it shall then be the duty of the
Mayor of the City to issue a proclamation reciting said ordinance and
appointing a day at which an election shall be held by the qualified voters of
the City to decide whether they will ratify or reject said ordinance. Any bond
ordinance may be voted on at the time of holding any general municipal election
or a special election may be held for the purpose of submitting said ordinance
to a vote of the people. If a bond ordinance is submitted to a vote at the time
of a general municipal election, separate ballots shall be provided therefor.
Such proclamation shall be published in two morning newspapers published in the

   More than one ordinance may be submitted at any election, but each ordinance
shall be separately voted upon; any ordinance may specify more than one purpose
for which said bonds are to be issued; provided, however, that the amount to be
appropriated for each purpose is also specified therein. The proclamation
issued by the Mayor, as hereinbefore provided, shall specify the aggregate
amount of indebtedness, outstanding and authorized, of the City existing at the
date of the proclamation.
   Bonds issued by the City shall be of the denomination of one hundred dollars
or multiples thereof, not exceeding one thousand dollars. They shall be payable

not more than six percent interest and the interest shall be payable annually

directly or indirectly any bond or bonds to be used in payment for work or
material to be furnished, but all such bonds shall be publicly sold to the
highest bidder in writing to be approved by the officers conducting the sale,
for cash, or its equivalent in bonds previously issued by the City, and the
money arising therefrom shall be used for the purpose specified in the
ordinance providing for the issuing of the same; before any sale of such bonds,
said sale shall be advertised in some newspapers, not exceeding four, in or out
of said City, once a week for four weeks previous to said sale.
   The Finance Director of the City of Wheeling and his sureties shall be
liable for the sinking fund and the amount levied or may be levied for a
sinking fund and to pay interest on the bonded debt, and it shall be applied to
the purposes for which it was levied or for investment in United States bonds
or bonds of the City, as the Council may direct, to be used for the payment of
principal and interest of any bonded debt of the City.
   Bonds of the City shall not be sold at less than their par value. The
Council shall provide in its ordinance that bonds of the City be signed by the
Mayor and City Clerk and sealed with the seal of the City.
   Should any of the funds derived from the issuance and sale of bonds of the
City be diverted by the Council or any officer or officers of the City from the
purpose for which said bonds were issued and sold, such members of Council or
City officer using same or consenting to or aiding in the use thereof for such
other purpose, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punished by a fine of not
less than one hundred dollars or more than five hundred dollars, or by
imprisonment for not less than thirty days nor more than one year, or both fine
and imprisonment.
   The City may issue and sell its bonds for any purpose for which a
Municipality may issue bonds. After the Council shall have passed an ordinance
providing for the submission of a bond issue to the voters of the City, the
Mayor, with the consent and approval of Council, shall appoint a committee
consisting of not less than five residents and citizens of the City of
Wheeling, which committee shall act in an advisory capacity with the City
Council in all matters relating to the issuance and sale of such bonds, and
with the City Manager in awarding of contracts and expenditures of the funds
derived from a sale of such bonds. The names of the members of such committee
shall be published in the proclamation issued by the Mayor prior to the holding
of the election on any such bond issue.
SECTION 72. CITY DEPOSITORIES.
   The Council shall provide by ordinance for the deposit of all public moneys
of the City in such bank or banks situated within the City as Council shall
designate by ordinance. Before any public moneys shall be deposited in such
bank it shall give a good and sufficient bond to the city to secure the
accounting for and due payment over such public moneys, with security approved
by the Council. The security shall always be in a sum not less than ten percent
in excess of the maximum amount at any time deposited, but there shall not be
deposited in any one bank an amount in excess of the paid-in capital stock and
surplus of such bank, and not in any event an amount in excess of six million
dollars. As to any deposits made under authority of an ordinance of the
Council, passed pursuant to this section, neither the depositing officer nor
other persons so depositing, nor such officers’ sureties, shall be liable for
any loss occasioned by the deposit or in anywise growing out of it.

subject to exceptions, and shall take such direction and have only such force
and effect as may be provided by law; but in all cases such settlements shall
be recorded and be open to examination of the people at such convenient place
or places as may be appointed by ordinance of the City.

      (1)   Council does hereby establish an Employees' Retirement and Benefit
Fund for the employees of the City as set forth and described in West Virginia
Code 8-22-2, by adopting all of the terms and provisions of West Virginia Code
Article 8-22.
      (2)   The City's Employees' Retirement and Benefit Fund is hereby amended
to allow a designated beneficiary to receive retirement pension upon the death
of a member receiving retirement pension pursuant to West Virginia Code 8-22-9
(b).
      (3)   Contributions made by a member of the Fund shall be before tax,
pursuant to Section 414 (h) (2) of the Internal Revenue Code [26 U.S.C. Sec.
414 (h) (2)].

the classified and unclassified services of the City. Each full pay period
worked by an employee, including vacation time and allowable sick leave, shall

department. Employees shall not take sick leave except in cases of absolute
necessity. The City Manager may order a physical examination of any employee on

member of the Board, Council shall appoint another individual to fill the

   Every position or employment, unless filled by reinstatement, reduction or
transfer, shall be filled in the following manner:
   Vacancies in positions in the classified service shall be filled so far as
practicable by in- house applicants. Filling positions shall be based upon the
merit to be approved by tests approved by the Civil Service Commission and upon
the superior qualifications of the person promoted, as shown by his/her
education, experience, performance record and work history.
   The appointing officer shall notify the Civil Service Commission of any
vacancy in the service which he/she desires to fill and shall request the
certification of eligibles. The Commission shall certify, from the eligible or
employment list, the names of the three persons who received the highest rank
at preceding examinations.
   The Department and/or Division Head, respective supervisor (if applicable)
and the Human Resources Director shall interview the three applicants and
recommend to the Appointing Authority the most qualified individual(s) for the
vacancy.
   The appointing officer shall, in his/her discretion, make an appointment
from the three names so certified. Should the appointing officer reject a
higher ranked individual for a lower ranked individual, then he/she shall
advise the Commission of his/her decision and reasons therefor.
   As each subsequent vacancy occurs in the same or another position, precisely
the same procedure shall be followed; provided, however, that after any name
has been three times rejected in the same list, the name shall be stricken from
the list. When there are a number of positions of the same kind to be filled at
the same time, each appointment shall be made separately and in accordance with
the foregoing provisions. If the number of eligibles on any eligible list is
less than three, then those so remaining may be certified and appointments may
be made therefrom, until the list is exhausted.
   When an appointment is made under the provisions of this section, it shall
be for the probationary period of six months, as provided in Section
159.14. Immediate report in writing shall be given to the Commission by the
appointing officer, and/or by such other persons as may be designated by the
Commission, of all appointments, reinstatements, vacancies, absences or other
matters affecting the status of positions or the performance of duties of
employees classified under the provisions of this article and all such notices
shall be prepared in the manner and form prescribed by the Commission.
(Ord. 11599. Passed 7-21-98.)
159.11 INVESTIGATIONS.
   The Commission may, as a body, or through a single Commissioner, make
investigations concerning all matters touching the enforcement and effect of
the provisions of this article and the rules prescribed thereunder, concerning
the action of any person in the public service in respect to the execution of
this article; and in the course of such investigation each Commissioner shall
have the power to administer oaths and affirmation and to take testimony.
(Ord. 11599. Passed 7-21-98.)

159.13 PROBATIONARY PERIODS FOR APPOINTEES.

month anniversary date of appointment or re-employment, the department head
shall complete a performance appraisal stating if the services of the employee
during the probationary period have been satisfactory and if he/she should be
continued in service, and forward it to the Human Resources Department. The
Human Resources Department will forward the performance appraisal and payroll
adjustment form to the appointing officer for continued service or termination
approval.
   This probationary period shall be deemed to be part of the examining process
for determining the qualification of candidates. At all times during this
probationary period, employment shall be at will. Upon dismissal during the
probationary period of a classified in- house appointment, the employee,
otherwise in good standing, shall be reinstated in his/her former position even
though this may necessitate the lay-off of the employee occupying his/her
former position.
(Ord. 11599. Passed 7-21-98.)
159.14 REMOVAL, DISCHARGE, SUSPENSION OR DEMOTION OF EMPLOYEES.
   (a)   Authority and Procedure Generally; Hearings and Appeals. The
appointing officer shall have the authority to remove, discharge, suspend or
demote any employee in the classified service of the City for just cause, which
shall not be religious or political. No such employee shall be removed,
discharged, suspended or demoted except as provided in this article and in no
event until furnished with a written statement of the reasons for such action
by the appointing officer. The employee sought to be removed, discharged,
suspended or demoted shall be given the opportunity to appear before the
appointing officer at a specified time to justify why such action should not be
taken. If the employee does not appear at that time, the removal, discharge,
suspension or demotion shall be final. In every case of such removal,
discharge, suspension or demotion, a copy of the statement of reasons therefor
and of the written answer thereto, if the employee desires to file such written
answer, shall be furnished no later than ten days after the written notice of
the action taken by the appointing officer to the Civil Service Commission and
entered upon its records.
   If, following the appearance before the appointing officer the employee
sought to be removed, discharged, suspended or demoted shall demand a hearing
in writing no later than ten days after the written notice of the action taken
by the appointing officer, the Civil Service Commission shall schedule such
public hearing which shall be held within a period of twenty days from the
filing of the charges in writing and the answer thereto, whichever shall last
occur. At such hearing, the burden shall be upon the appointing officer to
justify his/her action, and in the event that the Civil Service Commission
finds the action of the appointing officer unjustified, then the employee
removed shall be reinstated with full pay for the entire period during which
he/she may have been prevented from performing his/her usual employment, and no
charges shall be officially recorded against his/her record. The record of all
testimony taken at such hearing shall be kept and preserved by the Civil
Service Commission, which record shall be sealed and not be open to public
inspection unless an appeal is taken from the actions of the Commission.
   In the event the Civil Service Commission shall sustain the action of the
appointing officer, the employee removed shall have an immediate right of
appeal to the Circuit Court of Ohio County. In the event that the Civil Service
Commission reinstates the employee, the appointing officer has an immediate
right of appeal to the Circuit Court of Ohio County.
   Such appeal shall be taken within sixty days from the entry by the Civil
Service Commission of its final order. Upon such an appeal being taken and
docketed with the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the Circuit Court shall proceed
to hear the appeal upon the original record taken therein, and no additional
proof shall be permitted to be introduced. The record shall be furnished and
paid for by the appellant. The Circuit Court’s decision shall be final, but the
employee or appointing officer, as the case may be, against whom the decision
of the Circuit Court is rendered has the right to petition the Supreme Court of
Appeals for a review of the Circuit Court’s decision as in other civil cases.
The appointing officer and the employee sought to be removed shall at all
times, both before the Civil Service Commission, and upon appeal, be given the
right to employ counsel to represent them.
(Ord. 11761. Passed 4-6-99.)
   (b)   Grounds for Removal, Suspension or Demotion. Employees in the
classified service may be removed, suspended or demoted for the following
reasons:
      (1)   If the City Manager deems it necessary to reduce the number of
employees in the classified service, for the purpose of economy, lack of work
or lack of appropriation for the particular work or service which the employee
performs.
      (2)   When an employee becomes so physically or mentally disabled, as to
be rendered unable to perform the essential functions of the position he/she
occupies with a reasonable accommodation.
      (3)   When an employee does not maintain expected performance or violates
City Policy or Code.
   (c)   Reductions for Purpose of Economy, Lack of Work, Etc. When the
reduction is made for the purpose of economy, lack of work, or lack of
appropriation for the particular work or service which the employee performs,
the appointing officer shall make the reduction from the most recent
appointees, provisional or otherwise, by their removal in the reverse order of
their appointments.
   (d)   Re-employment List; Re-establishment of Discontinued Positions.
Whenever an employee is removed because his or her position has been
discontinued, his or her name shall be placed on the re-employment list which
is hereby created. Whenever discontinued positions are re-established, the
persons who have been so removed shall be the first to receive appointment and
in the reverse order of their removal. Any person who fails to be given
employment will, after the expiration of one year from the termination of such
employment, be automatically dropped from the re-employment list.
   (e)   Suspension of Subordinates by Appointing Officer. The appointing
officer may suspend a subordinate for a reasonable period not exceeding thirty
days, for any cause which will promote the efficiency of the service, including
violation of City Code or Policy and/or poor performance. Every such suspension
shall be without pay. If the suspended employee does not agree with the action,
he/she shall have ten days from notification of the appointing officer’s
written decision to file a request for a hearing with the Commission. The
Commission shall have the authority to investigate every such suspension, and,
in case of its disapproval shall have the power to restore pay in whole or in
part, to the employee(s) so suspended.
(Ord. 11599. Passed 7-21-98.)
159.15 AGE REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICANTS FOR POSITIONS.
   The Civil Service Commission shall comply with all state and federal
regulations regarding age requirements and/or restrictions.

and workers equal opportunity for employment, equal access to places of public

gender identity.
   (c)   The denial of these rights to properly qualified persons by reason of
race, religion, color, national origin, ancestry, sex, age, blindness,
disability, familial status, veteran status, sexual orientation, or gender
identity is contrary to the principles of freedom and quality of opportunity
and is destructive to a free and democratic society.
   (d)   This City policy is based on the recognition and vision that the
diversity found in our City brings forth richness in our community, a greater
understanding of our world, a multitude of talent to benefit collective needs,
and an opportunity for enhanced living and learning for all. Inherent in this
policy is a commitment to encourage and endeavor to bring about equal
opportunity, mutual understanding and respect for persons of all ages,
abilities, ancestry, blindness, color, disabilities, ethnicities, familial
status, veteran status, national origins, sex, races, religions, sexual
orientations, gender identities and other backgrounds or orientations. (Ord.

the Commission against such employer. Any complaint filed pursuant to this
article must be filed within three hundred sixty-five (365) days after the
alleged act of discrimination.
   (c)   After the filing of a written, verified complaint, or whenever there
is reason to believe that an unlawful discriminatory practice has been
committed, the Commission and the assigned Commissioner designated by the
Commission to oversee and direct the complaint process shall, within twenty
(20) days, complete a prompt investigation in connection therewith and make a
written determination.
   (d)   If it shall be determined after such investigation that no probable
cause exists for substantiating the allegations of the complaint, the
Commission, by and through the designated Commissioner, shall, within ten (10)
days from such determination, cause to be issued and served upon the
complainant written notice of such determination, and the said complainant or
his attorney may, within ten (10) days after such service, file with the
Commission a written request for a meeting with the Commission to show probable
cause for substantiating the allegations of the complaint. The meeting shall be
held within ten (10) days of receipt of the request. The designated
Commissioner shall be responsible for all notices and arrangements to be made
for such meetings. If it shall be determined after such investigation or
meeting that probable cause exists for substantiating the allegations of the
complaint, the Commission, by and through the designated Commissioner, shall
immediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful discriminatory practices
complained of by conference, conciliation and persuasion. The members of the
Commission shall, within ten (10) days after such investigation or meeting, not
disclose what has transpired in the course of such endeavors: Provided, that
the Commission may publish the facts in the case of any complaint which has
been dismissed and the terms of conciliation when the complaint has been
adjusted, without disclosing the identity of the parties involved to the extent
allowed by law.
   (e)   Except as provided in this Article, all of the pertinent provisions of
West Virginia Code Article 29A-5 shall apply to and govern the hearing and the
administrative procedures in connection with and following such hearing, with
like effect as if the provisions of such Article 29A-5 were set forth in
extensor in this section.
   (f)   The following alternative remedies are available, which may not be all
inclusive, in case of failure to eliminate through conciliation and conference
such discriminatory practice or in advance thereof, if in the judgment of the
Commission circumstances so warrant, the following alternative remedies are
available, which may or may not be all inclusive, the Commission may:
      (1)   Cause the complaint file to be immediately sent to the State of
West Virginia Human Rights Commission to be processed in accord with West
Virginia Code §5-11-10. The deadline for response by the Commission to verified
complaints as contained in this section is necessary so that prompt evaluation
can be made as to whether the matter will be retained by the City Commission
for purposes of conciliation and if such process fails, the matter can be sent
to the West Virginia State Human Rights Commission for further action in a
timely manner. Deadlines for responses to verified complaints may only be
extended with good cause shown and cannot be extended for any period other than
an additional ten (10) days. Parties may only request one (1) extension of any
applicable deadline. Deadline extensions are inapplicable to the mandatory
three hundred and sixty-five (365) day filing requirement wherein the act of
alleged discrimination occurred;
       (2)   If after such attempt at conciliation, mediation and persuasion
process has concluded and consideration of all of the information comprising
the record in the case, the Commission finds that a respondent has engaged in
or is engaging in any unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in this
Article, and there remains a failure to eliminate the discrimination, the
Commission may issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order to
cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take such
affirmative action as the Commission deems appropriate. Such order shall be
accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions drawn by the Commission citing
appropriate sections of this article.
   (g)   In the event any person fails to obey a lawful cease and desist order
of the Commission, the Commission may seek an order of a court of competent
jurisdiction for its enforcement in a proceeding as provided in this section.
Such proceeding shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in such court,
together with the entire record of its proceedings before the Commission.
Notice of the filing of such petition, together with a copy thereof, shall be
served upon the respondent in the manner provided by law for the service of
summons in civil actions. The court may grant such temporary relief or
restraining order as it deems just and proper and shall make and enter upon the
pleadings, testimony and proceedings set forth in such transcript an order
enforcing, modifying and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or
in part the order of the Commission. All such proceedings shall be heard and
determined by the court.
   (h)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the filing of a
private cause of action at any time. Judicial review of a final decision of the
Commission shall be by a certiorari as set forth in West Virginia Code §53-3-
1 through 53-3-6, or in such other manner as may be allowed under the laws of
the State.
(Ord. 15849. Passed 2-7-23.)
169.10 CONFLICTS OF LAW.
   In the event of a conflict between the interpretation of a provision of West
Virginia Article §5-11 et seq. and the interpretation of a similar provision
contained in any part of this municipal ordinance, the interpretation of the
provision in West Virginia Code shall apply to this municipal ordinance. Until
such time as the legislation of the State provides equal or broader protections
for the classifications of veteran status, sexual orientation or gender
identity, the provisions contained herein control such application of this
article to such classifications. (Ord. 15849. Passed 2-7-23.)

      (Ord. 9488. Passed 8-22-89.)
173.08 DESIGNATION; REPORT.
   (a)   Prior to designation of an historic landmark or historic district, the
Historic Landmarks Commission shall make or cause to be made a report on the
historical, cultural and architectural significance of each building,
structure, site and district proposed for designation, based upon the following
standards:
   (b)   No building, structure, site or district shall be deemed to be an
historic one unless it has been prominently identified with or best represents
some major aspect of the cultural, political economic, military or social
history of the City, the State or nation, or has had a major relationship with
the life of an historic personage or event representing some major aspect of,
or ideals related to, the history of the City, the State or the nation. In the
case of buildings or structures which are to be so designated, they shall
embody the principal or unique features of an architectural type or demonstrate
the style of a period of our history or method of construction, or serve as an
illustration of the work of a master builder, designer or architect whose
genius influenced the period in which that person worked or has significance in
current times.
   (c)   The commission shall submit such report, including maps and
photographs as necessary, to the West Virginia Department of Culture and
History. In the case of a report of a proposed historic district, the
Commission shall submit with the report a map showing boundaries of the
proposed district.
   (d)   In the event that such designation is proposed to include a
certificate of appropriateness procedures, Council shall delegate authority for
the Commission to hold a public hearing on the proposed designation of the
historic property or historic district, and any proposed regulations and
requirements for the historic district. Notice of the hearing shall be
published at least two times in the principle newspaper of general circulation
within the Municipality and written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by
certified mail with the signed return receipt required by the Commission to all
owners and occupants of such properties. All the notices shall be published or
mailed not less than ten nor more than twenty days prior to the date set for
the public hearing. Following the public hearing, unless the owner of a
proposed property or fifty percent (50%) of the ownership interest in a
proposed district objects to such designation or regulations and requirements
within thirty days following the public hearing, the Commission shall forward
its report of the public hearing and its recommendation to Council. Council may
designate the property or properties as historic, and approve, amend or reject
the proposed regulations or requirements. Within thirty days following such
designation or approval, the owners and occupants of each designated historic
property shall be given written notification of such designation or approval by
Council, which notice shall apprise the owners and occupants of the necessity
of obtaining a certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking any
alteration in the exterior architectural features of the historic landmark
designated or within an historic district.
   (e)   Any such historic landmark or district designated under this article
which is subject to certificates of appropriateness shall be shown on the
official zoning map of the City.
(Ord. 13926. Passed 3-2-10.)
173.09 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS; REVIEW; VARIANCES; APPEALS.
   (a)   No private buildings, site or structure designated as historic as
approved by Council and which is subject to certificates of appropriateness
under Section
173.08 shall be erected, altered, restored, moved or demolished until after an
application for a certificate of appropriateness as to exterior architectural
features has been submitted to and approved by the Historic Landmarks
Commission, except as otherwise provided by rules, regulations, policies,
procedures and standards adopted and published by the Commission. For the
purposes of this article, exterior architectural features include such portion
of the exterior of a structure as is open to view from a public street, way or
place. Similarly, if earthworks of historical or archaeological importance
exist in the historic district, there shall be no excavating or moving of
earth, rock or subsoil or any development upon or around earthworks without a
certificate of appropriateness. Notwithstanding the provisions of Article
1757, the style, material, size and location of outdoor advertising signs and
bill posters shall be under the control of the Commission.
 
   (b)   An application for a certificate of appropriateness includes the
following:
      (1)   Scaled elevation and/or a suitable eight-inch (8" x 10") photograph
of the building facades which are visible from a public way.
      (2)   Specification of materials, colors and construction techniques.
      (3)   Other information as may be reasonably deemed necessary by the
Commission to enable it to make a determination on the application for a
certificate of appropriateness.
   (c)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing upon each application for a
certificate of appropriateness. Notice of the time and place of such hearing
shall be given by publication in a newspaper having general circulation within
the City, at least seven days before such hearing, and by posting such notice
on or near the main entrance of any hall or room where the Commission usually
meets. The Commission shall take such action as required to inform the owners
of any property likely to be affected by the application and shall give the
applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard.
 
   (d)   The Commission shall approve or reject an application for a
certificate of appropriateness within forty-five days after the filing thereof
by the owner or occupant of a historic property or a building, site or
structure located within a historic district. Evidence of approval shall be by
a certificate of appropriateness issued by the Commission.
 
   (e)   In passing upon the appropriateness of proposed action, the Commission
shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and
architectural integrity and significance; architectural style; design,
arrangement, texture and materials of exterior architectural features; and the
relationship and general compatibility thereof to the historical value and
exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the
surrounding area. In reviewing an application, the Commission shall follow "The
Secretary of the Interior's STANDARDS FOR HISTORIC PRESERVATION PROJECTS with
Guidelines for Applying the Standards." The Commission shall pass only on
exterior features of a structure and shall not consider interior arrangements.
 
   (f)   The Commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate
of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed action would be appropriate.
In the event the Commission rejects an application, such Commission shall place
upon its records and shall transmit a record of such action and reasons
therefore, in writing, to the applicant. In such written record, the Commission
may make recommendations relative to design, arrangement, texture, material and
similar features. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to
the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
 
   (g)   The Commission shall transmit to the Zoning Administrator and Building
Inspector the certificate of appropriateness or rejection thereof. In cases
where the application covers new construction or an alteration in the exterior
architectural features of a structure which would require the issuance of a
building permit, the rejection of an application for a certificate of
appropriateness by the Commission shall be binding upon the Building Inspector
and Zoning Administrator.
 
   (h)   Where it is reasonably necessary or appropriate for the preservation
of a unique historic property, the Commission may enter into negotiations with
the owner for the acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange or otherwise of the
property or any interest therein.
 
   (i)   If the strict application of any provision of this article would
result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any
owner of any specific property, the Commission, in passing upon applications,
shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to
interpret the meaning of the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or
hardship: Provided, that such variance, modification or interpretation shall
remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that
architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be
conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the Commission
may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will
in its judgment best fulfill the purpose of this article.
 
   (j)   The Commission shall keep a record of all applications for
certificates of appropriateness and of all its proceedings.
 
   (k)   Any person adversely affected by any determinations made by the
Commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of
appropriateness may appeal such determination to the Circuit Court of Ohio
County.
 
   (l)   Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on an
historic property, which maintenance or repair does not involve a material
change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent any
property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other
laws, ordinances or regulations.
 
   (m)   Undertakings permitted, funded, licensed or otherwise assisted by the
State shall be reviewed in accordance with West Virginia Code 5-1-29(e)[sic]
and shall be considered exempt from review for certification or appropriateness
as described in this section.
(Ord. 9488. Passed 8-22-89.)
173.10 COURT ACTION TO PREVENT IMPROPER CHANGES OR ILLEGAL ACTS OR CONDUCT.
   The City or the Historic Landmarks Commission shall be authorized to
institute any appropriate action or proceeding in a court of competent
jurisdiction to prevent any material change in the appearance of a designated
historic property or historic district, except those changes made in compliance
with the provisions of this article or to prevent any illegal acts or conduct
with respect to such historic property or historic district.
(Ord. 9488. Passed 8-22-89.)
173.11 NOTICE OF DESIGNATION OF HISTORIC DISTRICT.
   When the Historic Landmarks Commission establishes an historic district, it
shall notify the county assessor of the county in which such district or any
part thereof is located of the fact of such establishment and the boundaries of
the district, together with the restrictions which are applicable to the
properties located in such district. The county assessor shall take such
factors into consideration in assessing the properties therein.
(Ord. 9488. Passed 8-22-89.)
173.12 ASSISTANCE OF STATE AGENCIES; ANNUAL REPORTS.
   The Historic Landmarks Commission shall cooperate and coordinate its
activities with the West Virginia Historical Society and the West Virginia
Department of Culture and History with the view of developing a unified program
for the identification, study, preservation and protection of all historic
buildings, structures and sites in this State. The Commission shall submit a
brief annual report to the West Virginia Department of Culture and History
summarizing Commission activities. In addition, the Commission shall submit
reports as required in other sections of this article and any other reports
required by rule, regulation or agreement.
(Ord. 9488. Passed 8-22-89.)

this section shall not be required for a building or structure, listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or listed as a contributing structure in a
Historic District, damaged beyond reasonable repair as the result of fire,
natural disaster, or other calamity sufficient to justify to the Department
and/or Wheeling Fire Department that there is an immediate threat to public
health, safety, or welfare should the demolition not occur as soon as possible.
In making this determination, the Department and/or Wheeling Fire Department
shall take into account whether insurance is available for the protection of
the public by, for example, fencing the area or shoring up the structure to
protect further damage. Once the structure has been made safe or the immediate
public threat has abated, a demolition permit shall be required.
   (h)   If substantial changes are made to a demolition permit application
either during the Public Hearing or in response thereto, the Commission may
adjourn the Public Hearing to a date certain or require that notice of a new
Public Hearing be given so that the public and other interested parties can
comment upon the substantial changes to the application.
   (i)   City Council may accept the recommendation of the Commission, reject
the recommendation of the Commission and send the application back to the
Commission for further investigation, or overturn the Commission's
recommendation and direct the Department to issue the demolition permit. In the
event City Council overturns the Commission recommendation, it shall state
reasons for such rejection.
   (j)   Any person adversely affected by any determinations made by City
Council, the Department, or the Commission relative to the application for a
demolition permit may appeal such determination to the Circuit Court of Ohio
County pursuant to the following:
      (1)   Every decision or order of the Commission, or Wheeling City Council
is subject to review by certiorari.
      (2)   Within thirty days after a decision or order by the Commission or
Wheeling City Council, any aggrieved person may present to the Circuit Court of
Ohio County, a duly verified petition for a writ of certiorari setting forth:
         A.   That the decision or order by the Commission or Wheeling City
Council is illegal in whole or in part; and
         B.   Specify the grounds of the alleged illegality. (See generally by
analogy WV Codes 8A-9-1).
   (k)   Any owner of a building or structure which is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places or listed as a contributing structure in a Historic
District that demolishes such a structure without a permit issued in accordance
with this section shall be fined the sum of ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00)
or the cost of demolition whichever is greater. Moreover, the City of Wheeling,
or any affected person, demonstrating to the court that he/she has the
requisite standing to do so, may apply for the issuance of emergency injunctive
relief to the Circuit Court of Ohio County, West Virginia, to stop demolition
until a permit issued pursuant to this section has been issued. If injunctive
relief is granted, the City or other interested party applying for injunctive
relief may apply to the Circuit Court of Ohio County, West Virginia, for the
reimbursement by the owner of the building or structure of reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses incurred by the City or other interested party in
addition to any other damages or fines. The costs herein discussed if not
promptly paid within thirty (30) days shall also be subject to statutory
interest. Unpaid costs shall also constitute a lien against the owner's
property and shall be filed in the County Clerk's office.
   (l)   If the strict application of any provision of this section would
result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any
owner, as reasonably determined by the Historic Landmarks Commission, the
Commission, shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the
provisions or to interpret the meaning of the provision so as to relieve such
difficulty or hardship: Provided, that such variance, modification or
interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
the provisions of this section so that a building or structure which is listed
on the National Register of Historic Places is preserved or maintained or the
continuity of a Historic District in which the contributing structure is
located shall be conserved and enhanced and substantial justice is done. In
granting variances, City Council after receiving the recommendations of the
Commission and the Department may impose such reasonable and additional
stipulations and conditions as will in its judgment best fulfill the purpose of
this article.
   (m)   If any article, section, subsection, provision, clause or phrase of
this chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held
unconstitutional or invalid, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not
affect other articles, sections, subsections, provisions, clauses or phrases or
applications of the chapter, and to this end each and every article, section,
subsection, provision, clause and phrase of this chapter is declared to be
severable. The above article is in addition to and not dependent upon other
Sections and Articles of the Codified Laws of the City of Wheeling, WV.
   Nothing contained in this section shall substitute for any other local,
state or federal requirements incumbent upon property owners. Likewise, nothing
contained in this section, article, or other articles of this code shall
constitute a defense to any action for personal injury, wrongful death or
damage to property, etc.
(Ord. 15545. Passed 5-4-21.)

313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the

successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one- way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      ((WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:

the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his crossing on
the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while the wait
signal is showing.

subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other

conviction under this subsection, the greater period of incarceration, period
of revocation, or fine shall be imposed: provided, however, that this section

offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions

applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No

unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense

this section.

of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:

a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b

pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B-1 et seq. may be used
as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation

permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.

section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the

   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,

Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
 333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and
discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status
he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal
and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of
perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his
or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in
response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any
inquiry made in connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:

commercial motor vehicles;

motor vehicle revoked for any offense under a municipal ordinance of this state

      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

Act (ADA).

officer as defined by West Virginia Code 30-29-1, and private security guards,
parking personnel and other personnel authorized by a city, county or the state
to issue parking citations.
   (b)   An accessible parking space should comply with the provisions of the
Americans with Disabilities Act accessibility guidelines, contained in 28
C.F.R. 36, Appendix A, Section 4.6. In particular, the parking space should be
a minimum of eight feet wide with an adjacent eight-foot access aisle for vans
having side mounted hydraulic lifts or ramps or a five-foot access aisle for
standard vehicles. Access aisles should be marked using diagonal two- to four-
inch-wide stripes spaced every twelve or twenty-four inches apart along with
the words “no parking” in painted letters which are at least twelve inches in
height. All accessible parking spaces should have a signpost in front or
adjacent to the accessible parking space displaying the international symbol of
access sign mounted at a minimum of eight feet above the pavement or sidewalk
and the top of the sign. Lines or markings on the pavement or curbs for parking
spaces and access aisles may be in any color, although blue is the generally
accepted color for accessible parking.
   (c)   A vehicle from any other state, United States territory or foreign

international symbol of access shall be designated in close proximity to all
public entities including state, county and municipal buildings and facilities,

   (e)   Any person whose vehicle properly displays a valid, unexpired special
registration plate or removable windshield placard may park the vehicle for
unlimited periods of time in parking zones unrestricted as to length of parking
time permitted: Provided, that this privilege does not mean that the vehicle
may park in any zone where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited or which
creates parking zones for special types of vehicles or which prohibits parking
during heavy traffic periods during specified rush hours or where parking would
clearly present a traffic hazard. To the extent any provision of any ordinance
of any political subdivision of this State is contrary to the provisions of
this section, the provisions of this section take precedence and apply.
   The parking privileges provided for in this subsection apply only during
those times when the vehicle is being used for the loading or unloading of a
person with a mobility impairment. Any person who knowingly exercises, or
attempts to exercise, these privileges at a time when the vehicle is not being
used for the loading or unloading of a person with a mobility impairment, and
upon first conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he or she may
otherwise incur, shall be fined two hundred dollars ($200.00); upon second
conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty, he or she may otherwise

registration plate or removable windshield placard may not stop, stand or park
a motor vehicle in an area designated, zoned or marked for accessible parking
with signs or instructions displaying the international symbol of access,
either by itself or with explanatory text. The signs may be mounted on a post
or a wall in front of the accessible parking space and instructions may appear
on the ground or pavement, but use of both methods is preferred. Accessible
parking spaces for vans having an eight-foot adjacent access aisle should be
designated as "van accessible" but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.
   Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (g)   All signs that designate areas as "accessible parking" or that display
the international symbol of access shall also include the words "Up to $500
fine".
   (h)   No person may stop, stand or park a motor vehicle in an area
designated or marked off as an access aisle adjacent to a van-accessible
parking space or regular accessible parking space. Any person, including a
driver of a vehicle displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special
registration plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (i)   Parking enforcement personnel who otherwise enforce parking violations
may issue citations for violations of this section and shall reference the
number on the vehicle's license plate, since the driver normally will not be
present.
   (j)   Law-enforcement agencies may establish a program to use trained
volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers' compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle's license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law- enforcement agency.
   (k)   The Municipality in enforcing this section shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (j) of this section, if adopted by the Municipality or otherwise
shall go into the Municipality's General Revenue Fund. (WVaC 17C-13-6)
   (l)   Accessible Parking space application, approvals and location
modification and removals, previously administered through a Traffic Commission
process, shall be administered by City Staff. Such handicap accessible parking

dogfight, or other combat between animals or between animals and humans. No
person, for any such reason, shall crop a dog's ears except when a licensed
veterinarian issues a signed certificate that the operation is necessary for
the dog's health or comfort and in no event shall any person except a licensed
veterinarian perform such an operation.
   No person who owns, keeps or possesses any number of dogs or cats shall fail
to maintain any enclosure or other place such animal is kept in a clean or
sanitary condition. Further, such place must be free of any unwholesome or
offensive substance, liquid or odor. Conditions which exist contrary to these
requirements shall be deemed a public nuisance.
   Upon receiving a signed complaint, the City Manager or his duly authorized
representative, upon displaying proper identification may enter any building,
structure or premises in the City during reasonable hours to determine if the
keeping of any dogs or cats thereon constitutes a public nuisance. If any
person refuses entrance to such City official during reasonable hours, such

obstacle preventing the dog from exiting the structure.
   (e)    Signs. All owners, keepers, or harborers of dangerous or vicious dogs

525.01 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

minor child.
   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting. Such reasonable

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment

centerfire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United
States and which is not readily available in the ordinary channels of
commercial trade; and
      (3)   Any muzzle-loading rifle, muzzle-loading shotgun, or muzzle-loading
pistol, which is designed to use black powder, or black powder substitute, and

club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (c)   “Concealed” means hidden from ordinary observation so as to prevent

or death.
   (j)   “Metallic or false knuckles” means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or

549.01 PURPOSE; PUBLIC NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
   Council may, by resolution, abate anything which, in the opinion of a
majority of Council, constitutes a public nuisance after due notice to all
parties that could be affected and after such hearings as Council deems
necessary to ascertain a factual and rational basis for the abatement of any
such public nuisance.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.02 APPLICATION OF ARTICLE.
   The provisions of this article shall apply to all nuisances as hereinafter
designated which are now in existence or which may hereafter exist in the City.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.03 DEFINITION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE.
   A public nuisance is one which affects an indefinite number of persons, or
the residents of a particular locality, or people coming within the extent of
its range or operation, although the extent of the annoyance or damage
inflicted upon individuals may be unequal. Such public nuisance endangers the
health, safety and welfare of the community and is dangerous and detrimental to
the public health, may violate the laws of the City and/or State as well as
obstructs the community from reasonable and comfortable use of property.
   A nuisance may arise from the unreasonable, unwarrantable or unlawful
behavior associated with the property, either real or personal, which hinders
the neighboring community and the general public from enjoying the common and
public rights enjoyed by the general community in like areas where no such
nuisance exists.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.04 CONTINUING NUISANCE.
   An uninterrupted or periodically recurring nuisance; not necessarily a
constant or unceasing injury, but a nuisance which occurs so often and is so
necessarily an incident of the use of property complained of that it can fairly
be said to be continuous. Such a nuisance may be of such character that its
continuance is necessarily an injury which will continue without change.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.05 REPORT AND RECOMMENDATIONS TO COUNCIL; HEARING.
   Public safety and law enforcement officers, as well as affected members of
the community, shall report findings and recommendations to the City Manager;
and if the City Manager ascertains from the report and findings that the
condition presents a public nuisance, as herein defined, the Manager shall make
his recommendation to Council that just cause exists to abate the nuisance.
Whereupon by a majority vote of Council, a hearing shall be held after at least
ten days’ notice to the property owner, tenant, business manager and/or
licensee of the time and place of such hearing, which notice shall contain a
statement or specification of the charges, grounds or reasons for such proposed
contemplated action, and which shall be served upon the property owner, tenant,
business manager and/or licensee as notices under the West Virginia rules of
civil procedure or by certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall, in
addition, be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises as well as within
100 feet surrounding such premises affected by the recommendation. The term
“cause” shall include the doing or omitting of any act or permitting any
condition to exist which causes a public or continuing nuisance as defined in
this article. At which time and place, so designated in the notice, the City
Administration shall put forth its evidence in support of the recommendation
made to Council as well as the property owner, tenant, business manager and/or
licensee shall have the right to appear and produce evidence in his behalf, and
to be represented by counsel. Provided that the Council may forthwith suspend
any such license when they believe the public safety will be adversely affected
by the continued operation of such nuisance.
   If, at the request of the property owner, tenant, business manager and/or
licensee or on his motion, the hearing shall be continued and shall not take
place on the day fixed by the Council, the property owner, tenant, business
manager and/or licensee shall not be permitted to continue doing business
pending an appeal as provided by this article.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.06 PERMANENT NUISANCE FURTHER DEFINED.
   In addition to the definitions provided above, a permanent nuisance is also
a nuisance of such a character that its continuance is necessarily an injury
which will continue without change, unless Council takes such action to cease
any like nuisance from becoming established and reoccurring at the particular
location. It is not enough to show a slight interference to the public welfare
and such will not be restrained unless the type of business or manner of
operation is injurious to the public health, safety and welfare of the
community or has a tendency to promote unlawful behavior or behavior which is
considered by the City Administration, including its health and/or safety
officials, to be a menace to public order and safety.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.07 DECLARATION OF PERMANENT NUISANCE.
   If upon review of information presented to Council it can be shown that
acts, occupations, types of businesses or structures which are generally not
considered nuisances at all times and under any circumstances are found to have
become nuisances by reason of the circumstances or the location and
surroundings, the Council may declare by majority vote of Council such a
nuisance-in-fact. Upon a showing that there has been a continuing nuisance of
similar character and circumstances at a particular location and surrounding
area existing in an uninterrupted or periodically reoccurring fashion, Council
may declare such a permanent nuisance and therefore permanently revoke and
withhold further licensure or approval of similar acts, occupations, types of
businesses or structures at such location. However, for industrial and
commercial zones which permit commercial establishments, the declaration of a
permanent nuisance as stated in this article and section shall not apply.
Council may consider primarily reports of safety and law enforcement officials,
as well as public comment and complaints of the community spanning at a minimum
a three-year period, at a minimum, when considering declaring a particular
permanent nuisance. The Municipality is entitled to seek appropriate judicial
relief against such public nuisances which are believed to be permanent in
nature and judicial proceedings and adjudication by a court of competent
jurisdiction may be sought.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.08 ABATEMENT BY MUNICIPALITY.
   After any hearings as defined herein and upon the declaration of the
Municipality that a public nuisance exists, an order to abate such nuisance
shall issue. If means short of destruction would abate the nuisance, such must
be employed. The order shall prohibit a further use constituting a nuisance.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.09 RECONSIDERATION OF PERMANENT NUISANCE.
   Should such a location be declared a permanent public nuisance, any further
use of that location for the same purpose is not allowed and after three months
of the date that such property is declared a permanent nuisance, the property
would lose its non-conforming use status and revert to the land use permitted
in accord with the Planning and Zoning Code. However, reconsideration of a
Declaration of a Permanent Nuisance may occur if such request is filed within
three (3) months of such order declaring a permanent nuisance. Another business
or non-conforming use may petition City Council for a hearing to demonstrate
that a legitimate business interest or other non-conforming use is proposed for
such location. If such petition is granted, a bond shall be posted in an amount
not less than $25,000.00 to extend for a minimum of one year from the date of
occupation of the premises. Such one-year period shall be considered
probationary in that any recurrence of similar activity which leads to the
prior declaration of a nuisance or would lead to a new nuisance violation shall
be cause for immediate forfeiture of said bond to the City of Wheeling and
closure of such establishment upon notice by the City Manager as directed by
City Council.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.10 APPEALS AND ENFORCEMENT.
   In the event that such property owner, tenant, business manager and/or
licensee may be aggrieved by such declared abatement which may include and not
be limited to revocation or suspension of any licensures and/or the restricted
use of such property having been declared a nuisance, petition for such review
must be filed with the circuit court within a period of thirty days from and
after the date of final action by Council. Any property owner, tenant, business
manager and/or licensee obtaining an order for such review shall be required to
pay the costs and fees incident to transcribing, certifying and transmitting
the records pertaining to such matter to the circuit court. Any person, firm,
corporation, landowner, or licensee so affected has the right to apply to the
circuit court for a temporary injunction pursuant to the provisions of the W.
Va. Code. The Municipality is also entitled to any and all appropriate judicial
relief against public nuisances.
(Ord. 12662. Passed 7-1-03.)
549.11 SEVERABILITY.
   If any article, section, subsection, provision, clause, or phrase of this
chapter or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held
unconstitutional or invalid, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not
affect other articles, sections, subsections, provisions, clauses or phrases or
applications of the chapter, and to this end each and every article, section,
subsection, provision, clause and phrase of this chapter is declared to be
severable. The above article is in addition to and not dependent upon other
sections of this Code, in particular Section
701.28 of the Business and Taxation Code of the City, which provides that the
Council may forthwith suspend, revoke or alter any such license when they
believe the public safety will be adversely affected by the continued operation
of such nuisance.

business activity from their residence.

      (8)   There is no retroactivity to be applied to a taxpayer claiming to
be a Shared Services Taxpayer and no retroactive calculations shall be made on

Credits” shall not apply for any taxpayer attempting to claim a retroactive
recalculation under this Shared Services Tax category.
 
   (h)   Required Job Creation for Shared Services Taxpayer.
      (1)   Any Shared Services Taxpayer as defined in Section

Finance Director annually submit a summary report to Council on applications

financially sound for the City’s budget and solvency and make any
recommendations concerning the continuation of the category or any needed
modifications thereto.

the tax year or at the start of business as to the classification as a Shared
Services Taxpayer or claim tax credits, yet a taxpayer cannot claim both.

one of the taxpayer credit sections as enumerated above within this paragraph
but may not assert such credits under more than one section and may not also
assert that they are eligible in the tax category of Shared Services Taxpayer.

also assert a Downtown Business District Enhancement Credit, nor may a
Management Information Services Taxpayer assert eligibility as a Shared
Services Taxpayer. The taxpayer’s election as to which credit will be asserted
shall be binding upon the taxpayer.

793.01 LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE.
   It is the intention of Council that the service of fire protection shall be
continuted, maintained and improved by the City, in part, at the charge and
expense of the owners of buildings and structures of every kind and nature
within the City, the occupiers or tenants of such buildings and structures and
the owners of vehicles within the City, which owners and occupiers are declared
to be the users and beneficiaries of such fire protection service as
contemplated by West Virginia Code 8-13-13.
    The charges and expenses with respect to each of such users as set out in
this article shall be based and imposed, in part, upon recognition of the
following legislative findings:
   (a)   The size of a building, as reflected by the total square feet, is a
factor which affects the cost of providing fire protection and therefore the
fees imposed hereunder are related in part to the size of a building.
   (b)   The user of a building is a factor which affects the cost of providing
fire protection and accordingly nonresidential property as compared to
residential property requires additional equipment and manpower to provide
effective fire protection and therefore it is the intent of this article that
owners and occupiers of residential buildings pay a lesser charge for fire
protection to reflect the reduced cost of protection.
      (Ord. 8003. Passed 8-30-83.)
793.02 DEFINITIONS.

accommodations are provided for normal living purposes as outlined in the

assembly, educational, institutional, stores and offices, industrial and
manufacturing, and storage as outlined in the uniform coding for fire
protection.
 
   (c)   "Vehicle" includes automobiles, buses, recreational vehicles,
trailers, boats, motorcycles which are licensed under State law.
 
   (d)    "Owner-occupant" includes any person, individual, firm, partnership,
joint venture, association, corporation, trust or any other group within the
City owning buildings or leasing/renting such buildings or structures and also
includes the owner or lessee of vehicles.
 
   (e)   "Total square feet" means that sum as measured by the exterior
dimensions of the structure multiplied by the number of stories, but shall not
include any part of a structure encompassed by the following:
      (1)   Porches,
      (2)   Basements (when not utilized),
      (3)   Attics.
         (Ord. 8003. Passed 8-30-83. )
793.03 IMPOSITION OF FIRE PROTECTION CHARGE.

   The Municipal Home Rule Board on May 24, 2013, approved the City’s amending
of its Home Rule Plan to enact a consumers sales and service tax and a use tax
pursuant to W. Va. Code § 8-1-5a without the limiting restrictions in W. Va.
Code § 8-13C-1 et seq. In accordance with the Home Rule Plan Amendment; the
City Council found and declared that the adoption by this City for its

800.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this Article is to provide an enforcement mechanism for
the City of Wheeling to collect delinquent municipal fees, interest or
penalties for services provided for the public good by providing that all
service liens shall be placed on property for security of payment due under
various ordinances. The liens for delinquent fees will have a secured position
and priority should the property be sold at a forced sale and the City may have
the option of initiating a sale to enforce and collect the lien. The fees are
classified by the City of Wheeling as user fees rather than a tax and all
proceeds which may be collected shall be used to pay a portion of expenses
associated with the service provided by the City which generated the fee,
interest and penalties.
   (b)   The City of Wheeling needs to be able, through assertion of Home Rule
powers, to fully utilize and expand West Virginia Code § 8-13-13 to assist in a
legal, equitable form of recapturing monies expended to enhance public health,
safety and welfare and so that there will be some incentive for property owners
to comply with the Ordinances pertaining to real property and to pay the
municipality the fees due for services rendered or for collection purposes for
fees owed. (Ord. 13779. Passed 5-19-09.)
800.02 SPECIAL CHARGES FOR MUNICIPAL SERVICES.
   Notwithstanding any statutory prevision to the contrary, the City of
Wheeling, which furnishes essential or special municipal service, including,
but not limited to, police and fire protection, parking facilities on the
street or otherwise, parks and recreational facilities, street cleaning,
abatement and demolition of uninhabitable, unsafe structures, building code and
property maintenance code enforcement services, vacant structure code
enforcement services, street lighting, street maintenance and improvement,
sewerage and sewage disposal, and the collection and disposal of garbage,
refuse, waste, ashes, trash, the clearing and removal of weeds, grass and
debris, the clearing and removal of any matter or form of personal property
found to be a threat to public health, safety and welfare and any other similar
matter, shall have plenary power and authority to provide by ordinance for the
installation, continuance, maintenance or improvement of such service, to make
reasonable regulations with respect thereto, and to impose by ordinance upon
those subject to such ordinances and the users of such service reasonable
rates, fees and charges to be collected in the manner specified in th
ordinance: Provided, that any sewerage and sewage disposal service and any
service incident to the collection and disposal of garbage, refuse, waste,
ashes, trash and any other similar matter shall be subject to the provisions of
chapter twenty-four of the W. Va. Code. The City of Wheeling shall have a lien
on any property as security for payments due under such ordinances. (Ord.
13779. Passed 5-19-09.)
800.03 LIENS GENERALLY.
   Except as otherwise provided, "lien" or "liens" as used in this section
shall arise whenever the charges corresponding with the services, as defined in
this section, are levied or imposed by the City of Wheeling and such charges
become due. Liens placed for fee collection have a secured priority lien
interest when any subject property is sold, even in federal state or county tax
commission sales. Therefore, liens placed pursuant to this section shall not be
dissolved during or due to such tax sale and shall remain in effect so that any
subsequent owner of the property takes the property subject to all municipal
liens. Liens that remain unsatisfied by payment in full to the municipality may
be subject to sale by the municipality to satisfy the lien. Any filing fees
that a municipality must pay to a court of competent jurisdiction to seek
enforcement shall be waived to effect such filing yet shall be collected as
part of the debt owed by the property owner and payable directly to the court
wherein the action is filed so long as the claim only involves the collection
of fees and interest due to such municipality excluding attorney fees. Such
evidence of fees being paid is required prior to any release of the lien by the
municipality.
(Ord. 13779. Passed 5-19-09.)
800.04  LIENS LEVIED UPON ALL REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   The liens created by this subsection are levied or imposed not only upon
that parcel of real property against or upon which such charges have been
levied or imposed, but all real and personal properties owned in whole or in
part by the person(s) or entity that owes the fee.
(Ord. 13779. Passed 5-19-09.)
800.05 LIEN PRIORITY.
   The liens created by this section shall have preference and priority with
respect to all other liens thereafter placed on such real property as of the
time such fees become final and non-appealable. (Ord. 13779. Passed 5-19-09.)
800.06 LIEN ATTACHMENT.
   There shall be an attachment of lien to proceeds of any sale of property. In
case any real estate upon which a tax and/or service lien exists is sold by any
means, including by an order of the court of competent jurisdiction directing
an executor or administrator to sell the real estate to pay the debts of a
deceased person, or is sold by virtue of an execution process, or is sold in
any fashion, such tax and/or service lien shall be transferred to the fund
arising from such sale in the hands of the officer making the sale, and the
real estate so sold shall be discharged therefrom. If the fund is not
sufficient to pay and discharge the tax and/or service lien, by reason of the
real estate having been sold subject to another or other lien or liens created
by the taxable prior owner, the unpaid balance of the tax and/or service lien
shall remain a lien upon the land so sold.
(Ord. 13779. Passed 5-19-09.)
800.07  RECEIPT OF PROPERTY SUBJECT TO LIEN.
   Should anyone take action to receive the subject property by any means,
including, but not limited to, transfer, sale, assignment, forfeiture or
county, state or federal tax sale, the owner of record shall take the property
subject to all municipal liens and shall thereafter be responsible for payment
thereof. As to the duration of the lien, the lien shall continue until the fee,
interest and penalties is collected.
(Ord. 13779. Passed 5-19-09.)
800.08 CITY SERVICE FEES; NOTICE OF LIEN; HEARING PROCEDURE; ADMINISTRATIVE
DECISION; RIGHT OF APPEAL; LIEN CREATION.
   (a)   Any municipal fee, interest or penalties due and payable under this
City code shall be a debt due the City. It shall be a personal obligation of
the City service customer chargeable therefor and shall be a lien upon the real
and personal property of the City service customer until paid. This lien shall
have priority over all other liens except those due to banking institutions or
the state and the United States of America as further described herein.
   (b)   If the City Finance Director desires to file a notice of lien with the
clerk of the Ohio County Commission regarding one or more delinquencies in
payment of any municipal fee, penalties or interest, the City Finance Director
shall give the delinquent fee payer written notice via certified U.S. Mail
return receipt requested to such fee payer's last known address, of intent to
file the notice of lien setting forth the amounts due and status of
delinquency. Unless the fee payer to whom the notice is given, or his duly
authorized agent, shall within thirty (30) days after service thereof, either
personally or by certified mail, file with the City Finance Director a petition
for hearing, setting forth with particular items objected to, together with the
reasons for objections, the City Finance Director may at any time thereafter
file the notice of the lien.
   (c)   When a petition for hearing as prescribed in this Section is filed
within the time prescribed, the City Finance Director shall assign a time and a
place for a hearing thereon and shall notify the petitioner of such hearing by
written notice at least twenty days in advance thereof. Such hearing shall be
held within 90 days from the date of filing the petition, unless continued by
agreement of the parties or by the City Finance Director for sufficient cause.
The hearing shall be informal and shall be conducted in an impartial manner by
the City Finance Director or a hearing examiner designed by the City Finance
Director. The burden of proof shall be upon the petitioner to show that the
notice of lien is improper, in whole or in part. After such hearing, the City
Finance Director or hearing examiner designed by the City Finance Director
shall, within a reasonable time, give notice in writing of his decision.
   (d)   If aggrieved by the decision of the hearing examiner or City Finance
Director, the fee payer may appeal the decision of the hearing examiner or City
Finance Director to the Circuit Court of Ohio County within thirty (30) days
after service of the hearing examiner's or City Finance Director's decision.
      (1)    The appeal shall be taken by the filing of a petition and notice,
which petition and notice shall be served upon or accepted by the City Finance
Director as an original notice. When the petition and notice is so served it
shall, with the return or acceptance thereon, be filed in the Office of the
Clerk of the Ohio County Circuit Court and docketed as other cases, with the
fee payer as plaintiff and the City Finance Director as defendant.
      (2)   The filing of the appeal shall not stay the collection of the fee
unless the fee payer shall file with such Clerk a bond for the use of the
defendant, with sureties approved by the Clerk of the Circuit Court of Ohio
County, the penalty of the bond to be not less than the total amount of the
fee, and accumulated penalties and interest to the date of the appeal, and
conditioned that the plaintiff shall perform the orders of the Ohio County
Circuit Court; provided, that the Judge of the Ohio County Circuit Court may
stay the collection fo the fee, and accumulated penalties without the

from entering the system, they shall be exempt from payment of sewer service
charges for such water or such sewage or wastes so disposed of or diverted.
   When metered water is not a fair measure of the use of the sewer by any
class of user, the Division may measure the effluents or wastes of users by
meters or any other practicable method and determine the quantity and the
constituents of the particular sewage for the purpose of establishing standards
of equivalence to the rate paid when metered water is the measure so that a
common rate will prevail as near as practicable among the various users of the
system, based upon the use and cost of handling the wastes of users, which
standards may be altered from time to time by the Division.
   In the interim of the adoption of standards of equivalence of rates by any
class of user, the Division may from time to time with the information
available to it, establish interim equivalent standards for determining rates
to be paid where the sewage delivered to the system is less in quantity than
metered water of a user and of less strength than normal sewage or in either
instance. The user will upon request furnish to the Division such data
determining the quantity and quality of the sewage as may be practicable.
   The expense of measuring and of measuring equipment shall be borne by the
user as may be reasonably necessary and fairly chargeable to the user as the
Division shall determine.
   The Division may maintain studies of the types and characteristics of sewage
and wastes originating with the users of the sewer system, and may employ
competent engineering services to determine the same and to keep and maintain
records thereof.
   Where any sewage is determined to be nonpolluting under the statutes of West
Virginia, the Division may permit diversion of the same and exempt the producer
of such sewage from compulsory connection with the sewer system.
(Ord. 2153. Passed 5-25-54.)
923.02 SEWER SERVICE CHARGES PAID BY CITY.
   There shall be no free services rendered by the sewer system, and the City
and every department, agency or instrumentality thereof availing itself of the
services and facilities of the sewer system, shall pay for the use of such
services and facilities at the established rates from general funds or other
funds available for such purposes. Revenues received from the services and
facilities furnished by the sewer system to the City shall be applied and
accounted for in the same manner as other revenues derived from the operation
of the sewer system.
(Ord. 2153. Passed 5-25-54.)
923.03 BILLING AND COLLECTION.
   All rates or charges provided for by this article shall be billed and
collected monthly for the Division of Water Pollution Control by the Water
Division or by persons, or departments or agencies of the City, authorized by
the Water Pollution Control Division.
(Ord. 2153. Passed 5-25-54.)
923.04 COLLECTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF BILLED RATES OR CHARGES.
   All bills shall be considered due and payable on or before the tenth day
following the date rendered. All rates or charges billed, if not paid when due
shall be a lien upon the premises served by the sewer system, and if such rates
or charges are not paid within thirty days after due then the amount thereof,
together with a penalty of ten percent (10%) and reasonable attorney's fees may
be recovered by the Division of Water Pollution Control in a civil action in
the name of the City, and in connection with such action the lien may be
foreclosed against such lot, parcel of land or building in accordance with the
laws relating thereto. In the event such rates or chargers billed are not paid
within thirty days after due as aforesaid, the City or the Division, under
reasonable rules and regulations established with respect to the taking of such
action, may shut off and discontinue the furnishing of sewer service to any
such user of the sewer system and refuse to again furnish service until such
time as the user of the sewer system disconnected therefrom has paid all
delinquent rates or charges billed, penalties, and reasonable cut-off and
reconnection charges.
   The Division may create a fund from sewer revenues in such an amount as
experience determines to be required to refund to users of the sewer system for
overcharges as it may determine.
   In any case where upon investigation the Division determines that a user of
the sewer system has not been properly charged or billed for sewer service it
shall correct the charge and correct such billing and collect any difference.
(Ord. 2153. Passed 5-25-54.)
923.05 DURATION OF LIABILITY FOR SEWER SERVICE.
   Liability for service shall begin, as to all users now connected with the
sewer system, on September 1, 1954; and thereafter liability for service shall
begin as to each subsequent user on the date of connection to the sewer system;
and such liability shall continue thereafter unless such premises are
disconnected from the sewer system with the approval of the Division of Water
Pollution Control. No allowance shall be made for vacant houses unless a
request in writing to have the sewer service shut off is received by the
Division, nor will any allowance be made for any shut-off period which is less
than thirty days.
(Ord. 2153. Passed 5-25-54.)
923.06 APPLICATION OF ESTABLISHED RATES TO SUBSEQUENT USERS.
   The rates or charges established for any class of users of property served
shall extend to and cover any additional user or property hereafter served
which falls within the same class, without necessity of any hearing or notice.

   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to
POTW. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless
indicated otherwise. The Superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition
to, or in place of, the concentration based limitations above.
   A minimum of four instantaneous separate measurements are required to be
reported to determine pH and Temperature. For Cyanide, Oil and Grease, the
individual results of four grab samples will be averaged and reported to
determine the daily value. For volatile organic compounds (VOC's) four grab
samples must be combined in the laboratory immediately before analysis, and a
single analysis performed. Oil & Grease sample must be collected in amber glass
sample containers. For all other pollutants, samples must be
obtained using the sample type shown in the individual discharge permit and 40
CFR 136.
   (e)   City's Right of Revision. The City reserves the right to establish, by
ordinance or in individual wastewater discharge permits, more stringent
standards or requirements on discharges to the POTW, including regulation of
pollutants of an unusual nature which are characteristic of a particular user.
   (f)   Dilution. No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in
any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
(Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-24.)
927.03 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER.
   (a)   Pretreatment Facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as
necessary to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all
categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out
in Section
 927.02(a) within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the
Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense.
Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the Superintendent for review and shall be acceptable to the
Superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans
and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the City under the provisions of this article.
   (b)   Additional Pretreatment Measures.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Superintendent may require users to
restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain
wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate
points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams from industrial waste
streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and
determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this article.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require any person discharging into the POTW
to install and maintain, on their property and at their expenses, a suitable
storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
      (3)   Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be installed at the owners
expense when, in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the
proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of grease and oil,
or sand; except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential
users. All interception units shall be of type and capacity approved by the
Superintendent and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired
regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense. Failure to clean grease,
oil, or sand interceptor is a violation of this article subject to penalties.
      (4)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
   (c)   Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans. At least once every two (2)
years, the Superintendent shall evaluate whether each significant industrial
user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan. The Superintendent may
require any user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.
Alternatively, the Superintendent may develop such a plan for any user. An
accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Superintendent of any
accidental or slug discharge, as required by Section
927.06(f); and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (d)   Hauled Wastewater.
      (1)   Septic tank wastewaters are not accepted at the POTW plant.
      (2)   The POTW will not accept hauled industrial waste and industrial
waste haulers are prohibited from discharging any hauled industrial waste into
the POTW and any unauthorized location on the collector system.
         (Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-24.)
927.04 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT APPLICATION.
   (a)   Wastewater Analysis. When requested by the Superintendent, a user must
submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within
sixty (60) days of the request. The Superintendent is authorized to prepare a
form for this purpose and may periodically require users to update this
information.
   (b)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement.
      (1)   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the
POTW without first obtaining a wastewater discharge permit from the
Superintendent, except that a significant industrial user that has filed a
timely application pursuant to subsection (c) hereof may continue to discharge
for the time period specified therein.
      (2)   The Superintendent may require other users to obtain wastewater
discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purpose of this article.
      (3)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a wastewater discharge
permit shall be deemed a violation of this article and subjects the wastewater
discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in Sections
927.10 to
927.12. Obtaining a wastewater discharge permit does not relieve a permittee of
its obligation to comply with all Federal and State pretreatment standards or
requirements or with any other requirements of Federal, State, and local law.
   (c)   Wastewater Discharge Permitting: Existing Connections. Any user
required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit who was discharging wastewater
into the POTW prior to the effective date of this article and who wishes to
continue such discharges in the future, shall, within sixty (60) days after
said date, apply to the Superintendent for a wastewater discharge permit in
accordance with subsection (e) hereof, and shall not cause or allow discharges
to the POTW to continue after one hundred eighty (180) days of the effective
date of this article except in accordance with a wastewater discharge permit
issued by the Superintendent.
   (d)   Wastewater Discharge Permitting: New Connections. Any user required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit who proposes to begin or recommence
discharging into the POTW must obtain such permit prior to the beginning or
recommencing of such discharge. An application for this wastewater discharge
permit, in accordance with subsection (e) hereof, must be filed at least sixty
(60) days prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or recommence.
   (e)   Wastewater Discharge Permit: Extra Jurisdictional Users. Any existing
industrial user who is located beyond city limits and who is required to obtain
a wastewater discharge permit shall submit a wastewater discharge permit
application. Any new source or new user who is located beyond city limits and
who is required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall submit a
wastewater discharge permit application.
   (f)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Application Contents. All users required
to obtain a wastewater discharge permit must submit a permit application. The
Superintendent may require all users to submit as part of an application the
following information:
      (1)   All information required by Section
927.06(a)(2);
      (2)   Description of activities, facilities, and plant processes on the
premises, including a list of all raw materials and chemicals used or stored at
the facility which are, or could accidentally or intentionally be, discharged
to the POTW;
      (3)   Number and type of employees, hours of operation, and proposed or
actual hours of operation;

927.05 WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT ISSUANCE PROCESS.
   (a)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Duration. A wastewater discharge permit
shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five (5) years from
the effective date of the permit. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued
for a period less than five (5) years, at the discretion of the Superintendent.
Each wastewater discharge permit will indicate a specific date upon which it
will expire.
   (b)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Contents. A wastewater discharge permit
shall include such conditions as are deemed reasonably necessary by the
Superintendent to prevent pass through or interference, protect the quality of
the water body receiving the treatment plants effluent, protect worker health
and safety, facilitate sludge management and disposal, and protect against
damage to the POTW.
      (1)   Wastewater discharge permits must contain:
         A.   A statement that indicates wastewater discharge permit duration,
which in no event shall exceed five (5) years;

pollution control, or construction of appropriate containment devices, designed
to reduce, eliminate, or prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
treatment works;
         C.   Development and implementation of waste minimization or waste
plans to reduce the amount of pollutants discharged to the POTW;
         D.   The unit charge or schedule of user charges and fees for the
management of the wastewater discharged to the POTW.
         E.   Requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection and
sampling facilities and equipment;
         F.   Development and implementation of a customized manifest specific
to the quality of wastewater discharged by the permittee.
         G.   A statement that compliance with the wastewater discharge permit
does not relieve the permittee of responsibility for compliance with all
applicable Federal and State pretreatment standards, including those which
become effective during the term of the wastewater discharge permit; and
         H.   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Superintendent to
ensure compliance with this article, and State and Federal laws, rules, and
regulations.
   (c)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Appeals. The Superintendent shall provide
public notice of the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit. Any person,
including the user, may petition the Superintendent to reconsider the terms of
a wastewater discharge permit with thirty (30) days of notice of its issuance.
      (1)   Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed to
be a waiver of the administrative appeal.
      (2)   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the wastewater
discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this objection, and
the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the wastewater
discharge permit.
      (3)   The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not be
stayed pending the appeal.
      (4)   If the Superintendent fails to act within thirty (30) days, a
request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied. Decisions not to
reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater discharge
permit, or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be considered
final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review.
      (5)   Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final
administrative discharge permit decision must do so by filing a complaint with
the Circuit Court of Ohio County within twenty days of said decision.
   (d)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Modification. The Superintendent may
modify a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited
to, the following reasons:
      (1)   To incorporate any new or revised Federal, State, or local
pretreatment standards or requirements;
      (2)   To address significant alternations or additions to the user's
operation, processes, or wastewater volume or character since the time of
wastewater discharge .permit issuance;
      (3)   A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent
reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
      (4)   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat
to the City's POTW, City personnel, or the receiving waters;
      (5)   Violation of any terms or conditions of the wastewater discharge
permit;
      (6)   Misrepresentations or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge permit application or in any required reporting;
      (7)   Revision of or a grant of variance from categorical pretreatment
standards pursuant to 40 CFR 403.13;
      (8)   To correct typographical or other errors in the wastewater
discharge permit; or
      (9)   To reflect a transfer of the facility ownership or operation to a
new owner or operator.
   (e)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Transfer. Wastewater discharge permits may
be transferred to a new owner or operator only if the permittee gives at least
sixty (60) days advance notice to the Superintendent and the Superintendent
approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the
Superintendent must include a written certification by the new owner or
operator which:
      (1)   States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent
to change the facility's operations and processes;
      (2)   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
      (3)   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
wastewater discharge permit.
   Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater
discharge permit void as of the date of facility transfer.
   (f)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Revocation. The Superintendent may revoke
a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including but not limited to, the
following reasons:
      (1)   Failure to notify the Superintendent of significant changes to the
wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
      (2)   Failure to provide prior notification to the Superintendent of
changed conditions pursuant to Section
 927.06(e);
      (3)   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge permit application;
      (4)   Falsifying self-monitoring reports;
      (5)   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
      (6)   Refusing to allow the Superintendent timely access to the facility
premises and records;
      (7)   Failure to meet effluent limitations;
      (8)   Failure to pay fines;
      (9)   Failure to pay sewer charges;
      (10)   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
      (11)   Failure to complete a wastewater survey or the wastewater
discharge permit application;
      (12)   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility; or
      (13)   Violation of any pretreatment standard or requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this article.
   Wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of operations
or transfer of business ownership. All wastewater discharge permits issued to a
particular user are void upon the issuance of a new wastewater discharge permit
to that user.
   (g)   Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance. A user with an expiring
wastewater discharge permit shall apply for wastewater discharge permit
reissuance by submitting a complete permit application, in accordance with
Section
927.04(e), a minimum of one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the expiration
of the user's existing wastewater discharge permit. (Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-
24.)

      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the
applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to,
hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts
for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and
conducting routine operation);
      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine (9) months;
      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the Superintendent no
later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final
date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether it has complied with the
increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps
being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
      (4)   In no event shall more than nine (9) months elapse between such
progress reports to the Superintendent.
   (c)   Reports on Compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standard Deadline.
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable

commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Superintendent a report containing the information described in subsection (a)
(2)D. to F. hereof. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this
report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production
rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or
other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual
production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must
be signed and certified in accordance with Section
927.04(f).
   (d)   Periodic Compliance Reports.
      (1)   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency determined
by the Superintendent but in no case less than twice per year (in June and
December), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of
pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the
measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period.
All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with
Section
927.04(t).
      (2)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working
order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
      (3)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Superintendent,
using the procedures prescribed in subsection (k) hereof, the results of this
monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (e)   Reports of Changed Conditions. Each user must notify the
Superintendent of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or
system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at
least ninety (90) days before the change.
      (1)   The Superintendent may require the user to submit such information
as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the
submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section
927.04(e).
      (2)   The Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge permit under
Section
 927.04(g) or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section
927.05(d) in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
      (3)   For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but
are not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent (20%) or greater, and the
discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
   (f)   Reports of Potential Problems.
      (1)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems
for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include the location of
the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and
corrective actions taken by the user.
      (2)   Within five (5) days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the Superintendent, submit a detailed written report
describing the cause(s) of the discharge and e measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as
a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to
person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article.
      (3)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board
or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a
discharge described in paragraph (f)(1), above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   (g)   Reports from Unpermitted Users. All users not required to obtain a
wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the
Superintendent as the Superintendent may require.
   (h)   Notice of Violation/Report Sampling and Reporting. If sampling
performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the
Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within thirty (30) days
after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if
the Superintendent monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if
the Superintendent samples between the user's initial sampling and when the
user receives the results of this sampling.
   (i)   Notification of the Discharge of Hazardous Waste.
      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and State
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the µser discharges more than one
hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the
notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such
information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass
and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during
that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. All
notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty (180) days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications
of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection (e) hereof. The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-
monitoring requirements of subsections (a), (c) and (d) hereof.
      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of paragraph (i)(l),
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen
(15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous
wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than
fifteen (15) kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the
user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and
State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within
ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations.
      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance
not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.
   (j)   Analytical Requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling
techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling
or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses
must be performed in accordance with procedures approved or validated by West
Virginia Division of Environmental Protection (DEP), or by U.S. EPA.
   (k)   Sample Collection.
      (1)   Except as indicated in subsection (k)(2), below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum
of four (4) grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab
samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      (2)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compo ds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
      (3)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in Section
 927.06(a) and (c) [40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)], a minimum of four (4) grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide
and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical sampling
data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data are
available, [the Superintendent] may authorize a lower minimum. For the reports
required by subsection (d) hereof (40 CFR 403.12(e)a and 403.12(h)), the
Industrial User is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to
assess and assure compliance by with applicable Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements.
   (l)   Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
   (m)   Record Keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this
article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all
records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required
by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under
Section
927.01(d)(5). Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of
sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the date analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three (3) years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the City or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Superintendent.
(Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-24.)
927.07 COMPLIANCE MONITORING.
   (a)   Right of Entry; Inspection and Sampling. The Superintendent shall have
the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is
complying with all requirements of this article and any wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Superintendent ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
      (1)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Superintendent will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
      (2)   The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the user's
property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
      (3)   The Superintendent may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated periodically to ensure their accuracy.
      (4)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
user at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the user.
      (5)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent access to the
user's premises shall be a violation of this article.
   (b)   Search Warrants. If the Superintendent has been refused access to a
building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with
this article or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Superintendent may
seek issuance of a search warrant from the Wheeling Municipal Court or the
Circuit Court of Ohio County or Marshall County.
(Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-24.)
927.08 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and from the Superintendent's inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user
specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the
portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes
shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made
available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to
the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and
characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not
be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction.
(Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-24.)
927.09 PUBLICATION OF USERS IN SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   The Superintendent shall publish annually in the largest daily newspaper
published in the City a list of the users which, during the previous twelve
(12) months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment
standards and requirements. The term significant noncompliance shall mean:
   (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all the measurements taken
for the same pollutant parameter taken during a six (6) month period exceed (by
and magnitude) a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including
Instantaneous Limits as defined in Section
927.02;
   (b)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those in
which thirty-three percent (33%) or more of wastewater measurements taken for
each pollutant Parameter during a six (6) month period equals or exceeds the
product of the numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement including
Instantaneous limits as defined by Section
927.02 multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
   (c)   Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement as
defined by Section
927.02 (Daily Maximum, long-term average, Instantaneous Limit, or narrative
standard) that [the Superintendent] determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, Interference of Pass Through, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
   (d)   Any discharge of pollutants that has caused imminent endangerment to
the public or the environment, or has resulted in the Superintendent's exercise
of his emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
   (e)   Failure to meet, within ninety (90) days of the scheduled date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
   (f)   Failure to provide within thirty (30) days after the due date, any
required reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance
with categorical pretreatment standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring
reports, and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
   (g)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
   (h)   Any other violation(s) which the Superintendent determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the local pretreatment
program.
      (Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-24.)
927.10 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Notification of Violation. When the Superintendent finds that a user
has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Superintendent may serve upon that
user a written Notice of Violation. Within thirty (30) days of the receipt of
this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall
be submitted by the user to the Superintendent. Submission of this plan in no
way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after
receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the
authority of the Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions
or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a Notice of Violation.
   (b)   Consent Orders. The Superintendent may enter into Consent Orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to
subsection (d) and (e) hereof and shall be judicially enforceable.
   (c)   Show Cause Hearing. The Superintendent may order a user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the Superintendent and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action, and request that the user show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least twenty (20) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall
not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the
user.
   (d)   Compliance Orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Superintendent may issue an order to the user responsible
for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a
specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time
provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly
operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the
noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A
compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a
pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.
   (e)   Cease and Desist Orders. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
Superintendent may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:
      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge.
   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (f)   Administrative Fines.
      (1)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement the Superintendent may fine such user in an amount not to exceed
one thousand dollars per day. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation,
per day basis. In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge
limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.
      (2)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after five (5) calendar
days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent (10%) of the unpaid
balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of allowable asset by
the Supreme Court of Appeals of the State of West Virginia and in no case less
than ten percent (10%) per month. A lien against the User's property shall be
sought for unpaid charges, fines and penalties.
      (3)   A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid
charges, fines, and penalties.
      (4)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request
for the Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the Superintendent may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the
user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing
thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Superintendent may add the costs of
preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to
the fine.
      (5)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
   (g)   Emergency Suspensions. The Superintendent may immediately suspend a
user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension
is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears
to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or
welfare of persons. The Superintendent may also immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, The
Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate
severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Superintendent
may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated
to the satisfaction of the Superintendent that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in subsection (h) hereof are
initiated against the user.
      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Superintendent prior to the date of any
show cause or termination hearing under subsection (c) or (h) hereof.
   (h)   Termination of Discharge. In addition to the provisions in Section
927.05(f), any user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions:
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge:
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge:
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling;
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in Section
927.02;
   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and
be offered an opportunity to show cause under subsection (c) hereof why the
proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the
Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-24.)
927.11 JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES.
   (a)   Injunctive Relief. When the Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Superintendent may petition the Circuit Court of Ohio
County or Marshall County through the City's Attorney for the issuance of a
temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which restrains or compels
the specific performance of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this article on activities of the user. The
Superintendent may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/
or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct
environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (b)   Civil Penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be liable to the City for a
maximum civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000) per violation, per day.
In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties
shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court
costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the City.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (c)   Criminal Prosecution.
      (1)   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than thirty
days, or both.
      (2)   A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substance into
the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall, upon
conviction, be guilty of a misdemeanor and _be subject to a penalty of at least
one hundred dollars ($100.00) and be subject to imprisonment for not more than
thirty days. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action for
personal injury or property damage available under State law.
      (3)   A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations,
or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or other
documentation filed or required to be maintained pursuant to this article,
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or who falsifies,
tampers with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method
required under this article shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of
not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per violation, per day, or
imprisonment for not more than thirty days.
   (d)   Remedies Nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this article are
not exclusive. The Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of
these actions against a noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment
violations will generally be in accordance with the City's enforcement response
plan. However, the Superintendent may take other action against any user when
the circumstances warrant. Further, the Superintendent is empowered to take
more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
(Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-24.)
927.12 SUPPLEMENTAL ENFORCEMENT ACTION.
   (a)   Performance Bonds. The Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue
a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with any
provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless
such user first files a satisfactory bond, payable to the City, in a sum not to
exceed a value determined by the Superintendent to be necessary to achieve
consistent compliance.
   (b)   Liability Insurance. The Superintendent may decline to issue or
reissue a wastewater discharge permit to any user who has failed to comply with
any provision of this article, a previous wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, unless the
user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
   (c)   Water Supply Severance. Whenever a user has violated or continues to
violate any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water
service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence, at the user's
expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
   (d)   Public Nuisances. A violation of any provision of this article, a
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement is hereby declared a public nuisance and
shall be corrected or abated as directed by the Superintendent. Any person(s)
creating a public nuisance shall be subject to the provisions of the City Code
governing such nuisances, including reimbursing the City for any costs incurred
in removing, abating, or remedying said nuisance.
(Ord. 16161. Passed 12-17-24.)
927.13 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, "upset" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of paragraph (a)(3), below, are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or
other relevant evidence that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         B.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         C.   The user has submitted the following information to the
Superintendent within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset. If
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five (5) days.
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of any upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
   (b)   Prohibited Discharge Standards. A user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions in Section
 927.02(a)(1) or the specific prohibitions in Sections
927.02(a)(2)C. to N. if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to
know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other
sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through
or interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (c)   Bypass.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section,
         A.   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from
any portion of a user's treatment facility.
         B.   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of paragraphs (c)(3) and (4) hereof.
      (3)   A.   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten (10) days before the
date of the bypass, if possible.
         B.   A user shall submit oral notice to the Superintendent of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four (24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user
becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description
of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates
and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it
is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Superintendent may waive the written
report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received with
twenty-four (24) hours.
      (4)   A.   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under Paragraph (c)(3)
hereof.
         B.   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent determines that it will
meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (c)(4)(1) hereof. (Ord. 16161.
Passed 12-17-24.)
927.14 WASTEWATER TREATMENT RATES FOR HIGH STRENGTH WASTES.
   (a)   All users discharging waste which contains a 5 day BOD concentration
in excess of 300 mg/1 shall be surcharged for all BOD exceeding 300 mg/1. The
surcharge shall be in addition to the sewage ·service charge levied for
treating and transporting wastes of normal BOD strength.
   The schedule of surcharge for wastes containing BOD with a concentration in
excess of 300 mg/1 shall be as follows:
      For all BOD concentration from 301 mg/1- $0.2755/lb.
   (b)   All users discharging waste with TSS concentration in excess of 350
mg/1 shall be surcharged for all TSS in excess of 350 mg/1. The surcharge shall
be in addition to the sewage service charge levied for treating and
transporting waste of normal TSS strength.
   The schedule of surcharge for wastes containing TSS with a concentration in
excess of 350 mg/1 shall be as follows:
      For all TSS concentration from 351 mg/1 - $.3045/lb.
   (c)   All users discharging waste with Ammonia concentration in excess of 45
mg/I shall be surcharged for all Ammonia in excess of 45 mg/I. The surcharge
shall be in addition to the sewage service charge levied for treating and
transporting waste of normal Ammonia strength.
   The schedule of surcharge for wastes containing Ammonia with a concentration
in excess of 45 mg/I shall be as follows:
      For all Ammonia concentration from 46 mg/I - $0.3625/lb.
   (d)   The concentration of a waste for BOD or TSS shall be determined by
taking the arithmetic mean of the concentrations of the BOD or TSS in the
samples during the period under consideration. In the event that no samples
have been taken during the period under consideration, the waste shall be
deemed to have the same concentration of BOD or TSS as it did during the prior
period of considerations immediately preceding the current period of
consideration. All samples for determining the concentration of BOD or TSS
shall be flow composite samples, or time composite samples where flow
measurement facilities are not available, taken over a period of time
commensurate with the discharge to the POTW of the waste which is at times a
high strength waste.
   (e)   The weight of BOD or TSS discharged to the POTW shall be calculated by
multiplying the entire flow of waste discharged to the POTW during the period
under consideration in gallons divided by 1,000,000 and multiplied by 8.34,
which will produce the weight in pounds of one mg/1, hereinafter called W,
during the period under consideration. The resulting number (W) shall be
multiplied in the following increments:
      (1)   For BOD:
 
Concentration            Multiplier
000 - 300 mg/1 = Free    W x > 300 mg/1 x $0.2755/lb. =Surcharge Fee
>300 mg/1 =Surcharge Fee
      (2)   For TSS:
 
Concentration            Multiplier
000 - 350/mg/l = Free    W x >350 mg/1 x $0.3045/lb. = Surcharge Fee
>350 mg/1 =Surcharge Fee
      (3)   For Ammonia: Concentration
 
Concentration             Multiplier
000 - 45mg/l = Free       W x > 45 mg/I x $0.3625/lb. = Surcharge Fee
> 45 mg/1 = Surcharge Fee
   (f)   In the case where the City of Wheeling has permitted the discharge of
non-contact cooling water in the POTW, the strength of the waste shall be back
calculated using the combined waste stream formula as set forth in 40 CPR 403.6
(e) to determine the amount of surcharge applicable to the waste without the
diluting effect of the cooling water. In all cases the user shall be required
to measure the amount of cooling water discharged to the POTW. (Ord. 16161.
Passed 12-17-24.)
927.15 MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Pretreatment Charges and Fees. The City may adopt reasonable fees for
reimbursement of costs of setting up and operating the City's Pretreatment
Program which may include:
      (1)   Fees for wastewater discharge permit applications including the
cost of processing such applications;
      (2)   Fees for monitoring, inspections, and surveillance procedures
including the cost of collection and analyzing a user's discharge, and
reviewing monitoring reports submitted by users;
      (3)   Fees for reviewing and responding to accidental discharge

by this article and are separate from all other fees, fines, and penalties
chargeable by the City.
   (b)   Severability. If any provision of this article is invalidated by any
court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall not be affected
and shall continue in full force and effect.
   (c)   Effective Date. This article shall be in full force and effect
immediately following its passage, approval, and publications, as provided by

may require. The written notice shall be served either in person or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, and shall set forth the
basis for such order and shall particularly describe the monitoring activities
and/or analyses and reports required. The burden to be borne by the owner or
operator, including costs of these activities, analyses and reports, shall bear
a reasonable relationship to the need for the monitoring, analyses and reports
and the benefits to be obtained. The recipient of such order shall undertake
and provide the monitoring, analyses and reports within the time frames set
forth in the Order.
   (b)   Within twenty (20) days of the date of receipt of the order notice,
the recipient shall respond personally or in writing advising the Director of

competent jurisdiction.
   (c)   In the event the owner or operator of a facility or property fails to
conduct the monitoring and/or analyses and furnish the reports required by the
Order in the time frames set forth therein, the Director may cause such
monitoring and/or analyses to occur. If a violation is found, the Director may
assess all costs incurred, including reasonable administrative costs and

cease and desist such discharge, or practice, or operation likely to cause such
discharge and direct that those persons not complying shall comply with the
requirement and comply with a time schedule for compliance. The Director shall
provide notice to one in violation of this Article by personal notice or
certified U.S. Mail, return receipt requested, or, if no return receipt is
received by the Director after a reasonable time, by first class U.S. Mail.
Said notice shall state the nature of the violation, the potential penalty, the
action required to correct the violation, and the time period within which the
corrective action must be taken.
   (b)   If, after receipt of proper notice, a violator fails to timely make
the required corrections, the Director may enter upon the subject property and
make said corrections. The costs of correction may be recovered in a civil
action brought against the violator on behalf of the City.
   (c)   In the alternative, and at the discretion of the Director, and
pursuant to WV Code §16-13-23A(l), a violator may be issued a cease and desist
order to immediately discontinue the illicit discharge and/or be assessed a
monetary fine, payable to the City, in accordance with the following schedule:

      (2)   Second violation and/or failure to correct: $500.00.
      (3)   Third violation and subsequent violations and/or continued failure
to correct: $5,000.
   Any fine assessed to the City for an illicit discharge or other action in
violation of this article shall be assessed against and collected from the
violator. In any event, the Director shall ensure that there is a reasonable
time between a notice to correct and a subsequent sanction for failure to
correct.
   (d)    (1)   In addition or in the alternative, a violator that, after due
notice, is found to be in non-compliance with the approved construction site
management plan pursuant to Section
939.06 of this Article, and/or is found to be in non-compliance with the
approved stormwater management and comprehensive drainage plan pursuant to
Section
939.13 of this Article, may, at the discretion of the Director, be denied
continued coverage by a cease and desist order regarding a previously issued
building permit and/or refusal to issue or withdrawal of a previously issued
occupancy permit until the non-compliant condition is resolved and damages
remediated to the satisfaction of the Director.
      (2)   These sanctions may be assessed against any user of the municipal
stormwater system within the City watershed. The Municipal Court and/or the
Ohio County Circuit Court shall be the venue for violations occurring within
the City political boundaries. The Ohio County Magistrate Court and/or the Ohio
County Circuit Court shall be the venue for violations occurring within the
City watershed and outside the political boundaries of the City.
         (Ord. 13957. Passed 6-1-10.)
939.23 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT POWERS.
   In addition to the other enforcement powers and remedies established by this
Article, the Director has the authority to utilize the following administrative
remedies.
   (a)   Notice to Clean. Whenever the Director finds any oil, earth dirt,
grass, weeds, dead trees, tin cans, rubbish, refuse, waste or any other
material of any kind, in or upon the sidewalk abutting or adjoining any parcel
of land, or upon any parcel of land or grounds or in close proximity to any
open drain or ditch channel, which may result in an increase in pollutants
entering the storm drain system or a non-stormwater discharge to the storm
drain system, he or she may give notice to the property owner to remove and
lawfully dispose of such material in any manner that he or she reasonably may
provide. The recipient of such notice shall undertake the activities as
described in the notice within the time frames set forth therein.
   (b)   In the event the owner or operator of a facility fails to conduct the
activities as described in the notice, the Director may cause such required
activities as described in the notice to be performed, and the cost thereof
shall be assessed and invoiced to the owner of the property. If the invoice is
not paid within sixty (60) days, the Director may recommend to the City Manager
that the City take appropriate legal action to collect the invoiced and
ancillary costs.
      (Ord. 13957. Passed 6-1-10.)

   Any person, firm, corporation or organization notified of non-compliance
with this Article or required to perform monitoring, analyses, reporting and/or
corrective activities who is aggrieved by the decision of the Director may
appeal such decision in writing to the Wheeling City Council within ten (10)
days following the effective date of the decision. Upon receipt of such
request, the City Council shall request a report and recommendation from the
Director and shall set the matter for administrative hearing at the earliest
practical date. At said hearing, the City Council may hear additional evidence,
and may revoke, affirm or modify the earlier decision. Such decision shall be
final, subject to appeal to a Court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 13957.
Passed 6-1-10.)
939.26 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of protection required by this Article is considered reasonable
for regulatory purposes. The standards set forth herein are minimum standards
and this Article does not imply that compliance will ensure that there will be
no unauthorized discharge of pollutants into the waters of the State. This
Article shall not create liability on the part of the City, any agent or
employee thereof for any damages that result from reliance on this Article or
any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

section of this Article at
1112.04(d) entitled backflow preventer for general descriptions thereof (Ref:
64 WV CSR 15-7).
      (8)   Any Owner having a private well or other private water source must
have the approval of the City of Wheeling Water Department if the well or
source is cross- connected to the City of Wheeling Water Department's system.
Permission to cross- connect may be denied. The Owner may be required to
install a backflow preventer at the service entrance if a private water source
is maintained, even if it is not cross- connected to the City of Wheeling Water
Department's system. (Ref: 64 WV CSR 15-6)
      (9)   In the event the Owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the City of Wheeling Water Department's side
of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer
installed. (Ref: 64 WV CSR 15-6)
      (10)   The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semi- annual assembly testing, retesting in the case that

Department and/or WVBPH requirements. (Ref: 64 WV CSR 15-8) (Ord. 15129. Passed
7-3-18.)
1112.07  DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   The City of Wheeling Water Department recognizes the threat to the public
water system arising from cross- connections. All threats will be classified by
degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved backflow
prevention assemblies in a manner and within a time period appropriate for said
degree of hazard. (Ref: 64 WV CSR 15-5,6)
(Ord. 15129. Passed 7-3-18.)
1112.08 EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the City of Wheeling
Water Department to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as
to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or otherwise
results in an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of
hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting
to a business establishment, any existing backflow preventer must be upgraded
to a reduced pressure principle assembly, or a reduced pressure principle
assembly must be installed in the event that no backflow assembly is present.
(Ref. 64 WV CSR 15-4,5,6)
(Ord. 15129. Passed 7-3-18.)
1112.09  PERIODIC TESTING.
   (a)   The owner is responsible to assure that backflow prevention assemblies
shall be tested upon installation and at least every 12 months thereafter. This
periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester. This testing
will be done at the owner's expense. All reports of such shall be sent to the
City of Wheeling Water Department.
   (b)   Any backflow preventer assembly that fails during a periodic test will
be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the
repair the backflow preventer assembly will be retested at owner's expense to
insure correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to
continue unprotected if the backflow preventer assembly fails the test and
cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not
more than thirty (30) days after the test date will be established. The owner
is responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or a replacement device. Parallel
installation of two (2) devices is an effective means of the owner insuring
that uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and is
strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity.
   (c)   Backflow prevention assemblies will be tested more frequently than
specified in A. above, in cases where there is a history of test failures and
the City of Wheeling Water Department feels that due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be
borne by the owner. (Ref. 64 WV CSR 15-4,8)
(Ord. 15129. Passed 7-3-18.)
1112.10 RECORDS.
   (a)   The City of Wheeling Water Department will initiate and maintain the
following:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections
      (2)   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections
      (3)   Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the WVBPH
   (b)   Upon request, the City of Wheeling Water Department will submit
records of inspection, surveys, tests or corrective actions to the West
Virginia Bureau for Public Health. (Ref- 64 WV CSR 15-8) (Ord. 15129. Passed 7-
3-18.)
1112.11 CONFLICTS OF LAW.
   In the event of a conflict between the interpretation of a provision of West
Virginia code and the interpretation of a similar provision contained in any
part of this municipal ordinance, the interpretation of the provision in West
Virginia Code shall apply to this municipal ordinance.

1301.01 GENERAL PURPOSE.
   The procedures and standards for the development and subdivision of real
estate and for the surveying and platting thereof, prescribed by this Chapter,
are found by Council to be necessary to promote the public safety, health, and
general welfare, to provide for suitable residential neighborhoods with
adequate streets and utilities and appropriate building sites, to save
unnecessary expenditures of public funds by reserving space for public lands
and buildings and by proper construction of streets and utilities, and to
provide proper land records for the convenience of the public and for better
identification and permanent location of real estate boundaries.
1301.02 DEFINITION OF SUBDIVISION AND RESUBDIVISION.
   (a)   Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land divided
into two or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose,
whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy, or building development, and
includes all division of land involving the opening or construction of a new
street or change in existing streets, provided, however, that the following
shall not be included:
      (1)   The division of land into parcels greater than five acres where no
street right-of-way dedication in involved.
      (2)   The public acquisition of strips of land for the widening or
opening of streets.
      (3)   A plat amendment of land in cases where plats with final approval
had been granted and the lot sizes are increased. In such cases the subdivider
shall file with the Engineer an amended plat.
   (b)   Subdivisions will be divided into two categories: Major Subdivisions
and Minor Subdivisions.
      (1)   Major Subdivision: Any subdivision not classified as a minor
subdivision, and requiring new streets or the extension of any off-tract
improvements.
      (2)   Minor Subdivision: Any subdivision of land involving the creation
of fewer than five platted lots. Properties that are classified as minor
subdivisions shall not be permitted to further subdivide.
   (c)   Resubdivision. Whenever a developer desires to resubdivide property
lot lines on an already approved final subdivision plat, the developer shall
first obtain approval for the resubdivision by the same procedures prescribed
for the subdivision of land. Resubdivision is a type of subdivision involving
any of the following:
      (1)   Any change in any street layout or any other public improvement;
      (2)   Any change in any lot line, whether combining lot lines or creating
new lots, except where the lot sizes are increased (see plat amendment below);
      (3)   Any change in the amount of land reserved for public use or the
common use of lot owners;
      (4)   Any change in any easements shown on the approved plat.
   
1301.03 PLANNING COMMISSION AUTHORITY AND ACTIONS.
   (a)   Authority. The Planning Commission of Wheeling, West Virginia
(hereinafter “Planning Commission”) is vested with the authority to review,
approve, conditionally approve and disapprove applications for the subdivision
of land, including sketch, preliminary, and final plats. The Planning
Commission may grant variances from these regulations pursuant to the
provisions below.
   (b)   Approval of Plat Required. Before any real property located within the
City or lands that abut thereon, is subdivided and offered for sale, and before
a plat for such property is recorded in the Office of the County Clerk of Ohio
County, the subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning Commission, and
such approval entered on the plat by the Chairman, after first having been
submitted to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
   (c)   Amendments. For the purpose of protecting the public health, safety,
and general welfare, the Planning Commission may from time to time propose
amendments to this Chapter which shall then be approved or disapproved by the
City Council at a public meeting following public notice.
   (d)   Hardship. Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary
hardship may result from strict compliance with this Chapter because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question, it may vary the
requirements so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured; provided that such variation will not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of the Comprehensive Plan or this Chapter. In granting
variances and modifications, the Planning Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements so varied or modified.
   (e)   Appeal. If the subdivider disagrees with the action taken on his
proposal by the Planning Commission, he may appeal such action to Council
within thirty days of the time such action was taken. The applicant shall file
a Notice of Appeal with the Council, with a copy to the Planning Commission, no
later than ten days after the date on which the Planning Commission notifies
the applicant that it has disapproved the sketch, preliminary, or final
subdivision plat. The Notice of Appeal shall set forth in clear and concise
fashion the basis for the appeal. The appeal shall be considered at the next
regularly scheduled public meeting of the Council, at which time it may affirm
or reverse the decision of the Planning Commission. The Council may reverse the
decision of the Planning Commission only by a unanimous vote of the Council
members present at the meeting. If the Council reverses the Planning
Commission, the applicant may proceed to submit a preliminary or final plat as
appropriate under the conditions for approval agreed to by the Council.
   (f)   No proposed changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be
made to any final plat of a subdivision after approval has been granted by the
Planning Commission and endorsed in writing on the plat, unless said proposed
changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions are submitted to the Planning
Commission for approval.
1301.04 GUARANTEE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Guarantee Bond or Letter of Credit. As a condition of the acceptance
by the Planning Commission of a subdivision and the streets and sidewalks
constructed therein, the subdivider shall agree that he will guarantee all
streets and sidewalks within his subdivision against any and all defects in
workmanship and material for a period of two years from the date of such
acceptance by the Planning Commission. The City Engineer, when in his opinion
the same shall be necessary for the protection of the City, may require such
subdivider to furnish and file with the City Clerk a cash bond or bond with
proper surety or a letter of credit in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the
cost of construction of such streets and sidewalks, conditioned upon the
failure of such subdivider to construct such streets and sidewalks without
defects in workmanship and material for such period of two years.
   (b)   Inspection of improvements. The applicant shall pay to the City an
inspection fee based on the estimated cost of inspection, and where the
improvements are completed prior to final plat approval, the subdivision plat
shall not be signed by the Chairman of the Planning Commission unless the
inspection fee has been paid at the time of application. These fees shall be
due and payable upon demand of the City. No building permits or certificates of
occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the City Engineer finds
upon inspection that any one or more of the required improvements have not been
constructed in accordance with the municipality’s construction standards and
specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for properly completing the
improvements. The City Engineer shall arrange for inspection of required
improvements during construction and ensure their satisfactory completion.
1301.05 PERFORMANCE BOND, ASSURANCES, OR OTHER SECURITY; START OF CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   A statement shall be placed on all subdivision plans approved by the
Planning Commission to the effect that the owner(s) agree (s) to comply with
the plan and all conditions noted thereon. The installation of required site
improvements (all roads, paved areas, drainage, utilities, outdoor lighting,
open space and recreation, landscaping and screening including planting) which
are an integral part of the approved plan may be guaranteed by cash,
performance bond, letter or credit, or other acceptable guaranty approved by
the City Council and the City of Wheeling Solicitor. In the event that a
satisfactory guaranty is not provided within ninety days of the date of the
resolution, the subdivision plan shall be null and void. A guaranty of the
improvements shall be for 100 percent of the cost of improvements.
 
   (b)   The said cash, performance bond or other acceptable guaranty shall be
conditioned on the completion of said work set forth on the approved
subdivision plan in a manner satisfactory to the Planning Commission; and upon
the proper functioning of said systems for a period of one year from their
completion. In default thereof, the said guaranty shall be forfeited; and the
City of Wheeling shall use the amount thereof to complete any incomplete
portion of the said work or to make sure repairs are undertaken as are
necessary to assure the proper functioning of said improvements. If any amount
of money remains after the City of Wheeling has completed said work, such
excess money will be returned to the surety or the person putting up the
required deposit. The installation of all improvements shall be under the
direct supervision of a West Virginia State registered architect, landscape
architect, or professional engineer.
 
   (c)   To obtain a building permit, an applicant shall provide to the

1305.01 APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Presubmission. For the purpose of expediting applications and reducing
subdivision design and development costs, the applicant may request a
presubmission conference, also known as sketch plat. The applicant should meet
in person with the Planning Commission and a representative of the Economic and

requirements of the subdivision ordinance proposal prior to the preparation of
a detailed subdivision plat;
      (3)   Identify policies and regulations that create opportunities or pose
significant constraints for the proposed development; and
      (4)   Review the proposed concept plan and consider opportunities to
improve the plan and mitigate undesirable project consequences.
   (b)   If deemed necessary by the Economic and Community Development
Department or Commission, the presubmission applicant may also meet with
appropriate municipal representatives. The applicant shall not be bound by the
determination of the presubmission conference nor shall the Planning Commission
or Economic and Community Development Department be bound by any such review.
The applicant may be required to temporarily stake the property so that the
Economic and Community Development Department or Commission can make a field
trip to the subdivision site. The applicant shall provide the following
documents as part of the presubmission conference:
      (1)   Application form and disclosure statement.
      (2)   Copies of all prior actions of the City Council, Planning

design, and engineering review. The City Council shall adopt, by resolution and
from time to time may amend, but not more than once annually, a schedule of
fees payable by an applicant for applications brought before the Planning
Commission for determination or action. A check, draft or money order, payable
to the City of Wheeling, shall accompany the application for preliminary plat
approval.
   (e)   The Planning Commission shall establish rules, regulations, and forms
for the administrative processing of subdivision applications. The Economic and
Community Development Department shall administer the subdivision planning
process. The subdivision application and any related information shall be
submitted to the Economic and Community Development Department, which in the

   (a)   Preliminary Plat Submission. Four copies of the complete preliminary
plat and any supplementary material shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission with written application for conditional approval at least thirty
days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The following steps
in the review and approval process may be undertaken either by the whole
Planning Commission or its Subdivision Committee. The term "Commission" used
below includes the Subdivision Committee.
   (b)   Preliminary Plat Review, Public Hearing, and Action. The Commission
shall review the submitted preliminary plat and other material and negotiate
with the subdivider/applicant on changes deemed advisable and the kind and
extent of improvements to be made by the subdivider/applicant. During this
period, the Commission may require the applicant to obtain the approval of
relevant municipal departments and commissions, such as the Department of
Public Works. The Planning Commission shall set a date, time, and place for a
public hearing, notify the applicant in writing of the public hearing, and

approval. If the Commission disapproves the preliminary plat, the Commission
shall express its disapproval and its reasons therefore. The action of the
Commission shall be noted on the copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and
attached to any conditions determined. One copy shall be returned to the
subdivider, one copy shall be sent to the City Engineer, and one copy shall be
retained by the Commission.
   (c)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute
approval of the final plat. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval
of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation
of the final plat, which will be submitted for approval of the Commission and
for recording upon the fulfillment of the requirements of this Chapter and the
conditions of the conditional approval.
   (d)   No street shall be opened, graded, improved or constructed; no water
or sewer line shall be constructed; no water or sewer service shall be

and directed to take necessary action to cause to be closed any street opened
in violation of this Chapter.
   (e)   Final Plat Submission. The final plat shall conform substantially to
the preliminary plat and conditional approval. If desired by the subdivider,
the final plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary
plat that he proposes to record and develop at the time, provided, however,
that such portion conforms to all requirements of these Subdivision
Regulations. Application for approval of the final plat shall be submitted in
writing to the Commission at least thirty days prior to the meeting at which it
is to be considered. Four copies of the final plat and other exhibits required
for approval shall be prepared as specified in Section
1305.04  and shall be submitted to the Commission within twelve months after
conditional approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise such approval shall
become null and void. The Commission may grant a time extension.
   (f)   Final Plat Review and Action. The Commission shall review the
submitted final plat. Following this, the Commission shall act within forty
days to approve or disapprove the final plat. The final plat may be approved if
the subdivider has satisfactorily completed the requirements of the preliminary
plat, all conditions of the conditional approval have been met, and a bond
acceptable to the City has been posted. The exhibits required under Section
1305.04 must be filed with the Commission prior to the Commission’s decision to
release the bond. The action to approve by the Commission shall be noted on the
final plat and all copies. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one
copy sent to the City Engineer, one copy retained by the Commission, and the
fourth shall be sent to Council for its review.
   (g)   Recording of Final Plat. After approval of the final plat by the
Planning Commission, such plat shall be recorded in the office of the County
Clerk within thirty days after such approval. The Commission may grant a time
extension if there are unusual circumstances.
   (h)   Offer of Dedication. Recording of the final plat shall have the effect
of an irrevocable offer to dedicate all streets and other public ways shown
thereon to public use, unless a notation is placed on the final plat by the
subdivider stating that there is no offer of dedication, and an irrevocable
offer to dedicate or reserve as specified on the plat lands for parks, schools
or other public purpose. Recording of the plat, however, shall not impose any
duty on the City concerning improvement or maintenance of any such dedicated
street or lands, until the proper authorities of the City have made actual
appropriation of the same by legal action. Where improvements were constructed
in territory prior to its annexation into the City and prior to the acceptance
by the City of any offer of dedication of improvements, the offer or shall
provide, at his expense, a certificate by a professional engineer as to the
compliance with the City’s and all other applicable standards of the offered
streets, public ways and infrastructure improvements.
1305.03 MINOR SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE.

preliminary plat to the Planning Administrator. If the preliminary plat meets
all necessary requirements, then it shall be deemed a final plat and may be
approved by the Planning Administrator. If approved, the Planning Administrator

located within 200 feet of the subject property. If the preliminary plat is not
approved by the Planning Administrator, the applicant shall submit the plat to
the Planning Commission's Subdivision Committee on appeal. If the preliminary
plat is not approved by the Subdivision Committee, the applicant may appear
before the Planning Commission for a final appeal. If the subdivider/applicant
has satisfactorily completed the requirements of the preliminary plat and a
bond acceptable to the City has been posted, then the Planning Administrator

subdivider stating that there is no offer of dedication, and an irrevocable
offer to dedicate or reserve as specified on the plat lands for parks, schools
or other public purpose. Recording of the plat, however, shall not impose any
duty on the City concerning improvement or maintenance of any such dedicated
street or lands, until the proper authorities of the City have made actual

 ARTICLE 1307
Street Design Standards
1307.01   Purpose.
1307.02   General design of streets.
1307.03   Specific street design standards.
 
1307.01 PURPOSE.
   The subdivision shall conform to standards that will result in a well-
planned community, protect the health and safety of the residents, and provide
a desirable living environment without unnecessarily adding to the development
costs. The following improvements shall be required: streets and circulation,
off-street parking, water supply, sanitary sewers, and storm water management.
1307.02 GENERAL DESIGN OF STREETS.
   (a)   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
   (b)   Conformity to Planned Public Way. Whenever a tract of land included
within any proposed subdivision embraces any part of a planned public way,
shown on plans which have been adopted by the proper authority, such part of
the proposed public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and
the width indicated by the plan.
   (c)   Storm Drainage. Adequate storm drainage shall be required, as per
standards established by the Department of Public Works and Water Pollution
Control. These standards shall control the design and construction of storm
drainage facilities so that acceptable storm water flow and minimum acceptable
runoff qualities are achieved by the subdivider.
   (d)   Classification of Streets. Streets which may be classified by
definition under two or more street types shall conform to the higher
requirements. Marginal access streets shall conform to the regulations for the
purpose they serve, i.e., residential street or business street.
   (e)   Street and Subdivision Names. The proposed name of the subdivision and
the proposed street names shall not duplicate or too closely approximate the
name of any other subdivision or street in the area covered by this Chapter.
Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with existing streets or are
an extension of an existing street shall bear the name of the existing street.
All street names shall be subject to approval by the Planning Commission.
   (f)   Subdivision Containing or Abutting Major Street or Railroad Right of
Way.
      (1)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse
frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the
rear property line, deep lots with rear service lanes, or such other treatment
as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
      (2)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way,
the Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side
of such right of way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land, as for park purposes in residential streets, or for the
business or industry in the appropriate districts; such distances shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future
grade separations.
   (g)   Half Streets. Streets within a proposed subdivision shall be designed
where possible to allow for a through connection to a future subdivision on
adjacent property or to future phases of the same subdivision. These shall be
known as half streets and shall be designed with temporary T-turnarounds at
their ends. The turnaround shall be removed and a permanent through street
created when the adjoining property is subdivided and where a half street is
contiguous to a previously platted half street. Half streets shall be shown on
the final plat.
   (h)   Street Center Line Offsets. Street jogs with center-line offsets of
less than 125 feet shall not be allowed.
   (i)   Tangents Between Reverse Curves. A tangent at least 100 feet shall be
introduced between reverse curves on major and collector streets.
   (j)   Street Intersections
      (1)   Three-way street intersections should be utilized, using four-way
intersections only when absolutely necessary.
      (2)   Flat grade within and fifty to one hundred feet each way from the
street intersection is preferred but over seven percent (7%) grade is not
acceptable.
      (3)   Right angle street intersections are preferred, but no intersection
shall be at an angle of less than seventy-five degrees or more than one hundred
fifteen degrees. The curb radius for residential and commercial streets shall
be twenty feet. The curb radius for a collector street intersecting a major
street shall be fifty feet.
      (4)   A clear sight triangle shall be provided at all street
intersections. Within such triangle no vision-obstructing objects shall be
permitted which exceed a height of twenty-four inches above the elevation of
the abutting streets.
      (5)   Such sight triangles shall be established from a distance of:
         A.   One hundred feet from point of intersection of the street center
lines for major streets;
         B.   Seventy-five feet from point of intersection of the street center
lines for collector streets;
         C.   Fifty feet from the point of intersection of the street center
lines for all other streets.
   (k)   Residential Streets to Discourage Through Traffic. Residential streets
shall be so laid out that their use by through traffic will be discouraged.
   (l)   Street Grading. All streets shall be graded to their full right-of-way
width so as to provide adequate shoulders and pedestrian walkways. All streets
shall be paved, and drainage courses, sidewalks and other structures installed
according to City standards. Driveways shall meet the sidewalk grade at the
property line.
   (m)   Street Installation Responsibility. The subdivider shall be
responsible for the cost and installation of the road foundation and paving
necessary to meet the requirements of this Chapter.

block is necessary because of unusual topography.
1311.03 LOT STANDARDS.
   (a)   Lots should be designed so that there will be no unreasonable
difficulties due to topography, flooding, high water table, sewage disposal,
storm water control, configuration, inadequate access, or for any other reason.
   (b)   For health and safety of the residents, residential lots should to the
greatest extent possible front on residential streets.
   (c)   All lots should be designed with sufficient access to afford a
reasonable means of entry or exit for emergency vehicles as well as others
needing access to the property.
   (d)   Lot dimensions shall conform to:
      (1)   The requirements of the Zoning Ordinance; and
      (2)   The requirements of Article
1309, Utilities and Drainage, with respect to individual sewerage systems when
service from an acceptable sewerage system is not available or feasible.

width to permit appropriate setback from and orientation to both streets.
   (h)   Reverse frontage lots. Double frontage or reverse frontage lots, also
known as through lots, should be avoided except where essential to provide
separation of residential developments from traffic arteries or to overcome
specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planted screen of at
least ten feet, across which there shall be no right of access, shall be
provided along the street lines of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other
similar use.
1311.04 CIRCULATION.
   (a)   Pedestrian walkways. Pedestrian walkways not less than ten feet wide,
with a minimum of four feet of pavement, shall be required when deemed
essential to provide circulation or access to schools, playgrounds, shopping
centers, transportation and other community facilities.
   (b)   Access to street. The subdividing of land shall provide each lot with
satisfactory access to an existing public street.
1311.05 RESERVATION OF LAND FOR FUTURE FACILITIES.
   To insure orderly development of the community, the subdivider of a major
subdivision will be required to reserve or dedicate open spaces, shown on plans
approved by the Planning Commission, for parks, schools, fire stations, and
playgrounds.
1311.06 HOUSE AND BUILDING NUMBERING.

(Ord. 13704. Passed 11-18-08.)
1323.05 LEGISLATIVE CHANGES TO THE PLANNING AND ZONING CODE VALIDATING EXISTING
MUNICIPAL CODE.
   Legislative changes to West Virginia Code by adoption of Chapter 8A
recognize the “grandfathering” of municipal land use law for cities such as
Wheeling by the incorporation of provisions which validate prior zoning and
planning ordinances as well as subdivision and land development ordinances (see
generally, as examples, West Virginia Code § 8A-4-7 and § 8A-7- 12).
(Ord. 13704. Passed 11-18-08.)
1323.06 AMENDING, SUPPLEMENTING OR CHANGING ZONING ORDINANCE.
   The governing body of a municipality, the City Council of the City of
Wheeling, or the county court may, from time to time, amend, supplement or
change the rules and regulations and districts fixed by the Planning and Zoning
Ordinance hereunder pursuant to the authority found on this Ordinance and in W.
Va. Code § 8-24-45.

such legislative enactments regarding standards for continuation of and the
extinguishing of non-conforming uses.
   (b)   Pursuant to the validation of prior municipal land use ordinances
recognized in Chapter 8A and Home Rule Authority, the City of Wheeling
continues to utilize the statutory language found in W. Va. Code prior to the
2004 enactments concerning non-conforming uses and the extinguishing of same.
The City of Wheeling utilizes a definitive time for abandonment of a non-
conforming use. The City utilizes various guidelines such as a discontinuance
of a period of six (6) months during any twelve (12) month period and in other
cases one (1) month of non-use for abandonment purposes and immediate
extinguishing in cases where a particular non- conforming use establishment,
such as a bar, house of prostitution/drugs, etc., when the property has been
found by the governing body to be a permanent public nuisance. These various
time parameters are set forth within the applicable Sections of the Codified
Ordinances of the City of Wheeling. Therefore, the City of Wheeling exercises
the powers and duties inherent in its local authority to establish the
abandonment time period.

prohibit the particular use intended to be made of a subject lot or which has
higher standards for setbacks, coverage, height, and similar requirements.
   (c)   WHEN PROVISIONS CONFLICT.
      (1)   Wherever the terms of this Zoning Ordinance require a greater width
or size of yards, courts or other open spaces, or require a lower height of
building or less number of stories, or require a greater percentage of lot to
be left unoccupied, or impose other higher standards than are required in any
other ordinance or regulation, the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall
govern.
      (2)   Wherever the provisions of any other ordinance or regulation
require a greater width or size of yards, courts or other open spaces, or
require a lower height of building or a less number of stories, or require a
greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other higher
standards than are required by the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, the
provisions of such other ordinance or regulation shall govern.
1331.02 OFFICIAL ZONING MAP.
   (a)   ZONING MAP. The location and boundaries of the zoning districts are
shown on the Zoning Map of the City of Wheeling. The zoning map, with all
explanatory notes thereon and all amendments thereto, is hereby adopted and
declared to be a part of this chapter. The zoning map shall be kept up-to-date
and shall be on file in the City Clerk's office for the use and benefit of the
public. Certified or endorsed copies of said map shall also be on file in the
offices of the Economic and Community Development Department.
   (b)   ZONING MAP BOOK. In recognition of the difficulty of determining the
zoning districts of certain properties as a result of the scale of the Zoning
Map, the City hereby also adopts as a part of this chapter the book entitled
City of Wheeling Zoning Map. Said book shall be kept up-to-date and shall be on
file in the City Clerk's office for the use and benefit of the public. Copies
of said book shall also be on file in the offices of the Economic and Community
Development Department and the Building Inspector. In the event of a
discrepancy between the Zoning Map described in subsection (a) above and the
book containing the Zoning Map, the book shall prevail. Said book consists of:
      (1)   A title page,
      (2)   A page listing the zoning districts and designation symbols,
      (3)   An index dividing the City and adjoining areas into consecutively
numbered segments, each numbered segment designating a particular area,
      (4)   The Zoning Map proper, consisting of pages numbered consecutively
and corresponding to the numbered segments of the index map and setting out at
a scale of 500 feet to one inch the area included in each numbered segment, and
      (5)   A map index by street names cross-referenced to the numbered
segments of the map.
   (c)   ZONING MAP AMENDMENTS. Whenever the City Council amends the Zoning
Map, the City Clerk shall notify the Economic and Community Development
Department which shall cause the amendment to be made to the official copy of
the Zoning Map and to the book of the Zoning Map. The Department shall provide
copies of the amended map and the relevant amended map pages to the Building
Inspector, and all other City agencies and departments requiring a zoning map.
   (d)   INTERPRETATION OF BOUNDARIES. Where uncertainty exists with respect to
the boundaries of zoning districts as shown on the official Zoning Map, the
following rules of interpretation shall apply:
      (1)   The zone boundary lines are intended generally to follow the center
lines of streets, highways, public utility easements or watercourses, and
railroad rights of way, the mean water level on the shore (the shore line) of
rivers, streams and other waterways, existing lot lines, or City boundary
lines, all as shown on the Zoning Map. In the event of change in the shore
line, the boundary shall be construed as moving with the actual shore line.
      (2)   Where a zone boundary line does not follow such a line as described
above, its position is shown on the Zoning Map by a specific dimension
expressing its distance in feet, measured perpendicularly, from a street line
or other boundary line as indicated. Distances not specifically indicated on
the official Zoning Map shall be determined by the scale of the map.
      (3)   If a zone boundary line does not follow an existing lot line but is
within ten feet of an existing lot line, the lot line shall be deemed the zone
boundary line.
      (4)   Where a zone boundary line follows a lot line, the lot line shall
be that shown on the Assessor's map on the date of adoption of such boundary.
      (5)   If, after the use of the above rules and the official zoning map,
the district classification of any property is in question, the Zoning Officer
shall make the final determination. The decision of the Zoning Officer with
respect to the officer's boundary interpretation may be appealed by the
applicant to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (e)   LOTS IN TWO OR MORE ZONING DISTRICTS OR INCORPORATED BODIES. Where a
lot is divided by one or more district boundary lines (also known as a split
lot), the following shall apply:
      (1)   Uses permitted in one district shall not extend into another
district where they would not otherwise be permitted.
      (2)   Dimensional requirements shall be measured from the lot lines and
not the zoning district lines.
   (f)   OVERLAY DISTRICTS. All regulations governing overlay districts are
superimposed on the zoning districts listed above, wherever applicable. Where
provisions governing overlay districts impose greater restrictions that those
imposed by other applicable provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the
overlay districts shall control.
   (g)   LANDS ANNEXED INTO THE CITY. All territory annexed to the City shall
be zoned in the same manner as the contiguous territory inside the previous
City limits until otherwise classified.

the regulations herein specified for the zoning district in which it is
located.
1331.15 NONCONFORMING USES, LOTS, AND STRUCTURES.
   (a)   INTENT. If, within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance
or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures, and uses
of land and structures which were lawful before the effective date of this
Zoning Ordinance, but which do not conform to this Zoning Ordinance or future
amendments, it is the intent of these regulations to permit these
nonconformities to continue until they are removed or abandoned. Such uses are
declared by this Zoning Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. However, these regulations recognize the right of
nonconformities to continue, but encourage such lots, uses, and structures to
be brought into conformity with these regulations as soon as reasonable.
   (b)   NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
      (1)   In any district in which residential dwellings are permitted,
notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance, a single- family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be
erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and
not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. If the lot is
dimensionally nonconforming with regard to yard requirements, a variance must
be obtained from front, side, and rear yard requirements from the Board of
Zoning Appeals. The lot shall comply with all other development standards for
the district and with Section
1331.06.
      (2)   Expansion or Reduction of Nonconforming Lots. Lots that fail to
meet minimum width or area requirements may be expanded to include abutting
lots under the same ownership. Lots that fail to meet minimum width or area
requirements may not be reduced in width or area respectively.
   (c)    NONCONFORMING USES. Where a lawful use exists which, on the effective
date of these regulations or subsequent amendment thereto, becomes
nonconforming, such use may be continued so long as it has not been abandoned
and remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No nonconforming use shall be changed into another nonconforming
use.
      (2)   No nonconforming use shall, if once changed into a conforming use,
be changed back to a nonconforming use.
      (3)   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged, increased, extended, or
expanded.
      (4)   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any
other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use.
      (5)   External evidence of a nonconforming use shall not be increased by
any means whatsoever.
      (6)   No nonconforming use shall be re-established if such use has for
any reason been discontinued for a period of six months during any twelve-month
period, except when government action impedes access to the premises.
Discontinuance shall be deemed substantial or total cessation of activities
with respect to the nonconforming use and/or substantial or total vacancy of
the structure in which the nonconforming use was conducted. Such discontinuance
shall be deemed abandonment, irrespective of whether an intent to abandon the
nonconforming use may exist. Intent to resume a nonconforming use shall not
confer the right to do so.
      (7)   If a nonconforming use of land is ceased for any reason, any
subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this
Zoning Ordinance for the district in which such land is located.
         (Ord. 12225. Passed 4-17-01.)
      (8)   Any property found to be a public nuisance by City Council, which
has a nonconforming status, shall lose its nonconforming status after three
months.
      (9)   Any property found to be a permanent public nuisance by City
Council, which has a nonconforming status, shall immediately lose its
nonconforming use status and revert to the land use permitted in accord with
the Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 12746. Passed 12-2-03.)
   (d)   NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the
terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on lot area, lot coverage,
height, yards, floor area ratio, off-street parking, loading, or other
dimensional requirements or characteristics of the structure or its location on
the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise
lawful. Such a building or structure that is otherwise conforming in use shall
be deemed to be dimensionally nonconforming. The following provisions apply:
      (1)   Any nonconforming building or structure or portion thereof may be
altered to decrease its dimensional nonconformity.
      (2)   Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved.
   (e)   NONCONFORMANCE CREATED BY ZONING CHANGE OR OTHER AMENDMENTS TO THIS
CHAPTER. Whenever a zoning designation or the restrictions affecting property
within a district shall be changed hereafter so as to render nonconforming a
use, building, or structure then presently or theretofore legally existing,
such use, building, or structure may nevertheless continue subject to the
conditions set forth in this chapter. Said uses shall be deemed nonconforming
uses and said buildings and structures shall be deemed dimensionally
nonconforming. Nothing in these regulations shall require any change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of a building for which a building
permit was issued prior to the effective date of these regulations provided
that such building permit has not expired when construction is commenced.
   (f)   REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE. A nonconforming structure may be maintained,
repaired, or altered but shall not be enlarged in any way that increases its
nonconformity. Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall prevent the restoration
to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by
the Building Inspector.
   (g)   RECONSTRUCTION OF NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES. Should a
nonconforming structure or portion thereof, or a conforming structure with a
nonconforming use be destroyed or damaged by any means to an extent where the
cost of reconstruction exceeds fifty percent of the fair market value thereof
at the time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity
with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (h)   SPECIAL PERMIT USES. Any use for which a special use permit is
required as provided in this Zoning Ordinance shall not be deemed a
nonconforming use, but shall be deemed a conforming use in such district.
   (i)   AUTOMATIC SPECIAL PERMIT. Any use in existence as of the effective
date of this chapter which is by this chapter made a special permit use in the
district in which it is located shall be presumed to have a special permit to
the extent such use is legally conforming as of the date immediately prior to
the effective date of this Chapter.
1331.16  FENCE FACING.
   The finished surfaces of any fence shall face toward adjacent properties and
street frontage. Fence posts and supporting structure, when visible on one side
and not the other or more visible on one side than the other, should face
inward. The Economic and Community Development Director may make a
determination as to which side of a fence is the finished surface, should there
be a question or dispute regarding the unfinished surface.

1347.01 R-5, PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   GENERAL PURPOSE. The regulations set forth in this section are
designed to deal with certain types of problems that arise only in connection
with large-scale residential developments, also known as planned unit
developments, and to promote and facilitate better site planning and community
planning through modified application of the district regulations in such
developments. Such large-scale residential developments may involve more than
one zoning lot, but shall be planned as one unit. The regulations of this
section are designed to allow greater flexibility for securing better site
planning for the development of vacant land and to provide incentives toward
that end while safeguarding the present or future use and development of
surrounding areas, and specifically:
      (1)   To achieve more efficient use of increasingly scarce land or of
annexed land within the framework of the overall bulk controls established by
the city in furtherance of its Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   To enable open space in large-scale residential developments to be
arranged in such a way as best to serve active and passive recreation needs of
the residents;
      (3)   To protect and preserve scenic assets and natural features;
      (4)   To foster a more stable community by providing for a population of
balanced household sizes, incomes, and ownership or rental tenure;
      (5)   To encourage harmonious designs incorporating a variety of building
types and variations in the siting of buildings;
      (6)   And thus to promote and protect public health, safety, and general
welfare.
   (b)   DEFINITION. A Planned Residential District is a large-scale
residential development or development predominantly for residential uses, on a
tract of land containing a single zoning lot or two or more zoning lots which

   (e)   REQUIREMENTS FOR APPLICATIONS. Any applicant wishing to construct a
planned residential development area may submit to the Planning Commission an
overall site plan for the development of a residential development area. The
overall site plan shall contain the following:
      (1)   The name of the property owner or owners, who must be the
applicant, except when the residential development area is an officially
approved urban renewal project, in which instance property ownership is not
required. This condition, however, will be satisfied if, at the time the
applicant submits his overall plan, he is the owner of an option to purchase
the property within the residential development area.
      (2)   A site plan indicating the planned location and heights of all
buildings and their use, off-street parking areas, driveways, recreation areas,
easements, walks, the location, type and heights of walls, the extent of
landscaping, and the location of existing natural features such as important
trees or clusters of trees, streams, creeks, rivers, or rock formations.

   (f)   REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
      (1)   The framework of the review and approval procedure is the standard
site plan process as found in Article
1373, Site Plan Review. The plan and any supplemental information shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for study and report. Other conditions and
concerns that the Planning Commission will use to review the proposed
development are:
         A.   The extent to which the proposed plan is in compliance with or
deviates from adopted municipal plans, goals, and policies;
         B.      The suitability of the subject property for the proposed uses
         C.   The adequacy of public facilities such as transportation,
utilities, and other required public services to serve the proposed uses
         D.   The effect of the proposed rezoning and development plan on
surrounding uses
         E.   The effect of the proposed rezoning and development plan on the
economic viability of existing developed and vacant land within the City.
      (2)   After the sketch plan has been reviewed and as part of the
preliminary site plan review, the applicant shall apply for the necessary
rezoning of the subject lot(s) to R-5. After notice and hearing for the
requested change in zone classification as required by Section
1377.06, the Planning Commission shall report its recommendations for approval
or disapproval, together with the reasons therefor and additional requirements,
if any, to Council for action.
      (3)   Once the property has been rezoned, the Planning Commission shall
continue its review of the planned residential development area in conformance
with the standard site plan review process and the restrictions or standards
stated below. The Planning Commission may waive or reduce requirements. Parking
requirements may be reduced to no less than 65% of the otherwise required total
of parking spaces. If affordable housing is provided within the development,
on-street parking spaces may be counted toward the required parking total.
Within one year following the approval of the R-5 Planned Residential District
for the planned residential development area, the applicant shall submit to the
Commission a preliminary plan for the development of all or a portion of the
residential development area, which preliminary plan shall include the
following:
         A.   The information required in the overall development plan in
detailed form.
         B.   A general development schedule stating the approximate date when
construction of the project will begin and the approximate completion date of
each stage of the project.
         C.   An off-street parking and loading plan.
         D.   A circulation diagram showing the proposed movement of vehicles,
goods and pedestrians within the planned residential development and traffic
regulating devices needed to facilitate or insure the safety of the circulation
pattern.
         E.   A drainage plan or plan for control of stormwater and surface
water, with special emphasis on off-street parking areas. All utility locations
shall be shown on the site development plan.
         F.   An erosion and sedimentation control plan for the construction
and occupancy phases.
         G.   Landscape and tree planting plan.
         H.   An economic feasibility report or market analysis.
      (4)   Within one year following the approval by the Commission of the
preliminary plan or at such other time as the Commission may direct, the
applicant shall file a final plan for the planned residential development with
the Commission, which final plan shall be approved by the Commission if the
plan meets the following requirements:
         A.   The final plan must be in substantial compliance with the
previously approved preliminary plan.
         B.   The final plan must be consistent with the comprehensive plan of
the City.
         C.   All public improvements included with the residential development
area must comply with the ordinances of the City regarding subdivisions and
approval of the subdivision must be completed prior to the submission of the
final plan.
         D.   The final plan for the residential development area must
harmonize and be developed in accordance with the area surrounding and adjacent
to the project area.
         E.   Density shall not be less than the minimum lot area per dwelling
unit as permitted in the zone existing prior to the change in zoning
classification. Such density shall be based on the overall gross acreage within
the planned residential development area less streets and off-street parking
areas. If the property involved was previously zoned more than one different
zoning classification, the more restrictive zoning regulation shall apply.
      (5)   All buildings not attached or having common walls shall be
separated by a minimum distance of ten feet.
      (6)   All standards of the zone in which the tract is located at the time
of application shall be complied with except that yard requirements may be
modified for the protection of adjacent properties. Yard requirements need only
be applied in relationship to the tract boundary.
      (7)   A minimum of fifteen percent of the project area included within
the planned residential development shall be devoted to usable common open
space and recreation facilities. Off-street parking areas, streets and required
yard areas shall not be counted for this purpose. Every property developed
within the planned residential development should be designed to abut upon
common open space.
   (g)   COMMON OPEN SPACE. All land shown on the final development plan and
designated as common open space land must be conveyed to a public agency or a
community association which agrees to maintain the common open space and any
buildings, structures or other improvements which have been placed on it; no
common open space may be used for any purpose not specified in the final
development plan until the final development plan has been amended and approved
by the Commission to permit such use.
   (h)   AMENDMENTS TO THE FINAL PLAN. No changes may be made in the approved
final plan for the residential development area except upon application to the
Commission as follows:
      (1)   Minor changes in the use, location, siting, height of buildings,
street alignment and structures may be authorized by the Commission as required
by engineering or other circumstances not foreseen at the time the final
planned residential development plan was approved, provided that such changes
will not affect street alignment or utility locations outside the planned
residential development area.
      (2)   If the Commission finds that the proposed changes constitute major
changes in use, rearrangement of lots, blocks, building tracts, changes in
provisions of common open space or other major changes, approval shall only be
granted as provided by subsection (e) above.
      (3)   Changes in the drainage plan shall not be allowed except for
changes at the connection between a structure and the system. All changes shall
be approved by the City Engineer.
   (i)   CONSTRUCTION.
      (1)   Construction may begin when the applicant/developer has all
necessary permits and a bond, letter of credit, or other guaranty has been
accepted by the city.
      (2)   In the event that construction of the planned development has not
begun within two years from the date of final approval, the district shall
revert to the same zoning classification(s) which existed prior to the approval
of the R-5 Residential Zone. The zoning regulations of the prior zone shall
thereupon be in full force and effect. The Planning Commission may, however,
grant a reasonable extension of time beyond the two-year period, for the
beginning of construction if, in its opinion, good cause has been shown for the
delay.
1347.02 NWSD, NORTH WHEELING SPECIAL DISTRICT.
   (a)   PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT. The Comprehensive Plan recognizes

1351.01 PURPOSE, APPLICABILITY, AND DISCLAIMER OF RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   The purpose of these provisions is to prevent the loss of property and
life, the creation of health and safety hazards, the disruption of commerce and
governmental services, the extraordinary and unnecessary expenditure of public
funds for flood protection and relief, and the impairment of the tax base by:
      (1)   Regulating uses, activities, and development that, acting alone or
in combination with other existing or future uses, activities, and development,
will cause unacceptable increases in flood heights, velocities and frequencies.
      (2)   Restricting or prohibiting certain uses, activity and development
from locating within areas subject to flooding.
      (3)   Requiring all those uses, activities and developments that do occur
in flood- prone areas to be protected and/or floodproofed against flooding and
flood damage.
      (4)   Protecting individuals from buying lands and structures which are
unsuited for intended purposes because of flood hazards.
   (b)   These provisions shall apply to all lands within the jurisdiction of
the City and shown as being located within the boundaries of the designated
flood plain districts as defined on the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)
maps and which are considered as a part of the official Zoning Map.
   (c)   No structure or land shall hereafter be used and no structure shall be
located, relocated, constructed, reconstructed, enlarged or structurally
altered except in full compliance with the terms and provisions of this article
and any other applicable ordinances and regulations which apply to uses within
the jurisdiction of this article.
   (d)   The degree of flood protection sought by the provisions of this
article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
acceptable engineering methods of study. Larger floods may occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes, such
as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This article does not
imply that areas outside the flood plain districts or that land uses permitted
within such districts will be free from flooding or flood damages.
   (e)   This article shall not create liability on the part of the City or any
officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

Floodway. The channel of a natural stream or river and portions of the
floodplain adjoining the channel, which are reasonably required to carry and
discharge the floodwater or flood flow of any natural stream or river.
Floodway district. Certain areas within the flood plain which must be capable
of carrying the waters of the 100-year flood without increasing the water
surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point.
Floodway, regulatory. The channel and the adjacent land areas that must be
reserved in order to discharge the regulatory base flood without cumulatively
increasing the water surface elevation more than two-tenths of one foot.
Functionally dependent use. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
General Flood Plain District. That flood plain area for which no detailed flood
profiles or elevations have been provided.
Manufactured home. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is
built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For flood plain
management purposes the term "manufactured home" also includes park trailers,
travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than
180 consecutive days. For insurance purposes the term "manufactured home" does
not include park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles.
Manufactured home park or subdivision. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land
divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The Federal program, administered by
the FEMA, which provides flood insurance to local jurisdictions.
One-hundred year flood. A flood that, on the average, is likely to occur once
every 100 years, i.e., that has a one percent (1%) chance of occurring each
year, although the flood may occur in any year.
Start of construction [for other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)]. This
includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation
of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure.
Substantial improvement. Any repair, reconstruction or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the
market value of the structure either:
Before the improvement or repair is started, or
If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage
occurred. For the purposes of this definition "substantial improvement" is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either:
a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing State
or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
b)   Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic
Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
Variance. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a flood plain
management regulation.
1351.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF FLOODPLAIN DISTRICTS.
   (a)   The Flood Plain Districts described below shall be overlays to the
existing underlying districts as shown on the official Zoning Map, and as such,
the provisions for the Flood Plain Districts shall serve as a supplement to the
underlying district provisions.
   (b)   Where there happens to be any conflict between the provisions or
requirements of any of the flood plain districts and those of any underlying
district, the more restrictive provisions and/or those pertaining to the flood
plain districts shall apply.
   (c)   In the event any provision concerning a flood plain district is
declared inapplicable as a result of any legislative or administrative actions
or judicial discretion, the basic underlying district provision shall remain
applicable.
   (d)   The boundaries of the flood plain districts are established as part of
the official Zoning Map of the City, which is declared to be a part of this
article and which shall be kept on file at the City offices.
   (e)   The various flood plain districts shall include areas subject to
inundation by waters of the 100-year flood. The basis for the delineation of
these districts shall be the Flood Insurance Study for the City prepared by the
FEMA and dated February 15, 1984, or any subsequent study:
      (1)   The Floodway District. The areas included in this District are
specifically defined in the Floodway Data Table of the above referenced Flood
Insurance Study and are shown on the accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway
Map.
      (2)   The Flood-Fringe District. The basis for the outermost boundary of
this District shall be the 100-year flood elevations contained in the flood
profiles of the above referenced Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and as shown on
the accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway Map.
      (3)   The General Flood Plain District. These areas are shown on the Maps
accompanying the FIS prepared by FEMA. Where the specific 100-year flood
elevation cannot be determined for this area using other sources of data such
as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Flood Plain Information Reports, U.S.
Geological Survey - Flood Prone Quadrangles, etc. then the applicant for the
proposed use, development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in
accordance with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others
of demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods
used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies,
analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow
a thorough technical review by the City.
   (f)   The delineation of any of the flood plain districts may be revised by
the governing body where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or more
detailed studies are conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual.
These sources shall document the notification of such change. Prior to any such
change, however, approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance
Administrator.
(Ord. 13235. Passed 6-21-06.)
   (g)   Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the flood plain districts
shall be made by the City Engineer. Should a dispute arise concerning the
boundaries of any of the districts, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall make the
necessary determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of
the district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his
case to the Board and to submit his own technical evidence if he so desires.
1351.04 GENERAL PROVISIONS.

1355.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the intent of the off-street parking and loading regulations to
provide for adequate off- street parking spaces to serve residential,
commercial, industrial, institutional and other land uses, and thus help to
prevent congestion of City streets. Proper design of and access to parking
facilities shall be required in order to protect the public health, safety and
welfare, and to bring about the most appropriate and aesthetic use of land.
Furthermore, it is the intent of these regulations to promote the functional
efficiency of all land uses by requiring off-street parking and loading
facilities consistent with modern standards.
1355.02 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   No structure shall hereafter be built or moved, unless the sufficient
off-street parking spaces required by this section are provided.
   (b)   Expansion. Whenever a building or use, constructed or established
after the effective date of this ordinance, is changed or enlarged in floor
area, number of employees, number of dwelling units, seating capacity, or
otherwise to create a need for an increase of ten percent or more in the number
of existing parking spaces, such spaces shall be provided based on the degree
of enlargement or change. Whenever a building or use existing prior to the
effective date of this ordinance is enlarged to the extent of fifty percent or
more in floor area or in the area used, such building or use shall then comply
with the parking requirements set forth herein.
   (c)   Except in the case of dwellings, no parking area provided hereunder
shall be established for less than three spaces.
   (d)   The number of off-street parking spaces required for each use is set
forth in
Table 9-A of this section or by occupancy as determined by the Wheeling Fire
Department based on the NFPA Life Safety Code. For uses not expressly set forth
in
Table 9-A of this section, parking spaces shall be provided on the same basis
as required for the most similar listed use as determined by the Zoning
Administrator. When determinations of the number of accessory off-street
parking spaces required by these regulations result in a requirement of a
fractional space, the fraction of ½ (0.5) or less may be disregarded, and a
fraction in excess of ½ (0.5) shall be counted as one parking space.
   (e)   All permitted and required accessory off-street parking spaces, open
or enclosed, shall be located on the same lot as the use to which such spaces
are accessory, except that such spaces may be provided within a radius of 250
feet from the lot lines. Such spaces shall be in the same ownership as the use
to which they are accessory and shall be subject to deed restrictions filed
with the County, binding the owner and his heirs, successors and assigns to
maintain the required number of spaces available throughout the life of such
use.
   (f)   The parking requirements of this section do not apply to the downtown
zones of D- 1, D-2, and D-3. Parking requirements within the D-1, D-2, and D-
3 districts shall be reviewed and approved on a case by case basis with the
Planning Administrator and the Planning Commission, pursuant to Section
1355.09, Joint or Shared Parking, and subsection (k) hereof, Modifications.
   (g)   Each short-term parking space shall measure nine feet by eighteen
feet. Each long- term parking space shall measure seven and one-half feet by
eighteen feet. In parking areas containing ten or more parking spaces, up to
twenty percent of the parking spaces may contain long-term parking spaces. If
such spaces are provided, they shall be conspicuously designated as reserved
for long-term parking. Short-term parking shall be used by shoppers and
visitors. Long- term parking shall be used for commuters and employees. In
parking areas containing five or more parking spaces, handicapped accessible
spaces shall be provided in accordance with "Uniform Federal Accessibility
Standards."
   (h)   Required accessory off-street parking facilities provided for the uses
hereinafter listed shall be solely for the parking of motor vehicles that are
registered and in operating condition (i.e., drivable), of patrons, occupants,
or employees of such uses.
   (i)   No motor vehicle repair, work or service of any kind shall be
permitted in connection with any non-residential accessory off-street parking
facilities.
   (j)   The Planning Administrator may allow an applicant for new construction
to reserve an unbuilt area for future required parking, if the applicant can
satisfactorily demonstrate that the full amount of required parking will not be
needed until a later phase of the build-out and occupancy program.
   (k)   Modifications. The Planning Commission may authorize a modification,
reduction, or waiver of parking requirements if it should find that the
peculiar nature of the residential, business, trade, industrial, other use,
exceptional situation, or condition would justify such action.
1355.03 LOCATION REQUIREMENTS IN ALL DISTRICTS.
   (a)   No parking stalls or aisles serving such stalls are permitted in
required front yards or within required buffer areas, other than in a legal
driveway used to gain access to a garage, legal carport, underground garage or
identified parking structure.
(Ord. 14387. Passed 11-7-12.)
 
   (b)   Driveways must intersect rights-of-way at right angles, or as closely
as practicable, and may traverse the required front yard.
 
   (c)   All parking areas shall be set back five feet from side and rear
property lines.
 
   (d)   There shall be adequate provision for ingress and egress to all
parking spaces. No access drive or driveway shall be located in any residential
zone to provide access to uses other than those permitted in such zone.
 
   (e)   Off-street parking spaces and structures for multi-family structures
containing four or more dwelling units shall not be located between the
required setback line and right-of-way line. On corner lots, no parking area or
parking structure for such structures shall be located between the side street
right-of-way line and the required front yard setback line for structures on

four-foot wall is constructed around the perimeter of the roof.
(Ord. 12225. Passed 4-17-01; Ord. 14387. Passed 11-7-12.)
1355.04 DESIGN REQUIREMENTS IN ALL DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Entrances and exits to parking areas shall be in a safe and convenient
location with minimal impact on traffic movement on adjacent streets. Adequate
reservoir space for queuing of cars shall be provided. Uses with drive–through
facilities shall provide a minimum of 100 feet in a stacking or queuing lane in
the side or rear yards. Entrances and exits shall not be located within the
required line-of-sight triangle of an intersection or less than 50 feet from
the projected intersecting curb lines. All entrances and exits to parking areas
shall be clearly marked with appropriate directional arrows and traffic signs
as required for traffic control. All parking stalls shall be marked with four-
inch wide lines.
(Ord. 12225. Passed 4-17-01.)
 
   (b)   All off-street parking and vehicular areas shall be curbed with full
depth concrete or granite block and paved or otherwise improved with an all-
weather dustless material, such as a bituminous or Portland cement concrete
pavement or similar surface material approved by the City Engineer. (Ord.
14387. Passed 11-7-12.)
 
   (c)   All parking areas shall be properly screened and landscaped in
accordance with Section
1355.05.
 
   (d)   All off-street parking areas shall be adequately and properly lit as
set forth in Section
1355.08.
 
   (e)   Aisles must be of adequate width for the driver to maneuver a vehicle
into a parking space in one continuous movement. Parking spaces that back-out
directly into a street are prohibited, except for one and two-family dwellings.
 
   (f)   A two-foot landscaped overhang area for any parking stall type may be
provided. The overhang area shall be landscaped and shall have full depth
curbing. The overhang area shall not reduce the clear width of an accessible
route for parking spaces or for walking. Wheelstops shall be provided so that
vehicles are prevented from driving or moving off the paved area or damaging
surrounding fences, walls, or landscaping.
 
   (g)   All parking areas for more than five vehicles shall be marked with
paint lines, curb stones, or in some manner approved by the City Engineer and
shall be maintained in a clearly visible fashion.
 
   (h)   All parking areas shall be arranged and designed to prevent damage to
adjacent fences, walls, plantings and lighting fixtures.
 
   (i)   All driveway or access drive permits and parking area plans shall be

(Ord. 12225. Passed 4-17-01; Ord. 14387. Passed 11-7-12.)
1355.05 REQUIRED LANDSCAPING IN ALL DISTRICTS EXCEPT R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, AND R-2.
   (a)   At least one major deciduous shade tree, not less than two and one-
half inches caliper measured three feet above the ground at the time of
planting, shall be provided within each parking area for every 3,000 square
feet of paved area or every ten parking spaces, whichever is greater. The trees
shall be spaced evenly throughout the lot interior to provide shade and reduce
glare. In all off-street parking areas containing twenty-five or more parking
spaces, at least ten percent of the interior of the parking area shall be
curbed and landscaped with trees, shrubs, and other plants.
   (b)   Raised planting islands at least eight feet in width for double loaded
islands or six feet for single loaded islands shall be provided to guide
vehicle movement and to separate opposing rows of parking spaces so as to
provide adequate space for plant growth, pedestrian circulation, and vehicle
overhang. Such raised planting islands and the landscaping within them shall be
designed and arranged in such a way as to define major circulation aisles,
entrances, and exits, to channel internal traffic flow, to prevent
indiscriminate diagonal movement of vehicles, and to provide relief from the
visual monotony and shadeless expanse of a large parking area.
   (c)   Curbs of such islands shall be designed to facilitate surface drainage
and prevent vehicles from overlapping sidewalks and damaging the plants.
   (d)   All islands and screens (see Section
1355.06) shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs, grasses, and/or ground covers.
The materials selected for the landscaped overhang area must be of suitable
height and hardiness for the size and use of the area. Species selected shall
be tolerant of urban conditions and deicing agents. All new plant materials
shall be consistent and compatible with the existing vegetation of the site and
the surrounding area. Plant materials judged to be inappropriate by the
Planning Administrator or Planning Commission will not be approved.
   (e)   Maintenance and responsibility. All planting shown on an approved site
development plan or special permit plan shall be maintained by the property
owner in a vigorous growing condition throughout the duration of the use.
Plants not so maintained shall be replaced with new plants at the beginning of
the next immediately following growing season.
1355.06 REQUIRED SCREENING IN ALL DISTRICTS EXCEPT R-1A, R-1B, R-1C, AND R-2.
   (a)   All off street parking areas, off street loading areas, outdoor
storage areas, refuse and recycling areas, and utility improvements such as
transformer(s), external heating and cooling equipment shall be effectively
screened.
   (b)   Such screening shall be a permanently maintained landscape of trees
and shrubs. The landscaping shall be designed to minimize erosion and
stormwater runoff, and to protect neighboring residential properties from the
view of uses and parking areas on the site. For landscaping requirements, see
Section
1355.05.
   (c)   The screening shall be along the lot lines that adjoin, abut, or are
adjacent to or face premises situated in any residential zone or institutional
buildings. It shall be of evergreen planting of such type, height, and spacing,
as in the judgment of the Planning Administrator or Planning Commission, will
effectively screen the activities on the lot from the view of persons standing
on adjoining properties. The plan and specifications for such planting shall be
filed with the approved plan for the use of the lot.
   (d)   A wall or fence, of location, height, and design approved by the
Planning Administrator or Planning Commission, may be substituted for the
required planting.
   (e)   Modifications. Where the existing topography and/or landscaping
provides adequate screening or would render the normally required screening
inadequate, the Planning Administrator or Planning Commission may modify the
planting and/or buffer requirements by, respectively, decreasing or increasing
the requirements.
1355.07 LANDSCAPING PLAN SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
   Landscaping plans shall be included with the preliminary site plan and final
site plan submissions and shall consist of the following:
   (a)   Preliminary site plan.
      (1)   A general concept of the landscaping, both in written and graphic
form.
      (2)   A list of existing vegetation, with the location, type, and size of
existing trees.
      (3)   Proposals to preserve and protect existing vegetation during and
after construction.
      (4)   The location of existing natural features, such as streams,
wetlands, and rock outcroppings.
   (b)   Final landscaping plan.
      (1)   All proposed physical improvements, such as buildings, walls,
parking areas, sidewalks, etc.
      (2)   Proposed landscaping materials, including vegetation to remain,
types of new plant materials, identified by common name and botanical name,
sizes of all new plant materials by height and/or diameter, quantities of each
of the planting materials, and treatment of the ground surface (paving,
seeding, or groundcover).
   (c)   Methods for controlling erosion and protecting landscaped areas.
   (d)   A drainage and grading plan. Any off-street parking area and off-
street loading area shall be graded and drained so as to dispose of all surface
water without detriment to surrounding uses. Such plan shall provide for
stormwater and surface water collection, and oil separators within the drainage
basins.
   (e)   An irrigation plan or location of water outlets.
1355.08 EXTERIOR LIGHTING.
   (a)   All exterior lighting in all districts except for R-1A, R-1B, R-1C,
and R-2 and in connection with all nonresidential uses and multi-family uses in
all other residential districts shall be of such a type and location and shall
have such shielding as will direct the light downward and will prevent the
source of light from being visible from any adjacent residential property or
street. “Source of light” shall be deemed to include any transparent or
translucent lighting which is an integral part of the lighting fixture(s). Site
illumination for uncovered areas shall be evenly distributed.
   (b)   Light sources shall comply with the following:
      (1)   The number and spacing of required light pole standards in a
parking lot shall be determined based on the type of fixture, height of pole,
number of fixtures on the pole, and the desired lighting level. Unless the
applicant can demonstrate a reasonable alternative, lighting shall be
considered evenly distributed if the light fixtures are placed at intervals
that equal four times the mounting height.
      (2)   Pole placement, mounting height, and fixture design shall serve to
minimize lighting from becoming a nuisance. All light sources shall be arranged
so as to reflect away from adjacent properties. All light sources shall be
shielded or positioned so as to prevent glare from becoming a hazard or a
nuisance, or having a negative impact on site users, adjacent properties, or
the traveling public. Excessive spillover of light to nearby properties shall
be avoided. Glare shall be minimized to drivers on adjacent streets.
      (3)   Poles shall be rustproof metal, cast iron, fiberglass, finished
wood or similar structural material, with a decorative surface or finish.
      (4)   Poles in pedestrian areas shall not be greater than 15 feet in
height and shall utilize underground wiring.
      (5)   Poles in all other areas shall not exceed 25 feet in height, and
shall utilize underground wiring.
      (6)   Light sources on structures shall not exceed 25 feet, or the height
of the structure, whichever is less.
      (7)   Safe pole locations: Breakaway poles shall not be used in parking
lots. Poles shall not be erected along the outside of roadway and ramp curves
or where vehicles must make sharp turns. Poles shall not be located where they
might be susceptible to collision strikes. Poles located behind longitudinal
traffic barriers shall be offset sufficiently to allow for barrier deflection
under impact.
      (8)   Pole location in parking lots: Pole locations shall be coordinated
with stall and aisle layouts. Where practical, poles shall be near the end of
parking rows or around the perimeter of the lot. When located at parking stall
boundaries, light poles shall be mounted on concrete pedestals. Where raised
medians or islands are used to separate adjacent stalls, light poles shall be
placed in these areas unless pedestrian traffic will be inconvenienced. Where
light poles are placed between parking rows in the interior of the lot, the
poles shall be located on the center line of double rows of parking stalls and
on the center line of two opposing stalls and shall not be placed on the stall
line between cars where fender damage might occur.
1355.09 JOINT OR SHARED PARKING.
   (a)   The number of required off-street parking spaces may be eliminated or
reduced if there exists within 500 feet of the church, synagogue or house of
worship, public or private parking lots containing a sufficient number of off-
street parking spaces to satisfy the requirements of this section. The church,
synagogue or house of worship shall provide the difference if the number of
parking spaces in the private or public lots is below the number required. Any
spaces provided in public or private lots shall be shown to be available for
worshippers on the day or days of greatest use. A written agreement between the
owner of the parking lot and the church, synagogue or house of worship shall be
provided to the Planning Commission.
   (b)   Recognizing that land uses can have different principal operating
hours, the Planning Administrator may approve joint or shared parking when the
nature of the parking demands of two types of uses warrants consideration. Up
to fifty percent of the off-street parking spaces required by this section may
be supplied in connection with another permitted use in close proximity that is
not normally open, used or operated during the principal operating hours of the
second use. A letter to the Planning Administrator is required establishing the
rights of each use in question to the use of such joint parking area so long as
such use exists and is filed with the certificate of Zoning Compliance.
1355.10 MINIMUM NUMBER OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES PER USE.
   (a)   Off-street parking spaces for principal and accessory uses shall be
provided as per
Table 9-A below.
   (b)   Where there is more than one use on a site, the number of required
off-street parking spaces shall be the sum of required parking spaces for each
use.
   (c)   The basis for floor area formulas in
Table 9-A shall be gross floor area. The basis for seating capacity formulas or
space-per-person formulas in
Table 9-A shall be the maximum allowed occupancy of each separate proposed use.

portion of the site's off-street parking requirement.
      (7)   Major truck repair work and/or service of any kind are not allowed
in loading areas.
      (8)   Multi-tenanted structures shall be designed so as to allow access
to all tenants to a common loading area.
   (b)   Location Requirements
      (1)   Loading areas, including accessory trailer parking areas, shall be
allowed only in rear yards. Where this is not possible due to site layout
reasons, such as unsafe or inadequate manueverability, such areas may be
located in the side yard(s).
      (2)   All loading areas or facilities shall be located on the same lot as
the use served.
      (3)   There shall be no loading in a yard abutting a public street.
      (4)   All loading areas shall be located so as to minimize danger of
access to the loading area. No loading area shall be located near an open
ditch.
      (5)   All entrances and exits to loading areas shall be located in a safe
and convenient pattern with minimal impact on traffic movement on adjacent
streets. Entrances and exits shall not be located within the required line-of-
sight triangle of an intersection, nor may they be located within forty feet of
the nearest point of intersection of any two streets or highways.
   (c)   Design Requirements
      (1)   The design of loading areas shall comply with current American
Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) templates.
      (2)   Loading areas may be open to the sky, if located in a rear yard, or
enclosed within a building.
      (3)   All loading areas and their aisles shall be curbed and shall be
fully paved or improved with a compacted select gravel base, not less than
seven inches thick, and surfaced with an all-weather dustless material.
      (4)   Loading areas and their aisles shall be graded, surfaced, drained,
and suitably maintained as required by BOCA/UCC.
      (5)   All loading areas shall be properly screened and landscaped in
accordance with Sections
1355.05,
1355.06 and
1355.07.
      (6)   All loading areas shall be properly lit in accordance with Section
1355.08.
      (7)   General circulation and maneuvering: The circulation and
maneuvering of trucks on site shall comply with established AASHTO turning
point templates or with such other design requirements as may be established
from time to time by the City Engineer.
      (8)   Each loading berth shall be not less than twelve [ten] feet in
width, forty feet in length, and have a minimum clearance of fourteen feet, and
may occupy all or any part of any required yard. Where necessary, a loading
berth of twelve feet by 60 feet may be required.
      (9)   Loading Berth Requirements. The minimum requirements for the number
and size of loading berths are given below in
Table 9-B. The requirements are based on the gross floor area of the building

1359.01 PURPOSE.
   Council hereby declares and determines that it is the purpose of this
article to promote and protect the public health, welfare, and safety by
regulating existing and proposed signs of all types. It is intended that the
adoption of this article will protect property values, create a more attractive
economic and business climate, enhance and protect the physical appearance of
the community and preserve the scenic and natural beauty of designated areas.
It is further intended to reduce sign or advertising distraction and

   (Ord. 12931. Passed 9-21-04.)
1359.04 SIGN AREA AND HEIGHT MEASUREMENT.
   The following principles shall control the computation of sign area and sign
height.
   (a)   Computation of Area of Individual Signs. The area of a sign shall be
measured in conformance with the regulations as herein set forth provided that
the structure or bracing of a sign shall be omitted from measurement unless
such structure or bracing is made part of the message or face of the sign.
Where a sign has two or more display faces, the area of all faces shall be
included in determining the area of the sign.
      (1)   Signs with Backing. The area of all signs with backing or a
background, material or otherwise, that is part of an overall sign display
shall be measured by determining the sum of the areas of each square,
rectangle, triangle, portion of a circle or any combination thereof which
creates the smallest single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits
of the display surface or face of the sign including all frames, backing, face
plates, non-structural trim or other component not otherwise used for support.
      (2)   Signs without Backing. The area of all signs without backing or a
background, material or otherwise, that is a part of the overall sign display
shall be measured by determining the sum of the area of each rectangle,
triangle, portion of a circle or any combination thereof which creates the
smallest single continuous perimeter enclosing the extreme limits of each
written representation, including any series of letters, emblems or figures of
similar character including all frames, emblems or figures of similar character
including all frames, face plates, nonstructural trim or other component parts.
      (3)   All Other Signs or Combinations Thereof. The area of any sign
having parts both with and without backing shall be measured by determining the
total area of all squares, rectangles, triangles, portions of a circle or any
combination thereof constituting the smallest single continuous perimeter
enclosing the extreme limits of any of the following combinations; the display
surface or face of the sign including all frames, backing, face plates,
nonstructural trim or other component parts not otherwise used for support for
parts of the sign that backing and each written representation, including any
series of letters, emblems or figures of a similar character including all
frames, face plates, nonstructural trim or other component parts not otherwise
used for support for parts of the sign having no backing.
   (b)   Multi-faced Signs. No sign shall have more than two faces. The sign
area for a sign with more than one face shall be computed by adding together
the area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign
faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any
point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign
structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be
computed by the measurement of one of the faces.
   (c)   Computation of Maximum Total Permitted Sign Area for a Zone Lot. The
permitted total area of all individual signs on a zone lot, exclusive of on-
site informational signs, shall be governed by Table 9-C, Permitted Signs by
District and Type. Lots fronting on two or more streets are allowed the
permitted sign area for each street frontage. Where frontage is on more than
one street, only the signs computed with the frontage of that street shall face
that street.
      (1)   Window signs. No more than one sign per window and two per business
are permitted. Lettering painted or affixed directly on a display window shall
not exceed six inches in height. If the use’s identification sign is placed
inside a display window, the sign shall not exceed five percent of the total
glass area of the window. Informational signs may be allowed in display
windows. The total area of all window signs shall not exceed fifteen percent or
more than six square feet in area of the glass area on any given facade.
      (2)   Upper story signs. Signs located above the first floor are
permitted. Such signs may be (1) wall signs, or (2) painted on or affixed upon
the interior face of windows and may not exceed 15 percent of the window
surface to which they are applied nor more than six square feet in area.
      (3)   Projecting or hanging signs. The maximum area per sign face shall
be 12 square feet. The top of any such sign shall not extend above or beyond
the window sills of second floor windows or twenty feet from ground level,
whichever is less.
   (d)   Computation of Height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the lower
of (1) existing grade prior to construction, or (2) the newly established grade
after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating
solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases in which the normal grade
cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the
assumption that the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public
street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal
structure on the zone lot, whichever is lower.
   (e)   Maximum allowed height.
      (1)   In residential districts and for residential buildings in
commercial and industrial districts, the maximum allowed height for a sign
shall be 15 feet or one story, whichever is lower.
      (2)   In the EMO district, the maximum allowed height for a sign on non-
residential buildings shall be 20 feet or roof level, whichever is higher.
      (3)   In the C-1 district, the maximum allowed height for a sign on non-
residential buildings shall be 20 feet or roof level, whichever is higher.
      (4)   In the C-2 district, the maximum allowed height for a sign on non-
residential buildings shall be 25 feet or roof level, whichever is higher.
      (5)   In the industrial districts, the maximum allowed height for a sign
on non- residential buildings shall be 25 feet or roof level, whichever is
higher.

with and be subject to the provisions of this article in the zone in which it
is situated.
   (h)   On-Site Informational Signs. Signs commonly associated with and

      (Ord. 15403. Passed 4-21-20.)
1359.08 NONCONFORMING SIGNS AND SIGN STRUCTURES.
   (a)   General. A nonconforming sign or sign structure shall be any sign or
sign structure which, on the effective date of this article, was lawfully
maintained and situated and which would be permitted under this ordinance only
with a sign permit but which sign or sign structure does not conform to the
provisions of this article.
   (b)   Continuance of Nonconforming Signs or Sign Structures.
      (1)   Subject to the termination hereafter provided, any nonconforming
sign or sign structure may be continued in operation and maintained after the
effective date of this article. An existing nonconforming sign, made
nonconforming by adoption of this ordinance, may remain in place and be
maintained provided that no action is taken which increases the degree or
extent of nonconformity. A change in the information on the face of an existing
nonconforming sign is allowed, as detailed in subsection (b)(2) hereof.
However, any nonconforming sign shall be either eliminated or made to conform
with the requirements of this section when any proposed change, repair, or
maintenance would constitute an expense of more than 25 percent of the lesser
of the original value or replacement value of the sign.
      (2)   No such sign or sign structure shall be replaced, enlarged,
extended or structurally altered, except that if the Building Inspector
certifies that the sign structure is safe, secure, well maintained and not in
danger of falling, the face of a nonconforming sign may be changed or replaced
but not enlarged, extended or structurally altered:
         A.   To conform a change in the logo of a business. For purposes of
this subsection, "logo" means the symbol, lettering, mark or illustration,
which identifies the business or service being conducted on the premises;
         B.   To conform to a change in the name of a business where such
change is caused by the order of a judicial or administrative agency of the
State of West Virginia or United States of America;
         C.   To reflect the addition or deletion of members of a business or
professional partnership or corporation;
         D.   To provide for the complete change in any business being
conducted on the premises provided the sign is affixed to a sign structure
which was erected prior to the effective date of this article.
   (c)   Abandonment of a nonconforming sign or sign structure shall terminate
immediately the right to maintain such nonconforming sign or sign structure,
and such sign or sign structure shall be considered abandoned when the business
which it advertises is no longer conducted on the premises or when such sign
structure is damaged or destroyed or becomes unsafe or a hazard to the public.
1359.09 SIGN REMOVAL REQUIRED.
   (a)   A sign or sign structure that was constructed, painted, installed, or
maintained in conformance with a permit under this ordinance, but for which the
permit has lapsed or not been renewed or for which the time allowed for the
continuance of a nonconforming sign has expired, or has for any reason been
abandoned shall be removed by the person responsible for the sign or sign
structure upon written notice, by certified mail, from the Zoning Officer, and
in any case within ten days of the date of such notice. After which time the
Zoning Officer may cause the sign or sign structure to be removed at the
expense of the person responsible for the sign or sign structure without
further notice from or action by the City. Such sign or sign structure, once
removed, if not claimed by the owner with ten (10) days of removal, may be
destroyed.
   (b)   Any sign erected without a permit or not in conformity with Article
1359 or any other general provision applicable to this Planning and Zoning
Code, shall be subject to immediate removal by the City of Wheeling or its
agents, at the expense of the person responsible for the sign or sign
structure. Such sign or sign structure, once removed, if not claimed by the
owner within ten (10) days of removal, may be destroyed.
(Ord. 12933. Passed 9-21-04.)
1359.10 SIGNS PROHIBITED UNDER THIS ORDINANCE.

1359.11 OFF-PREMISE SIGNS.
   (a)   Purpose and scope. It is recognized that signs perform important
functions in identifying businesses and in general advertising. The City of
Wheeling wishes to preserve and enhance traffic safety, property values, and
the good aesthetics of the municipality, and therefore regulates off-premise
(also known as billboards or outdoor advertising signs) as detailed below.
   (b)   General Regulations.
      (1)   No structure supporting an off-premise sign shall be located on a
platted or otherwise legally separate lot where there exists a structure
housing another principal permitted use.
      (2)   Off-premise signs are principal permitted uses. They are not
accessory uses.
      (3)   Maximum area. The display area of an off-premise sign shall not be
less than 200 square feet nor greater than 672 square feet per side exclusive
of cut-outs and extensions which may occupy an additional 100 square feet; two
off-premise signs erected one above the other shall be treated as one sign in
respect to maximum allowable square footage.
   (c)   Location.
      (1)   Off-premise signs shall only be located in the following zoning
districts: C- 2 General Commercial Zone, D-1 Downtown High Density Zone, D-
2 Downtown Medium Density Zone, I-1 Light Industrial Zone, and I-2 General
Industrial Zone. Sign applicants are reminded that off-premise signs are deemed
principal uses, not accessory uses.
      (2)   In the D-1 Downtown High Density District and D-2 Downtown Medium
Density District, one off-premise sign shall be permitted for each 1,000 linear
feet of street within the D-1 and D-2 districts, measured along the centerline
of the street. The maximum allowed number of off-premise signs permitted along
each street shall be determined by the length of that street. Such permitted
number of off-premise signs may be clustered or spaced at any distance along
that street.
      (3)   No off-premise sign, including its structure, shall be attached to
or located on any building.
      (4)   No off-premise sign shall be closer than 1,000 feet to another off-
premise sign. This 1,000 feet shall be measured radially.
      (5)   No off-premise sign shall be located within seventy-five feet of
any residential zone, residence structure that is occupied as a residence,
school, church, hospital or similar institution, cemetery, or public park or
public playground.
      (6)   No off-premise sign shall be attached to any tree, fence, or
utility pole or be painted on, affixed, or otherwise attached to any rock,
ledge, or other natural feature.
      (7)   No off-premise sign shall be located so as to obscure any signs
displayed by public authority.
      (8)   No off-premise sign shall be so located as to obscure the view of
any connecting road or intersection, or be placed in such a way as to obstruct
proper sight distance or otherwise interfere with pedestrian or traffic flow.
      (9)   No off-premise sign shall hinder the clear unobstructed view of any
approaching or merging traffic, or obscure from view any traffic sign or other
official sign.
      (10)   Off-premise signs, displays and devices may be erected or
maintained within 660 feet of the right-of-way and visible as to informative
content from the right-of-way of any road within the State of West Virginia
road system designated and classified or redesignated or reclassified for
purposes of allocation of federal highway funds as part of the federal aid
interstate or primary systems.
      (11)   An off-premise sign shall be located within 100 feet of the road,
street, or highway to which the sign is intended to be visible.
   (d)   Type, Design, and Illumination
      (1)   Back-to-back or V-Type signs will be permitted and shall be treated
as one sign provided that the interior angle between the two signs does not
exceed sixty degrees.
(Ord. 12225. Passed 4-17-01.)
      (2)   No advertising sign shall be erected or maintained which involves
rapid motion or rotation of the structure or any part thereof with the
following exceptions: Changeable Message Signs (CMS) and Smartboard Technology
Signs are permitted as defined in Section
1359.03(f) of this code.
      (3)   No advertising sign shall contain lighting that is not shielded,
and any lighting shall be of such low intensity as not to cause glare or impair
the vision of the operator of any motor vehicle.
      (4)   No advertising display or device shall be illuminated by any rapid
flashing, intermittent light or lights.
   (e)   Height. The height limitation for buildings in the zone in which an
outdoor advertising sign is located shall also apply to such sign. The height
shall be measured from the highest road level from which the sign is to be
viewed.
   (f)   Content. The regulations contained in this section only apply to those
outdoor advertising signs, displays, devices and billboards which direct
attention to a business, commodity, service, entertainment or other activity
conducted, sold or offered elsewhere than on the zoning lot on which the sign,
display, device or billboard is located. Commercial and non-commercial messages
are included under these regulations.
      (1)    No advertising display or device shall use the word "stop" or
"danger," or present or imply the need or requirement of stopping, or the
existence of danger.
      (2)   No advertising sign, display or device shall be a copy of or
imitate a traffic sign or other official sign.
      (3)   No advertising display or device shall attempt or purport to direct
traffic.
   (g)   Time Limit. If a sign for which a zoning permit has been issued is not
erected within six months of the date of approval, the permit shall become
void.
(Ord. 22225. Passed 4-17-01.)
   (h)   Replacement. A sign structure, whether legal non-conforming or
conforming may be improved, repaired or replaced provided that the new improved
or repaired structure does not increase the sign or advertising structure area
of the previous sign and complies with all applicable regulations for off-
premise signs contained in this section. This section is intended to include
maintenance necessary to restore an existing structure to a safe condition or
the repair of a sign damaged. In case of an accident or act of nature, repairs
must be made within 90 days of the damage to the sign.
(Ord. 12934. Passed 9-21-04.)
   (i)   Abandonment. Sections
1359.08 and
1359.09 regulate off-premise signs that are non-conforming, are abandoned, or
have a lapsed nonconforming sign permit, and regulate the removal of signs not
in conformance with this article.
   (j)   In addition to conforming to city law, all outdoor advertising signs
shall conform to West Virginia state law regarding outdoor advertising control.

1361.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this ordinance to regulate adult establishments in
order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the
City, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
deleterious secondary effects of adult establishments within the City. The
provisions of this ordinance have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a
limitation or restriction on the content or reasonable access to any
communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it
is neither the intent nor effect of this ordinance to restrict or deny access
by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or
to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
(Ord. 14993. Passed 8-15-17.)
1361.02  FINDINGS AND RATIONALE.
   (a)   Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of adult uses
presented in hearings and in reports made available to Council, and on
findings, interpretations, and narrowing constructions incorporated in various
cases and based upon reports concerning secondary effects occurring in and
around adult establishments, which documents have been received by City Council
in the report of the Planning Commission and are incorporated herein by
reference.
   (b)   Council finds:
      (1)    Adult establishments, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to, personal and property crimes, human trafficking, prostitution,
potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit
drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties,
urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (2)    Adult establishments should be separated from sensitive land uses
to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses, and should be
separated from other adult establishments, to minimize the secondary effects
associated with such uses and to prevent an unnecessary concentration of adult
establishments in one area.
      (3)    Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a
harm which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating. This substantial government interest in preventing secondary effects,
which is the City's rationale for this ordinance, exists independent of any
comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-sexually oriented
businesses. Additionally, the City's interest in regulating adult
establishments extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current
or future adult establishments that may locate in the City. The City finds that
the cases and documentation relied on in this ordinance are reasonably believed
to be relevant to said secondary effects.
   (c)   The City hereby adopts and incorporates herein its stated findings and
legislative record related to the adverse secondary effects of adult
establishments, including the judicial opinions and reports related to such
secondary effects.
(Ord. 14993. Passed 8-15-17.)

and of significant benefit to the City and its residents. In order to ensure
that the placement, construction or modification of Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities is consistent with the City's land use policies, the City is
adopting a single, comprehensive, Wireless Telecommunications Facilities
application and permit process.
      
   (b)   The intent of this local Ordinance includes and does not exclude
implicitly or otherwise, the requirement for wireless facilities to comply with
this Ordinance as regards ongoing occupancy or use of a public way or right of
way.
   (c)   The intent of this Local Ordinance is to minimize impact of Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities, establish a fair and efficient process for
review and approval of applications, assure an integrated, comprehensive review
of environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety and
welfare of the City of Wheeling.

and individual regulation of uses.
   (b)   STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS. All such uses are declared to possess
characteristics of such unique and special form that each specific use must be
considered as an individual case. Consideration by the Planning Commission
shall be based on adopted standards and requirements. These considerations
shall be both general, applying to all special uses, and specific, applying to
individual types of special uses. The standards and requirements stipulated in
this article shall be made a condition of approval. In addition, the Planning
Commission may impose other pertinent conditions to fit the particular use and
site under review.
1371.02 DEFINITION OF SPECIAL USE AND SPECIAL USE PERMIT.
   (a)   DEFINITION OF TERM. As used in this section, any use designated in a
given district as requiring a special use permit shall be deemed to be a
permitted use in such district, subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
and standards set forth in this article in addition to all other requirements
of this chapter. The term special use permit shall mean an authorization of a
particular land use which is permitted in its respective district, subject to
the satisfaction of all requirements and standards imposed by this section.
These requirements shall assure that the proposed use is in harmony with local
law and will not adversely affect the neighborhood if such requirements are
met.
   (b)   LIMITS OF AUTHORIZATION. A special use permit shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use specified in the permit.
1371.03 APPROVAL OF SPECIAL USE PERMITS.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall have the power, after public notice and
hearing, to grant special use permits for the uses specified within this
article.
   (b)   All special use permit applications are subject to Article
1373, Site Plan Review. The Planning Commission shall grant final site plan
approval in the case of special use permit applications.
1371.04 INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROCEDURES.
   Whenever a particular application requires both the consideration of a
special use permit and site plan review, the Planning Commission shall
integrate to the extent practicable and consistent with applicable law special
use permit review, as required by this article, with the site plan review and
approval process. Where site plan review is required, the site plan application
shall demonstrate that it meets all special permit provisions of this article
and must show any other information that the Planning Commission may require as
necessary. See Article
1373, Site Plan Review.
1371.05 REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS.
   (a)   SPECIAL USE PERMIT APPLICATION PROCEDURE. The Planning Commission
shall review and act on all special permit uses in accordance with the
procedure specified herein.

regulations, and forms established by the Planning Commission and administered
by the Economic and Community Development Department. Application for a special
use permit shall be made in writing to the Economic and Community Development
Department, which shall forward the application to the Planning Commission for
action when such application is complete. Within thirty calendar days of
receipt of the application, the Economic and Community Development Department
shall determine whether said application is complete or deficient. No
application shall be accepted by the Planning Commission unless it is complete.
   (c)   To be deemed complete, the special use permit application shall,

Planning Commission to explain the nature of the proposed use and its
consistency with the standards established by this article for special permit
uses.
   (d)   FEE. Payment of the applicable fee in accordance with the fee schedule
established by the City Council, to pay for the costs of planning, design, and
engineering review. The City Council shall adopt, by resolution, and from time

applicant for applications brought before all boards and commissions for
determination or action. No application shall be accepted as complete unless
the full fee has been paid.
   (e)   DECISION. Within thirty calendar days of receipt of the complete
application, the Planning Commission shall determine if the application is

and extent of landscaping on the site.
      (4)   Neighborhood character and surrounding property values shall be
reasonably safeguarded.
      (5)   Operations in connection with the use shall not be offensive,
dangerous, destructive of property values and basic environmental
characteristics, or detrimental to the public interest of the village. They
shall not be more objectionable to nearby properties by reason of fumes, noise,

than the operations of any permitted use not requiring a special use permit in
the district.
      (6)   Parking areas shall be of adequate size for the particular use,
properly located, and suitably screened at all seasons of the year from
adjoining residential lots and streets or roadways. Adequate provision for safe

      (10)   The use shall be appropriately located with respect to
transportation facilities, water supply, fire and police protection, waste
disposal, and similar facilities and services. All proposed buildings,
structures, equipment and/or material shall be readily accessible for fire and
police protection.
      (11)   The character and appearance of the proposed use, buildings,
structures, and/or outdoor signs shall be in general harmony with the character
and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood.
      (12)   The use shall meet the prescribed area and bulk requirements for
the district in which located or as further specified in the supplementary
regulations, including such matters as minimum setback, maximum height,
required off- street parking, and sign regulations.
      (13)   The level of services required to support the proposed activity or
use is or will be available to meet the needs of the proposed activity or use.
This consideration shall include the suitability of water supply and sanitary
sewage facilities, whether private or publicly provided, to accommodate the
intended use.
      (14)   The use shall be carried out in a manner compatible with its
environmental setting and with due consideration to the protection of natural
resources.

restrictions as may be necessary to assure continual conformance to all permit
provisions.
   (c)   WAIVER OF CONDITIONS AND RESTRICTIONS.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may waive any dimensional or other
requirement for the approval or approval with modifications of special use
permits, due to special conditions peculiar to the site. Such waiver may be
exercised in the event a requirement is found to be inappropriate or
unnecessary or that strict compliance with said requirements may cause
extraordinary and unnecessary hardship. The Planning Commission may waive said
requirements by up to ten percent wherever, in the opinion of the Planning
Commission, such waiver will not be detrimental to the public health, safety,
or general welfare or have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of
this article.
      (2)   The terms and conditions of a special use permit may be modified by
application to the Planning Commission in the same manner as an application for
a new special use permit. In the event that the modification sought is deemed
insubstantial by the Planning Commission, the Commission may waive one or more
of the requirements of this section. If the modification is deemed substantial,
a new special use permit shall be required.
   (d)   ISSUANCE OF PERMIT. Upon its granting of said special use permit, any
required terms and conditions must be met in connection with the issuance of
permits by applicable agents or officers of the city. The Building Inspector
shall not issue the permit for which the application has been made until
receipt of written permit approval from the Planning Commission.
1371.07 PUBLIC HEARING.
   (a)   The Planning Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the special
use permit application.
   (b)   Upon the Planning Commission’ determination that the special use
permit application is complete and satisfactory for review, a public hearing

circulation in the city, shall mail notice of said hearing to the applicant,
and shall mail notice of said hearing to all property owners within two hundred
feet of the subject property.
   (c)   Based on the public hearing, the Planning Commission may require the
application to be revised, referring the applicant back to the Economic and
Community Development Department. Such a referred application shall be
submitted to the Economic and Community Development Department for its review
and advice once the application has been revised to meet the Commission's
recommendations. The Planning Department shall then forward the revised
application to the Planning Commission for decision and action. If a referred
application is not received by the Planning Department within sixty calendar
days after the public hearing, the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn.
   (d)   The city shall charge the applicant either a flat rate or a stated
amount per notice for satisfying this requirement.
   (e)   The names and addresses of owners notified shall be taken as such
appear on the last completed tax roll of the city.
   (f)   Provided that there has been substantial compliance with these
provisions, the failure to give notice in exact conformance herewith shall not
be deemed to invalidate an action taken by the Planning Commission in
connection with granting or denying a special permit application.
1371.08 PLANNING COMMISSION ACTION.
   ACTION BY RESOLUTION.
   (a)   Within thirty calendar days after the public hearing or after a
revised application has been submitted to the Planning Commission, the Planning
Commission shall render a written decision. This time period may be extended
upon the mutual consent of the Planning Commission and the applicant.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall act to either approve, approve with
modifications, or disapprove the special use permit application. The decision
shall be made by resolution and shall clearly state the decision, including the
findings, and any conditions attached thereto. If the special use permit is
disapproved, the Planning Commission’ resolution shall state specific reasons
for such decision. In such a case, the Planning Commission may recommend
further study of the special use permit application and resubmission to the
Planning Commission after it has been revised or redesigned.
   (c)   Filing of decision and notice. Within five business days after the day
such decision is rendered, a certified or endorsed copy of the decision shall
be filed in the office of the City Clerk.
1371.09 EFFECT OF SPECIAL PERMIT APPROVAL.
   (a)   ISSUANCE OF BUILDING PERMIT. In addition to compliance with all other
applicable provisions of this chapter and all other local, county and state
laws, rules and regulations, no building permit shall be issued for any
structure regulated by this article until such special use permit, and site
plan approval if needed, have received Planning Commission approval and a copy
of a resolution to that effect has been presented to the Economic and Community
Development Department and Building Department.
   (b)   CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued
for any structure or use of land covered by this chapter until the structure is
completed or the land developed in strict accordance with the Planning
Commission resolution of special use permit approval and other applicable
requirements of this chapter.
   (c)   CONFORMING USE. Any use for which a special use permit may be granted
shall be deemed a conforming use in the zoning district in which it is located,
provided that such special use permit shall be deemed to affect only the lot or
portion thereof for which such special use permit has been granted.
1371.10 VIOLATION, EXPIRATION, REVOCATION, INSPECTION, CHANGE, AND RENEWAL.
   (a)   VIOLATION. No permit shall be issued for a special use for a property
or site upon which there is an existing violation of this or any other chapter
of the City of Wheeling code.
   (b)   EXPIRATION OF SPECIAL USE PERMIT.
      (1)   A special use permit shall be void if construction is not started
within one year and completed within two years of the date of issuance of the
special use permit. Such special permit approval may be extended once for a
maximum period of one year from its otherwise specified termination date by the
Planning Commission upon prior written request by the applicant. Such written
request must include a statement of justification for the requested time
extension. If a special permit expires or is revoked for a particular phase of
a special use project, this shall not invalidate any previously granted special
permit on the site, provided that construction under such previous permit was
completed in accord with the above timeframes.
      (2)   If no construction is involved, a special use permit shall be void
if the use has not commenced within six months of final special permit
approval.
      (3)   Unless other provisions are specifically set forth by the Planning
Commission, the special permit shall expire if said use shall substantially or
totally cease for a period of six months during any twelve-month period,
irrespective of whether an intent to cease such use may exist. Intent to resume
the special use shall not confer the right to do so.
      (4)   In the case where subsequent site plan review and approval or the
issuance of a building permit is required, vesting of the special use permit
may occur through submission within the specified time period of a complete
application for either required site plan approval or the issuance of a
building permit to carry out all work governed by the special use permit.
   (c)   REVOCATION. In all cases, including those cited above, a special use
permit may be revoked by the Planning Commission, if it is found and determined
that there has been a substantial failure to comply with any of the terms,
conditions, limitations, restrictions, standards, and requirements imposed by
said permit. The Building Inspector shall make a recommendation to the Planning
Commission when a special use permit should be revoked. In such cases, the
special permit holder shall be granted a period of sixty calendar days from the
day following the Building Inspector's recommendation to bring the special use
into full compliance. At the close of the sixty-day period, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing. After the public hearing and upon
specific determination by the Planning Commission that such conditions as may
have been prescribed in conjunction with the issuance of the original permit
have not been or are no longer being complied with, the Commission may revoke
the permit.
   (d)   INSPECTION. In connection with the issuance of a special permit, the
Planning Commission may establish a schedule of inspections by the Building
Department of a special permit use to determine continued compliance.
   (e)   CHANGE.
      (1)   Any change in the use or reduction in lot size shall require
amendment to the special permit, following the application and review
requirements of this article. However, the Building Inspector may issue
building permits as requested without amendment of the special permit where he/
she finds that:
      (2)   There is no change in the use or that the use proposed falls within
the definition of the existing special permit use, and that
      (3)   The change would require fewer than five parking spaces; however,
      (4)   Notwithstanding the above, the Building Inspector may require that
application be made for amendment to the special permit where he/she finds that
the proposed change will be a significant change in the essential
characteristics of the existing layout, arrangement, or use of buildings or
land.
   (f)   RENEWAL. The Planning Commission may require in its resolution of
approval that a special use permit be renewed periodically. On written
application by the permit holder, a special permit may be renewed by the
Building Inspector upon notice to the Planning Commission, provided that no
such renewal shall be made unless there has been substantial compliance with
all applicable codes, ordinances, regulations, and conditions of the special
permit and this chapter. The Building Inspector shall notify in writing the
Planning Commission forty-five calendar days prior to the effective date of
such renewal. If the Building Inspector recommends that the permit not be
renewed, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing. Renewal may be
withheld only after the public hearing and upon specific determination by the
Planning Commission that such conditions as may have been prescribed in
conjunction with the issuance of the original permit have not been or are no
longer being complied with. In all cases, including those cited above, a
special use permit may be revoked by the Planning Commission, if it is found
and determined that there has been a substantial failure to comply with any of
the terms, conditions, limitations, restrictions, standards, and requirements
imposed by said permit. The Building Inspector shall make a recommendation to
the Planning Commission when a special use permit should be revoked. See above
for revocation procedures.

reimbursable costs shall be in addition to the required application fee.
Maximum amounts for such reimbursable costs by project type and size shall be

schedule shall include the requirement that an escrow account be established
upon the Planning Department's receipt of the application to cover the
anticipated costs of such consultant review and other expenses.

1371.25 EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY / MINERAL EXTRACTION.
   An "extractive industry use" involves the extraction of minerals, including
solids, such as coal and ores; liquids, such as crude petroleum; and gasses,
such as natural gasses. In addition to the required Performance and Development
Standards outlined in Section
1343.05 and
 1343.06, extractive industry uses shall conform to the following performance
standards:
   (a)   External Setbacks. When reviewing an application to operate an
extractive industry, consideration shall be given to the proposed site's
external boundary proximity to residential zoning districts as it relates to
impact from noise, traffic, particulate matter, blasting, runoff and other
secondary effects. The Commission shall give particular emphasis to the
evaluation of the characteristics of the proposed use in relationship to its
immediate neighborhood and the compatibility of the proposed use with its
neighborhood. Therefore, minimum distance from the external boundary of the
proposed site to any residentially zoned property shall be 750 feet measured in
a straight line without regard to intervening structures or objects. The
Commission may waive or reduce this distance if it finds the nature of the
request or other specific distinctions would eliminate the impact on the
residentially zoned property that is within 750 feet of the proposed site and
if the proposed use is consistent with the policies and objectives of the
Comprehensive Plan, the effect on traffic, storm drainage, and land values
   (b)   Site Restoration. Within six months following the abandonment of an
extractive industry development site, including permanent well plugging, the
operator shall be responsible for the restoration of the development site to
its original condition as nearly as practicable. Abandonment shall be approved
by the City Engineer after restoration of the development site has been
accomplished in conformity with the following requirements at the discretion of
the City Engineer:
      (1)   All production, derricks, tanks, towers, and other appurtenant
surface equipment and installations shall be removed from the development site.
      (2)   All concrete foundations, piping, wood, guy anchors and other
foreign materials regardless of depth, except surface casing, shall be removed
from the development site, unless otherwise directed by the City.
      (3)   All holes and depressions shall be filled with clean, compactable
soil.
      (4)   All waste, refuse or waste material shall be removed from the
development site.
   (c)   Supplementary Regulations.
      (1)   There shall be one principal entrance to the industrial site from
any major thoroughfare bordering the tract, which shall be designed so that
traffic at its intersection with the major thoroughfare may be controlled and
so that there will be adequate storage space for traffic destined to enter the
thoroughfare or to leave the industrial site.
      (2)   There shall be no direct entrances or exits from parking areas or
structures onto the adjoining major thoroughfare, but a service drive parallel
to the main traffic-way may be provided for such access. Traffic on the service
drive shall enter the main traffic-way via the principal entry.
      (3)   The owner or owners shall provide a plan for the installation of
adequate facilities for the disposal of human and industrial wastes meeting the
approval of the State Department of Health.
      (4)   The owner or owners of the site shall establish in the
restrictions, which are a part of site plan, a perpetuating organization for
the maintenance of the industrial site, such as roads and planting areas, the

of the site.
   (d)   Perimeter Landscaping and Fencing. For the purpose of screening,
buffering, and security, the following improvements shall be installed within
thirty days after commencement of development.
      (1)   Landscaping. Where a heavy industry, heavy manufacturing, or
extractive industry development site abuts a nonindustrial property (zoned or
used) or public or private street, a thirty-foot landscaping transitional yard
shall be installed the length of said common border as follows:
         A.   A ten-foot-wide exterior landscaping transition area containing
three to four medium to large trees and fifteen to twenty evergreen shrubs per

containing parallel, staggered and/or concentric rows of evergreen trees or
evergreen hedge planted eight to twelve feet on center per 100 linear feet.
         C.   Trees shall have a minimum two-inch caliper and shrubs shall be
at least three gallons in size.
      (2)   Fencing. A minimum ten-foot black, green or brown vinyl-coated
chain link fence must be erected the entire perimeter of a heavy industry,
heavy manufacturing, or extractive industry development site between the
landscaping transitional yards and the development site. Prominently displayed
no trespassing signs are required on all four or more sides of the perimeter
fencing.
      (3)   Entrance gate specifications. All perimeter fences shall be
equipped with at least one entrance gate. The gate shall meet the following

   Authority to Adopt procedures and requirements for conditional use permits
1372.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to recognize that there
may be cases where community and Comprehensive Plan goals are met by a flexible
and individual regulation of land uses on a specific property. The
establishment of a conditional use permit procedure provides City of Wheeling
with such flexible and individual regulation of uses. This Article’s provisions
may not be used to convert a residential structure in a Residential Zoning
District when a more appropriate process such as a Zoning Amendment request is
otherwise prescribed.
   (b)    Standards and Requirements. All such uses are declared to possess
characteristics of such unique and special form that each specific use must be
considered as an individual case. Consideration by the Board of Zoning Appeals
(hereinafter BZA) shall be based on adopted standards and requirements. These
considerations shall be both general, applying to all conditional uses, and
specific, applying to individual types of conditional uses. The standards and
requirements stipulated in this article shall be made a condition of approval.
In addition, the BZA may impose other pertinent conditions to fit the
particular use and site under review.
(Ord. 13707. Passed 11-18-08.)
1372.02 DEFINITION OF CONDITIONAL USE AND CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT.
   (a)    Definition of Term. The term conditional use permit shall mean an
authorization of a particular land use, subject to the satisfaction of all
requirements and standards imposed by this section. These requirements shall
assure that the proposed use is in harmony with local law and will not
adversely affect the neighborhood if such requirements are met. Such
conditional use permit, if granted, shall be deemed to affect only the lot or
portion thereof for which such conditional use permit has been granted and only
for the particular applicant that sought the conditional use in effect.
   (b)    Limits of Authorization. A conditional use permit shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use specified in the permit to the specific
property.
(Ord. 13707. Passed 11-18-08.)
1372.03 APPROVAL OF CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   (a)    The BZA shall have the power, after public notice and hearing, to
grant conditional use permits.
   (b)    A conditional use permit application may be subject to Article
1373, Site Plan Review depending upon various factors such as expansion of
parking on the site where the conditional use is proposed. Should a Site Plan
Review be needed, then the Planning Commission shall grant final site plan
approval.
(Ord. 13707. Passed 11-18-08.)
1372.04 INTEGRATION WITH OTHER PROCEDURES.
   Whenever a particular application requires both the consideration of a
conditional use permit and site plan review, the Planning Commission and the
BZA shall integrate to the extent practicable and consistent with applicable
law conditional use permit review, as required by this article, with the site
plan review and approval process. Where site plan review is required, the site
plan application shall demonstrate that it meets all conditional permit
provisions of this article and must show any other information that the
Planning Commission may require as necessary. See Article
1373, Site Plan Review.
(Ord. 13707. Passed 11-18-08.)
1372.05  REQUIRED SUBMISSIONS.

act on all conditional permit uses in accordance with the procedure specified
herein.
   (b)    Application. All applications shall be in writing, according to
rules, regulations, and forms established by the BZA and administered by the
Economic and Community Development Department. Application for a conditional
use permit shall be made in writing to the Economic and Community Development
Department, which shall forward the application to the BZA for action when such
application is complete. No application shall be accepted by the BZA unless it
is complete.
   (c)    To be deemed complete, the conditional use permit application should
incorporate to the extent necessary, except as may be waived by the BZA on a
case-by-case basis due to the minor nature of the specific request, include the
items below.
A plot plan which demonstrates the overall site layout and building locations,
parking areas and circulation, access and egress locations, setbacks and buffer
areas, lighting, landscaping, signage and the location and extent of existing
development on adjacent parcels.

alteration, including an indication of exterior materials, textures and colors.
Any other information deemed helpful by the applicant or necessary by the BZA
to explain the nature of the proposed use and its consistency with the
standards established by this article for special permit uses.
   (d)    Fee. Payment of the applicable fee in accordance with the fee
schedule established by the City Council, to pay for the costs of planning,
design, and engineering review. The City Council shall adopt, by resolution,
and from time to time but not more than once annually, a schedule of fees
payable by an applicant for applications brought before all boards and
commissions for determination or action. No application shall be accepted as
complete unless the full fee has been paid.
   (e)   Decision. Within thirty calendar days of receipt of the complete
application, the BZA shall determine if the application is complete and
satisfactory for review.

conducted in connection with such use, the size of the site in relation to the
use, the assembly of persons in connection with the use, and the location of
the site with respect to streets giving access to the site.
      (4)   The proposed conditional use shall be such that the use will not
hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and
buildings, taking into consideration the location and nature of the use the
architecture of the building where the use is proposed in relation to
surrounding structures or greenspace, the location, nature, and height of walls
and fences, and the nature and extent of landscaping on the site.
      (5)   Neighborhood character and surrounding property values shall be
reasonably safeguarded.
      (6)   Operations in connection with the use shall not be offensive,
dangerous, destructive of property values and basic environmental
characteristics, or detrimental to the public interest of the City. They shall
not be more objectionable to nearby properties by reason of fumes, noise,
vibration, flashing of or glare from lights, and similar nuisance conditions
than the operations of any permitted use not requiring a conditional use permit
in the district.
      (7)   Parking areas should be of adequate size for the particular use,
properly located, and suitably screened at all seasons of the year from
adjoining residential lots and streets or roadways. Adequate provision for safe
and accessible off-street parking and loading spaces should be provided to
address the parking in public streets of the vehicles of persons associated
with or visiting the use.
      (8)   The entrance and exit drives shall be adequate as to satisfy
concerns of public safety and efficient use of the property.
      (9)   The use shall not cause undue traffic congestion or create a
traffic hazard.
      (10)   The general landscaping of the site shall be in character with
that generally prevailing in the neighborhood. Such landscaping shall include
the preservation of existing trees to the extent practicable.
      (11)   The proposed use must be appropriately located with respect to
fire and police protection, waste disposal, and similar facilities and
services, depending upon the nature of the conditional use.
      (12)   The character and appearance of the proposed use, buildings,
structures, and/or outdoor signs shall be in general harmony with the character
and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood.
      (13)   The use shall make a good faith effort to meet the prescribed
requirements for the district in which located or as further specified in the
supplementary regulations for such matters as required off- street parking, and
sign regulations. These requirements may be evaluated by the BZA on a case- by-
case basis or by a request for a variance from the BZA.
      (14)   The level of services required to support the proposed activity or
use is or will be available to meet the needs of the proposed activity or use.
This consideration shall include the suitability of water supply and sanitary
sewage facilities, whether private or publicly provided, to accommodate the
intended use.
      (15)   The use shall be carried out in a manner compatible with its
environmental setting and with due consideration to the protection of natural

   (c)   Waiver of Conditions and Restrictions.
      (1)   The BZA may waive any dimensional or other requirement for the
approval or approval with modifications of conditional use permits, due to
special conditions peculiar to the site. Such waiver may be exercised in the
event a requirement is found to be inappropriate or unnecessary or that strict
compliance with said requirements may cause extraordinary and unnecessary
hardship. The BZA may waive said requirements wherever, in the opinion of the
BZA, such waiver will not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or
general welfare or have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this
article.
      (2)   The terms and conditions of a conditional use permit may be
modified by application to the BZA in the same manner as an application for a
new conditional use permit. In the event that the modification sought is deemed
insubstantial by the BZA, the Board may waive one or more of the requirements
of this section. If the modification is deemed substantial, a new conditional
use permit shall be required.
   (d)   Issuance of Permit. Upon its granting of said conditional use permit,
any required terms and conditions must be met in connection with the issuance
of permits by applicable agents or officers of the city. The Building Inspector
shall not issue the permit for which the application has been made until
receipt of written permit approval from the BZA.
   (e)   Conditional Use Permits - Specific to the Applicant. The conditions
placed upon an application for a conditional use expire if the original

Department. Such a referred application shall be submitted to the Economic and
Community Development Department for its review and advice once the application
has been revised to meet the Board's recommendations. The Economic and
Community Development Department shall then forward the revised application to
the BZA for decision and action. If a referred application is not received by
the Economic and Community Development Department within sixty calendar days
after the public hearing, the application shall be deemed to be withdrawn.
   (d)   The City shall charge the applicant either a flat rate or a stated
amount per notice for satisfying this requirement.
   (e)   The names and addresses of owners notified shall be taken as such
appear on the last completed tax roll of the City.
   (f)   Provided that there has been substantial compliance with these
provisions, the failure to give notice in exact conformance herewith shall not
be deemed to invalidate an action taken by the BZA in connection with granting
or denying a special permit application.
(Ord. 13707. Passed 11-18-08.)
1372.08  BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS ACTION.
   (a)    After the public hearing or after a revised application has been

the BZA may recommend further study of the conditional use permit application
and resubmission to the BZA after it has been revised.
   (c)    Filing of decision and notice. The decision shall be deemed entered
at the meeting wherein the minutes reflecting the outcome of the public hearing
and the final decision of the BZA are accepted. A certified or endorsed copy of

(Ord. 13707. Passed 11-18-08.)
1372.09 EFFECT OF CONDITIONAL PERMIT APPROVAL.
   (a)    Issuance of Building Permit.  In addition to compliance with all
other applicable provisions of this chapter and all other local, county and

that effect has been presented to the Economic and Community Development
Department and Building Department.
   (b)    Certificate of Occupancy.  No certificate of occupancy shall be

chapter of the City of Wheeling code.
   (b)   Expiration of Conditional Use Permit.

started within six months and completed within one year of the date of issuance
of the conditional use permit. Such conditional use permit approval may be
extended once for a maximum period of one year from its otherwise specified
termination date by the BZA upon prior written request by the applicant. Such
written request must include a statement of justification for the requested
time extension.
      (2)   If no renovations are involved, a conditional use permit shall be

conditional use shall not confer the right to do so. See also Section
1372.06(e) regarding cessation of use.
   (c)   Revocation. In all cases, including those cited above, a conditional
use permit may be revoked by the BZA, if it is found and determined that there

The Building Inspector shall make a recommendation to the BZA when a
conditional use permit should be revoked. The permit may also be revoked if the
BZA is made aware by the Planning Administrator that the applicant had made
materially false statements during the application process or presented
information to the BZA that the Board finds at a later date to be inaccurate,
untrue or misleading. In such cases, the conditional permit holder shall be
granted a period of sixty calendar days from the day following the Planning
Administrator or the Building Inspector's recommendation to bring the
conditional use into full compliance. At the close of the sixty-day period if
there still remains issues of non-compliance as described herein, then the BZA

1373.07 GENERAL STANDARDS AS BASIS FOR REVIEW.
   The following criteria and standards shall be used by the Planning
Commission, or its zoning sub-committee, in reviewing applications for site
development plan approval. They are intended to provide a framework within
which the designer of the site development is free to exercise creativity,
invention, and innovation while recognizing the historic, scenic, and visual
quantities inherent in the City of Wheeling. The Planning Commission shall not
specify or favor any particular architectural style or design or assist in the
design of any of the buildings submitted for approval. Participation by the
Commission shall be restricted to a reasonable, professional review, and,
except as otherwise provided in the following subsections, full responsibility
for design shall be retained by the applicant.
   (a)   RELATIONSHIP OF PROPOSED DEVELOPMENT TO THE ADOPTED CITY OF WHEELING
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
      (1)   Due attention by the applicant should be given to the goals and
objectives and the stated general land use policies for the City of Wheeling as
set forth in the adopted City of Wheeling comprehensive plan, and this chapter
and the relationship of the proposed development to the specific area of the
City of Wheeling which it is located.
      (2)   In the site plan and design, consideration should be given to the
use of traditional building forms and layouts which are evidence of the
distinctive historical development of the area and, in particular, of any
specially designated or recognized scenic and historic district or properties
within the vicinity of the proposed development.
   (b)   RELATIONSHIP OF BUILDINGS TO THE SITE.
      (1)   The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition with
the streetscape and to provide for adequate planting, safe pedestrian movement
and adequate parking areas.
      (2)   Parking shall, wherever possible, be located to the rear or sides
of buildings so as to not interfere with the landscape treatment.
      (3)   Without restricting the permissible limits of the applicable zoning
district, the height and scale of each building shall be compatible with its
site and existing or anticipated adjoining buildings.
      (4)   Newly installed utility services and service modifications
necessitated by exterior alterations or building expansion shall, to the extent
practicable, be underground.
      (5)   New structures shall be sited and located to take advantage of
solar access insofar as practical, including the orientation of proposed
buildings with respect to sun angles, the shading and windscreen potential of
existing and proposed vegetation both on and off the site and impact on solar
access to adjacent uses and properties.
   (c)   RELATIONSHIP OF BUILDINGS AND SITE TO ADJOINING AREA.
      (1)   Site plans proposed for nonresidential uses adjacent to a
residential district shall be reviewed with regard to the impact of the
development on that district.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall encourage the use of a combination of
common materials and architectural characteristics (e.g., rhythm, color,
texture, form or detailing), landscaping, buffers, screens and visual
interruptions to create attractive transitions between buildings of different
architectural styles.
      (3)   Proposed structures shall be related harmoniously to themselves,
the terrain and to existing buildings and roads in the vicinity that have a
visual relationship to the proposed structures. The achievement of such
harmonious relationship may include the enclosure of space in conjunction with
other existing buildings or other proposed buildings and the creation of focal
points with respect to avenues of approach, terrain features or other
buildings.
      (4)   Proposed structures shall be so sited as to minimize any adverse
impact upon the surrounding area and particularly upon any nearby residences by
reason of:
         A.   Building location, height, bulk and shadows.
         B.   Location, intensity, direction and times of use of outdoor
lighting.
         C.   Likelihood of nuisances.
         D.   Other similar considerations.
      (5)   Appropriate natural or artificial screening may be required to
minimize any adverse impact.
   (d)   LANDSCAPE, BUFFERING, AND SITE TREATMENT.
      (1)   Where possible, natural or existing topographic patterns which
contribute to the beauty and character of a development shall be preserved, by
minimizing tree and soil removal. If development of the site necessitates the
removal of established trees, special attention shall be given to the planting
of replacements or to other landscape treatment. Any grade changes shall be in
keeping with the general appearance of neighboring developed areas.
      (2)   Grades of walks, parking spaces, terraces and other paved areas
shall provide an inviting appearance.
      (3)   Landscaped treatment shall be provided to enhance architectural
features, to strengthen vistas and visual corridors and to provide shade.
      (4)   Unity of design shall be achieved through repetition of certain
plant varieties and other materials and by coordination with adjacent
developments.
      (5)   Plant material shall be selected for interest in its structure,
texture and color and in consideration of its ultimate growth pattern. Plants
that are indigenous to the area and others that will be hardy and harmonious to
the design and exhibit a good appearance shall be used.
      (6)   In locations where plants may be susceptible to injury by
pedestrian or motor traffic, they shall be protected by appropriate curbs, tree
guards or other devices.
      (7)   Parking areas and traffic ways shall be enhanced with landscaped
islands containing trees and tree groupings.
      (8)   Screening of service yards, refuse containers and other places that
tend to be unsightly shall be accomplished by use of walls, fencing or
planting, or combinations of these, with all such enclosures being compatible
in material, texture and color with the principal building or buildings on the
site.
      (9)   Landscaping shall be designed and maintained so as not to create
hazardous conditions.
   (e)   ECOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS. The development shall, insofar as
practicable:
      (1)   Result in minimal degradation of unique or irreplaceable land types
and in minimal adverse impact upon the critical areas, such as river
tributaries, creeks, streams, wetlands, areas of aquifer recharge and
discharge, steep slopes, highly erodible soils, areas with a high water table,
mature stands of mature vegetation and extraordinary wildlife nesting, feeding
or breeding grounds.
      (2)   Conform to existing geological and topographic features to the end
that the most appropriate use of land is encouraged.
   (f)   SCENIC, HISTORIC, ARCHAEOLOGICAL, AND LANDMARK SITES. Scenic,
historical, archaeological and landmark sites and features that are located on
or adjacent to the proposed development shall be preserved and protected
insofar as practicable.
   (g)   STORM DRAINAGE. The proposed development shall be so designed as to
provide for proper surface water management through a system of controlled
drainage that preserves existing drainage patterns and wetlands and enhances
groundwater recharge areas and that protects other properties and existing
natural and artificial drainage features from the adverse effects of flooding,
erosion, and the depositing of silt, gravel, or stone. Development shall
minimize flooding and erosion hazards through non-structural means, long-term
structural measures, and appropriate siting of structures. Development shall
protect surface waters and groundwaters from direct and indirect pollution and
from overuse. All drainage plans shall be reviewed and approved by the City of
Wheeling Engineer. Wherever practicable, stormwater management techniques,
including on-site detention, should be employed to both address existing
drainage problems, if any, and avoid an increase in either the peak volume or
velocity of stormwater discharged from the project site during construction or
after in its post-development condition.
   (h)   DRIVEWAY CONNECTIONS TO PUBLIC STREETS. All entrance and exit
driveways to public streets shall be located with due consideration for traffic
flow and so as to afford maximum safety to traffic on the public streets. All
such entrances and exits shall be located and designed to:
      (1)   Conform to municipal sight triangle requirements at corners.
      (2)   Achieve maximum practicable distance from street intersections and
from existing and proposed access connections from adjacent properties.
      (3)   Minimize left-hand turns, other turning movements and backing
movements.
      (4)   Discourage the routing of vehicular traffic to and through local
residential streets.
   (i)   TRAFFIC EFFECTS. The site development proposal generally shall
minimize adverse traffic effects on the road networks serving the area in
question. (Ord. 12225. Passed 4-17-01.)
   (j)   PEDESTRIAN SAFETY. Insofar as practicable, pedestrian and bicycle
circulation shall be separated from motor vehicle circulation. Safe and
convenient pedestrian circulation, including appropriate sidewalks, shall be
provided on the site and its approaches. The vehicular traffic plan shall be
designed to minimize adverse effects of pedestrian circulation upon sidewalks
and bicycle paths.
      (Ord. 14946. Passed 5-16-17.)
   (k)   ON-SITE PARKING AND CIRCULATION. The location, width and layout of
interior drives shall be appropriate for the proposed interior circulation. The
location and layout of accessory off-street parking and loading spaces shall
provide for efficient circulation and the safety of pedestrians and vehicles.
Insofar as practicable, separate rows or aisles in parking areas shall be
divided by trees, shrubbery and other landscaping devices. The location of
parking areas shall not detract from the design of proposed buildings and
structures or from the appearance of the existing neighboring buildings,
structures and landscape. Provision shall be made for access by police, fire
and emergency vehicles.
   (l)   UTILITY SERVICES. Electric, telephone and other wire-served utility
lines and service connections shall be underground insofar as feasible and
subject to state public utilities regulations. Any utility installations
remaining above ground shall be located so as to have a harmonious relation to
neighboring properties and to the site. Building orientation and site design
shall, to the maximum extent practicable, insure that the proposed development
conserves energy use.
   (m)   DISPOSAL OF WASTES. There shall be adequate provision for the disposal
of all solid, liquid and gaseous wastes and for the avoidance of odors and
other air pollutants that may be generated at the site. All applicable federal,
state, county and local pollution control standards shall be observed.
Facilities to handle solid waste, including compliance with recycling
requirements, shall be accessible, secure and properly screened.
   (n)   NOISE. All applicable federal, state, and local regulations dealing
with the control of outside noise that is expected to be generated at the site
shall be complied with.
   (o)   ADVERTISING FEATURES AND SIGNS. The size, location, height, design,
color, texture, lighting and materials of permanent signs and outdoor
advertising structures or features shall not detract from the design of
proposed buildings and structures or of the surrounding properties.
      (1)   Every sign shall be wholly consistent with the requirements set
forth in Article
1359, of this chapter and shall be well-proportioned in its design and in its
visual relationship to buildings and surroundings.
      (2)   Every sign shall be designed as an integral architectural element
of the building and site to which it principally relates.
      (3)   The colors, materials and lighting of every sign shall be
restrained and shall be harmonious with the building and site to which it
principally relates.
      (4)   The number of graphic elements on a sign shall be held to the
minimum needed to convey the sign’s major message and shall be composed in
proportion to the area of the sign face.
      (5)   Identification signs of prototype design and corporation logos
shall be modified as necessary by the applicant and project designer to conform
to the criteria for all signs within the City of Wheeling.
   (p)   PEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE CIRCULATION.
      (1)   Pedestrian circulation shall be separated, to the extent
practicable, from motor vehicle circulation. Appropriate walkways shall be
provided on the site and its approaches if deemed necessary.
      (2)   Proper provision shall be made for buildings and associated site
development that are accessible to and functional for physically handicapped
persons, such as by provision of walks and ramps of suitable width and grade,
curb cuts, signed and suitably dimensioned parking spaces and ground level
building entrances as required in the West Virginia State Uniform Fire
Prevention and Building Code and the Vehicle and Traffic Law.
   (q)   LIGHTING.
      (1)   Exterior lighting shall enhance the architectural concept, the
building design and the adjoining landscape. Lighting standards and building
fixtures shall be of a design and size compatible with the building and
adjacent areas.
      (2)   The number of light standards and the intensity of lighting shall
be appropriate to illuminate the location for safety and security but shall not
cause glare upon adjoining properties.
      (3)   Lighting standards shall not exceed twenty feet in height.
   (r)   BUILDING DESIGN.
      (1)   Building design shall make appropriate recognition of compatible
building forms indigenous to the community and, in particular, of the historic
character of the City of Wheeling.
      (2)   Materials shall have good architectural character and shall be
selected for harmony with traditional building materials. Where practical,
natural materials shall be used.

costs associated with site plan review, be reimbursed to the city by the
applicant in accordance with the fee schedule established by the City Council.
1373.14 PROPOSAL OF SITE PLAN BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   The Planning Commission may, on its own initiative, propose a general or
specific site plan for a particular area where site plan approval may be
required in the future, using as a guide the requirements of this article.
1373.15 INTEGRATION OF PROCEDURES.
   (a)   GENERAL. There may be applications where the particular circumstances
of a proposed development required compliance with other procedures in this
chapter, such as special use permit review and approval or rezoning. In such
cases, the Planning Commission may integrate site plan review as required by
this article with the other procedural and/or submission requirements. Such
integration of procedures may require, upon mutual written consent of the
Planning Commission and the applicant, reasonable modification of the time
schedules otherwise stated in this article or in said related regulations or
requirements.
   (b)   REZONING. If an applicant is requesting a rezoning of the subject
site, in addition to site plan approval, the Planning Commission shall require
that the applicant obtain the necessary rezoning from City Council before the

conditional use permit, and subject to the limitations and conditions specified
in the Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 13708. Passed 11-18-08.)

reimbursed for all reasonable and necessary expenses actually incurred in the
performance of their official duties.

year; two for a term of two years; and two for a term of three years. The terms

respectively, following their appointment. Thereafter, as their terms expire,
each new appointment shall be for a term of three years.
   (e)   PROCEDURES AND MEETINGS.
      (1)   Procedures and Regulations. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall adopt
bylaws or rules governing the filing of appeals, applications for variances and
exceptions, the giving of notice and the conduct of hearings as shall be
necessary to carry out its duties. The board shall keep minutes of its

Appeals shall elect a chairperson and vice-chairperson from its membership. The
vice-chairperson shall have the power and authority to act as chairperson
during the absence or disability of the chairperson.
      (4)   Variance Procedure.
         A.   A variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be
granted by the Board unless and until a written application for a variance is
submitted demonstrating that:
            1.   Special conditions and circumstances exist which are peculiar
to the land, structure or building involved, and which are not applicable to
other lands, structures or buildings in the same district.
            2.   Literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance.
            3.   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant.
         B.   No conforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings
in the same district, and no permitted use of lands, structures or buildings in
other districts, shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a variance.
After proper public notice, a public hearing shall be held on each application
for a variance. Due notice shall additionally be given to owners of properties
abutting the subject property and/or located within 200 feet of the subject
property.
         C.   After hearing and before granting any variance, the Board shall
make findings that the requirements of this section have been met by the
applicant, that the reasons set forth in the application justify the granting
of the variance, that the variance is the minimum variance that will make
proper the reasonable use of land, building or structure. The granting of the
variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and intent of this Zoning
Ordinance and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.
         D.   In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance. Violation
of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which
the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.
         E.   Under no circumstances shall the Board grant a variance to permit
a use not generally or by special use permitted in the district involved, or
any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance in such district.
            (Ord. 12225. Passed 4-17-01.)
      (5)   Conditional Use Permit Procedure:
         A.   A conditional use permit shall be granted by the Board in accord
with the considerations, limitations and conditions detailed in Article
1372 of the Zoning Ordinance.
         B.   The board of zoning appeals shall grant a Conditional Permit Use
in accord with the zoning ordinance if it finds that the proposed use of the
applicant:
            1.   Will not adversely affect the public health, safety or
welfare, or the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
            2.   Arises from special conditions or attributes which pertain to
the property for which the Conditional Permit Use is sought and which were not
created by the person seeking the variance;
            3.   Would eliminate an unnecessary hardship and permit a
reasonable use of the land and building; and
            4.   Will allow the intent of the zoning ordinance to be observed
and substantial justice done.
               (Ord. 13708. Passed 11-18-08.)
   (f)   SECRETARY AND EMPLOYEES. The Board of Zoning Appeals may appoint and
fix the compensation of a secretary and such employees as are necessary for the
discharge of its duties, all in conformity to and in compliance with the
salaries and compensation theretofore fixed by the City Council.
   (g)   OFFICES. The governing body of the municipality in the case of a
municipal Board of Zoning Appeals and the county court in the case of a county
Board of Zoning Appeals shall provide the board with suitable offices for the
holding of meetings and the preservation of plans, maps, documents and
accounts, and shall provide by appropriation a sum sufficient to defray the
reasonable expenses of the board.
   (h)   APPEALS TO THE BOARD; HEARINGS; NOTICE. Appeals to the Board of Zoning
Appeals may be taken by any aggrieved person or by a requirement, decision or
determination made by the City’s zoning office or Planning Commission. The
zoning office from which the appeal is taken shall upon request of the Board
transmit to it all documents, plans and papers constituting the record of the
action from which an appeal was taken. The Board shall fix a reasonable time
for the hearing of an appeal, give public notice thereof as well as notice to
the interested parties, and decide the same within a reasonable time. The Board
may require the party taking the appeal to assume the cost of public notice and
notice to interested parties. At the hearing, any party may appear in person,
by agent or by attorney.
   (i)   STAY OF WORK ON PREMISES. When an appeal from the decision of the
zoning official has been taken and filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals, all
proceedings and work on the premises concerning the decision shall be stayed
unless the zoning official certifies to the Board that a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property by reason of facts stated in the certificate
of the zoning official. In such case, proceedings on work shall not be stayed
except by a restraining order that may be granted by the Circuit Court of Ohio
County on application and notice to the zoning office and the owner or owners
of the premises affected.
   (j)   DECISIONS OF BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS. In exercising the powers set
forth in subsection (b), Powers and Duties above, the Board of Zoning Appeals
may, so long as such action is in conformity with the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance, reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from, and may make such order,
requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made, and to that end
shall have powers of the zoning office from whom the appeal is taken.
   (k)   APPEAL FROM THE BOARD; PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI. Every decision
of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be subject to review by certiorari. Any
person, firm or corporation, aggrieved by any decision of the Board, may
present to the Circuit Court of Ohio County a petition duly verified, setting

grounds of the illegality. All must be done in accordance and in the manner
provided by West Virginia Code Article 24, Planning and Zoning, Part XVII Board
of Zoning Appeals – Judicial Review.
   (l)   NOTICE TO ADVERSE PARTIES.
      (1)   Upon filing a petition for a writ of certiorari with the City
Clerk, the petitioner shall cause a notice to be issued and served by the
sheriff upon the adverse party or parties, if any, as shown by the record of
the appeal in the office of the Board of Zoning Appeals and upon the chairman
or secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals. The adverse party or parties shall
be any property owner whom or which the record of the Board of Zoning Appeals
shows to have appeared at the hearing before the board in opposition to the
petitioner. If the record shows a written remonstrance or other document
opposing the request of petitioner containing the names of more than three
property owners, the petitioner shall be required to cause notice to be issued
and served upon the three property owners whose names first appear upon the
remonstrance or document. Notice to the other parties named in the remonstrance
or document shall not be required. The notice shall state that a petition for a
writ of certiorari has been filed asking for a review of the decision or order
of the Board of Zoning Appeals, shall designate the premises affected and shall
specify the date of the decision or order. Service of the notice by the sheriff
on the chairman or secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall constitute
notice to the board and to the City and to any official or board thereof
charged with the enforcement of the zoning ordinance and no further summons or
notice with reference to the filing of such petition shall be necessary.
      (2)   As an alternative to the requirements for notice prescribed in
subsection (a) of this section, notice shall be sufficient upon a showing that
the chairman or secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals and all adjacent
landowners to the subject property have received personal service of process of
the notice containing information as required. As to all other interested
parties, notice shall be sufficient if, by Class III-0 legal advertisement, a
notice containing information as required is published in the City wherein the
subject property is located.
   (m)   COURT OR JUDGE ACTION.
      (1)   Upon presentation of a petition for a writ of certiorari, the City
of Wheeling Court in which the premises affected are located, or a judge
thereof in vacation, shall direct the Board of Zoning Appeals to show cause
within twenty days from the date of such citation why a writ of certiorari
should not issue. If such board fails to show to the satisfaction of the court
or judge that a writ should not issue, then the court or judge may allow a writ
of certiorari directed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The writ shall prescribe
the time in which a return shall be made to it. This time shall not be less
than ten days from the date of issuance of the writ and may be extended by the
court or judge thereof.
      (2)   The court or judge may consider and determine the sufficiency of
the allegations of illegality contained in the petition without further
pleadings and may make a determination and render a judgment with reference to
the legality of the decision or order of the Board of Zoning Appeals on the
facts set out in the petition and return to the writ of certiorari. If it shall
appear to the court or judge that testimony is necessary for the proper
disposition of the matter, the court or judge may take evidence to supplement
the evidence and facts disclosed by the petition and return to the writ of
certiorari, but no such review shall be by trial de novo. In passing upon the
legality of the decision or order of the Board of Zoning Appeals, the court or
judge may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify such a decision
or order.
   (n)   STAY OF WORK ON ALLOWANCE OF WRIT. The allowance of the writ of
certiorari shall not stay proceedings or work on the premises affected by the
decision or order to be brought up for review. The court or judge may, however,
upon application and on notice to all parties to the decision or order and on
due cause shown, grant such relief as the circumstances of the case may
require, including an order staying the proceedings or work until final
determination of the case by the court or judge thereof. Such staying order may
be issued by the court or judge without requiring the petitioner to enter into
a written undertaking with the adverse party or parties affected thereby for
the payment of damages.
   (o)   RETURN TO WRIT. The return to the writ of certiorari by the Board of
Zoning Appeals must concisely set forth such facts and data as may be pertinent
and present material to show the grounds of the decision or appealed order. The
return must be verified by the secretary of the board. The board shall not be
required to return the original papers. It shall be sufficient to return
certified copies of all or a portion of the papers as may be called for by the
writ.
   (p)   APPEAL FROM COURT OR JUDGE FINAL JUDGMENT. An appeal may be taken to
the West Virginia supreme court of appeals from the final judgment of the court
or judge reversing, affirming or modifying the decision or order of the Board
of Zoning Appeals within the same time, in the same manner, and upon the same
terms, conditions and limitations as appeals in other civil cases.

1718.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted a Vacant Structure Code for the City of Wheeling.
(Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.02 PURPOSE.
     (a)    The City has determined that an uninspected and unmonitored vacant
building may present a fire hazard, may provide temporary occupancy by
transients (including drug users and traffickers), may detract from private
and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and
that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by the regulation
of such vacant buildings.
   (b)   Owners of uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings shall register
such vacant buildings with the City, make payment of a fee for the registration
thereof, and otherwise conform to these vacant building regulations.
   (c)   This article ensures that, through a registration, inspection, and
monitoring process, vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from
trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in
times of emergency, will not impede private and/or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and will not present otherwise
a public hazard.
   
   (d)   The City, by and through its departments (particularly the Building
and Planning Department) shall inspect and monitor vacant buildings (especially
vacant downtown buildings), shall assess the effects of the condition of those
buildings on nearby structures, and shall promote substantial efforts to
rehabilitate and develop such buildings when appropriate.
      These provisions will streamline and consolidate the existing procedure
(that is, complaint, research, notification, inspection, orders, fines, liens,
appeals and due process lien enforcement), by placing the responsibility to
register and maintain vacant structures on the building owner before a
building's condition falls into disrepair or otherwise merits a complaint.
(Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.03 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following words and
phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows:
            (1)    Boarded: A building or structure subject to the provision of
this section shall be deemed to be "boarded" if in place of one or more
exterior doors, other than a storm door, or of one or more windows, there is a
sheet or sheets of plywood or similar material covering the space for such door
or window.
            (2)    Exterior maintenance and major systems: The phrase "exterior
maintenance and major systems" shall mean the safe and lawful maintenance of
the facade, windows, doors, roof and other parts of the exterior of the
building and the maintenance of its major systems consisting of the roof, the
electrical and plumbing systems, the water supply system, the sewer system, and
the sidewalk, driveway, if any, area of the lot, as applicable and as enforced
by the Building and Planning, particularly in connection with codes adopted by
the City as well as all applicable local, state and federal laws.
          (3)   Foreclosure or Foreclosure Action: The legal process by which a
Mortgagee, or other lien holder, terminates or attempts to terminate a property
Owner's equitable right of redemption to obtain legal and equitable title to
the Real Property pledged as security for a debt or the Real Property subject
to the lien. The legal process is not concluded until the property obtained by
the Mortgagee, lien holder, or their designee, by certificate of title, or any
other means, is sold to a non-related bona fide purchaser in an arm's length
transaction to satisfy the debt or lien.
         (4)   Mortgagee: The creditor, including but not limited to, trustees;
mortgage servicing companies; lenders in a mortgage agreement; any agent,
servant, or employee of the creditor; any successor in interest; or any
assignee of the creditor's rights, interests or obligations under the mortgage
agreement; or any other person or entity with the legal right to foreclose on
the Real Property, excluding governmental entities as the assignee or owner.
            (5)    Occupied: Any building or structure shall be deemed to be
occupied if one or more persons actually conducts a lawful business or resides
in all or any part of the building as the licensed business occupant, or as the
legal or equitable owner/occupant(s) or tenant(s) on a permanent, non-transient
basis, or any combination of the same. For purposes of this section, evidence
offered to prove that a building is so occupied may include, but shall not be
limited to, the regular receipt of delivery of regular mail through the U.S.
Postal Service; proof of continual telephone, electric, gas, heating, water and
sewer services; a valid city business license, or the most recent, federal,
state or City income tax statements indicating that the subject property is the
official business or residence address of the person or business claiming
occupancy; or proof of bonafide pre-rental inspection.
      (6)    Open: A building or structure subject to the provisions of this
section shall be deemed to be "open" if any one or more exterior doors other
than a storm door is broken, open and/or closed but, without a properly
functioning lock to secure it, or if one or more windows is broken or not
capable of being locked and secured from intrusion, or any combination of the
same.
      (7)    Owner: An owner of the freehold of the premises or any lesser
estate therein, a mortgagee, a vendee-in-possession, assignee of rents,
receiver, executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or
corporation that is directly or indirectly in control of a building subject to
the provisions of this section, and as set forth below.
      (8)    Real Property: Any residential or commercial land and/or
buildings, leasehold improvements and anything affixed to the land, or portion
thereof identified by a property parcel identification number, located in the
City limits.
      (9)    Vacant: a building or structure shall be deemed to be vacant if no
person or persons actually, currently conducts a lawfully licensed business, or
lawfully resides, dwells, or lives in any part of the building as the legal or
equitable owner(s) or tenant-occupant(s), or owner-occupant(s), or tenant(s) on
a permanent, non-transient basis. A building or structure shall be deemed
vacant and subject to the registration and possible penalty provisions provided
herein if the exterior maintenance and major systems of the building and the
surrounding real property thereof, as defined in this section, are in violation
of the building codes or health and sanitation codes and if there is not proof
of continual utility service evidencing actual use of electric, gas (i.e.,
applicable heating sources), water service, etc. Continued is meant to be
without more than one thirty (30) day interruption in any given three hundred
sixty (360) day period. In order for such continual utility service to be
considered as being actually in use as described in this section, it must be
more than merely registered to the owner for purposes of billing and must be
utilized, at a minimum, in order to keep the property and the major systems of
the building in compliance with building and safety codes. The person or entity
asserting that there has been continued utility service has the burden to
produce actual bills evidencing utility service for the relevant period.
   
   (b)   All vacant structures shall also comply with the following criteria:
      (1)    Exterior property areas are to be mowed regularly and non-
cultivated gardens maintained at no more than 10 inches of growth. All noxious
weeds are prohibited.
      (2)    Structure is to be broom swept and cleared of all contents, not
including building materials or components to be used in the future renovation
at that structure.
      (3)    Electrical service is to be provided to the building via temporary
pole service on the exterior of the structure or create a permanent service for
the structure and install two GFCI protected receptacles.
      (4)    NEC and OSHA compliant string lighting is to be provided to the
entire structure so that it may be illuminated as needed to view the structure.
      (5)    Unstable interior and exterior surfaces and components are to be
removed. Unstable or unsound accessory buildings are to be razed or renovated.
      (6)    Using wood sheet goods; all loose, deteriorated and broken windows
and doors are to be covered to eliminate the danger of their falling and to
prevent the unwanted entry of trespassers. Such wood sheet goods are to be cut
and neatly fit, not just nailed over the opening.
      (7)    All loose or deteriorated trim, gutter or overhang extensions
(masonry or frame) are to be removed or reattached to prevent falling.
      (8)    Regular routine monitoring of the structure is to occur by the
owner to ensure that the building is being kept in compliance with the above
items.
      (9)    Utilities need to be connected to the structure.
   
    (c)   Applicability. The requirements of this section shall be applicable
to each owner of any building that is found to be vacant pursuant to the
language contained herein. Each such owner shall cause to be filed a
registration, which shall include the street address and parcel number of each
such vacant building, the names and addresses of all owners, as hereinafter
described, and any other information deemed necessary by the Building and
Planning Department.
      (1) If the owner is a corporation, the registration statement shall
provide the names and residence addresses of all officers and directors of the
corporation and shall be accompanied by a copy of the most recent annual
franchise tax report filed with the secretary of state;
      (2)    If an estate, the name and business address of the executor of the
estate;
      (3)    If a trust, the name and address of all trustees, grantors, and
beneficiaries;
      (4)    If a partnership, the names and residence addresses of all
partners with an interest of ten percent or greater;
      (5)    If any other form of unincorporated association, the names and
residence addresses of all principals with an interest of ten percent or
greater;
            (6)    If an individual person, the name and residence address of
that individual person. (Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.04 INSPECTION.
     At the time of registration, the Chief Building Inspector, Fire Chief,
City Engineer and Police Chief shall determine whether it is necessary for any
or all of them to inspect the structure so as to identify any public safety
issues needing addressed. Inspections shall also be available to verify the
status of any property concerning occupancy, vacancy, etc. If an internal
inspection is deemed necessary, the owner will be notified of the same and
arrangements made for the same. If the owner fails or refuses to consent to and
arrange for an inspection, the city will seek an administrative search warrant
from a court of competent jurisdiction, which shall include the Municipal
Court, to authorize inspection of the premises for the purpose of determining
the structural integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to insure its
structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire fighters and
police officers in time of emergency, and that the build in and its contents do
not present a hazard to the public during the time that the building remains
vacant.
(Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.05 CORRECTIVE ACTION.
    The property owners shall be notified in writing of any corrective action
deemed necessary for life, safety and building code matters by City officials,
the applicable code provisions or regulations, and will be afforded a
reasonable time to the corrective action. Corrective action concerning the
occupancy of vacant structures is discussed later herein.
(Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.06 REGISTRATION GENERALLY.
   (a)   At the time of adoption of this article, all owners or mortgagees who
have filed a foreclosure or obtained ownership of a property through
foreclosure of realty within the City of Wheeling that contain a vacant
structure, as defined above, shall register the same with the office of the
Building Inspection of the City. For those structures that qualify as a vacant
structure and after the adoption of this article, the owner thereof shall be
required to register the structure within 30 days after the structure is found
to meet the definition of a vacant structure. The registration form shall
require information from the registrant deemed necessary by the City Manager,
Building Inspector, Fire Chief, City Engineer and Police Chief of the City, so
as to ensure that the purpose of this article is met. Specifically, the above-
named City officers shall have the authority to require that the property owner
provide a professional opinion (architect, engineer, etc.) to determine the
structural integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to ensure its
structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire fighters and
police officers in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do
not present a hazard to the public during the time the building remains vacant.
The above-named officers shall have the authority to issue orders to the owner
for corrective action deemed necessary. The Building Inspector and Fire Chief
shall rely upon the West Virginia State Building Code and Fire Code, as well as
other applicable law, for guidance during any such structural review.
   
   (b)    Registration Statement and Fees; Local Agent. If none of the
responsible parties listed, as above, is shown at an address within the state,
the registration statement also shall provide the name and address of a person
who resides within the state and who is authorized to accept service of process
on behalf of the owners and who shall be designated as a responsible, local
party or agent, both for purposes of notification in the event of an emergency
affecting the public health, safety or welfare and for purposes of service of
any and all notices or registration statements as herein authorized and in
connection herewith. Registration shall be required for all vacant buildings,
whether vacant and secure, vacant and open or vacant and boarded, and shall be
required whenever any building has remained vacant for 45 consecutive days or
more. In no instance shall the registration of a vacant building and the
payment of registration fees be construed to exonerate the owner, agent or
responsible party for compliance with any other building code or housing code
requirement. One registration statement per property is required. The
responsible party of the vacant property shall renew the registration upon the
anniversary of the initial registration and shall be responsible for the
payment of the non-refundable registration fee. Said fee shall be based on the
duration of the vacancy as determined by the following scale:
      (1)    No fee for properties that are vacant for less than one year;
      (2)    $500.00 for properties that are vacant for at least one year but
less than two years;
      (3)    $1,000.00 for properties that are vacant for at least two years
but less than three years;
      (4)    $2,000.00 for properties that are vacant for at least three years
but less than four years;
      (5)    $3,500.00 for properties that are vacant for at least four years
but less than five years; and
      (6)    $4,000.00 for properties that are vacant for at least five years,
plus an additional $300.00 for each year in excess of five years.
         (Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.07 RIGHT OF APPEAL.
      (a)   Appeal Rights.  The owner shall have the right to appeal the
imposition of the registration fees to the City Manager; upon filing an
application in writing to the department of licenses and inspections no later
than 15 calendar days after the date of the billing statement. On appeal, the
owner shall bear the burden of providing satisfactory objective proof of
occupancy as defined in this article specifically.
   
   (b)    One Time Waiver of Registration Fee. A one-time waiver of the
registration fee, or an extension of a waiver for up to 90 days from the date
of the first renewal for properties not subject to a foreclosure, may be
granted by the City Manager or his designee upon application of the owner and
upon review and advice of the Building Code Licensure, Public Health and Safety
Officials and City Engineer; if the owner:
      (1)    Demonstrates with satisfactory proof to the City Manager or his
designee that he/she is in the process of demolition, rehabilitation, or other
substantial repair of the vacant building; and
      (2)    Objectively demonstrates to the City Manager or his designee a
reasonable anticipated length of time for the demolition, rehabilitation, or
other substantial repair of the vacant building;
      (3)    Provides satisfactory proof to the City Manager or his designee
that he/she was actively attempting to sell or lease the property during the
vacancy period; or
            (4)    Provides satisfactory proof to the City Manager, to be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis, that the vacancy is temporary and may be due
to illness of the owner, active military service, or some other reasonable
explanation believed to be short term in nature and document able as necessary.
   (c)   Within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as possible, after the waiver
application is received by the City Manager or his designee shall grant or deny
the waiver, or request for extension, in writing, and dispatch the written
decision by mail to the owner. If the owner properly submitted an application
for a one-time waiver or request for extension to the City Manager or his
designee, and the City Manager or his designee rendered a decision which the
owner seeks to appeal to the City Council, the owner must file an application
in writing no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the City Manager or
his designee's decision. City Council shall either grant or deny the appeal.
Thereafter the decision of City Council is final unless within thirty (30) days
of such decision the owner appeals for injunctive relief to the Circuit Court
of Ohio County. (Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.08  AMENDING INFORMATION.
    (a)    Duty to Amend Registration Statement. If the status of the
registration information changes during the course of any calendar year, it is
the responsibility of the owner, responsible party or agent for the same within
30 days of the occurrence of such change and update the registration with those
changes.
   (b)    Exceptions. This section shall not apply to any building owned by the
United States, the state, the City, or any of their respective agencies or
political subdivisions.
   (c)    Violations and Penalties for Failure to Register. The failure or
refusal for any reason of any owner, or agent of an owner acting on behalf of
the owner, to register a vacant building upon adoption of this section or to
pay any fees required to be paid pursuant to the provisions of this section,
within thirty days after they become due, shall constitute a violation
punishable upon conviction thereof by a fine in the amount of not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each
failure or refusal to pay a required vacant building fee, as applicable. In
such cases, whenever the minimum fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) is
imposed, it shall not be subject to suspension or reduction for any reason.
(Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.09 REINSPECTION.
    All vacant structures are subject to reinspection on an annual basis or as
deemed necessary pursuant to Section
1718.04.
(Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.10 NON-PAYMENT OF FEES/LIENS.
      (a)    Delinquent Registration Fees as a Lien. After the owner is given
notice of the amount of the registration fee due, except for those owners that
have properly perfected an appeal pursuant to subsection (b)(4) above, and the
owner fails to pay the amount due, said amount shall constitute a debt due and
owing to the City and the City may commence a civil action to collect such
unpaid debt.
   
   (b)   "Lien" or "liens" as used in this section shall arise whenever the
fees and charges as described in this section are levied or imposed. The liens
created in this article shall be subject to the provisions of Part Seven -
Business Regulation and Taxation Code of the City of Wheeling, Chapter Six -
Special Charges for Municipal Services, Article 800 concerning lien security
and priority.
   (c)    If an owner fails to pay the registration fee as assessed and the
City begins the collection action to enforce its lien, then the Code
Enforcement Officer shall post the written notice on the property and send the
written notice to the owner(s) by certified and regular mail.
   (d)    The City may take action to sell the subject property by means of
forfeiture and the court ordered enforcement process to collect the debt owed
the City. Should the City take the steps necessary to sell the subject
property, the City shall do so, subject to all liens and real and personal
property taxes that are due. Purchasers of the subject property shall be
similarly responsible for registration pursuant to this section in the same
manner as the prior owner and must begin the registration process anew if said
property remains vacant.
(Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.11 LIENS GENERALLY/FORFEITURE OF PROPERTY PROCEEDINGS.
     For unpaid fees, please see the Codified Ordinances of the City of
Wheeling, Part Seven - Business Regulation and Taxation Code - Chapter Six -
Special Charges for Municipal Services, Article 800. (Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-
22.)
1718.12 RELATION TO OTHER CODES AND LAWS.
      It is to be understood that the intent and purpose of this Article are
separate and distinct from other parts and sections of the Codified Ordinances
of the City of Wheeling and the general laws of the State of West Virginia
which may also be applicable. The provisions of this section are applicable to
the owners of such vacant buildings as set forth herein and are in addition to
and not in lieu of any and all other applicable provisions of this chapter, the
health and sanitation code, and any other applicable provisions of the City of
Wheeling municipal code. (Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.13 PROVISIONS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO PILOT HOME RULE AUTHORITY - SUNSET/
CONTINUATION PROVISION.
   Certain provisions of the Codified Ordinances of the City of Wheeling found
in this Article, being Part Thirteen-Planning and Zoning Code were adopted
pursuant to the authority granted to the municipality under the Pilot home Rule
authority found in West Virginia Code § 8-1-5a passed by the West Virginia
Legislature in 2007. Therefore, any actions begun during the Pilot Program
period, pursuant to Ordinances adopted by the municipality under its Home Rule
Authority, shall remain in full force and effect throughout all proceedings
initiated within the five (5) year initial time frame given to the Pilot Home
Rule municipalities to enact legislation. Similarly, should any future deadline
be set by the legislature for the extinguishing of the Pilot Home Rule
Authority found in West Virginia Code § 8-1-5a, all proceedings or actions
exercising the Home Rule Authority found in said section initiated prior to
such deadline shall remain in full force and effect throughout such proceedings
or actions. Should the legislature extend the Home Rule Authority so that the
initial period of five (5) years does not sunset, then the powers of the City
of Wheeling pursuant to its Home Rule Authority and the provisions adopted
under such authority shall continue and remain in full force and effect.
(Ord. 15662. Passed 2-1-22.)
1718.14 SEVERABILITY.
   The provisions of this Article
1718 are severable. If any part of this Article
1718 is held to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining
provisions of this Chapter and of this Article
1718 shall remain in full force and effect.

boundary up or down stream to the property that is the subject of the
application for Floodplain Permit. Adjacent property also includes all other
property that may be affected by flooding.
      (2)   Advisory Flood Height means the water surface elevation (WSEL), in
feet, of the one percent (1%) annual chance (100 year) flood at a given

      (3)   Adversely Affect Adjacent Properties means to adversely affect a
property the increase in the elevation of the 100 year base flood elevation
must be more than one (1) foot at any point. Stated conversely, if the effect
is that the 100 year flood base flood elevation rises one (1) foot or less the
property is not Aaffected. This standard does not apply to the Floodway. If
prior permit(s) has/have been approved in the same area of the Floodplain, the
above definition would include the cumulative impact to the base flood
elevation.
       (4)   Appurtenant Structure means a secondary structure on the same
parcel of property as the principal structure, the use of which is incidental
and shall not be habitable but shall be used only for storage in association
with the principal structure on said property. This does not include a gas or
liquid storage tank.

being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
      (6)   Base Flood Elevation (BFE) means the water surface elevation of the
base flood in relation to the datum specified on the County's Flood Insurance
Rate Map. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the one hundred (100) year flood
or one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. (See 100-
year flood also.)

(below ground level) on all sides.
      (8)   Certificate of Compliance means a certification that the entire
development, including the elevation of fill or the lowest floor of a structure
is in compliance with all the provisions of this article.
      (9)   Development means any man made change to improved or unimproved
real estate; including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations.
      (10)   Mobile home means a transportable, single family dwelling intended
for permanent occupancy, office or place of assembly, contained in one or more
sections, built on a permanent chassis, which arrives at a site complete and

impede, retard or change the direction of the flow of water either in itself or
by catching or collecting debris carried by such water or is placed where the
flow of the water might carry the same downstream to the damage of life and
property.
      (13)   Delineation of Flood Hazard Areas means that for the purposes of
this Building Code, the areas considered to be flood prone within the City
shall be those areas identified as being subject to the 100 year flood in the
Flood Insurance Study prepared for the City by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) and dated February 15, 1984.
         A map showing all areas considered to be flood prone is available for
inspection at the Department of Development Office. For the purpose of this
article the following nomenclature is used in referring to the various kinds of
flood prone areas:
         A.   The Floodway is delineated for purposes of this article using the
criteria that a certain area within the flood plain shall be capable of
carrying the waters of the 100 year flood without increasing the water surface
elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point. These areas are
specifically defined in Table 3 of the above referenced Flood Insurance Study
and shown on the accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway Map.
          B.   The Flood Fringe shall be that area of the 100 year flood plain
not included in the Floodway. The basis for the outermost boundary of this
District shall be the 100 year flood elevations contained in the flood profiles
of the above referenced Flood Insurance Study and as shown on the accompanying
Flood Boundary and Floodway Map.
         C.   The Approximated Flood Plain shall be that flood plain area for
which no detailed flood profiles or elevations are provided, but where 100 year
flood plain boundary has been approximated. Such areas are shown on the Flood
Boundary and Floodway Hap. Where the specific 100 year flood elevation cannot
be determined for this area using other sources of data such as the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, Flood Plain Information Reports, U.S. Geological Survey
Flood Prone Quadrangle, etc., then the applicant for the proposed use,
development and/or activity shall determine this elevation in accordance with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
review by the City Engineer.
The delineation of any of the flood plain districts may be revised by Council
where natural or man made changes have occurred and/or more detailed studies
conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or other qualified
agency or individual documents the need for such change. However, prior to any
such change approval shall be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
Initial interpretations of the boundaries of the Flood Plain Districts shall be
made by the City Engineer. Should a dispute arise concerning the boundaries of
any of the Districts, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall make the necessary
determination. The person questioning or contesting the location of the
district boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to present his case
to the Zoning Board of Appeals and to submit his own technical. evidence if he
so desires.
      (14)   Compensatory storage means an artificially excavated,
hydraulically equivalent volume of storage within the special flood hazard area
used to balance the loss of natural flood storage when artificial fill or
structures are placed within the special flood hazard area.
      (15)   Contractor B W.Va. Code §21-11-3(c) means a person who in any
capacity for compensation, other than as an employee of another, undertakes,
offers to undertake, purports to have the capacity to undertake, or submits a
bid to construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck or
demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, structure or excavation
associated with a project, development or improvement, or to do any part
thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structures or works in
connection therewith, where the cost of undertaking is two thousand five
hundred dollars or more. Contractor includes a construction manager who
performs management and counseling services on a construction project for a
professional fee.
Contractor does not include:
         A.   One who merely furnishes materials or supplies without
fabricating or consuming them in the construction project;
         B.   A person who personally performs construction work on the site of
real property which the person owns or leases whether for commercial or
residential purposes;
         C.   A person who is licensed or registered as a professional and who
functions under the control of any other licensing or regulatory board, whose
primary business is real estate sales, appraisal, development, management and
maintenance, who acting in his respective professional capacity and any
employee of such professional, acting in the course of his employment, performs
any work which may be considered to be performing contracting work;
         D.   A pest control operator licensed under the provisions of W.Va.
Code §19-16A-7(a) to engage in the application of pesticides for hire, unless
the operator also performs structural repairs exceeding one thousand dollars on
property treated for insect pests; or
         E.   A corporation, limited liability corporation, partnership or sole
proprietorship whose primary purpose is to prepare construction plans and
specifications used by the contractors defined in this section and who employs
a full time registered architect licensed to practice in this State or a
registered professional engineer licensed to practice in this State. Contractor
also does not include employees of such corporation, partnership or sole
proprietorship.
      (16)   Critical Facility means any facility in which even a slight chance
of flooding is too great a threat. Typical critical facilities include
hospitals, fire stations, police stations, storage of critical records, and
similar facilities. These should be given special consideration when
formulating regulatory alternatives and floodplain management plans. A critical
facility should not be located in a special flood hazard area if at all
possible. If a critical facility must be located in a special flood hazard area
it should be provided a higher level of protection so that it can continue to
function and provide services during a flood.
       (17)   Development means any man made change to improved or unimproved
real property, including but not limited to buildings or other structure,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations,

Floodplain Manager to determine if a property is in the Special Flood Hazard
Area, also to assist to determine the height in which to elevate the structure
as a permitting tool. And is acceptable data to FEMA for a Letter of Map
Amendment (LOMA).
      (5)   The AO and AH floodplain those areas identified as Zones AO and AH
on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by 1 percent
annual chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and three
feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   Where natural or man made changes have occurred and/or where more
detailed studies have been completed by a qualified government agency, private
entity, or qualified individual who can sufficiently document the necessity for
such changes; the process to revise the delineation of the identified special
flood hazard area may be recommended by the floodplain manager and executed by
the Floodplain Manager. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   A County or City's Base Flood Elevations (BFEs) may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon
as practical but, not later than six (6) months from the date such information
becomes available, the County or City shall notify FEMA of the changes by
submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The County or City may identify and regulate new flood hazard or

shall not be required to conform to the provisions of this article at the
discretion of the Floodplain Manager.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to the proposed development is
below the BFE, the site shall be considered to be within the Floodplain Area
and the proposed structure shall be required to conform to all appropriate
provisions of this article.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any Floodplain boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Manager and any
party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Building Code Board of
Appeals sitting as the “Floodplain Appeals Board”. The burden of proof shall be
on the appellant/applicant.
(Ord. 15476. Passed 10-20-20.)
1765.04  UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway.
      (1)   Within any Floodway Area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through Hydrologic and Hydraulic
(H&H) analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering
study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Manager.
      (2)   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere as determined by Floodplain Manager. In
addition to the requirements below the applicant shall demonstrate that there
are no reasonable alternatives other than the Floodway encroachment before a
permit is issued.
          B.   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable Federal and State Law, Ordinances
and Regulations.
         D.   When small, single lot development (not incorporating significant
amounts of fill) is proposed in a special flood hazard areas for which no
regulatory floodway has been designated, a regulatory floodway may, at the
discretion of the Floodplain Manager, be determined to be a width equal to the
channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one half the
width of the special flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank
nearest the site to the upland limit of the one percent (1%) annual chance SFHA
boundary.
 
   (b)   AE Zone Without Floodway Area. Within any AE Zone Without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100 year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (c)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).  Within any Floodplain Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Manager shall use elevation and floodway information
from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to determine
the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Manager shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all proposed
development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the specific
flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Manager shall then require the applicant
to determine the elevation above which the development and adjacent properties
including but not limited to existing buildings will be reasonably safe from
flooding using H&H analyses or other techniques. When H&H analyses are
required, they shall only be prepared by a registered professional engineer who
shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Manager.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with this floodplain ordinance and related provisions contained
herein and in all other applicable Federal and State Laws, Ordinances and
Regulations.
      (4)   Within any approximated Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100 year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
      (5)   When Advisory Flood Height Data is available, this data will be
utilized to assist in permitting and regulating development within the Special
Flood Hazard Area.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of Wheeling's Floodplain Manager, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to FEMA. In
addition, prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain Manager shall
require copies of all necessary permits from those governmental agencies from
which Federal or State Law requires approval
       (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Wheeling, in writing,
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Manager may require the applicant to
demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will provide equal
or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If H&H analyses are
required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer,
who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses and computations shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Manager.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Manager may require
the use of certain “best practice” techniques in the construction of bridges,
culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and
localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are
not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of
sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood
heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the County and City of
Wheeling a legal agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance
to be performed on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts,
bridges and other stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to transfer the agreement to the purchaser when the land associated
with the watercourse alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements
shall be provided to the Floodplain Manager. Failure to transfer the agreement
and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Manager shall subject the violator
to the penalties set forth in Section 1765.08(d).

confidential information from the contracts and addendums that are not
otherwise public information. Failure to present contract(s) or addendums for
review shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the
work is of an aggregate construction cost value of less than ten thousand
dollars including material and labor, a brief written description of proposed
work and the estimated value will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two (2) feet above the BFE and:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the methods of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, etc. When required by the Floodplain
Manager, a registered professional engineer or architect shall prepare the
plans.
          D.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the BFE at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification. The
elevation certificate must confirm the structure in question together with
attendant utilities are elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
         G.   A Non Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Floodplain Manager determines that the area below the first floor
could be converted to a non conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas
below base flood elevation that are five (5) feet high or more). This agreement
shall state:
            1.   The area below BFE shall not be converted for use other than
for parking, building access or for allowable storage as detailed in this
article.

provided to the Floodplain Manager. Failure to transfer the Non Conversion
Agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Manager shall subject the
violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1765.08(d).
      (2)   All structures shall be flood proofed to two feet above the BFE
(nonresidential structures only): All applicants shall meet or exceed the
minimum flood proofing requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can
be lowered significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the
height required by this article. In order to obtain an “elevation credited”
flood insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend
at least one foot above the BFE.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits, certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood Proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in (1) above, stating the structure in question, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities are designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
(2) feet above the BFE.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
B used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage (Appurtenant
Structures only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
Floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a Floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An Elevation Certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two (2) feet above the BFE and that all utilities
are located at least two (2) feet above the BFE
             2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               i.   A minimum of two (2) openings have a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               ii.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above grade.
               iii.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
          C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non Conversion Agreement
and notify prospective purchasers of the existence of the Non Conversion
Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non
Conversion Agreement to any purchaser at closing through notarized signature. A
signed copy of the transferred Non Conversion Agreement shall be provided to
the Floodplain Manager. Failure to transfer the Non Conversion Agreement and
provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Manager shall subject the violator to
the penalties set forth in Section 1765.08(d).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria. Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a SFHA
and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Manager to assure that they are consistent
with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Manager that includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to Floodplain Areas, proposed lot sites, and fill
areas.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the SFHAs, the plan map shall include detailed information giving
the location and elevation of proposed roads, utilities and building sites. All
such maps shall also show contours at intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet
depending upon the slope of the land and identify accurately the boundaries of
the SFHAs. A registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor
must certify the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include BFE data and shall delineate the Flood
way.
         A.   When a FIS is available from FEMA, the data contained in that
study must be used to substantiate the BFE.
          B.   If a FEMA's FIS Study is not available the required data may be
available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers (USACE), U.S. Geological Survey (USGS), Natural Resource Conservation
Service or State and Local Water Resource Department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a FIS. This data shall be prepared and
certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts
Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the SFHA
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the Floodplain
Area (Zone AE) boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed BFE data
may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan for the proposed development
must show contours at intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending on the
slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed and the location of the
special flood hazard boundary as scaled from the FEMA map. A registered
professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications must certify the site plan
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the SFHA shall result in lots that include a buildable
portion outside of the SFHA and be served by streets within the proposed
subdivision having surfaces at or above the BFE of the line defining the SFHA
limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot
that is located outside of the SFHA.
(Ord. 15476. Passed 10-20-20.)

SFHA.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the BFE, the following flood damage
reduction provisions apply:
         A.   Use of the structure shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
            1.   Structures shall be no more than 300 square feet in size and
valued at less than seven thousand dollars ($7,000.).
             2.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one (1) side.
            3.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
            4.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
            5.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two (2) feet above the Base Flood
Elevation.

must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or
meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two (2) openings have a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         B.   In addition, a Non Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the Non Conversion Agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non Conversion Agreement at
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of the Non
Conversion Agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Manager. Failure to
transfer the Non Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the
Floodplain Manager shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in
Section
1765.08(d).
   (d)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any SFHA shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and,
       (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnected utilities, security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
   (e)   Fill.  The City of Wheeling officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the Floodplain Area serves in storage and transportation of water
during floods. Placement of fill in the SFHA is discouraged and should be
minimized.
Placement of fill in other areas of the SFHA shall be restricted to functional
purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill shall only be permitted in the
same permit with the related structure or other functional purpose. Placement
of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to elevate yards, parking lots,
or fields will not generally be considered a functional purpose. The Floodplain
Manager may require the developer to provide compensatory storage before
permitting fill.
No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through H&H analyses performed in accordance with currently accepted technical
standards that the proposed fill will not result in any increase in the BFE
All fill placed in the SFHA shall meet or exceed the following standards:
      (1)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Manager may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports
that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and adjacent
properties. When required, H&H analyses shall be undertaken only by a
professional engineer who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resulting study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Manager. During permit
review the Floodplain Manager shall consider the following issues that have the
potential to cause adverse impact to the subject property and adjacent
properties:
         A.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
         B.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
         C.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
         D.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating erosion
problems.
          E.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when determining
whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and adjacent
properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst topography,
stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.   
      (2)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
      (3)   A Fill Site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with pre construction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
Ordinance and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
      (4)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in subsection (e)(8) below. For non residential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
      (5)   At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty five (25)
percent of the perimeter of a non residential structure.
      (6)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
      (7)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary stability
and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction standards must
be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention is necessary
when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
      (8)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Manager.
      (9)   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
         A.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five (5) feet per second or less
will be protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or
similar vegetative undergrowth.
         B.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five (5) feet per
second will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
       (10)   All applicants placing fill in a SFHA area shall obtain a
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed to do so
by the Floodplain Manager before a permit can be issued. After fill is finished
the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map Revision based on
Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy can be issued. The
Floodplain Manager is hereby appointed as the designated official to approve a
request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall cooperate with the applicant
with respect to any requirements of FEMA for requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-
F), which includes, but is not necessarily limited to, approving said request
and executing Form 1, “Overview & Concurrence Form” or other form as may be
required by FEMA.
      (11)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the FEMA to revise the FIS and/or FIRM, when notified by
the Floodplain Manager, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development.  All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of flood water.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
      (2)   In so far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools, above ground gas and
storage tanks located at or below the BFE shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation or lateral movement.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback.
      (1)   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of fifty (50) feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from
the top of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas
wells and well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100
feet from any perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or
wetland. [See W.Va. Code §22-6A-12(b)]. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation
shall be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along
the watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall
be given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and
enhance aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection at the discretion of the Floodplain Manager.
      (3)   At the discretion of the Floodplain Manager the Flood Protection
Setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback Area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
    (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below the BFE except for mineral storage properly and wholly within the ground
in compliance with other State environmental agency(ies) requirements.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles “fill” material
shall not be considered “storage” material for purposes of this subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage.  Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within zones AH and
AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures
   (l)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the SFHA.

FIRM and/or FIS in effect at the time the extension is granted. All work on the
proposed development must be completed within eighteen (18) months of permit
issuance, at which time the permit shall expire, unless a time extension made
in writing to the Floodplain Manager and filed in the official Floodplain
Permit File by the Floodplain Manager is granted in writing by the Floodplain
Manager. The request for a time extension shall be in writing and shall state
the reasons for the extension. When considering an extension, the Floodplain
Manager shall consider the following criteria:
      (1)   Has the applicant diligently pursued the completion of the proposed
development during the eighteen (18) months?
      (2)   Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public safety,
health, or welfare or injurious to other property?
   (h)   Stop Work Orders, Inspections and Revocations.
      (1)   Stop Work Orders.
         A.   The Floodplain Manager shall issue, or cause to be issued, a

subject the violator to the penalties described in Section
1765.08(d).
         B.   The Floodplain Manager shall issue, or cause to be issued, a
“Stop Work Order Notice” for any development found non compliant with the
provisions of this article and/or the conditions of the Floodplain Permit.
Disregard of a Stop Work Order notice shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1765.08(d).
         C.   In the event that the Floodplain Manager issues a Stop Work Order
Notice, the Floodplain Permit shall be stayed pending a determination of
whether a violation actually occurred and/or abatement of the alleged
violation, whichever occurs first.
         D.   In the event of an Appeal on a Floodplain Permit, the Floodplain
Manager shall immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall remain in
effect until a resolution of said Appeal.
      (2)   Inspections and Revocations.
         A.   During the development period, the Floodplain Manager or other
authorized County, State or Federal Government Officials may inspect the
premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the
information provided on the Floodplain Permit Application, this article and
with all applicable Federal, State and County laws, Regulations and Ordinances.
          B.   If the Floodplain Manager discovers that the work does not
comply with the Floodplain Permit Application, this article or that there has
been a false statement(s) or misrepresentation(s) by any applicant in the
permitting process, the Floodplain Manager shall issue a “Stop Work Order
Notice”, revoke the permit and request a temporary injunction in the Circuit
Court of Ohio County. The Floodplain Manager shall notify any appropriate
agency or authority if the Floodplain Manager finds a violation of any non
Floodplain Law, Regulation or Ordinance
         C.   The Floodplain Manager or other authorized County, State or
Federal Government Officials may inspect any development covered by this or
previous Floodplain Ordinances to determine whether any portion of the
development has been altered to be non compliant with the requirements of this
article or other Ordinances.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In the SFHA it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to permit the
occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof hereafter
created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or partly altered or
enlarged in its use or structure until a Certificate of Compliance has been
issued by the Floodplain Manager stating that the building or land conforms to
the requirements of this article. Occupying or using a building or premises in
violation of this section shall subject the violator to the penalties described
in Section
1765.08(d).
      (2)   In the SFHA it shall be unlawful to inspect and approve a permanent
utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part thereof
hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the utility inspector is
in possession of a copy of the Certificate of Compliance issued by the
Floodplain Manager stating that the particular development being inspected
conforms to the requirements of this article. Inspection and approval of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1765.08(d).
      (3)   A Certificate of Compliance shall be issued by the Floodplain
Manager upon satisfactory completion of all development in the special flood
hazard.
      (4)   Issuance of the Certificate of Compliance shall be based upon the
inspection conducted as prescribed in this Ordinance and any finished
construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing certificate,
or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a condition of the
Floodplain Permit approval process.
   (j)   Fees.  All fees are waived if the appropriate Floodplain permit
application is provided. Failure to do so is subject to penalty.
   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a building
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the City of Wheeling for the additional
cost of processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover
this cost the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by
the same person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this article in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein. (Ord. 15476. Passed 10-20-20.)
1765.08 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals.  Whenever a person or entity is aggrieved by a decision of
the Floodplain Manager with respect to the provisions of this article, it is
the right of that person or entity to appeal to the Building Code Board of
Appeals sitting as the Floodplain Appeals Board. Such appeal must be filed with
the Appeals Board or Floodplain Manager in writing, within thirty (30) days
after notification of the decision of the Floodplain Manager as announced at a
regularly scheduled Planning Commission Meeting. Said Appeal shall be served by
the aggrieved person by regular mail on all interested parties on the date that
said Appeal is filed. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Building Code Board of
Appeals shall set a time, date and place not less than ten (10) days nor more
than sixty (60) calendar days for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of
the time, date and place of the hearing shall be given to all interested
parties by placing an announcement of said hearing date, time and place on the
agenda of the next regularly scheduled Building Code Board of Appeals meeting
notice and to announce the date, time and place of the appeal hearing not
sooner than ten (10) calendar days from said announcement date, at which time
all may appear and be heard. The determination by the Building Code Board of
Appeals shall be final in all cases, subject to any Appeal to the Circuit Court
of Ohio County, West Virginia or any other Court of competent jurisdiction.
   In the event an Appeal is filed wherein a Floodplain Permit grant has been
ruled by the Floodplain Manager, the Floodplain Manager shall immediately issue
a Stop Work Order Notice that shall remain in effect until a resolution of said
appeal.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria. All appeals contesting only the permit fee,
the cumulative substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback
requirement, or the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of
the Building Code Board of Appeals.
   (c)   Variances.  If compliance with any of the requirements of this article
would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or
landowner, the City of Wheeling may, upon request, grant relief from the strict
application of the requirements.
    Considerations for the issuance of Variances to this article shall adhere
to the following criteria:
      (1)   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances.
      (2)   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the SFHA, to
afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria, shall not be
considered sufficient justification to grant a variance.
      (3)   An affirmative decision granting a Floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the BFE will result in
increased premium rates for flood insurance, and (ii) such construction below
the BFE increases risk to life and property. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all decisions as required in this article; and
      (5)   The Building Code Board of Appeals shall (i) maintain a record of
all decisions including justification for the decisions, and (ii) report such
decisions issued in its biannual report to FEMA.
      (6)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for issuance of a
Floodplain variance for any construction, development use or activity within
any Floodway Area that would cause any increase in the BFE.
   (d)   Penalties. Any person, who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or direction or Order of the
Floodplain Manager, or any other authorized employee of, shall be unlawful and
shall be referred to the City of Wheeling Legal Department who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Wheeling of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. Each day
during which any violation of this article continues shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or non
compliance with, this article shall not excuse the violation or non compliance
with the article or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be
required to correct or remedy such violations or non compliance within a
reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or
relocated in non compliance with this article may be declared by the City
Manager and/or City Council to be a public nuisance and abated as such subject
to other applicable laws and exhaustion of appellate rights.

   To incorporate and enhance within this Chapter recitals of the various
administration, enforcement and penalty provisions historically utilized by
Code Enforcement Officials and City Administration; to note various other
sections of the Codified Ordinances that are applicable and cross reference,
where necessary, the International Property Maintenance Code. The Council
desires to assist the Code Enforcement Officials in carrying out their duties
of code enforcement which includes, but is not limited to, providing an ability
in expediting the citation process for a number of common Code violations which
regularly occur within the City which violations create adverse affects thereby
protecting the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry. (Ord. 15251. Passed
5-7-19; Amended by Ord. 15537. Passed 4-20-21.)
1775.02 GENERAL PURPOSE.
       (a)   Nothing in this article prohibits Code Officials, City
Administrators or Law Enforcement to utilize numerous sections of the Codified
Ordinances and the Administration and Enforcement process as well as penalties
associated thereto. In addition, Health and Building Code Inspectors are
authorized to issue citations requiring remediation of Code violation within an
expedited timeframe prior to penalties and fines being operational. Such fines
shall be set in accord with the fines imposed by the City Municipal Court for
such violations at the time of the violation. A copy of the current City
Municipal Court Chart entitled Municipal Court - City of Wheeling Fines -
Property Maintenance Code Violations, delineating the fines for Property
Maintenance Code violations and the citation format is attached to Ordinance #
15251 adopted on May 7, 2019 for reference, however the Chart and Citation
letter may from time to time be modified by the Court or Building Code Official
and placed on file within such Court, Department and/or Office of the City
Clerk. (Ord. 15251. Passed 5-17-19 Amended by Ord.15537. Passed 4-20-21.)
    (b)   As the City of Wheeling has seen that there are individuals and/or
landowners who are repeat offenders with violations of the Building and
Property Maintenance Codes. These infractions are repetitive in nature and
therefore those responsible persons and/or individuals are aware of the City
Codified Ordinances and the penalties associated therewith. Therefore the
municipality is creating an ENHANCED PENALTY PROVISION for repeat offenders
which requires the Court to mandatorily impose the highest possible monetary
penalty, along with mandatory community service which must be performed in
addition to and not in lieu of other penalties and fines being administered by
the Court.
(Ord. 15537. Passed 4-20-21.)
1775.03  GENERAL PENALTY AND ENHANCED PENALTY SECTION.
   (a)   See International Property Maintenance Code at §112.4 - Failure to
Comply. Unless otherwise stated in a Local, State or Federal law applicable to

person is directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition, shall
be liable to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) per violation. Each day that a violation
persists may constitute a separate violation subject to additional fees.
Reasonable costs incurred for enforcement shall also apply. Administrative
costs and court costs applicable to all violations of not less than fifty
dollars ($50.00) per violation.
(Ord. 15251. Passed 5-17-19; Amended by Ord. 15537. Passed 4-20-21.)
   (b)   Notwithstanding other applicable penalty sections, including but not
limited to those in Article
1775 of the City Codified Ordinances, the City of Wheeling shall impose an
Enhanced Penalty to those repeat offenders, who are found guilty/plead guilty/
plead no contest, if identified by the Court as follows: (1) Those property
owner(s) who are given similar citations for similar offenses and/or return to
Court for such similar repeat violations; (2) Landowners who are given similar
citations for similar offenses and/or return to court for such similar repeat
violations, even if such violation occurs upon other properties not previously
cited, so long as said Landowner has been previously on notice of such
violations, which are similar in character, and/or the City of Wheeling has
previously issued Building and Property Maintenance Code violations on other
properties owned and/or managed by said property owner. Those who are found
guilty/plead guilty/ plead no contest, if identified by the Court, for such
repeat and/or recidivist violations and/or being such repeat and/or recidivist
violators, the Court is required to mandatorily impose the highest possible
monetary penalty, along with mandatory community service which must be
performed in addition to and not in lieu of other penalties and fines when such
