EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

   Police officers are authorized to provide for the removal and impounding of
a vehicle under the following circumstances:

   (f)    When any vehicle has been damaged or wrecked so as to be inoperable

Article 17C-15 whereby its continued operation would constitute a condition
hazardous to life, limb or property.
   (g)    When any vehicle is left unattended due to the removal of an ill,

   (j)    When any vehicle is found for which two or more citation tags for

   (k)    When any vehicle is parked on or in front of a public or private
driveway so as to prohibit vehicular ingress and egress to such property,
without the consent of the person having the right to the possession of the
property.
   Any vehicle removed under authority of subsection (b) hereof shall be
disposed of as provided under West Virginia Code Article 17-24.
307.02 REPORT REQUIRED; NOTICE TO OWNER.
   Any police officer removing or causing any vehicle to be removed and stored
for safe keeping under the provisions of this article shall, as soon as
practicable, make a report of such action to the officer in charge at the
police station, giving in such report the license registration number, state of
registration if any, make and type of vehicle, place of, and reason for,
removal, as well as the place at which stored. If any such vehicle shall not be
claimed within twenty-four hours from and after the time of such report, either
by the owner or the person in charge thereof, the owner of such vehicle shall
be notified by mail of the impounding thereof by the Clerk of the Police Court.
Such notice shall include the facts and matters contained in the report to the
officer in charge and shall also notify such owner of the manner and terms upon
which he may reclaim such vehicle.
307.03 LIABILITY OF OWNER FOR COSTS.
   The owner or person in charge of any vehicle impounded under the provisions
of this article shall pay the costs of impounding, hauling, driving, towing and
storing such vehicle, in addition to any fine and costs assessed against him
for any violation of the provisions of this Traffic Code or other ordinance of
the Town resulting from the parking of such vehicle or otherwise, or arising
out of any act resulting in the impounding of such vehicle.
307.04 POST-STORAGE HEARINGS FOR IMPOUNDED VEHICLES.
   (a)    Right to Hearing. As to any vehicle impounded pursuant to any
ordinance of the Town, by its agents or employees, a person who has a legal
entitlement to possession of the vehicle has a right to a post-seizure
administrative hearing to determine whether there was probable cause to impound
the vehicle if such person files a written demand on forms so provided for such
a hearing, with the Town within five days after such person has learned such
vehicle has been impounded or within five days after the mailing of the date
set in the notice of stored vehicle, whichever occurs first, the notice of
stored vehicle shall be sent in the mail to the legal and registered owner or
their agent and to the garage where the vehicle is stored within twenty-four
hours, in cases of out-of-state vehicles forty-eight hours, excluding weekends
and holidays, after impounding and storage of the vehicle.
   (b)    Conduct of Hearing.
      (1)    A hearing shall be conducted before the Municipal Police Judge
within twenty-four hours of receipt of a written demand therefor from the
person seeking the hearing unless such person waives the right to a speedy
hearing. Saturdays, Sundays and Town holidays are to be excluded from the
calculation of the twenty-four hour period. The sole issue before the Police
Judge shall be whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in
question.
      (2)    "Probable cause to impound" means such a state of facts as would
lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there was
sufficient breach of local, state or federal law to grant legal authority for
the removal of the vehicle.
      (3)    The Police Judge shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner
and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the
hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right
to possession of the vehicle. The Police Department shall carry the burden of
establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the Police Judge shall prepare a written
decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person demanding the
hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle, if not the person requesting
the hearing. The Police Judge's decision in no way affects any criminal
proceeding in connection with the impound in question and that any criminal
charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in the appropriate
court. The decision of the Police Judge is final. Failure of the registered or
legal owner, or their agent to request or attend a scheduled post-seizure
hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to such hearing.
   (c)    Decision of the Police Judge. The Police Judge shall only determine
that as to the vehicle in issue either there was probable cause to impound the
vehicle or there was no such probable cause, and in the event that the Police
Judge determines that there was no probable cause, the Police Judge shall
prepare and date a Certificate of No Probable Cause, copies of which shall be
given to the possessor of the vehicle and the Police Department. Upon receipt
of the possessor's copy of such certificate, the garage having custody of the
vehicle shall release the vehicle to its possessor. Upon a finding of no
probable cause, towing and storage fees shall be paid by the Town in accordance
with arrangements made between the Town and the garage. If the possessor fails
to present such certificate to the garage having custody of the vehicle within
twenty-four hours of its receipt, excluding such days when the garage is not
open for business, the possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent
storage charges. Such certificate shall advise the possessor of such
requirement.
307.05 TOWN NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES.
   The Town, its agents, officers or employees shall not be liable for any
damages to persons or property resulting directly or indirectly from any act
done or performed under the provisions of this article.
307.06 AUTHORITY OF THE MAYOR.
   The Mayor is hereby authorized to rent suitable spaces in garages, parking
lots or elsewhere for the storage and safekeeping of the vehicles impounded
under the provisions of this article and he is also authorized to enter into
contracts and agreements for the removal, towing and storage of vehicles coming
within the provisions hereof, with persons having equipment suitable for the
hauling away and towing of such vehicles. The Mayor is also authorized to issue
and promulgate any suitable rules and regulations which he may deem proper or
necessary in order to fulfill, advance and carry into effect the purposes and
provisions of this article.
307.07 SALE OF UNCLAIMED VEHICLES.
   (a)   If any vehicle impounded and stored under the provisions of this
article is not claimed by the owner, operator or other person entitled to the
possession thereof within thirty days from and after the date the same is
impounded, such vehicle may be sold at public auction by the Chief of Police,
or by the persons storing the same under provisions of this article, but before
any such sale shall be made, ten days' notice of the date, place and purpose of
such sale with a description of the vehicle to be sold shall be served upon the
owner of record of such vehicle by registered mail at his last known address
and like notice of such sale shall be published once each week for two
successive weeks prior to the date of such sale in a newspaper of general
circulation in the Town. If the owner of any such vehicle is unknown; then no
notice to such owner shall be necessary but the newspaper publication shall be
made and the facts with regard to the ownership of the vehicle set forth in
such notice.
   (b)   In the making of any sale hereunder the Chief of Police may continue
the same by verbal announcement at the time and place of such sale, and in the
making of any such sale of any such vehicle he may act by agent or attorney.
   (c)   The proceeds from any such sale of any such vehicle shall be applied,
first, to the costs of such sale; second, to the hauling, towing and storage
charges thereof; third, to the payment of any fine and costs incurred by reason
of any violation of the provisions of this Traffic Code or other ordinance of
the Town; and fourth, to the payment of any bona fide lien owner who intervenes
or establishes a bona fide claim to such sum. Any balance remaining shall be
paid to the owner of such vehicle, if he is known, or if unknown, shall be paid
to the general receiver of the Circuit Court of the County, to be disposed of
by him as provided by the statutes of the State. In the event that no person
shall claim any such funds in the hands of the general receiver for a period of
twenty years, the principal of such fund together with the interest thereon
shall be paid into the General Fund of the Town by the general receiver.
307.08 IMMOBILIZATION OF CERTAIN VEHICLES.
   (a)    Authority of Police. When any police officer of the Town finds on a
City street a vehicle which has in the past been cited for a traffic violation
and which violation has not been disposed of in the Police Court in accordance
with the ordinances pertaining thereto, or which vehicle is in violation of the
provisions of this Traffic Code and the police officer deems it necessary, in
order to enforce such provisions, that an immobilizer be used, then such police
officer may immobilize such vehicle by installing or attaching a device thereto
until the owner or driver thereof has satisfied any existing and past
violations in accordance with the ordinances pertaining thereto.
   (b)    Notice. Whenever any such vehicle is so immobilized, a notice in
writing, on a form to be prescribed by the Police Chief, shall be conspicuously
affixed to such vehicle advising the owner or driver thereof that such vehicle
has been immobilized for violation of the Town ordinances enumerated thereon,
and indicating the procedure to obtain the release of such immobilizer.
   (c)    Moving Vehicle Prior to Obtaining Release Prohibited. No unauthorized
person shall move any vehicle immobilized pursuant to subsection (a) hereof
prior to obtaining a release thereof from the Judge of the Police Court or from
the officer in charge at the police station.
   (d)    Additional Fine. The owner or driver of any vehicle which has been
immobilized shall, in addition to the fines and penalties provided for under
the provisions of this Traffic Code pay a fine of five dollars ($5.00) before
releasing such vehicle.

   (a)    Green alone or "go":
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02 , may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at

the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)    Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)    Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)    Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to

      (2)    A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at

as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one- ay street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such

can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)    Red with green arrow:
      (1)    Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)    No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)    In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.

with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)    Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.

credit for any period of actual confinement he or she served upon arrest for
the subject offense.
   (j)   A person violating any provision of subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f)
or (g) of this article, for the second offense under this section, is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be confined in jail for not
less than six months nor more than one year and the court may, in its
discretion, impose a fine of not less than $1,000 nor more than $3,000.
   (k)    For purposes of subsection (l) of this article relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses under this
section:
      (1)    Any conviction under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), (d),
(e), (f), (g) or (h) of West Virginia Code Section 17C-5-2, or under a prior
enactment of said code section for an offense which occurred within the ten-
year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current proceeding;
      (2)    Any conviction under a municipal ordinance of this state or any
other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state of an
offense which has the same elements as an offense described in subsection (b),
(c), (d), (e), (f), (g), (h) or (i) of West Virginia Code Section 17C-5-2,
which offense occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the
date of arrest in the current proceeding; and,

a second offense under this article if the person has been previously arrested
for or charged with a violation of this article which is alleged to have
occurred within the applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding
the fact that there has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the
alleged previous offense. In that case, the warrant must set forth the date,
location and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No person may be

(b), (c), (d), or (e), of this article, or any person permitted to drive as
described under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally
entitled to use alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug does not constitute a
defense against any charge of violating subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or
(g) of this article.
   (n)    For purposes of this section, the term "controlled substance" has the
meaning ascribed to it in West Virginia Code Section 60A-1-1 et seq.

333.011 DEFERRAL OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS FOR CERTAIN FIRST OFFENSES UPON
CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM;
PROCEDURE ON CHARGE OF VIOLATION OF CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (g) of this article, whenever any
person who has not previously been convicted of any offense under this code or
under any statute of the United States or of any state relating to driving
under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance or any other drug;
      (1)   Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)    Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under Part Three, Chapter Five, Article
333.01 (c) of this Code.
The court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the
accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding any provisions of
this code to the contrary, place him or her on probation, which conditions
shall include that he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol
Test and Lock Program as provided in West Virginia Code Section 17C-5A-3a.
   (b)   (1)   If the defendant, during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol
Test and Lock Program has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor
Vehicles, or has failed to successfully complete the program before making a
motion for dismissal pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the court may
issue such process as is necessary to bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)    When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (3)    Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant's right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)    When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the city attorney who shall within thirty days after service advise
the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such objections on
the defendant or the defendant's attorney. If there are no objections filed
within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter dismiss the charges
against the defendant. If there are objections filed with regard to the
dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in subsection (b)(1)
of this article.
   (d)    Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of this article,
discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of
guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities
imposed by law upon conviction of a crime except for those provided in article
five-a of the West Virginia Code. The effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense.
   (e)    There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)    No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
article: (1) In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision
of Part Three, Chapter Five, Article
333.01  of this Code has been charged; (2) if the person holds a commercial
driver's license or operates commercial motor vehicle(s); (3) if the person has
previously had his or her driver's license revoked under West Virginia Code
Section 17C-5-2(a) or under any statute of the United States or of any state
relating to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance or
any other drug; or (4) if the person refused the secondary chemical test
pursuant to West Virginia Code Section 17C-5-7.
   (g)    (1)    After a period of not less than one year which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this article, the person may apply to the circuit court for an
order to expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her
arrest, trial and conviction, pursuant to this article except for those
maintained by the Division of Motor Vehicles: Provided, That any person who has
previously been convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement
pursuant to this section.
   (h)    Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, any
person prosecuted for a violation of Part Three, Chapter Five, Article
333.01 (c) of this Code, whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions
of this article shall be liable for any court costs assessable against a person
convicted of a violation of said offense. Payment of such costs may be made a
condition of probation. The costs assessed pursuant to this article, whether as
a term of probation or not, shall be distributed as other court costs. (Passed

any residential street, or in any parking area, or upon the ways of any
institution of higher education, whether public or private or upon the property
of the Board of Education, or upon any property within the Town park and public
recreation system, in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or
property.

which have been temporarily closed for racing sport events or which may be set
aside by the Town within the park and recreation system for exclusive use by
motorcycles or other recreational vehicles.
333.03 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   Any person who drives a motor vehicle upon the public streets or
highways of this Town shall be deemed to have given his consent by the
operation thereof, subject to the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-1 et
seq. to a preliminary breath analysis and a secondary chemical test of either
his blood, breath or urine for the purposes of determining the alcoholic
content of his blood. A preliminary breath analysis may be administered in
accordance with the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-5 whenever a police
officer has reasonable cause to believe a person to have been driving a motor
vehicle upon the public streets or highways while under the influence of
alcohol, controlled substance or drugs as prohibited by Section
333.01. A secondary test of blood, breath or urine shall be incidental to a
lawful arrest and shall be administered at the direction of the arresting law
enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person has been
driving a motor vehicle upon the public streets or highways while under the
influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs as prohibited by Section
333.01. The Police Chief shall designate which one of the aforesaid secondary
tests shall be administered, provided, that if the test so designated is a
blood test, and the person so arrested refuses to submit to such blood test,
then the law enforcement officer making such arrest shall designate in lieu
thereof, either a breath or urine test be administered, and notwithstanding the
provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-7 such refusal to submit to a blood test
only shall not result in the suspension of the arrested person’s license to
operate a motor vehicle in this State. Any person to whom a preliminary breath
test is administered who is then arrested shall be given a written statement
advising him or her that his/her refusal to submit to the secondary chemical
test finally designated as provided in this section, will result in the
revocation of his/her license to operate a motor vehicle in this State for a
period of at least one year and up to life.
   (b)   For the purpose of this article, “law enforcement officer” or “police
officer” means and is limited to any member of the Police Department. Only the
person actually administering or conducting such test shall be competent to
testify as to the results and veracity of such tests.
333.04 INTERPRETATION AND USE OF CHEMICAL TEST.
   Upon trial for the offense of driving a motor vehicle in this Town while
under the influence of alcohol, controlled substance or drugs, or upon the
trial of any civil or criminal action arising out of acts alleged to have been
committed by any person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of
alcohol, a controlled substance or drugs, evidence of the amount of alcohol in
the person’s blood at the time of the arrest or of the acts alleged, as shown
by a chemical analysis of his or her blood, breath or urine, is admissible, if
the sample or specimen was taken within two hours from and after the time of
arrest or of the acts alleged, and shall give rise to the following
presumptions or have the following effect:
   (a)   Evidence that there was at that time five hundredths of one percent
(.05%) or less, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood, shall be prima facie
evidence that the person was not under the influence of alcohol;
   (b)   Evidence that there was, at that time, more than five hundredths of
one percent (.05%) and less than eight hundredths of one percent (.08%) by
weight of alcohol in the person’s blood shall be relevant evidence, but it is
not to be given prima facie effect in indicating whether the person was under
the influence of alcohol;
   (c)   Evidence that there was, at that time, eight hundredths of one percent
(.08%) or more, by weight of alcohol in his or her blood, shall be admitted as
prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcohol;
   (d)   A determination of the percent, by weight, of alcohol in the blood
shall be based upon a formula of:
      (1)   The number of grams of alcohol per one hundred cubic centimeters of
blood;
      (2)   The number of grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of
breath;
      (3)   The number of grams of alcohol per sixty-seven milliliters of
urine; or
      (4)   The number of grams of alcohol per eighty-six milliliters of serum.
   (e)   A chemical analysis of a person’s blood, breath or urine, in order to
give rise to the presumptions or to have the effect provided for in subsections
(a), (b) and (c) hereof, must be performed in accordance with methods and
standards approved by the State Division of Health. A chemical analysis of
blood or urine to determine alcoholic content of blood shall be conducted by a
qualified laboratory or by the State Police Scientific Laboratory of the
Criminal Identification Bureau of the West Virginia State Police.
   (f)   The provisions of this article shall not limit the introduction in any
administrative or judicial proceeding of any other competent evidence bearing
on the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs.
333.05 TAKING A CHILD INTO CUSTODY.
   (a)   A preliminary breath analysis may be administered to a child whenever
a law enforcement official has reasonable cause to believe the child to have
been driving a motor vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her blood,
for the purpose of determining the child’s blood alcohol content. Such breath
analysis must be administered as soon as possible after the law enforcement
officer arrives at a reasonable belief that the child has been driving a motor
vehicle with any amount of alcohol in his or her blood. Any preliminary breath
analysis administered pursuant to this subsection must be administered with a
device and in a manner approved by the Division of Health for that purpose. If
a preliminary breath analysis is administered, the results shall be used solely
for the purpose of guiding the officer in deciding whether the child, at the
time of driving the motor vehicle, had an alcohol concentration in his or her
blood of two hundredths of one percent or more, by weight, and should therefore
be taken into custody to administer a secondary test in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
   (b)   A child may be taken into custody by a law enforcement official
without a warrant or court order if the official has reasonable grounds to
believe the child to have been driving a motor vehicle with any amount of
alcohol in his or her blood. If a preliminary breath analysis is administered
and the results of the analysis indicate that the child has an alcohol
concentration in his or her blood of less than two hundredths of one percent,
by weight, the child may not be taken into custody unless other grounds exist
under West Virginia Code 49-5-8(b). Upon taking a child into custody pursuant
to the provisions of this section, the official shall take all reasonable steps
to cause notification to be made to the child’s parent or custodian or, if the
parent or custodian cannot be located, to a close relative.
   (c)   Upon taking a child into custody pursuant to this section, the
official shall take the child to a facility where a secondary test of the
child’s blood or urine may be administered at the direction of the official or
a test of the child’s breath may be administered by the official. The law
enforcement agency by which such law enforcement official is employed shall
designate whether the secondary test is a test of either blood, breath or
urine. Provided, that if the test so designated is a blood test and the child
refuses to submit to the blood test, then the law enforcement official taking
the child into custody shall designate in lieu thereof a breath test to be
administered. Notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-7, a
refusal to submit to a blood test only shall not result in the revocation of
the child’s license to operate a motor vehicle in this State. Any child taken
into custody pursuant to this section shall be given a written statement
advising him or her that a refusal to submit to a secondary test of either
blood, breath or urine, as finally designated by the law enforcement agency or
official in accordance with this subsection, will result in the suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this State for a period of at
least thirty days or a revocation of the license for a period up to life.
   (d)   If at any point in time the Police Department does not have available
the testing equipment or facilities necessary to conduct any secondary test
which may be administered pursuant to the provisions of this section, then the
official who took the child into custody may request another qualified person
to administer a secondary breath test; provided, that the breath test shall be
administered in the presence of the official who took the child into custody.
The results of such breath test may be used in evidence to the same extent and
in the same manner as if such test had been conducted by the law enforcement
official who took the child into custody. The qualified person administering
the breath test must be a member of the Division of Public Safety, the sheriff
of the county wherein the child was taken into custody or any deputy of such
sheriff, or a law enforcement official of another municipality within the
county wherein the child was taken into custody. Only the person actually
administering the secondary breath test is competent to testify as to the
results and veracity of the test. If the secondary test is a blood test the
test shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of West Virginia Code
17C-5-6.
   (e)   After taking the child into custody, if the law enforcement official
has reasonable cause to believe that the act of the child in driving the motor
vehicle is such that it would provide grounds for arrest of an offense defined
under the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-2 if the child were an adult,
then the official shall proceed to treat the child in the same manner as any
other child taken into custody without a warrant or court order, in accordance
with the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-8.
   (f)   If the results of any secondary test administered pursuant to this
section indicate that the child, at the time of driving the motor vehicle, had
an alcohol concentration in his or her blood of eight hundredths of one percent
or less, by weight, and if the law enforcement official does not have
reasonable cause to believe that the act of the child in driving the motor
vehicle is such that it would provide grounds for arrest for an offense defined
under the provisions of this article if the child were an adult, then the
official shall release the child: Provided, that if the results of any
secondary test administered pursuant to this section indicate that the child at
the time of driving the motor vehicle, had an alcohol concentration in his or
her blood of two hundredths of one percent or more, by weight, the child shall
only be released to a parent or custodian, or to some other responsible adult.
333.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever violates Section
333.02 shall be fined not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00).

or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or

501.99  and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;

      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

well as the use of unimproved driveways within front and side yards, causes
ruts, ditches, and mud holes that are unsightly and detract from the values of
other properties within any such neighborhood, and that the placement and
movement of motor vehicles and other personal property within grassy or
otherwise unimproved areas of front and side yards, creates potential danger to
the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. As a result, the Town
finds it necessary to regulate the same through the adoption of this article.
526.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this article, the following words and phrases shall have
the meaning respectively assigned to them by this section:
   (a)   “Motor vehicle” shall include motor vehicles and motorcycles as
defined within Section 17A-1-1 of the West Virginia Code.
   (b)   “Other personal property” shall include utility or other types of
trailers meant for the hauling of items thereon, boats or other watercraft,
motor homes, campers, and vacation trailers. For the purposes of this article,
the term “boats or other watercraft” shall not include watercraft which do not
require a trailer to transport them.
   (c)   “Unimproved area” shall mean an area which has not been constructed
for the parking of motor vehicles and other personal property to standards
adopted by the Town Engineer.
   (d)   “Improved area” shall mean an area which has been constructed for the
parking of motor vehicles and other personal property to the standards adopted
by the Town Engineer. In constructing an “improved area” the use of concrete,
asphalt, pavers, and gravel shall be allowed if done in a manner meeting the
standards and specifications set by the Town Engineer.
526.03 PARKING PROHIBITED.
   No person shall park or place a “motor vehicle” or “other personal property”
within the grassy or otherwise unimproved area of any front or side yard.
526.04 DRIVEWAYS.
   All driveways shall be required to be improved in accordance with the
standards applicable to improved areas.
526.05 IMPROVED AREAS.
   The Mayor shall require the Town Engineer to adopt “improved area” standards
for the construction of parking areas and driveways for the purpose of this
article. Should there be any question as to whether any front or side yard
parking area or driveway meets the requirements of this article, it shall be
the duty of the Town Engineer to examine the same and render an opinion. Should
any property owner allow an improved area to deteriorate to a point where in
the judgment of the Town Engineer the area no longer meets the intent and
purpose of an improved area as described in this article, the Town Engineer
shall inform the property owner in writing of said deterioration and therein
describe what needs to be done in order to correct the situation. Any property
owner who disagrees with the Town Engineer’s decision regarding their realty,
within 10 days of receiving the Town Engineer’s written decision, may appeal
the decision to the Town Manager. The Town Manager’s decision in the matter
shall be final.
526.06 TEMPORARY USE.
   (a)   The Town recognizes that there may be isolated instances in which a
property owner might need to temporarily utilize unimproved areas of his/her
front and side yard for purposes otherwise prohibited by this article. For that
reason the provisions of this article shall not apply to the temporary (less
than 12 hours) parking of a motor vehicle or utility trailer within the yard
for purposes of loading and unloading materials or equipment; nor shall it
apply to temporary parking of motor vehicles or utility trailers used in
conjunction with permitted construction or repair activities on the premises.
   (b)   In addition to the foregoing paragraph, should a property owner or
occupant of a structure desire to utilize a front or side yard in a manner
prohibited by this article, that individual shall be allowed to file a written
request for permission to do so with the Mayor. Should the Mayor determine,
based upon the particular facts applicable to the request in question, that the
request should be granted, the Mayor shall notify the applicant in writing that
his or her request has been approved. The Mayor’s letter of approval shall set
forth the specific date and time period for which the exception to the parking
requirements of this article will be allowed, and additional conditions that
the Mayor may deem necessary. No such exception shall be for a period of more
than 12 hours.

judicial relief in the form of a restraining order or injunctive relief from a
court of competent jurisdiction in those cases in which a property owner
refuses to comply with the requirements of this article or a decision by either
the Town Engineer or Mayor regarding the same.

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)    Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment

   As used in this article, unless the context otherwise requires:
   (a)   “Antique firearm” means:
      (1)   Any firearm, including, but not limited to, a firearm with a match
lock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system which was
manufactured on or before 1898;
      (2)   Any replica of any firearm described in subsection (a)(1) hereof if
such replica is not designed or redesigned to use rimfire or conventional
centerfire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United
States and which is not readily available in the ordinary channels of
commercial trade; and
      (3)   Any muzzle-loading rifle, muzzle-loading shotgun, or muzzle-loading
pistol, which is designed to use black powder, or black powder substitute, and
which cannot use fixed ammunition. For purposes of this subdivision, the term
“antique firearm” shall not include any weapon which includes a firearm frame
or receiver, any firearm which is converted into a muzzle-loading weapon, or
any muzzle-loading weapon which can be readily converted to fire fixed
ammunition by replacing the barrel, bolt, breechblock, or any combination
thereof.
(b)   "Blackjack" means a short bludgeon consisting, at the striking end, of an
encased piece of lead or some other heavy substance and, at the handle end, a
strap or springy shaft which increases the force of impact when a person or
object is struck. "Blackjack" includes, but is not limited to, a billy, billy
club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (c)   “Concealed” means hidden from ordinary observation so as to prevent
disclosure or recognition. A deadly weapon is concealed when it is carried on
or about the person in such a manner that another person in the ordinary course
of events would not be placed on notice that the deadly weapon was being
carried. For purposes of concealed handgun licensees, a licensee is considered
to be carrying on or about his or her person while in or on a motor vehicle if
the firearm is located in a storage area in or on the motor vehicle.
   (d)   “Controlled substance” has the same meaning as is ascribed to that
term in West Virginia Code 60A-1-101(e).
   (e)   “Deadly weapon” means an instrument which is designed to be used to
produce serious bodily injury or death or is readily adaptable to such use. The
term “deadly weapon” includes, but is not limited to, the instruments defined
in subsections (a) through (h) hereof, inclusive, of this section or other

radiological materials. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
the term “deadly weapon” does not include any item or material owned by the
school or county board, intended for curricular use, and used by the student at
the time of the alleged offense solely for curricular purposes. The term
“deadly weapon” does not include pepper spray as defined in subsection (l)
hereof when used by any person solely for self-defense purposes.

Virginia 60A-1-101(m).

an explosion: provided, that it does not mean an antique firearm as defined in
subsection (a) hereof; except for the purposes of West Virginia Code 48-27-502.
   (h)   "Gravity knife" means any knife that has a blade released from the
handle by the force of gravity or the application of centrifugal force, and

to be used as a weapon, consisting of a sharp-edged or sharp-pointed blade,

limited to, any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and
one-half inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any
other instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds. A
pocket knife with a blade three and one-half inches or less in length, a
hunting or fishing knife carried for hunting, fishing, sports or other
recreational uses, or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement
shall not be included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless the
knife is knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury
or death.
   (j)   “Metallic or false knuckles” means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or
springy material, constructed in a manner that allows the rigid parts to swing
freely so that one rigid part may be used as a handle and the other rigid part
may be used as the striking end.
   (l)   “Pepper spray” means a temporarily disabling aerosol that is composed
partly of capsicum oleoresin and causes irritation, blinding of the eyes, and

received by the hotel operator or upon the expiration of the thirty day payment

return authorized by this article, with the intent to evade the payment of this
tax.
   (b)    Any person willfully violating any of the provisions of this article

thereof, shall be fined not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or

to perform any act, required to be performed by any provision of this article,
in respect of which the violation occurs; provided, that the mere failure to

or notice of such duty, intentionally failed to perform such act.
       (2)    "Evade" means to willfully and fraudulently commit any act with

911.01 ORDER OF COUNCIL; NOTICE TO OWNERS; HEARING.
   Whenever in the judgment of Council the interests of the Town require,
Council may, after giving notice to abutting property owners as hereinafter
provided, order all or any portion of any street, alley, public way or easement
within the Town to be graded, regraded, paved, repaved, surfaced, resurfaced,
curbed, recurbed, permanently improved with sidewalks or otherwise permanently
improved with such material and in accordance with such plans and
specifications therefor as Council may deem suitable, depending upon the
character of traffic and the grade and other conditions of the street, alley,
public way or easement to be so paved or improved, or to build and renew
sidewalks, or curbs, separately, or in conjunction with the paving or improving
of any street, alley, public way or easement or any portion thereof. Before
adopting any such ordinance Council shall cause notice to be given to the
owners of the properties abutting upon such street, alley, public way or
easement proposed to be paved or improved, or sidewalks, or curbs to be built
or renewed and all such property owners shall appear before Council on the date
stated and present any objection they may have to the proposed improvement or
improvements. Such notice may be by personal service on owners at least ten
days before such meeting, and in lieu of personal service, such notice may be
given by publication once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of
general circulation in the Town.
911.02 PREPARATION OF PLANS; NOTICE REQUESTING BIDS.
   After Council shall have determined upon the improvement or improvements to
be made as provided in Section
911.01, it shall be the duty of the Mayor to cause the plans and specifications
to be prepared by the Town Engineer and to cause notice requesting sealed bids
upon the work to be published once a week for two successive weeks in one or
more newspapers of general circulation published in the Town, which notice
shall set forth in general terms the improvement authorized, the deposit or
bond required, and the right to reject any and all bids.
911.03 BIDDER'S DEPOSIT, OPENING BIDS.
   All bids submitted pursuant to the notice for bids provided for by Section
911.02 shall be accompanied by a certified check payable to the Town for the
amount of not less than three percent (3%) nor more than ten percent (10%) of
the aggregate bid. Such bids shall be opened and read publicly in Council.
911.04 LETTING CONTRACT; CONTRACTOR'S BOND; RETURN OF DEPOSITS.
   Unless all bids referred to in Section
911.02 shall be rejected, the contract for the improvement of the street or
alley involved shall be let to the bidder whom Council may deem capable of
doing the work best for the public interest, considering responsibility,
equipment and organization. After Council shall have entered into contract with
such bidder, the Mayor shall at once return to all unsuccessful bidders their
checks or deposits. The successful bidder, within fifteen days after the award
of the contract to him, shall furnish bond with sureties to be approved by
Council in such penalty as Council shall fix not exceeding the aggregate bid.
After such bond shall have been given and approved, the deposit made by the
contractor shall be returned to him; otherwise the same shall be forfeited for
failure either to enter into contract or to furnish bond as aforesaid.
911.05 REJECTION OF BIDS AND PERFORMANCE OF WORK BY TOWN.
   In case Council, after consideration of the estimated cost and
recommendations submitted by the Mayor, shall be of the opinion that no bids
received for the improvement of a street or alley are satisfactory and that the
work can be done by the Town with its equipment and facilities in better manner
or at less cost to the public, Council shall have the right to reject all bids
and cause the work to be done by the Town.
911.06 ESTABLISHING GRADES AND PROPERTY LINES; PETITION FOR IMPROVEMENT.
   Before any street or alley is ordered paved, the grade and property lines
thereof shall be fixed and approved by Council, and the profile thereof
recorded.
   In case persons desire to have any street or alley paved upon their
petition, if no grade and property lines have been fixed and approved as
aforesaid, the persons owning a majority of the frontage shall file their
petition in writing requesting that the grade and property lines be surveyed
and determined by the Town Engineer and approved by Council.
   After approval of the grade and property lines as aforesaid, persons owning
a majority of the frontage may petition Council to order any street or alley
graded, curbed or paved as provided in this article, which petition shall be
accompanied by the plan and profile showing the approved grade and property
lines and shall contain suitable provisions waiving all damages for the
improvement of the street in accordance with the established grade and property
lines thereof as shown upon such plan and profile. Petitions for the
improvement of streets or alleys may also contain offers of payment in cash or
annual installments of ten years or less; and Council may require that the
estimated cost of improvement of any street or alley shall be deposited before
the work is commenced. All petitions and profiles attached thereto shall be
recorded before the work authorized by Council is begun.
   Inasmuch as the proceeds of the sale of bonds may be used legally only for
paving purposes and not for alleged damages, it is provided that where a street
or alley has been improved according to the plan and profile approved by
Council before the work is begun, no claim for damages will be considered by
Council unless substantial changes in the grade have caused material injury to
the abutting property or until it has been established by a court of competent
jurisdiction in the manner provided by law.
911.07 ASCERTAINMENT OF LOT FRONTAGES PRIOR TO COMMENCING WORK.
   Before any work under this article petitioned to be done is commenced,
either under contract or by the Town itself, the Mayor shall ascertain the
respective frontages of lots abutting on such portion of such street or avenue,
and upon the completion of the work, the cost thereof shall be assessed against
the owners of the respective properties abutting on such portion of such street
in accordance with the terms of their petition, and the Finance Director is
hereby authorized and directed to collect such assessments in accordance with
such petition.
911.08 COST AGAINST OWNERS OF ABUTTING PROPERTY.
   (a)    Assessment of Cost . Upon completion of any improvement ordered by
Council under this article, it shall be the duty of the Engineer to cause the
several frontages abutting upon the street or alley so improved to be
accurately measured and to calculate the cost to be assessed against each
abutting owner and against any public service or public utility company, and to
make report thereof to the Mayor. Upon such report the Town Clerk shall publish
notice, and after hearing grievances, if any, Council shall assess the entire
cost of the improvement against the owners of the lots or fractional parts of
lots abutting on the part of the street or alley so improved, subject to the
following provisions:
      (1)    Provided, that where any street or alley improved as aforesaid is
occupied or used by any public service or public utility company under a
franchise or permit requiring it to pave and maintain part of the street or
alley occupied or used by it, the cost of paving or repaving such part shall be
assessed against it for payment in cash as provided by its franchise or permit,
and the remainder of the cost of such improvement, including the intersections
of cross streets and alleys, shall be assessed against the abutting property
owners according to their respective frontages, taking the entire distance the
street or alley is traversed by such company as the basis of such assessment.
      (2)    Provided, that whenever the owners of a majority of the frontage
abutting on both sides of any street or alley improved as aforesaid shall have
petitioned Council to do so, Council shall assess the entire cost thereof
against the property owners abutting on the part so improved, including the
expense of grading the same and of grading and paving the intersections of
cross streets and alleys, taking the entire distance petitioned to be paved as
the unit.
      (3)    Provided, that if any street or alley shall be once graded and
paved with concrete or other permanent base at the cost and expense of the
owners of the property abutting thereon, they shall not be again assessed with
the cost of regrading or repaving the same within fifteen years after the
completion of such grading and paving.
   (b)    Payment of Assessments. The amounts assessed against abutting land
owners under the provisions of this article shall, subject to the following
proviso, be paid in ten annual payments, that is to say, one-tenth of such
amount, together with interest on the whole assessment, shall be paid into the
Town Treasury before May 1 next after such work is completed and such
assessments have been certified to the County Clerk, and a like one-tenth with
interest for one year upon the whole amount remaining unpaid on or before May 1
in each succeeding year thereafter until the whole has been paid. Provided,
however, that when any property owner shall have signed a petition for the
improvement of any street or alley as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
agreeing to pay for such improvement so requested in a period of less than ten
years from the time the assessment of the cost thereof shall become final, then
the land so owned by such petitioner shall be liable to an assessment of the
cost thereof to be paid in accordance with the agreement of such property owner
in such petition; and each of such installments whether they be ten or a less
number, beginning with the first, shall bear interest on the amount of such
installment at six percent (6%) per annum from the date of the record of same
in the office of the Clerk of the County Court until paid. Provided, however,
that any abutting owner so liable for any portion of the cost of such paving
shall have the right at any time after the same is certified as aforesaid to
the Mayor for collection to anticipate the payment of any or all of such
assessments and shall be allowed to pay the face of such assessment with
interest at six percent (6%) per annum only to the time of payment.
   (c)    Collection of Delinquent Assessments; Penalty; Lien. To each of the
installments of assessments under this article remaining unpaid in the Mayor’s
hands on the days specified in this article for the payment thereof, a penalty
of ten percent (10%) shall be added and any assessment remaining unpaid in such
Director's hands on such date shall be taken up by Council on such settlements
had with the Director on such dates, and thereupon Council shall place such
assessments with the penalty added thereto, in the hands of the Chief of Police
and the Tax Collector, to be treated and considered and payment thereof
enforced in the same manner as is now provided for the collection of Town taxes
and assessments, and they shall be a lien upon the property liable therefor the
same as for taxes. The liens herein provided for shall have priority over all
other liens except those for taxes due the State and shall be on a parity with
taxes and assessments due the Town.

913.01 DEFINITIONS.
   The term "sidewalk" includes all of the ground between the face of the curb
of any public street or alley and the property line of the abutting property
owner. The term "sidewalk pavement" means that part of the sidewalk paved or
required to be paved, and may be only a portion of the full width of the
sidewalk as defined above.
913.02 WIDTH OF SIDEWALKS.
   The sidewalks of the streets and alleys of the Town shall be of such width
as Council may, upon recommendation of the Engineer, establish by orders duly
made; and, unless otherwise ordered by Council, the sidewalks on the opposite
sides of any street or alley shall be of equal width.
913.03 DUTIES OF OWNERS AND OCCUPANTS.
   In all cases where there has been heretofore established, or where there is
hereafter established, one or more sidewalks along any street or alley or part
thereof within the Town, it shall be the duty of the owners or occupants of any
ground fronting or abutting on such sidewalks to pave and repave the same,
whenever required by an order of Council to do so, and to keep such sidewalks
in repair and to keep the same clean.
   The property owners shall be responsible for any such sidewalk being out of
repair.
913.04 GRADING AND PAVING.
   Sidewalks shall be graded and paved, and repaved or repaired, in the manner
and with the materials and according to the specifications as provided in this
article.
913.05 PLACING SIDEWALK PAVEMENT ABOVE OR BELOW CURB ELEVATION.
   The paved portion of all sidewalks or the sidewalk pavement where there is a
grass plot between it and the curb, may, at the direction of the Engineer with
the approval of Council, be placed above or below the elevation of the curb in
order to conform as nearly as practicable to the topography of the abutting
land and street; provided, that the slope of such grass plot shall not be
steeper than one and one-half horizontal to one vertical. Where the sidewalk
pavement is placed above or below the elevation of the curb, the owner of the
corner lot shall provide concrete steps from such sidewalk pavement to the
curb, such steps to be of similar materials and workmanship as the sidewalk
pavement and the design thereof to be approved by the Engineer.
913.06 SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION SPECIFICATIONS.
   All sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete pavement according to the
following specifications:
   (a)    Width and Location. Council shall be order prescribe the width of all
concrete sidewalk pavements hereafter paved or repaved, taking into
consideration the nature and class of traffic on such street and sidewalk. Such
sidewalk pavements shall not be less than three feet in width in R1, R2 and R3
Zoning Districts and within the public right of way as designated by the Town
administration, so that the grass plot, if any, shall be between the sidewalk
pavement and the curb line of the street.
   (b)    Subgrade. When the subgrade is composed of a fill it shall be laid in
layers, not exceeding twelve inches, and the same shall be thoroughly wetted
and tamped or rolled. The tops of all fills shall extend at least twelve inches
beyond the sidewalk pavement, and in cases where there are no curbs the slope
shall not be steeper than one and one-half to one.
   (c)    Drainage Course. The drainage course shall consist of coarse
aggregate, as hereinafter defined, of a depth of not less than six inches,
except where solid rock is encountered, and shall be thoroughly compacted by
tamping or rolling.
   (d)    Concrete. The concrete shall consist of a mixture of one part of
cement, as hereinafter defined, and three parts of fine aggregate, as
hereinafter defined, and three parts of coarse aggregate, as hereinafter
defined, to a depth of not less than four inches. It shall be worked to an
approximately true surface and shall be roughened. The concrete pavement shall
be monolithic and no mortar course shall be permissible for surface.
   (e)    Water Used. All water used in mixing materials for sidewalk pavements
shall be clean and free from oil, acid, strong alkalies or vegetable matter.
   (f)    Forms. All forms used for setting sidewalk pavements shall be free
from warp, and of sufficient strength to resist springing out of shape. All
mortar and dirt shall be carefully removed from forms that have been previously
used. All forms shall be well staked to the established lines and grades, as
indicated by the stakes set by the Engineer, and all forms shall be so set as
to provide for the specified slope of one-fourth of an inch to the foot toward
the curb.
   (g)    Expansion Joints. Expansion joints shall be made three-fourths of an
inch wide for the whole of all sidewalk pavements, and shall be spaced at
intervals of not more than forty feet, and shall be filled with sand, felt, tar
or other suitable material. The wearing surface at all expansion joints shall
be cut clear through with a jointing tool.
   (h)    Drainage.  Where the drainage course is at the same elevation as, or
above the drainage course of the curb, a blind drain or ditch of suitable size
and filled with broken stone shall be laid with a proper degree of fall from
the bottom of the drainage course of all sidewalk pavements at such points as
will properly drain the water from the drainage course to the curb. Where the
drainage course of the sidewalk pavement is below that of the curb, a three
inch agricultural tile drain shall be laid in the lower part of the drainage
course, and vitrified tile drainage connection made from it to the storm sewer
in the street.
   (i)    Precautions Against Freezing. Concrete shall not be mixed or
deposited at a freezing temperature, unless special precautions are taken to
avoid the use of materials that are frozen or covered with ice crystals, and
adequate means are provided to prevent the concrete from freezing after being
placed in position and until it is thoroughly hardened; and no such concrete
shall be mixed or deposited in freezing weather, without the written consent of
the Engineer.
   (j)    "Cement", "Fine Aggregate" and "Coarse Aggregate" Defined. "Cement",
as used in this article, shall meet the requirements of the specifications for
Portland cement, adopted by the American Society for Testing Materials, as set
forth in its bulletins and other publications. “Fine aggregate”, as used in
this article, shall consist of clean sharp sand, crushed stone or gravel
screenings, free from all vegetable loam or other deleterious matter. "Coarse
aggregate", as used in this article, shall consist of inert matter, such as
crushed stone, brickbats, gravel or cold crushed slag. All such materials shall
be hard and durable and free from all deleterious matter.
913.07 PERMIT TO LAY SIDEWALK PAVEMENT.
   The owner of any property abutting on a public street shall, before laying
any sidewalk pavement on the part of such street intended to be used for
sidewalk purposes, apply to the Mayor for a permit therefor, and such permit
when granted shall show the location and width of such sidewalk pavement and
shall recite the specifications required therefor. If such application is to
lay a sidewalk pavement on a street within the fire limits on which the width
between the curbs of such street shall be paved has not been determined,
Council shall, before a permit is granted, specify by order, resolution or
ordinance the width of sidewalk pavements on each side thereof, and the
location and width of grass plots, if any; and if a grade has not been
established on such street, Council shall not grant such permit until a grade
is established on such street by the Engineer and adopted by Council. In no
case where a permit is granted to lay a sidewalk pavement shall the work be
commenced until the Engineer shall have first set stakes or had the same done
under his direction, showing the exact location of the same. The Mayor shall
have the power and authority to grant such permits, without referring the same
to Council, and to report the same at the next meeting of Council when it shall
be made a matter of record.
913.08 ORDER TO OWNER TO GRADE AND PAVE.
   Council may order the owner of any property abutting on any public street or
alley within this Town to grade that part of the sidewalk of such street
abutting on such property, if not then already graded, and to construct thereon
a sidewalk pavement, the same to be constructed according to the specifications
therefor. Such grade shall conform to the adopted grade of such street. Such
order shall designate the width of such sidewalk pavement so ordered to be
constructed. The Mayor shall cause notice of such order to be served upon the
owner of such property, such notice to be served in the manner provided by the
laws of the State for the service of notices generally, or by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation published in the County in the manner provided
by the laws of the State for the publication of notices generally.
913.09 WORK TO BE DONE BY TOWN; ASSESSMENT OF COSTS; LIEN.
   If any property owner shall have failed or refused to comply with the order
provided for by the preceding section within fifteen days after the service or
publication thereof, then the Mayor may cause such work to be done, and the
cost thereof, including a commission of not exceeding twenty percent (20%) of
the net cost thereof to the Town for the time of Town employees in supervising
such construction, laying the assessment therefor and collecting the same, over
and above the actual cost to the Town of such work, shall be assessed against
such property. Such assessment shall bear interest at six percent (6%) per
annum and shall be immediately due and payable and may be collected in the same
manner provided by law for the collection of Town taxes. If such assessment is
not paid within thirty days after the same is made, the Recorder may certify
the amount of any such assessment with a description of the property chargeable
therewith, and the name of the owner thereof, to the Clerk of the County Court
to be recorded in the trust deed books of such Clerk's office; and such
assessment shall be and constitute from and after the date of such recordation
the first lien against such property, subject only to State, County and
Municipal taxes and prior assessments.
913.10 REPAIRING AND REPAVING.
   All owners of property abutting upon a public street where there is a
sidewalk shall keep the sidewalk in good repair so as to minimize public or
private liability. Any concrete sidewalk which is broken or deteriorated to the
extent of needing repair shall be repaired by replacing the entire block or
section thereof and not by surface patching.
   The Mayor on his own initiative may or upon direction of Council shall
require any such property owner to make needed repairs by having served upon
such owner a notice as provided by Section
913.08. Each thirty day period during which the owner fails to comply with the
provisions hereof shall constitute a separate violation.
   When deemed proper by the Mayor, he may cause the repairs to be made either
by the Town employees or by an independent contractor and assess the cost
thereof as a lien against the property as provided in Section
913.09.
913.11 MAINTENANCE; REMOVAL OF SNOW, ICE AND DIRT.
   The owner, lessee or occupant of property abutting on any street shall keep
the sidewalk adjacent thereto in a clean and sanitary condition and free from
snow, ice, dirt or refuse. In the event the owner, lessee or occupant of any
property shall fail to keep the sidewalk adjacent to such property in a clean
and sanitary condition and free from snow, ice, dirt or refuse the Mayor is
hereby empowered and authorized to give notice to such property owner, lessee
or occupant to clean such sidewalk of snow, ice, dirt or refuse and to put such
sidewalk in a clean and sanitary condition, such notice to be served as
provided by Section
913.08, and upon the failure or neglect of such property owner, lessee or
occupant to put such sidewalk in a clean and sanitary condition and to remove
snow, ice, dirt or refuse therefrom within twenty-four hours, excluding Sunday,
after such notice has been given, the Mayor may cause the same to be done and
the cost thereof shall be assessed against such property and become a lien upon
such property in the manner provided by Section
913.09.
913.12 CONDEMNATION OF SIDEWALK PAVEMENT; ORDER TO RELAY; WORK BY TOWN.
   When, in the judgment of Council, the public necessity may require it, any
sidewalk pavement may be condemned because of its unsafe condition, or because
it is not laid out of suitable materials or in the manner and according to the
specifications provided therefor; and the owner of the abutting property may be
required to relay the same, after notice of the order of Council, in the same
manner as provided by Section
913.08; and upon the refusal or failure of such property owner to do so, the
Mayor may cause the same to be done and the cost thereof assessed against such
property owner in the manner provided by Section
913.09, and such assessment shall become a lien against such property in the
manner provided by Section
913.09.
913.13 REPAIR OR REPAVING WHEN PAVEMENT BROKEN.
   When any person shall break or injure any sidewalk pavement by driving a
truck or vehicle upon or over the same, or in any other manner, he shall be
required to repair it, or if necessary to relay the same and put it in as good
condition as it was before such injury occurred; and in the event of his
failure to do so, after being served with an order of Council requiring him to
do so, the Mayor may have such sidewalk repaired or relaid and the cost of the
same shall be charged against such person, and collected by legal process; and
where, in order to properly repair such broken or injured sidewalk pavement, it
is necessary to repave the same, such repaving shall be with the materials and
in the manner and according to the specifications set forth in this article.
913.14 SUPERVISION AND INSPECTION OF PAVEMENT CONSTRUCTION; POWER TO STOP
IMPROPER WORK.
   All sidewalk pavements laid under the provisions of this article shall be
under the direct and immediate supervision and inspection of the Engineer, or
his authorized representative. Any owner of property who may desire to lay a
sidewalk pavement or repair the same shall, upon being granted permission
therefor, notify the Engineer of the time he expects to begin such work; and
when, in the judgment of the Engineer such work is not being done with the
materials and in the manner and according to the specifications required by
this article, he shall have the power and authority to stop such work until
such owner indicates his willingness to do such work with the materials and in
the manner and according to the specifications required by this article.
913.99 PENALTY.

service line or lateral sewer which in turn is connected directly or indirectly
to a sanitary sewer. Upon determination that this type of connection has been
made, the Town shall cause the owner to be notified by certified mail that he
shall remove such connections within thirty days. Should the owner fail to do
so, penalties called for under Section
921.99, shall be invoked.
   (h)   Except as otherwise provided in this article, each improved property
shall be connected separately and independently with a lateral through an
independent customer service line. Grouping of more than one improved property
on one customer service line shall not be permitted except under special
circumstances and for good sanitary reasons or other good causes shown and then
only after special permission of the Superintendent as may be prescribed by the
Governing Body; provided, however, a single customer service line may be
permitted to serve a school, mobile home park, apartment house or other
permanent multiple unit property.
   (i)   Where an improved property, at the time connection to a sanitary sewer
is required, shall be served by its own sewage disposal system or device, the
existing sewer line shall be broken on the structure side of such sewage
disposal system or device and attachment shall be made, with proper fittings,
to continue such sewer line as a customer service line. The Superintendent may,
at his discretion, permit the utilization of an existing sewer line provided an
inspection discloses that it is reasonably true to grade and alignment and in
good condition. In case of an existing sewer line utilizing a type of sewer
pipe not specified herein, the Superintendent shall have the right to require
the owner to uncover the full extent of the pipe to determine its condition and
may require its replacement with approved pipe as outlined herein if the
inspection discloses such pipe to be deteriorated in any manner. The cost of
replacing the pipe where necessary, shall be the sole responsibility of the
owner thereof.
   (j)   No customer service line shall be covered until it has been inspected
and approved by the Superintendent or his representative. Every customer
service line shall be maintained in a sanitary and safe operating condition by
the owner of such improved property.

system shall provide the Town with and thereafter shall keep the Town advised
of his or her correct address. Failure of any person to receive bills for sewer
user charges shall not be considered an excuse for nonpayment nor shall such
failure result in an extension of the period of time during which the net bill
shall be payable.
   (d)   Surcharge for High Strength Users: Users discharging any water or
wastes with a thirty day average BOD in excess of 300 milligrams per liter or a
thirty day average suspended solids content in excess of 300 milligrams per

any such user charges or other charges which are delinquent for a period of
thirty days shall, together with a penalty of ten percent (10%) and a
reasonable attorney’s fee, be filed as a lien against the improved property and
premises so connected to and served by the sewer system, which lien shall be
filed in the office of the Clerk of the County Commission of Monongalia County,
West Virginia, and shall be collected in the same manner now provided by law
for the enforcement of tax liens on real property. Such liens shall be of equal
dignity, rank, and priority with a lien on such premises for state, county,
school, and municipal taxes.
   (b)   At the discretion of the Town, it may request that the water service
to any improved property be shut off for nonpayment of sewer user charges if
the bill for sewer user charges is delinquent for a period of fifty days and
such owner shall have received twenty-four hour notice from the Town of the
intention to shut off the water supply, provided such action is not in
violation of any rules of the West Virginia Public Service Commission or the
West Virginia Department of Health. In such event, water service shall not be

by the owner, at his expense, in continuously efficient operation at all times.
   (e)   No statement contained in this ordinance shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Governing Body and
any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the Town for treatment. (Passed 1-8-85)
921.12 ADMISSION OF INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   (a)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the sewer
system any industrial wastes except upon application to the Town and upon
receipt of a written permit therefor. An industrial waste permit shall be in
addition to any other permit required for connection to the sewer system. There
is no fee required for an industrial waste permit.
   (b)   Any person desiring to make or use a connection to the sewer system
through which industrial waste will be discharged into the sewer system shall
file with the Town an Industrial Wastes Questionnaire, to be furnished by the
Town, which shall supply pertinent data, including estimated quantity, flow
characteristics and constituents, with respect to the industrial wastes.
   (c)   Any person who shall discharge industrial wastes into the sewer
system, when required by the Town, shall construct and thereafter properly
maintain at his own expense, a suitable and accessible control manhole and
other devices as may be approved by the Superintendent to facilitate
observation, accurate measurement and sampling by the Town of industrial waste
discharges.

system and contemplating a change in the method of operation which will alter
the characteristics and/or volume of wastes at the time being discharged into
the sewer system shall notify the Town, in writing, at least sixty days prior
to consummation of such change. The Town reserves the right to require improved
properties having large variations in rates of waste discharge to install
suitable regulating devices for equalizing waste flows to the sewer system.
   (e)   The Governing Body reserves the right to impose surcharges on sewer
user charges and/or impose other requirements in connection with any high
strength or industrial waste discharged into the sewer system by agreement with
the owner of the improved property, in accordance with the methods described in
this article, or by modification or alterations to this article as may be
acceptable to the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources and the United
States Environmental Protection Agency, and/or require the pretreatment of such
industrial waste at the expense of such owner.
(Passed 1-8-85)
921.13 CHANGE IN CUSTOMER.
   Each sewer service permit applicant must give written notice to the Town

his premises shall make application therefor directly to the Superintendent.
Only premises which are both vacant and have had the water supply shut off for
one or more complete monthly billing periods are eligible for exoneration from
sewer user charges. No exoneration will be granted for less than one full
month. In the case of premises with private water supply facilities, such
application shall be supported by an affidavit to the effect that such water
supply has been shut off. Application for exoneration must be made at least
five days in advance of the beginning of discontinuance of service. In all
cases involving water service from the Town, such service shall not be restored
until the owner of the improved property has paid the necessary charges for the
reinstallation of the water meter and opening of the water service line.
(Passed 1-8-85)

volition and expense, as outlined in the P.S.C. Rules and Regulations for the
operation of sewer utilities, a refund of a portion of the sewer user charges
paid by customers occupying dwellings served may be made to the builder,
developer or other applicants under the terms of a refund agreement, entered
into between the Governing Body and the builder, developer or other applicants.
Such agreements will provide for refunds not exceeding such amounts and for
such periods as may be authorized by the Governing Body. Each refund agreement
shall be an individual agreement between the interested parties, and shall not
be construed as outlining a definite procedure as to percentage of refund or
the duration thereof. Each and every separate refund agreement shall be
negotiated independently of any other existing similar agreement. In no event
shall the terms of any refund agreement exceed ten years in duration. (Passed

921.18 SANITARY IMPROVEMENT FEE.
   (a)    The Sanitary Improvement Fee shall apply to commercial developers
requesting sanitary sewer service from the Town of Granville. “Commercial
Developer” is defined as an entity, corporation or person who will profit from
commercial construction of housing, schools, churches, restaurants, industrial
buildings, retail stores, hotel/motel, hospital, office buildings, service
stations, swimming pools, shopping centers and any other “commercial
enterprise”.
   (b)    Exempt from the Sanitary Improvement Fee are owners of existing, new
or under construction single-family dwellings, not part of a subdivision or a
tract of land subdivided for commercial or residential development for profit.
   (c)   A Sanitary Improvement fee of twelve hundred dollars ($1,200) per
residential connection shall be paid to the Granville Sewer Board. Non-
residential connections shall charged a Sanitary Improvement fee based on the
chart below based on minimum loading for sewage facilities in Title 64
Legislative Rule Bureau for Public Health, Table 64-47-B. Facilities with large
flows have been adjusted on said chart and are noted on the chart. Non-
residential facilities not shown on the fee chart or facilities that encompass
several categories shall be calculated by the Granville Sewer Board.
   (d)    All collected fees shall be placed in a separate account maintained
by the Granville Sewer Board and shall be used only for Sanitary System
Improvements.
   (e)    Developers requesting a main line extension shall pay the fee before
or at the time construction of the main line starts. The fee shall be based on
the number of proposed structures, single-home lots, apartments or
nonresidential structures.
   (f)    When the development is adjacent to existing sanitary lines, the fee
is due four weeks prior to the requested date of hook up to the sanitary
service. Should the entire development flow to one point where it enters the
Town’s system the fee shall be based on the number of proposed structures,
single-home lots, apartments or nonresidential structures. If the development
flows into the Town’s sanitary system at multiple points, only the proposed
structures, lots, apartments or nonresidential structures serviced by that
section of the development and entering the Town’s system at the point that
service has been requested shall be accessed the fee.
   (g)    A sanitary service tap shall not be installed on any structure within
a development with out written documentation that the Sanitary Improvement fee
has been paid.
   (h)    Existing Structures within a commercial development that have had
sanitary service prior to the enactment of this ordinance shall not be assessed
the Sanitary Improvement fee unless the sanitary effluent capacity has been
increased. (Example: A structure was used as an office building (35 workers fee
would have been $3,010) and is then converted to a restaurant (60 seats fee
$7,740) the fee for the new business would be the difference $4,730).
   (i)    This section shall be effective from the date of its adoption.

1304.14 WIND ENERGY SYSTEM, SMALL.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate the placement,
construction, and modification of small wind energy systems while promoting the
safe, effective, and efficient use of such systems.
   (b)   Applicability. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern
the siting of wind energy systems used to generate electricity or perform work
that may be connected to the utility grid pursuant to West Virginia's net
metering laws, serve as an independent source of energy, or serve in a hybrid
system.
   (c)   Siting Requirements. The requirements for siting and construction of
all small wind energy systems regulated by this section shall include the
following:
      (1)   Small wind energy towers shall maintain a galvanized steel finish,
unless FAA standards require otherwise, or if the owner is attempting to
conform the tower to the surrounding environment and architecture, in which
case it may be painted to reduce visual obtrusiveness. A wind energy tower may
be erected, maintained, or operated on or as an attachment to a building on a
lot. A photo simulation may be required by the Town.
      (2)   Wind energy systems shall not be artificially lighted unless
required by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) or appropriate authority.
      (3)   No tower shall have any sign, writing, or image, except signs
permitted by this code.
      (4)   The applicant shall provide evidence that the proposed height of
the wind energy system tower does not exceed the height recommended by the
manufacturer or distributor of the system. The tower height shall not exceed a
maximum height of seventy (70) feet on a parcel. When situated on or attached
to a building the total height shall not exceed seventy (70) feet. The building
itself shall otherwise conform to the applicable height requirement under this
ordinance.
      (5)   The applicant shall provide evidence that the provider of electric
utility service to the site has been informed of the applicant's intent to
install an interconnected, customer-owned electricity generator, unless the
applicant intends, and so states on the application, that the system will not
be connected to the electricity grid. Notification will take place by having
the electric utility provider sign the conditional use permit application, but
such signature does not construe approval for net metering by the electric
utility.
      (6)   Wind energy systems shall adhere to noise limits as delineated in
Article 527 of the Town of Granville ordinances. These levels, however, may be
exceeded during short-term events such as utility outages or severe windstorms.
      (7)   The applicant will provide information demonstrating that the
system will be used primarily to reduce on-site consumption of electricity.
      (8)   The minimum distance between the ground and any protruding blade
utilized on a small wind energy system shall be fifteen (15) feet, as measured
at the lowest point of the arc of the blades. The lowest point of the arc of
the blades shall also be ten feet above the height of any structure within
seventy-five (75) feet of the base. The supporting tower shall also be enclosed
with a six-foot tall fence or the base of the tower shall not be climbable for
a distance of ten (10) feet.
      (9)   The applicant will provide proof of adequate liability insurance
for a small wind energy system. Whether or not the applicant is participating
in the net metering program, the applicant will be required to meet the
insurance coverage requirements as set forth in W. Va. Code R. 150-33-4 (2011).
      (10)   The small wind energy system generators and alternators should be
constructed so as to prevent the emission of radio and television signals and
shall comply with the provisions of Section 47 of the Federal Code of
Regulations, Part 15 and subsequent revisions governing said emissions.
   (d)   Federal and State Requirements. 
      (1)   Compliance with the Building Code. Building permit applications for
wind energy systems shall be accompanied by standard drawings of the wind
turbine structure, including tower, base, and footings. An engineering analysis
of the tower showing compliance with the Building Code and certified by a
licensed professional engineer shall also be submitted.
      (2)   Compliance with FAA Regulations. Wind energy systems must comply
with applicable FAA regulations.
      (3)   Compliance with National Electric Code. Building permit
applications for wind energy systems shall be accompanied by a line drawing of
the electrical components in sufficient detail to allow for a determination
that the manner of installation conforms to the National Electrical Code.
      (4)   Compliance with regulations governing energy net metering. Wind
energy systems connected to the utility grid must comply with West Virginia
Code Section 24-2F-8 and West Virginia Administrative Code Title 150, Series
33.
   (e)   Setbacks. The wind energy system shall be setback a distance at least
equal to one hundred and ten (110) percent of the height of the tower plus the
blade length from all adjacent property lines and a distance equal at least to
one hundred fifty (150) percent of the tower height plus blade length from any
dwelling inhabited by humans on neighboring property. Additionally no portion
of the wind energy system, including guy wire anchors, may be extended closer
than ten (10) feet to the property line.
   (f)   Removal of Defective or Abandoned Wind Energy Systems. Any wind energy
system found to be unsafe by the Zoning Officer shall be repaired by the owner
to meet federal, state, and local safety standards or removed within six (6)
months. Any wind energy system that is not operated for a continuous period of
twelve (12) months shall be considered abandoned and the owner of the system
shall remove the turbine within ninety (90) days of receipt of notice from the
Town instructing the owner to remove the abandoned wind energy system.

width for a lot in the zoning district in which it is located, the handle is
not to be used in delineating the minimum required lot width. The minimum lot
width shall be taken from the front building setback line. However the handle
shall be used in computing the required minimum lot size, except that in no
case shall the area of the handle constitute more than fifty (50) percent of
the entire lot. Additionally no structures whether primary or accessory shall
be placed in the handle.

from the front lot line adjacent to the street right of way with the greatest
frontage in linear feet. In the case of a lot having no street frontage or a
lot of an odd shape, only the one lot line farthest from any street shall be
considered a rear lot line. Where there is only one lot line other than street
lot lines, it shall be considered the rear lot line.

1306.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT; INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses
for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The
purpose of this chapter is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement,
materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private
property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property
values, the character of the various neighborhoods, the creation of a
convenient, attractive and harmonious community, protection against destruction
of or encroachment upon historic areas, and the safety and welfare of
pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and
encouraging economic development. This chapter allows adequate communication
through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location,
and size of all signs. This chapter shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this
chapter is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which
can be given effect without the invalid provision.
   (b)   Signs not expressly permitted as being allowed by right or by
conditional use permit under this chapter, by specific requirements in another
portion of this code, or otherwise expressly allowed by the Town Council or
Board of Zoning Appeals are prohibited.
   (c)   A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of
identification, protection or directing persons to a use conducted therein
shall be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the
principal use of land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is to
establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to the
land, building or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for their
intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests
identified in subsection (a) of this section.
   (d)   These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible
with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant, landscape and
architecture of surrounding buildings, and that are legible and appropriate to
the activity to which they pertain, are not distracting to motorists, and are
constructed and maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.
   (e)   These regulations distinguish between portions of the Town designed
for primarily vehicular access and portions of the Town designed for primarily
pedestrian access.
   (f)   These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual
speech that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the
Town. Rather, they are intended to regulate those forms and instances that are
most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set forth above.
   (g)   These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms that may
be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an
appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of
visual display while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms
caused by signs.
(Passed 8-28-18.)
1306.02 PERMIT REQUIRED. 
   (a)   A sign permit is required prior to the display and erection of any
sign except as provided in this Code.
   (b)   Application for Permit.
      (1)   An application for a sign permit shall be filed with the Zoning
Officer on forms furnished by the Town of Granville. The applicant shall
provide sufficient information to determine if the proposed sign is permitted
under this code and other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances. An
application for a temporary sign shall state the dates intended for the
erection and removal of the sign. An application for an electronic message
display shall include the manufacturer's statement that the sign has been pre-
programmed, to the extent possible, to conform to the requirements of this
code. Such manufacturer's statement shall include, where applicable, the pre-
stacked sign settings relating to text and graphic features, message change
features, message change time intervals, day and night lighting requirements,
and any other settings capable of limiting the electronic message display such
that it conforms to this code.
      (2)   The Zoning Officer shall promptly process the sign permit
application and approve the application, reject the application, or notify the
applicant of deficiencies in the application within twenty (20) business days
after receipt. Any application that complies with all provisions of this code,
the building code, and other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances shall
be approved.
      (3)   If the application is rejected, the Town shall provide a list of
the reasons for the rejection in writing. An application shall be rejected for
non-compliance with the terms of this code, the building code, or other
applicable law, regulation, or ordinance.
   (c)   A nonrefundable fee shall accompany all sign permit applications. The
permit fee shall be set by Town Council.
   (d)   Duration and Revocation of Permit. If a sign is not installed within
six (6) months following the issuance of a sign permit (or within 30 days in
the case of a temporary sign permit), the permit shall be void. The permit for
a temporary sign shall state its duration, not to exceed thirty (30) days
unless another time is provided in the zoning ordinance. The Town may revoke a
sign permit under any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   The Town determines that information in the application was
materially false or misleading;
      (2)   The sign as installed does not conform to the sign permit
application; or
      (3)   The sign violates this code, the building code, or other applicable
law, regulation, or ordinance.
   (e)   Appeals from the denial or granting of a sign permit shall be made to
the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to the process set out in the zoning
ordinance for appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (Passed 8-28-18.)

      (4)   Neon signs, except in windows.
      (5)   Any sign located in the clear sight triangle formed by any two (2)
or more intersecting streets.
      (6)   Window signs whose aggregate area on a window or door exceed
twenty-five (25) percent of the total area of the window or door.
         (Passed 8-28-18.)
1306.05 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Setback. Except as otherwise permitted, all freestanding signs and
flagpoles shall be set back from any public right-of-way at least the height of
the sign or flagpole.
   (b)   Illumination.
      (1)   Definitions.
         A.   "Candela" means the basic unit of measurement of light in SI
(metric) units.
         B.   "Candela per square meter (cd/m²)" means the SI (metric) unit
used to describe the luminance of a light source or of an illuminated surface
that reflects light, also referred to as Nits.
         C.   "Nit" means a photometric unit of measurement referring to
luminance. One nit is equal to one cd/m².
         D.   "SI (International System of Units)" means the modern metric
system of measurement, abbreviated SI for the French term "Le Systeme
International d'Unites."
      (2)   A sign in any district may be illuminated at night. Signs that are
illuminated at night may not exceed a maximum luminance level of seven hundred
and fifty (750) cd/m² or Nits, regardless of the method of illumination, at
least one-half hour before Apparent Sunset, as determined by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), US Department of Commerce, for
the specific geographic location and date. All illuminated signs must comply
with this maximum luminance level throughout the night, if the sign is
energized, until Apparent Sunrise, as determined by the NOAA, at which time the
sign may resume luminance levels appropriate for daylight conditions.
      (3)   The maximum luminance during daylight conditions, between Apparent
Sunrise and one-half hour before Apparent Sunset, shall be ten thousand
(10,000) cd/m² or Nits.
      (4)   All permitted and conditional use signs may be backlit, internally
lighted, or indirectly lighted, subject to lighting limitations in this code.
All external sign lighting shall have lighting fixtures or luminaires that are
fully shielded.
      (5)   Temporary signs shall not be lighted
   (c)   Material. Signs shall be of quality design, construction, color, and
materials consistent with the design of the building and/or development. This
includes glass, masonry, wood, natural stone, ornamental metalwork, and
ceramics. Paint and metal gilt work are also acceptable. Signs painted on cloth
awnings are permissible. Signs shall be constructed of durable materials.
   (d)   Maximum Height Measurements. Wall signs and other signs with sign
structures not affixed to the ground are measured from the lowest attached
component of the sign to the highest attached component of the sign. The height
for signs with sign structures affixed to the ground is measured as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign, subject to limitations in this article. Normal
grade is the lower of:
      (1)   Existing grade prior to construction; or
      (2)   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating primarily for the purpose of mounting
or elevating the sign.
   (e)   Measurement of Sign Area. Sign area is calculated under the following
principles:
      (1)   With signs that are regular polygons or circles, the area can be
calculated by the mathematical formula for that polygon or circle. With signs
that are not regular polygons or circles, the sign area is calculated using all
that area within a maximum of three abutting or overlapping rectangles that
enclose the sign face.
      (2)   The permitted area of a double-faced a-frame sign shall be
considered to be the area on one side only. If one face contains a larger sign
area than the other, the larger face shall be used in calculating the sign
area.
      (3)   For projecting signs, the sign area also includes the area of the
visible sides of the sign, calculated as a rectangle enclosing each entire side
view.
      (4)   Supports, uprights, or structures on which any sign is supported
shall not be included in determining the sign area unless such supports,
uprights, or structure are designed in such a way as to form an integral
background of the display; except, however, when a sign is placed on a fence,
wall, planter, or other similar structure that is designed to serve a separate
purpose other than to support the sign, the entire area of such structure shall
not be computed.
      (5)   In instances where there are multiple tenants or users on a
property or in a building, allowable sign area for all parties shall not exceed
the maximum sign area computed based upon the number of tenants multiplied by
forty (40) square feet per tenant. In no case shall any tenant sign exceed
forty (40) square feet.
   (f)   Wall Signs. Wall signs shall provide as part of a zoning permit
application:
      (1)   Express permission from the operator and/or owner of the building;
      (2)   The name and address of the person applying or installing the wall
sign; and
      (3)   A clear drawing of the proposed wall sign including dimensions and
its location.
   (g)   Electronic message displays shall be placed perpendicular to
residential structures and shall comply with Federal Communications Commission
regulations, including the avoidance of harmful interference with radio
frequencies. (Passed 8-28-18.)
1306.06 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   Signs lawfully existing on the effective date of this chapter or prior
ordinances, which do not conform to the provisions of this chapter, and signs
which are accessory to a nonconforming use shall be deemed to be nonconforming
signs and may remain except as qualified below. The burden of establishing
nonconforming status of signs and of the physical characteristics/location of
such signs shall be that of the owner of the property.
   (a)   No nonconforming sign shall be enlarged nor shall any feature of a
nonconforming sign, such as illumination, be increased.
   (b)   No nonconforming sign shall be moved for any distance on the same lot
or to any other lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform
in all respects to the provisions of this article.
   (c)   A nonconforming sign that is destroyed or damaged by any casualty to
an extent not exceeding fifty (50) percent of its area may be restored within
six (6) months after such destruction or damage but shall not be enlarged in
any manner. If such sign is so destroyed or damaged to an extent exceeding
fifty (50) percent, it shall not be reconstructed but may be replaced with a
sign that is in full accordance with the provisions of this article.
   (d)   A nonconforming sign which is changed to becoming conforming or is
replaced by a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and
thereafter such sign shall be in accordance with the provisions of this code.
   (e)   A nonconforming sign structure shall be subject to removal. In
addition, a nonconforming sign structure shall be removed if the use to which
it is accessory has not been in operation for a period of one year or more.
Such sign structure shall be removed by the owner or lessee of the property. If
the owner or lessee fails to remove the sign structure, the zoning officer
shall give the owner written notice of fifteen (15) days to remove the sign
structure. Upon failure to comply with this notice, the zoning officer may
enter the property upon which the sign is located and remove any such sign or
initiate such action as may be necessary to gain compliance with this
provision. The cost of such removal shall be chargeable to the owner of the
property.
   (f)   Nonconforming signs shall not be extended or structurally
reconstructed or altered in any manner, except a sign face may be changed so
long as the new face has equal or less sign height and area as the prior sign.
   (g)   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent keeping a
nonconforming sign in good repair. (Passed 8-28-18.)

Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code.
   (b)   All signs and components thereof shall be maintained in good repair
and in a safe, neat, and clean condition.
   (c)   Safety Hazard. The Zoning Officer may cause to have removed or
repaired immediately without written notice any sign which, in his or her
opinion, has become insecure, in danger of falling, or otherwise unsafe, and,
as such, presents an immediate threat to the safety of the public. If such
action is necessary to render a sign safe, the cost of such emergency removal
or repair shall be charged to the owner, person having control, or person
receiving benefit from such sign, with payment due within thirty (30) days of
notice of charges.
   (d)   Nuisance. Any sign which constitutes a nuisance shall be abated by the
owner within thirty (30) days of notice by the Zoning Officer. At any time, the
Zoning Officer may cause the nuisance to be abated with the costs charged to
the owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign,
with payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.
   (e)   Illegal sign and good condition. Any sign which is illegal or in
disrepair shall be made conforming or repaired within thirty (30) days of
notice from the Zoning Officer. If an illegal sign or a sign in disrepair is
not made conforming or repaired, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be
removed or repaired and the cost of such removal or repair shall be charged to
the owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign,
with payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.
   (f)   Expired Permit. Any sign for which a sign permit has expired shall be
removed within five (5) days of the permit expiration. If the sign is not
removed, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be removed and the cost of
such removal shall be charged to the owner, person having control, or person
receiving benefit from such sign, with payment due within thirty (30) days of
notice of charges.
   (g)   Signs located within ten (10) feet of any public right-of-way and in
violation of this code may be impounded at any time.
   (h)   The owner of any commercial sign, other than a permitted off-premise
sign, located on commercial property where the use or business has ceased
operating shall, within sixty (60) days of the cessation of the use or business
operation, remove temporary signs and all aspects of any permanent sign that
refer to the use or business. Property owner may request, in writing, a waiver
of such requirement, if the businesses is temporarily or seasonally
operational, is remodeling, or otherwise has the good will intention of opening
that business back up within one (1) year of time of cessation. (Passed 8-28-
18.)
 
1306.08 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   (a)   Temporary signs require a permit, except as provided in this article,

an event, or no more than (30) days, whichever is less.
   (b)   A use may erect one temporary, off-premises sign on property in any
district with the consent of the persons in charge of such properties, no more

Nonconforming Uses, Lots and Structures
1307.01   Purpose.
1307.02   Nonconforming uses.
1307.03   Nonconforming structures.
1307.04   Nonconforming lots.
1307.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   This purpose of this chapter is to set forth standards and regulations
regarding the continued existence of uses, structures, and lots established
prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance (or any amendment
subsequent thereto) that do not conform to this code. These standards shall
apply to all nonconforming uses, structures and lots, as defined by this code.
   (b)   Nothing in this section prohibits alterations or additions to or
replacement of buildings or structures owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer, or the use of land presently owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer but not used for agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing
purposes, or the use or acquisition of additional land which may be required
for the protection, continuing development, or expansion of any agricultural,
industrial, or manufacturing operation of any present or future satellite
agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing use. (Passed 8-28-18.)
1307.02 NONCONFORMING USES. 
   (a)   These regulations shall apply to any use of a structure or lot in any
zoning district that is a nonconforming use as defined by this code. Whenever
the boundaries of a zoning district shall be changed so as to transfer an area
from one zoning district to another zoning district of a different
classification, these regulations shall apply to any uses which thereby become
nonconforming.
   (b)   A nonconforming use may be sold or otherwise transferred to other
owners, and may be continued as long as the nonconforming use remains otherwise
lawful in accordance with the provisions of this code.
   (c)   Normal structural repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the
continuation of a non-conforming use.
   (d)   Nonconforming uses existing at the time this ordinance was passed, or
at the time a subsequent amendment creates the nonconforming use, may extend:
      (1)   Within the building which housed the nonconforming use at the time
this ordinance was passed, or at the time a subsequent amendment creates the
nonconforming use, provided that the area to which the nonconforming use
extends was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use, and that
no structural alterations are made within the building in order to allow the
use to extend, except those that may be required by the Building Code; or
      (2)   Within the building which housed the nonconforming use at the time
this ordinance was passed, or at the time a subsequent amendment creates the
nonconforming use, provided that such enlargement or extension may occur once
and shall not exceed more than twenty-five (25%) percent of the gross floor
area.
   (e)   Nonconforming uses existing at the time this ordinance was passed, or
at the time a subsequent amendment creates the nonconforming use, may enlarge
the building which housed the nonconforming use at the time this ordinance was
passed, or at the time a subsequent amendment creates the nonconforming use,
and extend within such enlargement, provided that:
      (1)   The enlargement becomes an attached part of the main structure and
does not utilize additional or adjoining land area other than the original
parcel.
      (2)   The enlargement meets all requirements of this Code, including but
not limited to setback and yard requirements.
      (3)   The enlargement is for the purpose of expanding the area housing
the same use which existed at the time this ordinance was passed, or at the
time a subsequent amendment creates the nonconforming use.
      (4)   The enlargement and extension does not:
         A.   Adversely affect the health, safety, and welfare of persons
residing or working in the district;
         B.   Cause a depreciation of the value of other property and uses
permitted in the district;
         C.   Significantly increase traffic congestion;
         D.   Adversely affect the privacy of persons residing in the immediate
vicinity;
         E.   Increase the hazard in the area of fire, offensive noise, smoke,
dust, debris, or other objectionable influences;
         F.   Adversely affect any recreational, institutional, or other
authorized use;
         G.   Inhibit the desirability, feasibility, or likelihood of future
residential or commercial development or expansion in the immediate vicinity.
      (5)   The enlargement or expansion brings all off-street parking
requirements into conformity.
      (6)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may impose such other reasonable
restrictions upon the proposed expansion as deemed necessary to protect the
health, safety, and welfare of persons residing within the vicinity of the
nonconforming use.
      (7)    Enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use or structure shall
be null and void if construction work does not begin within one year from the
date of approval, or in the even such work is suspended or abandoned at any
time after the work is commenced for a period of ninety (90) days.
      (8)   All enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use must comply
with the applicable floodplain management requirements.
   (f)   Upon authorization by the Board of Zoning Appeals, a non-conforming
use may be changed to another equal or less intense non-conforming use.
   (g)   Once a non-conforming use has been changed or converted to a
conforming use, it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use.
   (h)   When a nonconforming use is discontinued for twelve (12) months,
abandonment is presumed and the non-conforming use shall not be allowed to be
re-established. If the property has been abandoned, then any future use of the
land, buildings, or structures shall conform and be in accordance with all
applicable rules, regulations, and requirements of the particular zoning
district wherein the property is located. Abandonment of a nonconforming use
shall be presumed if one (1) or more of the following conditions exists,
indicating intent on the part of the property owner to abandon the
nonconforming use:
      (1)   When the intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent;
      (2)   Utilities, such as water, gas, and electricity to the property have
been disconnected;
      (3)   The property, buildings, and grounds, have fallen into disrepair as
evidenced by proper code violation documentation;
      (4)   When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use;
      (5)   When the nonconforming use has been changed to a use permitted or
conditional use by the Town of Granville; or
      (6)   The business license issued by the Town of Granville has expired.
         (Passed 8-28-18.)
1307.03 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A non-conforming structure containing a use permitted in the zoning district
in which it is located may continue only in accordance with the provisions of
this section.
   (a)   Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the
continuation of nonconforming structures.
   (b)   Nonconforming structures used for a permitted use may be enlarged,
provided that the enlargement shall not create any additional nonconformity or
increase the degree of the existing nonconformity of such structure.
   (c)   Nonconforming structures and uses may enlarge principal structures by
adding decks or porches provided structural nonconformities are not increased
and that all requirements of this Code are met, including but not limited to
setback and yard requirements.
   (d)   Where the nonconforming setback of a building or structure exists, the
nonconforming setback may be extended along the same building line as the
existing nonconforming setback, provided that in so doing, the setback itself
is not further reduced.
   (e)   Any legal, pre-existing nonconforming structure damaged by fire,
flood, explosion or other disaster event may be reconstructed and used as
before, so long as the structure is damaged no more than fifty (50) percent of
its reconstruction cost exclusive of foundations, if such reconstruction is
undertaken within twelve (12) months of such disaster, and if the restored
structure has no greater coverage and contains no greater content (measured in
cubic feet) than before such disaster. An application to the Board of Zoning
Appeals for permission to undertake to reconstruct the structure must be filed
prior to undertaking the repairs after the use has been destroyed or damaged,
otherwise any structure shall conform to and be in accordance with all
applicable rules, regulations, and requirements of the particular district as
provided in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (f)   If any building occupied by a nonconforming use is damaged more than
fifty (50) percent of its reconstruction cost exclusive of foundations, such
building may not be restored for any nonconforming use. (Passed 8-28-18.)
1307.04 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   A nonconforming vacant lot existing and of official record as of the
effective date of this Ordinance may be developed for any of the uses permitted
by these regulations in the zoning district in which it is located, provided
that the use meets all applicable yard and setback requirements for the zoning
district in which the lot is located.

   (a)   Specify the grounds of the appeal;

   (a)   Within ten (10) days of receipt of the appeal by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, the board shall set a time for the hearing of the appeal and give
notice. The hearing on the appeal must be held within forty-five (45) days of
receipt of the appeal by the board.
   (b)   At least fifteen (15) days prior to the date set for the hearing on
the appeal, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall publish a notice of the date,

   (e)   Every decision by the board must be in writing and state findings of
fact and conclusions of law on which the board based its decision. If the board
fails to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law adequate for decision
by the circuit court and as a result of the failure, the circuit court returns
an appealed matter to the board and dismisses jurisdiction over an applicant's
appeal without deciding the matter, whether the court returns the matter with
or without restrictions, the board shall pay any additional costs for court
filing fees, service of process, and reasonable attorneys' fees required to
permit the person appealing the board's decision to return the matter to the
circuit court for completion of the appeal.
   (f)   The written decision by the board shall be rendered within thirty (30)
days after the hearing. If the board fails to render a written decision within
thirty (30) days after the hearing, then any party may pursue additional legal
remedies to obtain a decision, including, but not limited to, seeking a writ of
mandamus.
   (g)   When an appeal has been filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals, all
proceedings and work on the premises in question shall be stayed, except as
provided below:
      (1)   If the official or board from where the appeal was taken certifies
in writing to the Board of Zoning Appeals that a stay would cause imminent
peril to life or property;
      (2)   Upon further administrative proceedings, including, but not limited
to, submissions to and reviews by the staff or any administrative body; or
      (3)   Upon engineering or architectural work that does not disturb the
real estate beyond what is necessary to complete engineering, survey work, or
other tests.
   (h)   Nothing in this section prevents a party from obtaining an injunction.
(Passed 8-28-18.)
1308.08 VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES. 
   (a)   Any person who violates any provision of this chapter is guilty of a
misdemeanor and upon conviction, shall be punished for each offense by a fine
not less than $50.00 nor more than $500.00. Each day the violation continues
shall be considered a separate offense. Work carried on in violation of a
cancelled permit issued under this chapter shall also be deemed a violation
punishable in the same manner.

provision of the Zoning Ordinance or any rule, regulation, or requirement
adopted or established hereunder.
   (b)   The Planning Commission, Granville Board of Zoning Appeals, or any

designated enforcement official is successful in any suit brought under this
section, the respondent shall bear the costs of the action. (Passed 8-28-18.)
1308.10  VARIANCES.
   (a)   A variance is a deviation from the minimum standards of the zoning
ordinance and shall not involve permitting land uses that are otherwise
prohibited in the zoning district nor shall it involve changing the zoning
classifications of a parcel of land.
   (b)   The board of zoning appeals shall grant a variance to the zoning
ordinance if it finds that the variance:
      (1)   Will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare, or
the rights of adjacent property owners or residents;
      (2)   Arises from special conditions or attributes which pertain to the
property for which a variance is sought and which were not created by the
person seeking the variance;
      (3)   Would eliminate an unnecessary hardship and permit a reasonable use
of the land; and
      (4)   Will allow the intent of the zoning ordinance to be observed and
substantial justice done.
   (c)   The board of zoning appeals shall not grant a variance to allow the
establishment of a use in a zoning district when such use is prohibited by the

the limitations and conditions as follows:
   (a)   The use will be consistent with the vision and goals set forth in the
Town comprehensive plan;
   (b)   The use is physically and operationally compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood and surrounding existing uses. Conditions may be
imposed on a proposed conditional use to ensure that potential significant
adverse impacts on surrounding existing uses will be reduced to the maximum
extent feasible, including, but not limited to, conditions or measures
addressing:
      (1)   Location on a site of activities that generate potential adverse
impacts such as noise and glare;
      (2)   Hours of operation and deliveries;
      (3)   Location of loading and delivery zones;

shall not adversely impact adjacent uses or result in hazardous conditions for
pedestrians or vehicles in or adjacent to the site.

Public facilities and services that may be considered in light of this standard
include, but are not limited to, water, sewer, electric, schools, streets, fire
and police protection, storm drainage, public transit, and public parks or

Addressing and Mapping Project.
(Passed 11-12-3.)
1706.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   For the purpose of this Article, the following terms, phrases, works
and their derivations shall have the meaning that is provided in the National
Emergency Number Association (NENA) Standard Guidelines as referenced by the
United States Postal Service, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise.
   (b)   "Address number" means the number assigned to consecutive intervals
along a street or road pursuant to the Number Assignment Formula contained
herein.
   (c)   "Road" or "Street" means any public or private thoroughfare, used for
vehicular traffic and/ or any easement or right-of-way that provides sole
access to more than two parcels or lots. This term shall be defined as the
"Street Suffix" and shall include, but is not limited to; avenue (ave), drive
(dr), way (way), boulevard (blvd), highway (hwy), lane (ln), pike (pke) or
similar street types.
   (d)   "Number Assignment Formula" means as follows: Beginning from the point
of origin a house number shall be assigned for each interval, with each
interval on the right side of the roadway as one leaves the point of origin
being assigned an even number, and each interval on the left side as one leaves
the point of origin being assigned an odd number. Left and right shall be
determined from the perspective of a traveler moving away from the road point
of origin in a forward motion.
   (e)   "Interval" means the distance along a roadway of 25.00 feet.
   (f)   "Point of origin" means the end point of a road, which is the starting
point for a numbering sequence. The point of origin for the Town of Granville
shall be the best location for the designated neighborhood. The point of origin
for an individual road may be adjusted, upon the counties Addressing
Coordinators approval, to avoid numbering conflicts.
   (g)   "Primary structure" means, but is not be limited to, residential
building, mobile home parks, commercial building, industrial building, office
building, public building, utility, communications tower.
   (h)   "Display" means the manner the numbers are affixed to a structure or
otherwise displayed when affixing to a structure.
   (i)   “Non-compliance" means any failure to comply with the provisions of
this Ordinance including, but not limited to, by way of example: a number out
of sequence, odd or even number on wrong side of street, rural box numbers in a
9-1-1 address area, numbers improperly affixed, numbers illegible, numbers
unclear, numbers obstructed, numbers not visible, numbers not present, numbers
of improper size, numbers not in contrast with immediate background,
weatherworn numbers, wrong numbers, and non-approved numbers.

building number and street name. "City-type addresses" are based on an address
system, which means that they usually appear in a consistent numeric sequence
along a street and reflect parity conventions (that is, odd numbers all appear
on one side of the street and even numbers on the other). If number assignment
is based on a standard numbering interval, then the "city-type address" will

   (b)   Abrogaation and Greater Restrictions. This article supersedes any
other conflicting provisions which may be in effect in identified floodplain
areas. However, any other ordinance provisions shall remain in full force and
effect to the extent that those provisions are more restrictive. If there is
any conflict between any of the provisions of this article, the more
restrictive shall apply.
   (c)   Applicability. It shall be unlawful for any contractor, person,
partnership, business, or corporation to undertake or cause to be undertaken,
any development, new construction, substantial improvement, repair of
substantial damage, other repairs, or the placement or relocation of any
structure (including manufactured homes) within Town of Granville unless a
permit application has been completed and a permit has been obtained from the
Floodplain Administrator. In addition, where land is partially or fully in the
Floodplain is to be developed, subdivided, utilized for a manufactured home
park or subdivision or otherwise developed, a site plan with elevation data
must be submitted to, and approved by, the Floodplain Administrator prior to
any development.
   Provision of all other codes, ordinances, and regulations shall be
applicable insofar as they are consistent with the provisions of this article
and the County's need to minimize the hazards and damage resulting from
flooding.
   (d)   Matters Not Provided for Specifically. Where conditions are
encountered that are not specifically provided for herein, the Floodplain
Administrator shall determine the applicability of the provisions of this
article in accordance with its intent, and shall require the applicant to take
appropriate measures pursuant to such determination.
(Passed 2-26-19.)
1743.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   General. Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in
this article shall be interpreted so as to give this article its most
reasonable application.
      (1)   “Adjacent property”. Adjacent Property includes any surface tract,
regardless of whether such surface tract is entirely within Town of Granville,
so long as a portion of said surface tract is located within Town of Granville,
which shares an immediate and common boundary up or down stream to the property
that is the subject of the application for Floodplain Pennit. Adjacent property
also includes all other property that may be affected by flooding.
      (2)   “Adversely Affect Adjacent Properties". To adversely affect a
property the increase in the elevation of the 100-year base flood elevation
must be more than one (1) foot at any point. Stated conversely, if the effect
is that the 100-year flood base flood elevation rises one (1) foot or less the
property is not "affected". This standard does not apply to the Floodway. If
prior permit(s) has/have been approved in the same area of the Floodplain, the
above definition would include the cumulative impact to the base flood
elevation.
      (3)   Appurtenant Structure. A structure on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental and used for
storage only to the use of the principal structure. This does not include a gas
or liquid storage tank. These structures cannot be used as living space.
      (4)   Base Flood. Means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
      (5)   Base Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of the base
flood in relation to the datum specified on the County's Flood Insurance Rate
Map. For the purposes of this article, the one hundred (100) year flood or one
percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. (See 100 year
flood also)
      (6)   Basement.  Any area of the building having its floor sub grade
(below ground level) on all sides.
      (7)   Certificate of Compliance.  A certification that the entire
development, including the elevation of fill or the lowest floor of a structure
is in compliance with all the provisions of this article.
      (8)   Compensatory storage. An artificially excavated, hydraulically
equivalent volume of storage within the special flood hazard area used to
balance the loss of natural flood storage when artificial fill or structures
are placed within the special flood hazard area.
      (9)   Contractor - West Virginia Code §21-11-3(c). A person who in any
capacity for compensation, other than as an employee of another, undertakes,
offers to undertake, purports to have the capacity to undertake, or submits a
bid to construct, alter, repair, add to, subtract from, improve, move, wreck or
demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, structure or excavation
associated with a project, development or improvement, or to do any part
thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structures or works in
connection therewith, where the cost of undertaking is two thousand five
hundred dollars ($2,500) or more. Contractor includes a construction manager
who performs management and counseling services on a construction project for a
professional fee.
      Contractor does not include:
         A.   One who merely furnishes materials or supplies without
fabricating or consuming them in the construction project;
         B.   A person who personally performs construction work on the site of
real property which the person owns or leases whether for commercial or

         E.   A corporation, limited liability corporation, partnership or sole
proprietorship whose primary purpose is to prepare construction plans and
specifications used by the contractors defined in this section and who employs
a full time registered architect licensed to practice in this State or a
registered professional engineer licensed to practice in this State. Contractor
also does not include employees of such corporation, partnership or sole
proprietorship.
      (10)   Critical Facility. Any facility in which even a slight chance of
flooding is too great a threat.
Typical critical facilities include hospitals, fire stations, police stations,
storage of critical records, and similar facilities. These should be given
special consideration when formulating regulatory alternatives and floodplain
management plans. A critical facility should not be located in a special flood
hazard area if at all possible. If a critical facility must be located in a
special flood hazard area it should be provided a higher level of protection so
that it can continue to function and provide services during a flood.

Special flood hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in Flood Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A,
AE, AO, A1-30, and A99. The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard
maps that are specifically listed or otherwise described in this article.
      (40)   Start of Construction.  (The definition for start of construction
is to be used only when calculating the starting time for expiration of a
Floodplain Permit.)
The date the Floodplain Permit was issued, including Floodplain Permit for
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the Floodplain Permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
Floodplain Permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
      (41)   State Coordinating Office.  The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management.
      (42)   Stream.  As defined in West Virginia Code §7-l-3u, any
watercourse, whether natural or man-made, distinguishable by banks and a bed,
regardless of its size, through which water flows continually or
intermittently, regardless of its volume.
      (43)   Structure. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (44)   Subdivision. Development that includes a creation of individual
land parcels for future sale. It does not include development where rights-of-
way or easements are obtained and recorded.
      (45)   Subject Property. "Subject property" includes the surface tract(s)
upon which the proposed development is planned and for which the Floodplain
Permit Application is submitted.
      (46)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
      (47)   Substantial lmprovement.  Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the
structure before the start of construction of the improvement.
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation(s) of State or Local Health, Sanitary or Safety Code
Specifications which have been identified by the Local Code Enforcement
Official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all Ordinance
requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure. Documentation that a specific Ordinance requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of
the building commences whether or not the alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (48)   Top of Bank. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of the bank. In the field a professional
familiar with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of the bank. When a
professional is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the
top of the first significant slope landward of the water's edge when it is
followed by at least fifty (50) feet of relatively flat land.
      (49)   Variance. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
      (50)   Violation. The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this article. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation
until such time as the documentation is provided. No future improvements or
developments can be made to structures found to be in violation unless the
development is to bring the structure into compliance with the current article.

Town of Granville by use of historic or other technical data and shown on an
officially recognized "FIRM".
These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the level of technical data
described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area Without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided,
      (5)   The AO and AH floodplain those areas identified as Zones AO and AH
on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by 1-percent-
annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one (1) and
three (3) feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to
guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by Town of Granville where natural or man-made changes have occurred
and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   A County's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting
from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practical but,
not later than six (6) months from the date such information becomes available,
the County shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or
scientific data.
      (3)   Town of Granville may identify and regulate new flood hazard or
ponding areas. These areas shall be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map"
using best available topographic data and locally delivered information such as
flood of record, historic high water marks and/or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is at
or above the Base Flood Elevation, and the following is provided to the
Floodplain Administrator:
         A.   Elevation information and a site plan demonstrating that all
proposed development will occur above the Base Flood Elevation or,
         B.   A Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA removing the site from
the SHFA
then the site shall be considered to be outside the Floodplain Area and shall
not be required to conform to the provisions of this article.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation, the site shall be considered to be within the
Floodplain Area and the proposed structure shall be required to conform to all
appropdate provisions of this article.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Granville Town
Council sitting as the "Floodplain Appeals Board". The burden of proof shall be
on the appellant/applicant.
(Passed 2-26-19.)
1743.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway. Within any Floodway Area (F1), no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property due to
their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
       (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the Floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (2)   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable Federal and State Law, Ordinances and
Regulations.
      (4)   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the Town of
Granville Floodplain Manager, be determined to be the channel of the stream and
the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special
flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the
upland limit of the one percent (1%) annual chance special flood hazard area
boundary.
   (b)   AE Zone Without FloodwayArea. Within any AE Zone Without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (c)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A). Within any Approximated Floodplain
Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
and adjacent properties including but not limited to existing buildings will be
reasonably safe from flooding using hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other
techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall
only be prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that
the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable Federal and State Laws, Ordinances and Regulations.
      (4)   Within any apportioned Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100- year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.  
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, Town of Granville's Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. In addition prior to issuing the local permit the
Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from
those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure Town of Granville in writing that
the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resulting study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses and
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the use of certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of
bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream
crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may
include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings
to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in
flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the County a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1743.08(d).
      (6)   When any watercourse alteration has occurred, the applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.
         (Passed 2-26-19.)
1743.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.

contract(s) or addendums for review shall void the permit. If a licensed
contractor is not involved, or the work is of an aggregate construction cost
value of less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000) including material and labor,
a brief written desc1iption of proposed work and the estimated value will
suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing lnformation. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two (2) feet above the Base Flood Elevation and:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.

         D.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two (2) feet
above the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification. The
elevation certificate must confirm the structure in question together with
attendant utilities are elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
         G.   A Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that the area below the first
floor could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed
areas below base flood elevation that are five (5) feet high or more). This
agreement shall state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of the
existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the purchaser through
notarized signature, a copy of all new Non-Conversion Agreements shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non-
Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator
shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1743.08(d).
      (2)   All structures shall be flood proofed to two (2) feet above the
Base Flood Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
   All applicants shall meet or exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements
contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by
increasing the level of flood proofing above the height required by this
article. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood insurance rate on dry
flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one (1) foot above
the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits, certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood Proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in subsection (c)(2)A. above, stating the structure in question, together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities are designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
(2) feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
- used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage (Appurtenant
Structures only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
Floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a Floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An Elevation Certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two (2) feet above the Base Flood Elevation and
that all utilities are located at least two (2) feet above the Base Flood
Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               i.   A minimum of two (2) openings have a total net area of not
less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               ii.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above grade.
               iii.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-Conversion Agreement
and notify prospective purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion
Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-
Conversion Agreement to any purchaser at closing tbrough notarized signature. A
signed copy of the transferred Non-Conversion Agreement shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement
and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the
violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1743.08(d).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.  Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks.
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to Floodplain Areas, proposed lot sites, and fill
areas.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify
the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include Base Flood Elevation data and shall
delineate the Floodway.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the Base Flood
Elevation.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
State and Local Water Resource Department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect cunently accepted technical concepts.
   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the Approximated
Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed
Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan
for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two (2) or five
(5) feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed
and the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled from the FEMA
map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than one (1) foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood
hazard area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the
subdivided lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Passed 2-26-19.)

buoyancy.
               v.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two (2) feet above the Base Flood
Elevation.
               vi.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all
utilities shall be located at least two (2) feet above the Base Flood
Elevation.
               vii.   Opening requirements:
Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by allowing for
automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement
must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or
meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
                  a.   A minimum of two (2) openings have a total net area of
not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided.
                  b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
(1) foot above grade.
                  c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves
or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
               2.   In addition, a Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by
the applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the Non- Conversion Agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement at
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of the Non-
Conversion Agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the
Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth
in Section
1743.08(d).
      (4)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnected utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   Fill.  Town of Granville officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the Floodplain Area serves in storage and transportation of water
during floods. Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is
discouraged and should be minimized.
Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area shall be
restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill shall
only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
currently accepted technical standards that the proposed fill will not result
in any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall consider
the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to the
subject property and adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and
adjacent properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst
topography, stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   A Fill Site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with pre- construction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
article and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in subsection (a)(5)H. below. For non-residential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
         E.   At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five percent
(25%) of the perimeter of a non-residential structure.
         F.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         G.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         H.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
          I.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five (5) feet per second or less
will be protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or
similar vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five (5) feet per
second will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         J.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
can be issued. The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving said request and executing Form 1, "Overview &
Concurrence Form" or other form as may be required by FEMA.
         K.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of structures and other development.  All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         B.   In so far as practicable, structures and other development shall
be placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of fifty (50) feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from
the top of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas
wells and well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100
feet from any perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or
wetland. [See West Virginia Code §22-6A-12(b)]. To reduce erosion, natural
vegetation shall be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not
exist along the watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high
priority shall be given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize
banks and enhance aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection at the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator the Flood
Protection Setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback Area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with other State environmental agency(ies)
requirements.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constrncted to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage.  Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within zones AH
and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
      (12)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area Floodplain Area.

      (1)   Has the applicant   diligently pursued the completion of the
proposed development during the eighteen (18) months?
      (2)   Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public safety,
health, or welfare or injurious to other property?
   (h)   Stop Work Orders, Inspections and Revocations.
      (1)   Stop-Work Orders.
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued,
a "Stop Work Order Notice" for any development found ongoing without having
obtained a Floodplain Permit. Disregard of a Stop Work Order Notice shall
subject the violator to the penalties described in Section
 1743.08(d).
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued,
a "Stop Work Order Notice" for any development found non-compliant with the
provisions of this article and/or the conditions of the Floodplain Permit.
Disregard of a Stop Work Order notice shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
 1743.08(d).
         C.   In the event that the Floodplain Administrator issues a Stop Work
Order Notice, the Floodplain Permit shall be stayed pending a determination of
whether a violation actually occurred and/or abatement of the alleged
violation, whichever occurs first.
         D.   In the event of an Appeal on a Floodplain Permit, the Floodplain
Administrator shall immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall
remain in effect until a resolution of said Appeal.
      (2)   Inspections and Revocations.
         A.   During the development period, the Floodplain Administrator or
other authorized County, State or Federal Government Officials may inspect the
premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the
information provided on the Floodplain Permit Application, this article and
with all applicable Federal, State and County laws, Regulations and Ordinances.
         B.   If the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not
comply with the Floodplain Permit Application, this article or that there has
been a false statement(s) or misrepresentation(s) by any applicant in the
permitting process, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a "Stop Work Order
Notice", revoke the permit and request a temporary injunction in the Circuit
Court of Town of Granville. The Floodplain Administrator shall notify any
appropriate agency or authority if the Floodplain Administrator finds a
violation of any non-Floodplain Law, Regulation or Ordinance.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized County, State or
Federal Government Officials may inspect any development covered by this or
previous Floodplain Ordinances to determine whether any portion of the
development has been altered to be non-compliant with the requirements of this
article or other Ordinances.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to occupy, or
to permit the use of occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this article. Occupying or
using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1743.08(d).
      (2)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect
and approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until
the utility inspector is in possession of a copy of the Certificate of
Compliance issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular
development being inspected conforms to the requirements of this article.
Inspection and approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in Section
1743.08(d).
      (3)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
development conforms to the requirements of this article. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1743.08(d).
      (4)   A Certificate of Compliance shall be issued by the Floodplain
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in the special
flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the Certificate of Compliance shall be based upon the
inspection conducted as prescribed in this article and any finished
construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing certificate,
or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a condition of the
Floodplain Permit approval process.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   Floodplain Determination fee of twenty dollars ($20.00), payable to
the Monongalia County Commission shall be assessed on all proposed development.
      A.   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this article shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to Town of Granville based upon a set schedule approved by Granville
Town Council using the estimated value of the proposed construction as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
          B,   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing
the Town of Granville for any additional costs for services necessary for
review and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
         Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this article is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the Monongalia County Commission for the
additional cost of processing permits for work already underway. To more fully
recover this cost the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent
occurrence by the same person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve
any person from complying fully with the requirements of this article in the
execution of the work or from other penalties prescribed herein. (Passed 2-26-
19.)
1743.08 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals. Whenever a person or entity is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provisions of this article, it is
the right of that person or entity to appeal to the Granville Town Council
sitting as the Floodplain Appeals Board. Such appeal must be filed with the
County Clerk, in writing, within thirty (30) days after notification of the
decision of the Floodplain Administrator as announced at a regularly scheduled
Granville Town Council Meeting. Said Appeal shall be served by the aggrieved
person by regular mail on all interested parties on the date that said Appeal
is filed. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Floodplain Appeals Board shall set a
time, date and place not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) calendar
days for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of the time, date and place
of the hearing shall be given to all interested parties by placing an
announcement of said hearing date, time and place on the agenda of the next
regularly scheduled Granville Town Council meeting and to announce the date,
time and place of the appeal hearing not sooner than ten (10) calendar days
from said announcement date, at which time all may appear and be heard. The
determination by the Floodplain Appeals Board shall be final in all cases,
subject to any Appeal to the Circuit Court of Monongalia County, West Virginia
or any other Court of competent jurisdiction.
   In the event an Appeal is filed wherein a Floodplain Permit grant has been
ruled by the Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator shall
immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall remain in effect until a
resolution of said appeal.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria. All appeals contesting only the permit fee,
the cumulative substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback
requirement, or the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of
the Floodplain Appeals Board.
   (c)   Variances. If compliance with any of the requirements of this article
would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or
landowner, the Town of Granville may, upon request, grant relief from the
strict application of the requirements. Considerations for the issuance of
Variances to this article shall adhere to the following criteria:
      (1)   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances.
      (2)   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the Special
Flood Hazard Area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,
shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance.
      (3)   An affirmative decision granting a Floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood
Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and (ii)
such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in this article; and
      (5)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all
decisions including justification for the decisions, and (ii) report such
decisions issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
      (6)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for issuance of a
Floodplain variance for any construction, development use or activity within
any Floodway Area that would cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (d)   Penalties. Any person, who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or direction or Order of the
Floodplain Administrator, or any other authorized employee of, shall be
unlawful and shall be referred to the Granville City Attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the Town of Granville of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. Each day
during which any violation of this article continues shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or non-
compliance with, this article shall not excuse the violation or non-compliance
with the article or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be
required to correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within a
reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or
relocated in non-compliance with this article may be declared by the Town of
Granville to be a public nuisance and abated as such subject to other
applicable laws and exhaustion of appellate rights.
