The purpose of this title is to designate and protect the functions and values
of ecologically sensitive and hazardous areas without violating any citizen's
constitutional rights. Landslide, erosion, volcanic and seismic hazards,
wetlands, aquifer recharge areas, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas,
and flood hazard areas constitute critical areas that are of special concern to
Orting. The city finds that these critical areas perform a variety of valuable
and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city and its
residents; certain critical areas may also pose a threat to human safety or to
public and private property. By limiting development and alteration of these
critical areas, and by incorporating best available science into those limited
instances of development and alteration of critical areas, this chapter seeks
to:
   A.   Protect members of the public and public resources and facilities from
injury, loss of life, or property damage due to flooding, erosion, volcanic
eruptions, landslides, seismic events, or steep slope failures;
   B.   Protect and designate unique, fragile and valuable elements of the
environment, including wildlife and its habitat;
   C.   Mitigate unavoidable impacts to environmentally critical areas by
regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas;
   D.   Prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality and
wetlands;
   E.   Implement the requirements of the Washington State Growth Management
Act 1 with regard to the protection of critical area lands;
   F.   Coordinate environmental review and permitting of proposals to avoid
duplication and delay.
G. Implement the goals, policies, guidelines, and requirements of the city of
Orting comprehensive plan. (Ord. 2016-985, 7-13-2016)
 
Notes
 
1 1. Chapter 36.70A RCW.
 
11-1-2: DEFINITIONS:
ALTERATION: Any human induced activity that changes the existing condition of a
critical area. Alterations include, but are not limited to: grading; filling;
dredging; draining; channelizing; clearing or removing vegetation; discharging
pollutants; paving; construction; demolition; or any other human activity that
changes the existing landforms, vegetation, hydrology, wildlife, or wildlife
habitat of a critical area.

a large part of their lives in the sea, and return to fresh water rivers and
streams to procreate.
APPLICANT: The person, party, firm, corporation, or other entity that proposes
any activity that could affect a critical area.
AQUIFER: A saturated geologic formation that will yield a sufficient quantity
of water to serve as a private or public water supply.
BASE FLOOD: A flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year, also referred to as the 100-year flood.
BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE: Current scientific information used in the process to
designate, protect, or restore critical areas that is derived from a valid
scientific process as defined in WAC 365-195-900 through WAC 365-195-925, as
applicable.
BOG: A wetland with limited drainage generally characterized by extensive peat
deposits and acidic waters. Vegetation includes sedges, sphagnum moss, shrubs
and trees.
BUFFER OR BUFFER AREA: A naturally vegetated and undisturbed or revegetated
zone surrounding a critical area that protects the critical area from adverse
impacts to its integrity and value, or is an integral part of the resource's
ecosystem.
CITY: The city of Orting.
CITY ADMINISTRATOR: The City Administrator of the city of Orting or any other
city official appointed by the mayor to administer this title, including the
Community Development Director.
CLEARING: The removal of timber, brush, grass, ground cover, or other
vegetative matter from a site that exposes the earth's surface of the site or
any actions that disturb the existing ground surface.
CRITICAL AREAS: Include wetlands, fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas,
, critical aquifer recharge areas, frequently flooded areas, and geologically
hazardous areas including erosion hazard areas, seismic hazard areas, landslide
hazard areas, and volcanic hazard areas.
Critical areas are to be designated and protected using the best available
science, consistent with RCW 36.70A.172. As used in this title, the term
“critical area” shall also encompass any required buffer or setback associated
with that critical area. The Departments of Fish and Wildlife and Ecology, and
various federal agencies, offer online mapping tools to help define general
critical area locations and may be used for illustrative and informational
purposes only.
CRITICAL AQUIFER RECHARGE AREAS: Areas with a critical recharging effect on
aquifers used for potable water, including areas where an aquifer that is a
source of drinking water is vulnerable to contamination that would affect the
potability of the water, or is susceptible to reduced charge. Critical aquifer
recharge areas are classified as follows:
   A.   High significance aquifer recharge areas: Areas with slopes of less
than fifteen percent (15%) that are underlain by coarse alluvium or sand and
gravel.
   B.   Moderate significance aquifer recharge areas:
      1.   Areas with slopes of less than fifteen percent (15%) that are
underlain by fine alluvium, silt, clay, glacial till, or deposits from the
electron mudflow; and
      2.   Areas with slopes of fifteen percent (15%) to thirty percent (30%)
that are underlain by sand and gravel.
   C.   Low significance aquifer recharge areas:
      1.   Areas with slopes of fifteen percent (15%) to thirty percent (30%)
that are underlain by silt, clay, or glacial till; and
      2.   Areas with slopes greater than thirty percent (30%).
CRITICAL HABITAT: Critical habitats are those habitat areas which meet any of
the following criteria:
   A.   The documented presence of species listed by the federal government or
state of Washington as endangered, threatened, or critical.
   B.   Those streams identified as "shorelines of the state" under the city of
Orting shoreline master program.
   C.   Those wetlands identified as class I wetlands, as defined in this
chapter.
DEVELOPMENT RIGHT: Any specific right to use real property which inures to an
owner of real property through the common law, statutory law of real property,
the United States and Washington constitutions and as further defined and
delineated herein.
ECOSYSTEM FUNCTIONS: The products, physical and biological conditions, and
environmental qualities of an ecosystem that result from interactions among
ecosystem processes and ecosystem structures, including but not limited to
sequestered carbon, attenuated peak streamflow, aquifer water level, reduced
pollutant concentrations in surface and ground waters, cool summer in-stream
water temperatures, and fish and wildlife habitats.
EROSION: A process whereby wind, rain, water, and other natural agents mobilize
and transport soil particles.
EROSION HAZARD AREAS: Those areas containing soils which, according to the
United States Department of Agriculture Natural Resources Conservation Service
Soil Survey Program, may experience significant erosion. Erosion hazard areas
also include coastal erosion-prone areas and channel migration zones. Erosion
hazard areas are classified according to the criteria set forth in OMC 11-3-3..
EXISTING AND ONGOING AGRICULTURE: Those activities conducted on lands defined
in Revised Code Of Washington 84.34.020(2), and those existing activities
involved in the production of crops or livestock. Activities may include the
operation and maintenance of farm and stock ponds or drainage ditches;
operation and maintenance of existing ditches or irrigation systems; changes
from one type of agricultural activity to another agricultural activity; and
normal maintenance, repair, and operation of existing serviceable structures,
facilities, or improved areas. Activities which bring a nonagricultural area
into agricultural use are not part of an ongoing operation. An operation ceases
to be ongoing when the area on which it is conducted is converted to a
nonagricultural use or has lain idle for more than five (5) years.
FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT CONSERVATION: Land management for maintaining
populations of species in suitable habitats within their natural geographic
distribution so that the habitat available is sufficient to support viable
populations over the long term and isolated subpopulations are not created.
This does not mean maintaining all individuals of all species at all times, but
it does mean not degrading or reducing populations or habitats so that they are
no longer viable over the long term. Counties and cities should engage in
cooperative planning and coordination to help assure long term population
viability.
Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas contribute to the state's
biodiversity and occur on both publicly and privately owned lands. Designating
these areas is an important part of land use planning for appropriate
development densities, urban growth area boundaries, open space corridors, and
incentive based land conservation and stewardship programs.
FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT CONSERVATION AREAS: Areas that serve a critical role
in sustaining needed habitats and species for the functional integrity of the
ecosystem, and which, if altered, may reduce the likelihood that the species
will persist over the long term. These areas may include, but are not limited
to, rare or vulnerable ecological systems, communities, and habitat or habitat
elements including seasonal ranges, breeding habitat, winter range, and
movement corridors; and areas with high relative population density or species
richness. Counties and cities may also designate habitats of local importance
and species of local importance. Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas
do not include such artificial features or constructs as irrigation delivery
systems, irrigation infrastructure, irrigation canals, or drainage ditches that
lie within the boundaries of, and are maintained by, a port district or an
irrigation district or company.
FISH HABITAT: Habitat that is used by fish at any life stage at any time of the
year, including potential habitat likely to be used by fish that could be
recovered by restoration or management and includes off channel habitat.
FREQUENTLY FLOODED AREAS: Lands in the floodplain subject to at least a one
percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year (“100-year flood”), or
within areas subject to flooding due to high groundwater. These areas include,
but are not limited to, streams, rivers, lakes, coastal areas, wetlands, and
areas where high groundwater forms ponds on the ground surface. These areas
also consist of the following components, as determined by the city:
   A.   Floodplain: The total area subject to inundation by the base flood.
   B.   Flood fringe: That portion of the floodplain outside the floodway which
is generally covered by floodwaters during the base flood. It is generally
associated with standing water rather than rapidly flowing water.
   C.   Floodway: The channel of the stream and that portion of the adjoining
floodplain that is necessary to contain and discharge the base flood flow
without increasing the base flood elevation more than one foot (1').
GEOLOGIC HAZARD AREAS: Lands or areas characterized by geologic, hydrologic,
and topographic conditions that render them susceptible to potentially
significant or severe risk of landslides, erosion, or volcanic or seismic
activity and unsuitable for the unmitigated siting of commercial, residential,
or industrial development consistent with public health or safety concerns.
GRADING: Any excavating, filling, clearing, leveling, or contouring of the
ground surface by human or mechanical means.
GROUNDWATER: All water found beneath the ground surface, including slow moving
subsurface water present in aquifers and recharge areas.

and wildlife habitat conservation areas include those areas found to be locally
important by counties and cities.
HAZARD TREE: Any tree posing a threat to life, property, or public safety.
HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE PROCESSING OR HANDLING: The use, storage, manufacture or
other land use activity involving hazardous substances, but does not include
individually packaged household consumer products or quantities of hazardous
substances of less than five (5) gallons in volume per container.

substances including, but not limited to, certain pesticides, or any residues
or containers of such substances which are disposed of in such quantity or
concentration as to pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human
health, wildlife, or the environment because such wastes or constituents or
combinations of such wastes:
      1.   Have short lived, toxic properties that may cause death, injury, or
illness or have mutagenic, teratogenic, or carcinogenic properties; or
      2.   Are corrosive, explosive, flammable, or may generate pressure
through decomposition or other means.
   B.   "Extremely hazardous waste" means any waste which:
      1.   Will persist in a hazardous form for several years or more at a
disposal site and which in its persistent form presents a significant
environment hazard and may be concentrated by living organisms through a food
chain or may affect the genetic makeup of humans or wildlife, and
      2.   Is disposed of at a disposal site in such quantities as would
present an extreme hazard to humans or the environment.
HAZARDOUS WASTE TREATMENT AND STORAGE FACILITY: A facility that treats and
stores hazardous waste and is authorized pursuant to chapter 70A.300 Revised

existing ecosystem functions and values or the natural systems constituting the
protected critical areas.
NOXIOUS WEED 1 : Any plant which, when established, is highly destructive,
competitive, or difficult to control by cultural or chemical practices. The
state noxious weed list in chapter 16-750 is the officially adopted list of
noxious weeds by the state noxious weed control board.
PRIORITY HABITAT: A habitat type with unique or significant value to one or
more species. An area classified and mapped as priority habitat must have one
or more of the following attributes:
   A.   Comparatively high fish and wildlife density;
   B.   Comparatively high fish and wildlife species diversity;
   C.   Important fish and wildlife breeding habitat;

A priority habitat may be described by a unique vegetation type or by a
dominant plant species that is of primary importance to fish and wildlife (such
as, oak woodlands, eelgrass meadows). A priority habitat may also be described
by a successional stage (such as, old growth and mature forests).
Alternatively, a priority habitat may consist of a specific habitat element
(such as, consolidated marine/estuarine shorelines, talus slopes, caves, snags)
of key value to fish and wildlife. A priority habitat may contain priority and/
or nonpriority fish and wildlife. Priority habitats are listed by the state
department of fish and wildlife in the Priority Habitats and Species program.
PRIORITY SPECIES: Fish and wildlife species requiring protective measures and/
or management guidelines to ensure their perpetuation. Priority species are
those that meet any of the criteria listed below:
   A.   Criterion 1: State listed or state candidate species. State listed
species are those native fish and wildlife species legally designated as
endangered (WAC 232-12-014), threatened (WAC 232-12-011), or sensitive (WAC

will be reviewed by the department of fish and wildlife (POL-M-6001) for
possible listing as endangered, threatened, or sensitive according to the
process and criteria defined in Washington administrative code 232-12-297.
Federal candidate species are evaluated individually to determine their status
in Washington and whether inclusion as a priority species is justified.
   B.   Criterion 2: Vulnerable aggregations. Vulnerable aggregations include
those species or groups of animals susceptible to significant population
declines, within a specific area or statewide, by virtue of their inclination
to congregate. Examples include heron rookeries, seabird concentrations, marine
mammal haul outs, shellfish beds, and fish spawning and rearing areas.
   C.   Criterion 3: Species of recreational, commercial and/or tribal
importance. Native and nonnative fish, shellfish, and wildlife species of

at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal
circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life
in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs,
and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands
intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to,
irrigation and drainage ditches, grass lined swales, canals, detention
facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape
amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were
unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or
highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created
from nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.(Ord. 2016-
985, 7-13-2016; amd. Ord. 2019-1057, 1-8-2020)

15.12.010)
 
11-1-4: EXEMPTIONS:
The following activities shall be exempt from the provisions of this chapter:
   A.   Agricultural Activities: Existing and ongoing agricultural activities,
provided no alteration of flood storage capacity or conveyance occurs.
   B.   Damaged Structures: Remodeling of structures in existence on the
effective date of July 13, 2016. When such structures are damaged by fire,
explosion, or other unforeseen circumstances, they may be reconstructed or
replaced within one year; provided, that the new construction or related
activity does not further intrude into a critical area or established buffer
and is subject to flood hazard areas reconstruction restrictions.
   C.   New Accessory Structures And Additions: New accessory structures and
additions to structures provided that the lot coverage does not exceed a
cumulative additional seven hundred fifty (750) square feet of impervious
surface after the effective date July 13, 2016; provided, that the new
construction or related activity does not further intrude into a critical area
or established buffer and is subject to flood hazard areas reconstruction
restrictions.
   D.   Artificially Created Wetlands: Activities involving artificially
created wetlands or streams intentionally created from nonwetland sites,
including, but not limited to, grass lined swales, irrigation and drainage
ditches, detention facilities, and landscape features, except wetlands,
streams, or swales that provide critical habitat for anadromous fish.
   E.   Small Wetlands: The following wetlands may be exempt from the
requirement to avoid impacts and they may be filled if the impacts are fully
mitigated. If available, impacts should be mitigated through the purchase of
credits from an in lieu fee program or mitigation bank, consistent with the
terms and conditions of the program or bank. In order to verify the following
conditions, a critical area report for wetlands must be submitted.
      1.   All isolated category IV wetlands less than four thousand (4,000)
square feet that:
         a.   Are not associated with riparian areas or their buffers;
         b.   Are not associated with shorelines of the state or their
associated buffers;
         c.   Are not part of a wetland mosaic;
         d.   Do not score six (6) or more points for habitat function based on
the "Washington State Wetland Rating System For Western Washington" (Ecology
publication #23-06-009, or as revised).
         e.   Do not contain a priority habitat or a priority area for a
priority species identified by the Washington department of fish and wildlife,
do not contain federally listed species or their critical habitat, or species
of local importance.
      2.   Wetlands less than one thousand (1,000) square feet that meet the
above criteria and do not contain federally listed species or their critical
habitat are exempt from the buffer provisions contained in this chapter.
   F.   Existing Roads: Maintenance, operation and reconstruction of existing
roads, streets, utilities and associated structures.
   G.   Emergency Activities: Emergencies are those activities necessary to
prevent an immediate threat to public health, safety, or welfare, or that pose
an immediate risk of damage to private property and that require remedial or
preventive action in a timeframe too short to allow for compliance with the
requirements of the critical areas regulations. Emergency actions are required
to use reasonable methods to address the emergency with the least possible
impact to the critical area. The Administrator will require review of the
action to determine whether it was beyond the scope of the exemption and may
require permits after the fact, which may include restoration or compensatory
mitigation.
H. Removal of Hazard Trees: Removal of hazard trees, provided that hazard tree
removal shall not adversely affect ecologic functions to the extent
practicable, creates snags rather than complete removal of trees where
possible, avoid and minimize damage to remaining trees and vegetation within a
riparian zone. Tree removal exempted other this provision may only be allowed
if the applicant provides a determination by a qualified arborist who has
evaluated and determined the subject trees to be hazard trees. (Ord. 2016-985,
7-13-2016)
 
11-1-5: REASONABLE USE EXCEPTION:
   A.   Allowing Exception: If the application of this chapter would deny all
reasonable use of the property, development may be allowed which is consistent
with the general purposes of this chapter and the public interest.
   B.   Application For Exception: An application for a critical areas
reasonable use exception shall be filed with the city and shall be heard by the
hearing examiner. The hearing examiner shall issue a final decision.
   C.   Determination; Conditions: The hearing examiner must determine that:
      1.   Application of this title would deny all reasonable use of the
property; and
      2.   There is no other reasonable use with less impact on the critical
area; and
      3.   The proposed development does not pose an unreasonable threat to the
public health, safety or welfare on or off the development proposal site; and
      4.   Any alterations permitted to these critical areas shall be the
minimum necessary to allow for reasonable use of the property; and
5. The inability to derive reasonable economic use is not the result of the
applicant’s actions or that of a previous property owner, such as by
segregating or dividing the property and creating an undevelopable condition.
   D.   Alterations: Any authorized alteration of a critical area under this
section shall be subject to conditions established by the city of Orting and
shall require mitigation under an approved mitigation plan. (1973 Code §
15.12.030)
 
11-1-6: MAPS AND INVENTORIES:
   A.   Critical Area Mapping: The approximate location and extent of critical
areas in the city are shown on a series of maps, including the extent of land
subject to the Shoreline Master Program, to Title 14 of this code, and to areas
mapped in publicly available critical areas resources which include, but are
not limited to, those resources set forth in section 11-2-6 of this code. These
areas may be used by the public and by the city to inform of the potential
presence of critical areas. Boundaries are generalized; the actual type,
extent, and boundaries of critical areas shall be determined in the field by a
qualified professional according to the procedures, definitions, and criteria
established by this chapter.
   B.   Changes In Critical Area Mapping: Authority is hereby delegated to the
City Administrator to subsequently effect changes in City critical area maps as
appropriate in the light of changed circumstances or newly acquired
information. (1973 Code § 15.12.040)
 
11-1-7: RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER REGULATIONS:
   A.   These critical area regulations shall apply as an overlay and in
addition to zoning, land use and other regulations established by the city. In
the event of any conflict between these regulations and any other regulations
of the city, the regulations that provide greater protection to environmentally
critical areas shall apply.
   B.   Areas characterized by particular critical areas may also be subject to
other regulations established by this chapter due to overlap or multiple
functions of some critical resources or critical areas. Wetlands, for example,
may be defined and regulated according to the wetland and habitat provisions of
this title. In the event of any conflict between regulations for any particular
critical areas in this title, the regulations which provide greater protection
to environmentally critical areas shall apply. (1973 Code § 15.12.050)
 
11-1-8: VARIANCES:
Variances from the standards of this title may be authorized by the hearing
examiner in accordance with the procedures set forth in title 15 of this code.
A decision may not be issued by the hearing examiner on a requested variance
from this title until a complete application, including all fees, is submitted
by the applicant. In granting such a variance, the hearing examiner shall find:
   A.   Because of the special circumstances applicable to the subject
property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, or the
size or nature of the critical area, the strict application of this title would
deprive the property owner of reasonable use of their property;
   B.   The granting of the variance is the minimum necessary to accommodate
reasonable use based on the parcel’s underlying zoning and will not be
materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or
improvements in the vicinity and zone in which the property is situated, or
contrary to the goals and purposes of this title.
Variances from mitigation requirements set forth in this chapter cannot be
authorized. Mitigation for adverse impacts to functions or values of critical
areas shall be provided consistent with the mitigation requirements of this
chapter, regardless of whether the adverse impact relates to relief afforded
via an approved critical area variance. (1973 Code § 15.28.010)

NO NET LOSS, MITIGATION SEQUENCING, AND BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE
SECTION:
11-3-1: No Net Loss of Ecologic Impact
11-3-2: Mitigation Sequencing
11-3-3: Best Available Science
 
11-3-1: NO NET LOSS OF ECOLOGIC IMPACT
In no instance shall development, alterations, or activities occur in any
critical area or its buffer that causes harm to the function or value of the
critical area or its buffer. Any harm caused to critical areas or their buffer
shall be fully mitigated so that no net loss of the critical area or its buffer
occurs. Compensatory mitigation may be necessary to achieve no net loss of
critical area functions or values in instances where avoidance or minimization
of impacts to the critical area is infeasible or insufficient to fully mitigate
harm to the critical area function or value.
 
11-3-2: MITIGATION SEQUENCING
Alteration to critical areas may be allowed when all adverse impacts to
functions and values of the critical area can be shown to be fully mitigated.
The applicant should mitigate for impacts following the sequence of mitigation
set forth in WAC 197-11-768. Mitigation sufficient to achieve no net loss of
critical area function or value may include a combination of mitigation
measures following the sequence of mitigation, and may occur concurrently.
 
11-3-3: BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE
In determining an application’s compliance with the provisions of this section,
the City shall rely on the best available science (BAS). Methods and practices
for determining whether information is the BAS, obtaining BAS, including BAS in
developing policies and development regulations, addressing inadequate
scientific information, and demonstrating that special consideration has been
given to conservation or protection measures necessary to preserve or enhance
anadromous fisheries shall align with the guidance set forth in WAC 365-195, or
as revised.

outfalls and bioswales, may be allowed within the outer twenty five percent
(25%) of the buffer of category III and IV wetlands only, provided that no
other location is feasible and facilities do not degrade the function and
values of such wetlands.
   C.   Required Buffers:
      1.   Buffer Requirements: The following table establishes the standard

 Notes:
1.    High intensity land uses include commercial, industrial, and retail
developments; institutional use; residential developments at more than 1 unit
per acre; high intensity recreation areas (golf course, ball fields, etc.); and
solar farms.
2.    Moderate intensity land uses include residential developments at less
than 1 unit per acre; moderate intensity open space (parks with biking,
jogging, etc.); and paved trails and utility corridors with maintenance roads.
3.    Low intensity land uses include low intensity open space (hiking,
birdwatching, preservation of natural resources, etc.); and unpaved trails and
utility corridors without maintenance roads.
      2.   Removal Of Vegetation Within The Buffer: Removal or alteration of
existing vegetation in the buffer areas shall be prohibited or limited as
necessary to preserve the wetland. Removal of hazard trees, as determined by a
qualified arborist who has evaluated and determined the subject trees to be
hazardous to life, limb, or property on the subject property or surrounding
properties is also allowed, provided that in any given year, no more than 1% of
trees within the continuous critical area is demonstrated to be affected by the
tree removal. Any disturbance of the buffer area shall be replanted with a
diverse plant community of native vegetation appropriate for the site and
approved by the city.
      3.   Buffer Averaging: The City Administrator may allow modification of
the standard wetland buffer width in accordance with an approved critical area
report and the best available science on a case by case basis by averaging
buffer widths. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a qualified
professional demonstrates that:
         a.   It will not reduce wetland functions or values;
         b.   The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing
physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils,
or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and
would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places;
         c.   The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no
less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer; and
         d.   The buffer width is not reduced to less than seventy five percent
(75%) of the standard width.
   D.   Wetland Mitigation And Restoration:
      1.   Mitigation: All adverse impacts to wetlands shall be mitigated to
achieve no net loss of ecologic function, consistent with OMC 11-3-1.
Mitigation actions by an applicant or property owner shall occur in accordance
with OMC 11-3-2. If mitigation is required for the proposed project to achieve
no net loss of ecologic function, the applicant shall submit a Mitigation Plan
prepared by a qualified professional to the City. The Mitigation Plan shall
include the following, at minimum:
a.   Scaled mitigation plan sheets containing: mapped areas of existing and
proposed wetlands and buffers; location of proposed compensation actions;
existing topography with 2-foot contour intervals if grading is proposed;
cross-sections of existing and proposed site conditions; proposed planting plan
including species, spacing of plants, total number of each species, and timing
of installation; and any areas proposed for wetland buffer width averaging.

after the development project has been implemented, including proposed
monitoring and maintenance programs.
j.   A bond estimate for the entire compensatory mitigation project, including
the following elements: site preparation, plant materials, construction
materials, installation and oversight, maintenance at least twice per year for
up to five (5) years, monitoring field work and reporting, contingency actions
for a maximum of five (5) years, and removal of all non-natural site implements
(e.g., irrigation equipment, construction fencing, plant protectors, weed
barrier fabric) by the end of the monitoring period.
k.   Proof of establishment of Notice on Title for the remaining wetlands and
buffers on the development project site (if any).
      2.   Monitoring Program And Contingency Plan: A monitoring program shall
be implemented by the applicant to determine the success of the mitigation and
any necessary actions to achieve the objectives of the mitigation plan. The
monitoring program shall also include annual monitoring of the mitigation area
by a qualified professional for five (5) years, unless determined otherwise by
the City Administrator.
         a.   A contingency plan shall be established for indemnity in the
event that the mitigation project is inadequate or fails. A performance and
maintenance bond or other acceptable security device or financial guarantee is
required to ensure the applicant's compliance with the terms of the mitigation
and monitoring plan. The amount of the performance and maintenance bond shall
equal one hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the cost of the mitigation
project for a minimum of five (5) years. The bond may be reduced in proportion
to work successfully completed over the period of the bond at the discretion of
the City. The bonding period shall coincide with the monitoring period.
         b.   Monitoring programs prepared to comply with this section shall
reflect the following guidelines:
            (1)   Scientific procedures based on best available science shall
be used to establish the success or failure of the project.
            (2)   For vegetation determinations, permanent sampling points
shall be established.
            (3)   Vegetative success shall, at a minimum, equal eighty percent
(80%) survival of planted trees and shrubs and eighty percent (80%) cover of
desirable understory or emergent plant species at the end of the required
monitoring period. Additional standards for vegetative success, including, but
not limited to, minimum survival standards following the first growing season,
may be required after consideration of a report prepared by a qualified
professional.
            (4)   Monitoring reports on the current status of the mitigation
project shall be submitted to the city against the schedule set forth in
subsection OMC 11-4-1(D)(2)(b)(5).
            (5)   The reports are to be prepared by a qualified professional
and reviewed by the city or a consultant retained by the city and should
include monitoring information on wildlife, vegetation, water quality, water
flow, stormwater storage and conveyance, and existing or potential degradation,
as applicable, and shall be produced on the following schedule: at the time of
construction; thirty (30) days after planting; early in the growing season of
the first year; at the end of the growing season of the first year; twice
during the second year; and annually thereafter.
            (6)   Monitoring programs shall be established for a minimum of
five (5) years.
            (7)   Failures identified in the mitigation project shall be
replaced to meet the minimum vegetative success rate set forth in OMC 11-4-1(D)
(2)(b)(3).
            (8)   Dead or undesirable vegetation shall be replaced with
appropriate plantings to meet the minimum vegetative success rate set forth in
OMC 11-4-1(D)(2)(b)(3).
            (9)   Damage caused by erosion, settling, or other geomorphological
processes shall be repaired.
            (10)   The mitigation project shall be redesigned (if necessary)
and the new design shall be implemented and monitored.
      3.   Mitigation Ratios:
         a.   Equivalent Areas: Where wetland development is permitted by the
city, the applicant shall create or enhance wetland areas to compensate for
wetland losses. Equivalent areas shall be determined according to acreage,
function, type, location, timing factors and projected success of restoration
or creation.
         b.   Acreage Replacement Ratio: When creating or enhancing wetlands,
the following acreage replacement ratios shall be used where the first number
specifies the acreage of replacement wetlands and the second number specifies
the acreage of wetlands altered:
 
 
                      Wetland Creation                  Wetland Preservation or
Wetland Type          Replacement Ratio  Rehabilitation Enhancement Ratio
                      (Area)                            (Area)
Category I: Bogs,     Not considered     Case by case   Case by case
natural heritage site possible
Category I: Mature    6:1                12:1           24:1
forested
Category I: Based on  4:1                8:1            16:1
functions
Category II           3:1                6:1            12:1
Category III          2:1                4:1            8:1
Category IV           1.5:1              3:1            6:1
 
         c.   Increased Replacement Ratios: The City Administrator may increase
the ratios under the following circumstances:
            (1)   Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed
restoration or creation;
            (2)   A significant period of time will lapse between impact and
replication of wetland functions;
            (3)   Proposed mitigation will result in a lower category wetland
or reduced functions relative to the wetland being impacted;
            (4)   The impact being mitigated for was an unauthorized impact; or
            (5)   Where mitigation is to occur off site.
      4.   Restoration: Restoration is required when a wetland or its buffer
has been altered in violation of this title. The following minimum performance
standards shall be met for the restoration of a wetland, provided that if it
can be demonstrated by the applicant that greater functional and habitat values
can be obtained, these standards may be modified:
         a.   The original wetland configuration should be replicated including
depth, width, and length at the original location;
         b.   The original soil types and configuration shall be replicated;
         c.   The wetland and buffer areas shall be replanted with native
vegetation which replicates the original in species, sizes and densities; and
         d.   The original functional values shall be restored, including water
quality and wildlife habitat functions.
      5.   Wetland Mitigation Actions: Mitigation shall be in the same drainage
basin as the altered wetland. Wetland mitigation actions shall be conducted in
the same subbasin unless a higher level of ecological functioning would result
from an alternate approach.
      6.   Wetland Mitigation Banks:
         a.   Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as
compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:
            (1)   The bank is certified under state rules;
            (2)   The City Administrator determines that the wetland mitigation
bank provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and
            (3)   The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and
conditions of the certified bank instrument.
         b.   Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be
consistent with replacement ratios specified in the certified bank instrument.
         c.   Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to
compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the
certified bank instrument. In some cases, the service area of the bank may
include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland
functions.
      7.   In Lieu Fee: To aid in the implementation of off-site mitigation,
the city may develop an in lieu fee program. This program shall be developed
and approved through a public process and be consistent with federal rules,
state policy on in lieu fee mitigation, and state water quality regulations. An
approved in lieu fee program sells compensatory mitigation credits to
permittees whose obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is then
transferred to the in lieu program sponsor, a governmental or nonprofit natural
resource management entity. Credits from an approved in lieu fee program may be
used when subsections D7a through D7f of this subsection apply:
         a.   The approval authority determines that it would provide
environmentally appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts.
         b.   The mitigation will occur on a site identified using the site
selection and prioritization process in the approved in lieu fee program
instrument.
         c.   The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and
conditions of the approved in lieu fee program instrument.
         d.   Land acquisition and initial physical and biological improvements
of the mitigation site must be completed within three (3) years of the credit
sale.
         e.   Projects using in lieu fee credits shall have debits associated
with the proposed impacts calculated by the applicant's qualified professional
using the method consistent with the credit assessment method specified in the
approved instrument for the in lieu fee program.
         f.   Credits from an approved in lieu fee program may be used to
compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the
approved in lieu fee instrument.
   E.   Transfer Of Development Rights: If a site contains a regulated wetland
and/or buffer, a property owner may transfer residential development rights
from the regulated wetland and/or buffer to another site or sites within the
city. The transfer of development rights (TDR) shall meet the following
criteria:
      1.   The idea of transfer of development rights is based upon the legal
concept of property law that the right to develop real estate is one of the
"bundle of rights" included in fee simple ownership of land. Fee simple
ownership of real estate allows the owner to sell, lease, or trade any one or
all of the "bundle of rights" to his property which includes the right to use,
lease, sell, or abandon the property or any of its components of ownership not
retained by a previous owner such as mineral, oil, gas, air, and/or development
rights. These rights of ownership are subject to the limitation and legislative
powers of the local government.
      2.   A development right is a simple extension of the rights normally
associated with land ownership. When legally established, a development right
has value separate from the land itself. It can be subject to reasonable
regulation by local government under the police power. The development right
can be transferred by the owner, by means of gift or sale, to another property.
The landowner may sell the development rights and still retain the title to the
land and the right to use the surface of the land on a limited basis.
      3.   The planning commission shall consider the request for TDR at the
public hearing for the land use proposal for the receiving parcel.
      4.   To assure that the sending parcel is adequately protected, a
restriction shall be placed on the deed which expressly prohibits all regulated
activities within the wetland and/or buffer. This restriction shall be required
regardless of the number of dwelling units for which the development rights are
transferred. A memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the applicant and the city
shall be recorded with the county auditor and city clerk. The MOA shall refer
to all deed restrictions related to the property.
      5.   If the wetland and/or buffer is degraded as a result of human or
agricultural activity in violation of this code, the matter shall be addressed
by the city administrator or the code enforcement officer to remedy the code
violation as per section 11-5-1 of this chapter.
      6.   Except for required enhancement, the buffer and wetland shall remain
in a natural condition. This shall be indicated by a note on the face of any
final plat, final site plan, or other final approval for activity on the
sending site. In the case of a formal subdivision, the wetland and buffer shall
be placed in a separate tract.
      7.   TDR shall not exceed the number of dwelling units which would be
allowed on the sending parcel according to the zoning designation of the
sending parcel, if there were no development restrictions tied to wetland
areas. This number of dwelling units shall be equal to the number of dwelling
units that could be produced on the wetland and/or buffer if the sending parcel
were subdivided in terms of the minimum requirements of the underlying zone as
evidenced by a preliminary plan sketch.
      8.   TDR may go to more than one receiving parcel; however, this shall
not increase the total number of transferred dwelling units which are allowed.
      9.   The increased number of dwelling units on the receiving parcel shall
not be more than twenty five percent (25%) above the number of dwelling units
allowed according to the zoning designation on the receiving parcel(s).
      10.   TDR shall be allowed only if the land use proposal on the receiving
parcel(s) is designed in such a way that the increased density:
         a.   Is consistent with any land use plan associated with the
receiving parcel and with goals, purposes, and intents of the zoning
designation of the receiving parcel; and
         b.   Is compatible with the existing and likely future developments in
the vicinity; and
         c.   Adequately addresses infrastructure, natural and other
constraints, and does not result in significant environmental impacts.
      11.   TDR shall not be approved until final plat approval or other final
approval for the receiving parcel is granted by the city council. (Ord. 2016-
985, 7-13-2016)
 
11-4-2: LANDSLIDE HAZARD AREAS:
Development proposals on sites containing class I and class II landslide
hazards shall meet the following requirements:
   A.   Buffer Requirement: A buffer shall be established from all edges of
landslide hazard areas. The size of the buffer shall be determined by the City
Administrator to eliminate or minimize the risk of property damage, death, or
injury resulting from landslides caused in whole or part by the development,
based upon review of and concurrence with a critical areas study. The buffer
shall be equal to the height of the slope or fifty feet (50'), whichever is
greater. The buffer may be reduced when a qualified professional demonstrates
to the City Administrator's satisfaction that the reduction will adequately
protect the proposed development, adjacent developments, and uses and the
subject critical area. The buffer may be increased where the City Administrator
determines a larger buffer is necessary to prevent risk of damage to proposed
and existing development.
   B.   Alterations: Alterations of a landslide hazard area and/or buffer may
only occur for activities for which a critical areas report is submitted and
certifies that:
      1.   The development will not increase surface water discharge or
sedimentation to adjacent properties beyond predevelopment conditions;
      2.   The development will not decrease slope stability on adjacent
properties; and
      3.   Such alterations will not adversely impact other critical areas.
   C.   Impervious Surface Ratio: Impervious surfaces are defined in Title 9,
Chapter 5A, Section 4 of this code. The maximum impervious surface ratios for
class I and class II landslide hazard areas are set forth in table 2 of this
section.
   D.   Native Vegetation: The minimum percentage of native vegetation, as
defined in chapter 1 of this title, that must be retained on sites including
class I or class II landslide hazard areas is set forth in table 2 of this
section.

      1.   Structures and improvements shall be clustered to retain as much
open space as possible and to preserve the natural topographic features of the
site.
      2.   Structures and improvements shall conform to the natural contour of
the slope.
      3.   Structures and improvements shall be located to preserve the most
critical portion of the site and its natural landforms and vegetation.
      4.   The use of retaining walls which allow the maintenance of existing
natural slope area is preferred over graded artificial slopes.
   F.   Additional Standards For Class I Landslide Hazards:
      1.   Alteration of class I landslide hazard areas is permitted only if
the development proposal can be designed so that the landslide hazard to the
project and the adjacent property is eliminated or mitigated and the
development proposal on that site is certified by a geotechnical engineer
licensed in the state of Washington.
      2.   Development or alteration shall be prohibited on parcels with a lot
slope of greater than forty percent (40%). These parcels shall be eligible for
transfer of development rights as set forth in subsection 11-4-1(E) of this
code.
 
11-4-3: EROSION HAZARD AREAS:
Alteration of a site containing a critical erosion hazard area shall meet the
following requirements:
   A.   All alteration proposals shall submit an erosion control plan
consistent with this section prior to receiving approval.
   B.   Clearing on erosion hazard areas is allowed from April 1 to November 1
only.
   C.   Only that clearing necessary to install temporary sedimentation and
erosion control measures shall occur prior to clearing for roadways or
utilities.
   D.   Clearing limits for roads, water, wastewater, and stormwater utilities,
and temporary erosion control facilities shall be marked in the field and
approved by Orting prior to any alteration of existing native vegetation.
   E.   The authorized clearing for roads and utilities shall be the minimum
necessary to accomplish project specific engineering designs and shall remain
within approved rights of way.
   F.   All trees and understory shall be retained on lots or parcels provided
that understory damaged during approved clearing operations may be pruned or
replaced. (1973 Code § 15.24.030)
 
11-4-4: SEISMIC HAZARD AREAS:
Development proposals on sites containing mapped seismic hazard areas may make
alterations to a seismic hazard area only when the applicant demonstrates and
Orting concludes that:
   A.   Evaluation of site-specific subsurface conditions shows that the site
is not located in a seismic hazard area; or
   B.   Mitigation is implemented which renders the proposed development as
safe as if it were not located in a seismic hazard area, as certified by a
qualified professional licensed by the state of Washington. (1973 Code §
15.24.040)
 
11-4-5: VOLCANIC HAZARD AREAS:

that will enable the fair, efficient and orderly conduct of the two (2) hearing
types.
      1.   Type A Hearing; Procedure: A type A hearing is a hearing to contest
the existence and/or responsibility for the violation or violations that are
subject to the appeal.
The hearing examiner shall conduct an adjudicative hearing on the appeal
pursuant to the rules of procedure of the hearing examiner. The city and the
appellant shall be the parties in the hearing and each party may call witnesses
and may be represented by legal counsel. The city shall have the burden of
proof to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that violation or
violations that are the subject of the appeal has or have occurred and that the
appellant is the person responsible for compliance.
      2.   Type B Hearing; Procedure: A type B hearing is a hearing to
determine whether or not the civil regulatory order or a final determination of
noncompliance or enforcement decision was issued in error based upon one or
more of the following:
         a.   Issued in excess of the authority or jurisdiction of the city or
code enforcement officer; or
         b.   Made upon unlawful procedure; or
         c.   Affected by material error of law or fact; or
         d.   Clearly erroneous in view of the entire record as submitted; or
         e.   Order or determination was arbitrary or capricious.
The city and the appellant shall be the parties in the hearing and each party
may call witnesses and may be represented by legal counsel. The appellant shall
have the burden of proof to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence the
claimed errors of law and/or errors of fact. The hearing examiner shall give
substantial weight to any discretionary decision, or any construction of this
code, rendered by the code enforcement officer or department director pursuant
to this chapter/title.
   E.   Stay Of Action Pending Appeal: An appellant may request the hearing
examiner to stay or suspend an action by the city to implement the decision
under review pending the outcome of the administrative appeal. The request must
set forth a statement of grounds for the stay and the factual basis for the
request. The hearing examiner may grant a stay only if the hearing examiner
finds that:
      1.   The party requesting the stay is likely to prevail on the merits;
      2.   Without the stay the party requesting it will suffer irreparable
harm;
      3.   The grant of a stay will not substantially harm other parties to the
proceedings; and
      4.   The request for the stay is timely in light of the circumstances of
the case.
The hearing examiner may grant the request for a stay upon such terms and
conditions, including the filing of security, as are necessary to prevent harm
to other parties by the stay.
   F.   Decision Of The Hearing Examiner:
      1.   Determination; Type A: The hearing examiner shall determine whether
the city has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation
or violations subject to the appeal has or have occurred and shall affirm or
vacate the city's decision regarding such violation or violations. If the
hearing examiner affirms the decision of the city, the hearing examiner shall
impose the penalties as set forth in the notice of violation, or such other
penalties as the hearing examiner determines are reasonable and just and in
conformance with this chapter.
      2.   Determination; Type B: The hearing examiner shall determine whether
the appellant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the city
committed one or more errors under subsections D2a through D2e of this section.
The examiner may: a) affirm the decision of the code enforcement officer, b)
remand the matter back to the code enforcement officer for further action
consistent with the decision of the hearing examiner, c) reverse the order or
determination if the substantial rights of the appellant may have been
prejudiced because the order or determination was in violation of one or more
factors set forth in subsections D2a through D2e of this section, or d) modify
the order or decision to the extent necessary to correct the error.
      3.   Need For Corrective Action: The determination of the applicable code
enforcement officer and/or department director as to the need for the required
corrective action shall be accorded substantial weight by the hearing examiner
in determining the reasonableness of the required corrective action.
      4.   Issue Order: The hearing examiner shall issue an order to the
parties which contains the following information:
         a.   The decision regarding the matter being appealed including
findings of fact and conclusions based thereon in support of the decision; and/
or
         b.   The required corrective action; and/or

the hearing examiner, b) remand the matter back to the hearing examiner or code
enforcement officer for further action consistent with the decision of the city

1-13-1: GENERAL:
   A.   Purpose; Application: The purpose of this chapter is to establish an
efficient and consistent civil administrative system of enforcing city
regulations, violations of the development code, and violations of the public
health and safety code (title 5 of this code) that will enable violations to be
promptly resolved wherever possible, while providing both appropriate penalties
and a full opportunity for alleged violators to have a hearing to contest the
violations. The procedures and remedies provided herein shall apply to all
violations of the development code, the public health and safety code (title 5
of this code) and city regulations and to any title, chapter, section or
provision of the code to which zoning enforcement provisions of this code are
made applicable.
   B.   Liability; Duty: While this chapter does authorize the city of Orting
and city officials, officers, employees or agents to take action to enforce
city ordinances and regulations, it shall not be construed as placing
responsibility for code compliance or as creating any duty on the part of the
city or any city official, officer, employee or agent to any particular case,
or as creating any duty on the part of the city or any city official, officer,
employee or agent to any particular person or class of persons. This chapter
shall be enforced for the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and
not for the benefit of any particular person or class of persons. Nothing
contained in this chapter is intended nor shall be construed to create or form
the basis of any liability on the part of the city, its officials, officers,
employees or agents, for any injury or damage resulting from any act or
omission on the part of the city, its officials, officers, employees or agents.
   C.   Intent: It is the intent of this chapter to place the obligation of
complying with its requirements upon the owner, occupier or other person
responsible for the condition of the land and/or structures or responsible for
actions regulated pursuant to this chapter.
   D.   Authorization: Code enforcement officers are authorized to use the
provisions and procedures of this chapter to take action to enforce those
regulations and provisions of this code, and uncodified provisions of a city
ordinance, over which such enforcement officer has been granted enforcement
authority, including issuance of correction notices, voluntary correction
agreements, civil regulatory orders, notices of violation and notices of
infraction, to enforce compliance therewith.
   E.   Statement Of Policy: It is the policy of the city of Orting to
emphasize code compliance by education and prevention as a first step. This
policy is designed to ensure code compliance and timely action that is
available to all persons and uniform in its implementation. While warnings
through a notice of correction and voluntary compliance are desirable as a
first step, enforcement, monetary penalties, and restitution should be used for
remedial purposes as needed to assure and effect code compliance. Abatement,
correction, remediation or mitigation should be pursued when appropriate and
feasible, but is not a precondition to issuance of a notice of civil violation
or notice of infraction or taking action to seek imposition of criminal
penalties. Uniform and efficient procedures, with consistent application
tailored by regulation, should be used to accomplish this policy.
   F.   Joint And Several Responsibility And Liability: Responsibility for
violations subject to enforcement under this chapter is joint and several, and
the city is not prohibited from taking action against a party where other
persons may also be potentially responsible for a violation, nor is the city
required to take action against all persons potentially responsible for
compliance.
   G.   Presumption: Proof that a violation of a regulation, the development
code or the health and safety code (title 5 of this code) exists on privately
owned (nongovernmental) property shall constitute prima facie evidence that the
owner of the property is a person responsible for compliance. However, this
shall not relieve or prevent enforcement against any other person who may also
be responsible for compliance. Proof that a violation of a regulation occurred
on property subject to a project permit shall constitute prima facie evidence
that the applicant for the project permit is a person responsible for
compliance. However, this shall not relieve or prevent enforcement against any
other person who may also be a person responsible for compliance.
   H.   Prohibited Acts Include Causing And Permitting: Whenever in this code
or the noncodified ordinances of the city, or any rule or regulation issued
pursuant thereto, any act or omission constitutes a civil violation, such act
or omission includes causing, allowing, permitting, aiding, abetting, suffering
or concealing the fact of such act or omission.
   I.   Separate Offense: Every act or omission which constitutes a civil
violation under this code or the noncodified ordinances of the city, or any
rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto, shall constitute a separate civil
violation for each and every day during any portion of which the act or
omission constituting the violation is committed, continued or permitted.
   J.   Nonexclusive: The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive and may
be used in addition to other enforcement provisions authorized by this code,
state or federal law, including, but not limited to, civil infraction
proceedings and penalties, criminal proceedings or sanctions, nuisance and
injunction actions, unfit dwelling proceedings, or other civil or equitable
actions to abate, discontinue, correct, or discourage unlawful acts in
violation of this chapter. The choice of enforcement action to be taken and the
severity of any penalty to be imposed shall be guided by the nature of the
violation, the damage or risk to the public or to public resources, and/or the
existence or degree of bad faith of the person or persons subject to the
enforcement action.
   K.   Conflicts: Except as provided in section 1-13-2, "Definitions", of this
chapter, in the event of a conflict between this chapter and any other
provision of this code or other city ordinance providing for a civil violation
or civil infraction, this chapter shall control to the extent of the conflict.
In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any mandatory provision of
state or federal law, the provision of the state or federal law shall control
to the extent of the conflict. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)

be any of the following as they appear at the time the document is mailed: the
address of the property where the violation is occurring, as reflected on the
most recent equalized tax assessment roll of the county assessor or the
taxpayer address appearing for the property on the official property tax
information website for Pierce County; the address appearing in any database
used for the payment of utilities for the property at which the violations are
occurring; the address appearing on the project permit application, or the
address of the person to whom the documents are being sent that appears in the
Washington state department of licensing database. Where service of the notice
of violation is by mail, service shall be deemed complete upon the third day

falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal legal holiday, in which event service
shall be deemed complete on the first day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or
legal holiday following the third day.
      3.   Posting: Posting shall mean affixing a copy of the document in a
conspicuous place on the property, with at least one copy of such document

civil violation, notice of hearing, civil regulatory order, or other code
enforcement document shall be deemed legally served upon a party by use of
regular, first class mail, as described in subsection A2 of this section,
unless another method of service is expressly required in a particular
subsection of this chapter, state law, or court rule; provided, at the
discretion of the code enforcement officer, the code enforcement officer may
personally serve documents or cause documents to be personally served upon a
party.
   C.   Proof Of Service; Due Diligence: Proof of service may be made by
written affidavit or declaration under penalty of perjury executed by the
person effecting the service, declaring the time and date of service, the
manner by which service was made, and if service was made solely by posting or
publication, facts showing that due diligence was used in attempting to locate
a mailing address for the person at whom the notice of violation is directed.
Proof of service may also be made by testimony given under oath in a proceeding
relating to the violation.
   D.   Additional Proof Of Service Not Necessary: The hearing examiner shall
not require additional proof of service beyond the requirements in this
section. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)
 
1-13-4: VOLUNTARY CORRECTION:
   A.   General: A code enforcement officer may attempt to secure the voluntary
correction of a violation by attempting to contact the person responsible for
the violation, explaining the violation, and requesting correction. This may be
done verbally by the code enforcement officer or in writing.
   B.   Written Correction Notice; Policy; Exceptions: It is the policy of the
city to attempt voluntary correction pursuant to the provisions of this section
prior to issuance of a notice of civil violation or notice of civil infraction,
except under the following circumstances: 1) when the violation constitutes a
"repeat violation" as defined in this chapter, 2) when the code enforcement
officer determines, in his or her reasonable discretion, that a written
correction notice would be ineffective or futile, or 3) when a civil regulatory
order has been issued. The failure of the code enforcement officer to seek
voluntary correction shall not invalidate any action taken by the code
enforcement officer or the city pursuant to this chapter.
   C.   Service Of Correction Notice: Service of a written correction notice
may be accomplished by regular, first class mail or by personal service, at the
discretion of the code enforcement officer, or by posting or publishing the
correction notice pursuant to subsections 1-13-3A3 and A4 of this chapter if an
address for the person responsible for compliance cannot be ascertained.
   D.   Contents Of Written Correction Notice: The written correction notice
shall be deemed sufficient if it contains the following information:
      1.   The name and address of a person responsible for the violation; and
      2.   The street address or description sufficient for identification of
the building, structure, premises, or land upon or within which the violation
has occurred or is occurring; and
      3.   A description of the nature, extent, and time of the violation and a
reference to the regulation or provision of this code or uncodified city
ordinance that has been violated; and
      4.   A statement identifying what corrective actions are required and a
correction deadline stating the date and time by which the corrective actions
must be completed in order for the violator to avoid the issuance of a notice
of violation; and
      5.   A statement indicating that a notice of civil violation or civil
infraction may be issued for each day a violation continues, with each
violation constituting a separate violation subject to civil and/or criminal
penalties.
   E.   Time Period In Which To Correct Or Abate The Violation: Whenever a
person responsible for compliance is served with a written correction notice,
he or she shall be given at least ten (10) days from the date of issuance of
the notice to correct the violation(s); provided, where, the code enforcement
officer determines that a violation creates a risk of imminent harm to public
health or safety, or is a "repeat violation" as defined in this chapter, the
code enforcement officer can require less than ten (10) days for correction to
be completed. In the event the violation is not corrected within the required
time period, the code enforcement officer may exercise whatever other remedies
are available pursuant to this chapter.
   F.   Extension Of Voluntary Correction Period Or Modification Of Required
Actions: An extension of the deadline for voluntary correction, or a
modification of any required corrective action noted in the written correction
notice, may be granted by the code enforcement officer if the person
responsible for compliance has, in the opinion of the code enforcement officer,
shown due diligence or made substantial progress in correcting the violations
but unforeseen circumstances, or other circumstances over which the person
responsible for compliance has no control, render correction unattainable
within the original deadline.
   G.   Revocation Of Deadline For Compliance: The original deadline for
compliance, or any extension for compliance previously granted by the code
enforcement officer, may be revoked and immediate compliance required where, in
the opinion of the code enforcement officer, circumstances make immediate
correction necessary to avoid an imminent risk of injury to persons or
property. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)
 
1-13-5: VOLUNTARY CORRECTION AGREEMENT:
   A.   Voluntary Correction Agreement; General: At the sole discretion of the
code enforcement officer, a voluntary correction agreement (hereinafter
"agreement") may be entered into between the person responsible for compliance
and the city. The agreement must be in writing. The agreement may be
implemented following an oral or written notice of correction, service of a
civil regulatory order, issuance of a notice of civil violation or notice of
infraction, or filing of a criminal complaint.
   B.   Effect Of Agreement: Execution of the agreement represents
acknowledgment and agreement by the person entering into the agreement
(hereinafter the "signatory") that he or she is the person responsible for
compliance or violations as set forth in the agreement, that the agreement

agreement have been committed, and that this determination is final and
conclusive.
   C.   Contents Of Voluntary Correction Agreement: The voluntary correction

violation within the time specified in the voluntary correction agreement; and
      2.   An acknowledgment by the person responsible for compliance that if
the violation is not corrected in compliance with the terms and conditions of
the voluntary correction agreement, the city may issue a notice of civil
violation and impose monetary penalties for the time period for the violation
or violations described in the voluntary correction agreement; and
      3.   The name and address of the person responsible for the violation;
and
      4.   The street address or a description sufficient for identification of
the building, structure, premises, or land upon or within which the violation
has occurred or is occurring; and
      5.   A description of the nature, extent, and time of the violation and a
reference to the regulation or provision of this code or uncodified city
ordinance that has been violated; and
      6.   An acknowledgment by the person responsible for compliance that the
violation described in the voluntary correction agreement exists; that he or
she is the person responsible for compliance or the violations set forth in the
voluntary correction agreement, that the agreement represents a determination
that the violation or violations as set forth in the voluntary correction
agreement have been committed, and that this determination is final and
conclusive; and
      7.   A statement identifying the necessary corrective action to be taken,
the date or time by which correction must be completed, and an acknowledgment
by the person responsible for compliance that he or she will correct the
violation within the time specified in the voluntary correction agreement; and
      8.   An acknowledgment by the person responsible for compliance that if
the violation is not corrected in compliance with the terms and conditions of
the voluntary correction agreement, the city may issue a notice of civil
violation and impose monetary penalties for the time period for the violation
or violations described in the voluntary correction agreement; and
      9.   Acknowledgment by the person responsible for compliance that the
city may enter the building, structure, premises, or land and inspect the
building, structure, premises, or land as may be necessary to determine
compliance with the voluntary correction agreement; and
      10.   Acknowledgment by the person responsible for compliance that the
code enforcement officer shall have the decision making authority to determine
if corrective action has been taken in compliance with the terms and conditions
of the voluntary correction agreement; and
      11.   Acknowledgment by the person responsible for compliance that if the
code enforcement officer determines that the terms of the voluntary correction
agreement are not met, the city may enter the building, structure, premises, or
land to complete the corrective action set forth in the voluntary correction
agreement and may also recover its costs and expenses and/or a monetary penalty
pursuant to this chapter from the signatory; and
      12.   The signature or official mark of the person responsible for
compliance and the signature or official mark of the code enforcement officer.
   D.   Failure To Comply With Voluntary Correction Agreement:
      1.   Determination: The code enforcement officer shall have the authority
to determine, in his or her discretion, whether or not the signatory is in
compliance with the voluntary correction agreement. A final determination of
compliance or noncompliance shall be made in writing and shall identify that it
is a final determination.
      2.   Notice Of Violation: In the event that the code enforcement officer
has made a final determination that the signatory has failed to comply with the
terms and conditions of a voluntary correction agreement, and no appeal has
been timely filed pursuant to subsection E of this section, the city may issue
a notice of civil violation and impose monetary penalties for the underlying
violation or violations which are the subject of the voluntary correction
agreement or may, as permitted in this code, file criminal charges for the
underlying violation or violations which are the subject of the voluntary
correction agreement. The filing of an appeal of the determination of
noncompliance shall not preclude the city from pursuing any other remedies
available under this chapter or at law or in equity, including issuing a notice
of violation or infraction for each continuing violation. The City maintains
the ability to record documents associated with civil violations with the
Pierce County Auditor, and may record a voluntary correction agreement using
the property address associated with the underlying violations.
      3.   Abatement By The City: In addition to any other remedy provided for
in this chapter, the city may abate the violation in accordance with the
applicable provisions of this code and state law if the code enforcement
officer issues a determination of noncompliance.
   E.   Appeal: A person responsible for a violation who has entered into a
voluntary correction agreement may appeal the code enforcement officer's final
determination of noncompliance with the voluntary correction agreement pursuant
to the provisions of chapter 12 of this title for appeal of a final
determination of noncompliance. The filing of an appeal, as provided herein,
shall not preclude the city from taking further enforcement action. Nothing
herein shall preclude an appeal of issuance of notice of civil violation and
imposition of monetary penalties pursuant to subsection 1-13-6K of this
chapter. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)
 
1-13-6: CIVIL VIOLATIONS:
   A.   Civil Violation: A code enforcement officer may issue a notice of civil
violation when there is reasonable cause to believe that there is or has been a
violation.
   B.   Contents Of Notice Of Violation: The notice of violation shall set
forth and contain:
      1.   The name and address of the person responsible for compliance; and
      2.   The street address or a description sufficient for identification of
the building, structure, premises, or land upon or within which the violation
has occurred or is occurring; and
      3.   A description of the nature, extent, and time of the violation and a
reference to the regulation or provision of this code or uncodified city
ordinance that has been violated; and
      4.   A statement setting forth the monetary penalty imposed and each
violation or violations that are subject to such monetary penalty; and
      5.   A statement that the person to whom the notice is issued may appeal
the notice of civil violation as provided in subsection K of this section; and
      6.   A statement that a notice of civil violation issued pursuant to this
section represents a determination that the violation/violations identified in
the notice has/have been committed and that this determination is final and
conclusive unless appealed as provided in subsection K of this section.
   C.   Service: Except as provided herein, service of a notice of civil
violation shall be by personal service or by mailing. If personal service is
not accomplished after reasonable effort and if an address for mailed service
cannot be ascertained, service shall be accomplished by posting a copy of the
order conspicuously on the affected building, structure, premises, or land. If
service by posting is ineffective or cannot be lawfully accomplished, service
shall be accomplished by publication.
   D.   Effect Of Notice Of Civil Violation: A notice of civil violation issued
pursuant to this section represents a determination that the violation/
violations identified in the notice of civil violation has/have been committed.
This determination is final and conclusive as to the violation or violations
set forth in the notice of violation, unless a timely appeal is filed as
provided in subsection K of this section. If a timely appeal is not filed, such
determination shall be also be final and conclusive for any subsequent notice
of violation issued for the same continuing violation or violations; provided
that, such determination shall not preclude an appeal of the determination that
the violation or violations is/are continuing. Nothing herein is otherwise
intended to preclude timely appeal of a separate or subsequent civil regulatory
order, notice of civil violation, notice of infraction or imposition of
criminal penalties related to the same or continuing violation or violations,
to the extent an appeal may be available.
   E.   Continued Duty To Correct: Payment of a monetary penalty imposed
pursuant to this chapter does not relieve a person of the duty to correct the
violation as ordered by the code enforcement officer.
   F.   Monetary Penalty: Unless a different monetary penalty is specified in
this code or state law for a particular violation, the monetary penalty for
each violation per day or portion thereof, and each continuing day or portion
thereof, shall be as follows:
      1.   First day of each violation, one hundred dollars ($100.00);
      2.   Second day of each violation, two hundred dollars ($200.00);
      3.   Third day of each violation, three hundred dollars ($300.00);
      4.   Fourth day of each violation, four hundred dollars ($400.00);
      5.   Each additional day of each violation continuing beyond four (4)
days, five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day;
      6.   For each repeat violation, five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day.
   G.   Mitigation Of Monetary Penalty: In the event that the person who is the
subject of the notice of violation enters into a voluntary compliance
agreement, upon approval by the city administrator, the code enforcement
officer may suspend, reduce or waive the monetary penalties imposed pursuant to
the notice of civil violation upon a showing of hardship, substantial
completion of the necessary correction, unforeseeable circumstances beyond the
control of the person responsible for compliance which render completion
impossible by the date established as a good cause, or other factors or
considerations establishing a basis for mitigation of the monetary penalty.
   H.   Other Action: In addition to the issuance of the notice of civil
violation, the city may take other enforcement action available at law or in
equity including, by way of example and not limitation, issuance of a notice of
civil infraction, seeking injunctive or declaratory relief, taking action to
seek imposition of criminal penalties, and rescission as set forth in Revised
Code Of Washington 90.58.140. The city may also combine a notice of civil
violation with a civil regulatory order. The City maintains the ability to
record documents associated with civil violations with the Pierce County
Auditor, and may record a notice of civil violation using the property address
associated with the underlying violations.
   I.   Collection Of Monetary Penalty: The monetary penalty constitutes a
personal obligation of the person to whom the notice of civil violation is
directed. Any monetary penalty assessed shall be immediately due and payable
and must be paid to the city within ten (10) calendar days from the date of
service of the notice of violation. The city attorney is authorized to take
appropriate action to collect the monetary penalty. The city administrator may
issue a civil regulatory order stopping work until such penalty is paid.
   J.   Application For Remission Or Mitigation: Any person incurring a
monetary penalty for a civil violation may, within ten (10) days of service of
the notice of violation, apply in writing to the city administrator for
remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. The city administrator shall
issue a decision on the application within fifteen (15) business days. Upon
receipt of a complete application for remission or mitigation, the city
administrator, or his/her designee, shall consider the application, together
with any information the city administrator, or his/her designee, determines is
relevant, and may remit or mitigate the penalty only upon a finding by a
preponderance of the evidence that applicant has demonstrated extraordinary
circumstances, such as the presence of information or factors not considered in
setting the original penalty. When a monetary penalty is imposed jointly by the
department of ecology and the city, the penalty may be remitted or mitigated
only upon such terms as both the department of ecology and the city agree.
   K.   Appeal: A notice of civil violation may be appealed to the hearing
examiner pursuant to the procedures set forth in chapter 12 of this title for
appeal of a notice of civil violation. In the event that a notice of civil
violation is combined with the civil regulatory order, payment of the monetary
penalty imposed shall be stayed during the pendency of any administrative
appeal. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)
 
1-13-7: CIVIL REGULATORY ORDER:
   A.   In General: A code enforcement officer may issue a civil regulatory
order when there is reasonable cause to believe that there is or has been a
violation or that failure to take action or to refrain from taking action will
result in a violation. It is the policy of the city that a civil regulatory
order may be issued, in lieu of initially seeking voluntary correction or
issuing a notice of correction, when the code enforcement officer determines,
in his or her discretion, that: 1) the nature of the violation creates a risk
of imminent harm to public health or safety, or 2) the act or omission that has
caused the violation or from which the violation arose or will arise, is
continuing or ongoing, or 3) issuance of a civil regulatory order is necessary
to prevent future or continuing violations, or 4) issuance of a civil
regulatory order is necessary to prevent imminent harm to persons or property,
or 5) issuance of a written correction notice would be ineffective or futile.
The failure of the code enforcement officer to seek voluntary correction prior
to issuance of a civil regulatory order shall not invalidate any action taken
by the code enforcement officer or the city pursuant to this chapter.
   B.   Content Of Civil Regulatory Order: The order shall set forth and
contain:
      1.   The name and address of the person responsible for compliance with
the order; and
      2.   The street address or a description sufficient for identification of
the building, structure, premises, or land upon or within which the violation
will occur, has occurred or is occurring; and
      3.   A description of the nature, extent, and time of the violation and a
reference to the regulation or provision of this code or uncodified city
ordinance that has been or may be violated; and
      4.   An order that the act or omission or use causing or leading to a
violation or a potential violation shall immediately cease and desist and/or,
in appropriate cases, an order to take specific corrective action within a
specific and reasonable time, which corrective action may include, but is not
limited to, abatement, remediation, correction, and/or mitigation of the site
and other property damaged; and
      5.   A statement that the person to whom the civil regulatory order is
issued may appeal the civil regulatory order as provided in subsection L of
this section; and

notice of civil violation, the order shall include a statement of the monetary
penalty imposed and each violation or violations that are subject to such
monetary penalty.
   C.   Service: Except as provided herein, service of a civil regulatory order
shall be by personal service or by mailing. If personal service is not
accomplished after reasonable efforts and if an address for mailed service
cannot be ascertained, service shall be accomplished by posting a copy of the
order conspicuously on the affected building, structure, premises, or land. If
service by posting is ineffective or cannot be lawfully accomplished, service
shall be accomplished by publication.
   D.   Effective Date: An order issued under this section shall become
effective immediately upon service of the order upon the person to whom it is
directed.
   E.   Effect Of Civil Regulatory Order: A civil regulatory order represents a
determination that the violation/violations identified in the civil regulatory
order has/have been committed. This determination is final and conclusive
unless appealed as provided herein; provided that, nothing herein is intended
to preclude timely appeal of a separate or subsequent order, notice of civil
violation, notice of infraction or imposition of criminal penalties related to
the same or continuing violation or violations, to the extent an appeal may be
available.
   F.   Extension: Upon written request received prior to the correction date
or time, the code enforcement officer may extend the date set for correction
for good cause or in order to accommodate a voluntary correction agreement. The
code enforcement officer may consider substantial completion of the necessary
correction or unforeseeable circumstances which render completion impossible by
the date established as a good cause.
   G.   Violation; Unlawful: When a civil regulatory order has been issued,
posted and/or served pursuant to this section, it is unlawful for any person to
whom the order is directed or any person with actual or constructive knowledge
of the order to conduct any activity or perform any work prohibited by the
terms of the order, even if the order has been appealed, until the enforcement
officer has removed the copy of the order, if posted, and issued written
authorization for the activity or work to be resumed.
   H.   Removal Of Civil Regulatory Order; Violation: It shall be unlawful to
remove a civil regulatory order posted in conformity with the requirements of
this chapter without the prior authorization of a code enforcement officer or
public official of the city, the city hearing examiner, or an order of a court
with jurisdiction.
   I.   Compliance; Violation: It is unlawful to fail to comply with the terms
and conditions of the civil regulatory order. Failure to comply with a civil
regulatory order can result in enforcement actions including, but not limited
to, the issuance of a notice of civil violation, issuance of a civil
infraction, and imposition of criminal penalties.
   J.   Other Action: In addition to the issuance of the civil regulatory
order, the city may take other enforcement action available at law or in equity
including, by way of example and not limitation, issuance of a notice of civil
violation and penalties, issuance of a civil infraction, seeking injunctive or
declaratory relief, imposition of criminal penalties, modification or
revocation of the project permit or approval, and rescission as set forth in
Revised Code Of Washington 90.58.140. The city may also combine a notice of
civil violation with a civil regulatory order. The City maintains the ability
to record documents associated with civil violations with the Pierce County
Auditor, and may record a notice of civil regulatory order under a property
with underlying violations.
   K.   Revocation Of Project Permit Or Approval:
      1.   Order Of Revocation/Rescission: The code enforcement officer may
issue a civil regulatory order revoking or rescinding a project permit or
approval if the code enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that:
a) the project permit or approval was obtained in violation of subsection 1-13-
8B of this chapter (fraud; deception), or b) no reasonable conditions can be
imposed that would abate or mitigate a violation, or c) the person responsible
for compliance has failed to comply with the conditions of the project permit
or approval. The person responsible for compliance shall cease all activity
allowed by the project permit or approval upon service of the civil regulatory
order revoking the project permit and exhaustion of all administrative appeals
of such order.
      2.   Notice; Hearing: A decision to rescind a project permit or approval
issued pursuant to title 11, chapter 6, "Shoreline Master Program", of this
code shall be subject to the requirements of Revised Code Of Washington
90.58.140.
      3.   Reapplication: If a project permit or approval is revoked for fraud
or deception, no similar application shall be accepted for a period of one year
from the later of the date of service of the order of revocation, or finding
and nonappealable decision upon appeal, if any. If a permit or approval is
revoked for any other reason, another application may be submitted subject to
all of the applicable requirements of the development code.
   L.   Appeal: A civil regulatory order may be appealed to the hearing
examiner pursuant to the procedures set forth in chapter 12 of this title for
appeal of a civil regulatory order. In the event that a notice of civil
violation is combined with the civil regulatory order, payment of the monetary
penalty imposed shall be stayed during the pendency of any administrative
appeal. In the event of a notice of appeal of an order revoking or rescinding a
project permit or approval, the order shall be stayed during the pendency of
any administrative appeal. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)

thereof is the named insured. In the event of any conflict between this chapter
and the provisions of any such policy of insurance, the policy provisions shall
be controlling; provided, however, that nothing contained in this section shall
be deemed to limit or restrict any employee's or official's right to full
coverage pursuant to this chapter, it being the intent of this chapter and
section to provide the coverage detailed in this chapter outside and beyond
insurance policies which may be in effect, while not compromising the terms and
conditions of such policies by any conflicting provision contained in this
chapter.
   B.   If a bargaining unit contract covers the subject of any of the
provisions of this chapter, all employees subject to the contract shall be
governed by the terms of the contract. If there is a conflict between the

WHEREAS, the City Council has established a goal for Downtown Revitalization
and Economic Development outlining the general intention to create a cohesive
business
environment in Orting’s downtown core, and specifically including an aim to evaluate Orting’s
parking regulations; and
WHEREAS, 
the City is expected to grow its economic base by nearly 200 jobs in the next
20 years, and the most substantial growth in jobs is expected to occur in
retail, finance, insurance, and real estate services, all of which are
land use types that are permitted to occur in Orting’s Mixed Use Town Center
(MUTC) zone which occupies the majority of the City’s downtown core; and
WHEREAS, through coordination with Orting residents and application of Orting’s
parking regulations on business concepts by desirous or prospective
entrepreneurs, the City has determined that Orting’s current parking
regulations hinder and effectively prohibit new business establishment and
existing business expansion when applied in the downtown core; and
WHEREAS, the effective prohibition of new business establishment and of
existing business expansion directly conflicts with the Downtown Revitalization
and Economic Development goals established by the City Council; and
WHEREAS, 
in the interest of immediately removing the barrier that downtown parking
regulations have on new and expanded economic development opportunities in the
City, and
in the interest of studying and contemplating alternative permanent solutions through a public
process before adopting an appropriate permanent solution for the City, the
City desires to renew interim controls related to off-street parking; and
WHEREAS,  the official interim controls 
(“Interim Controls”) that are the subject matter
of this Ordinance, attached hereto as Attachment A, are eligible for, and not exempt from, the

WHEREAS, under the Growth Management Act (GMA), the City held a public hearing
within 60 days of adopting Ordinance No. 2024-1137, on February 12, 2025, to

WHEREAS, following the February 12, 2025, public hearing, the City Council
affirmed that Ordinance No. 2024-1137 should be adopted and
remain in effect for an initial six-month period, terminating August 12, 2025;
and
WHEREAS, while the Interim Controls are in place, the City is working to
develop
permanent regulations that support the City’s goal for Downtown Revitalization and Economic
Development without placing an undue burden on public infrastructure or the
general public at large; and
WHEREAS, development of permanent code amendments necessary to implement
provisions contained in the Interim Controls is anticipated to occur in the second half of 2025;
and
WHEREAS, 
an extension of the Interim Controls is necessary to provide time for the City
to observe the efficacy of the Interim Controls, to consider implementation of
additional measures to support the intention of the Interim Controls, and to
draft, consider, and hold hearings on permanent regulations; and
WHEREAS, the State Environmental Policy Act (SEPA) Responsible Official for the
City of Orting has determined that permanent code amendments would be
categorically exempt from the threshold determination requirements of SEPA
pursuant to the terms of WAC 197- 11-800(19); and
WHEREAS, the City Council duly held the public hearing required pursuant to RCW
36.70A.390 and RCW 35A.63.220 on July 30, 2025, to hear and consider public
comment and testimony regarding renewal of the Interim Controls for an
additional six-month period; and
WHEREAS, the City Council intends the recitals in this Ordinance to be
considered findings of fact in support of the immediate extension
of Ordinance No. 2024-1137 consistent with the Effective Date set forth in this
Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the City Council intends that any additional or amended findings made
during the July 30, 2025 public hearing at which the extension of the Interim
Controls was heard be incorporated as findings of fact in support of this
Ordinance’s adoption; and
WHEREAS, 
at a future date, the City Council may extend these Interim Controls for one
or more additional six-
month periods provided a subsequent public hearing is held and findings of fact
are made prior to each renewal; and
WHEREAS, at the time of the enactment of the Interim Controls, there are no
known pending or contemplated applications or activities that would prohibit
the City Council from taking this action;
 
NOW, THEREFORE, the City Council of the City of Orting, Washington, do ordain

aim to evaluate Orting’s parking regulations; and
WHEREAS, the City is expected to grow its economic base by nearly 200 jobs in
the next 20 years, the most substantial of which are expected to occur in
retail, finance,
insurance, and real estate services, all of which are land use types that are outright permitted
to occur in Orting’s Mixed Use Town Center (MUTC) zone which occupies the
majority of the City’s downtown core; and
WHEREAS, through coordination with Orting citizens, and through application of
Orting’s parking regulations on business concepts by desirous or prospective entrepreneurs,
the City has determined that Orting’s current parking regulations hinder and
effectively prohibit new business establishment and existing business expansion
when applied in the downtown core; and
WHEREAS, 
the effective prohibition of new business establishment and of existing
business expansion directly conflicts with the Downtown Revitalization and
Economic Development goals established by the City Council; and
WHEREAS, in the interest of immediately removing the barrier that downtown
parking regulations have on new and expanded economic development opportunities in the
City, and in the interest of studying and contemplating alternative permanent
solutions

WHEREAS,  RCW 36.70A.390 and RCW 35A.63.220 authorize the City Council to adopt
interim controls with an effective period of up to 6 months without first
holding a public
hearing, so long as a public hearing is held no more than 60 calendar days after the adoption
of the interim controls; and
 
WHEREAS, 
the interim official control that is the subject matter of this Ordinance is
eligible for, and not exempt from, the establishment of interim controls
pursuant to RCW 36.70A.390 and RCW 35A.63.220; and
WHEREAS, 
the City Council intends the recitals in this Ordinance to be considered
findings of fact in support of the immediate adoption of the described interim
controls consistent with the Effective Date set forth in this Ordinance; and
WHEREAS,  the City Council intends that any additional or amended findings made
during the meeting at which the proposed interim controls ordinance was heard
be incorporated as findings of fact in support of their immediate adoption,
and;
WHEREAS, 
it is anticipated that additional or amended findings of fact may be made and
incorporated after the public hearing on these interim controls occurs, and;
WHEREAS, at a future date, the City Council may extend these interim controls
for one additional term of 6 months 
(up to a total of one year) provided staff has developed a work plan or
submitted related studies supporting the longer period; and
WHEREAS, at the time of the enactment of these interim controls, there are no
known pending or contemplated applications or activities that would prohibit Council from
taking this action;
NOW, THEREFORE, the City Council of the City of Orting, Washington, do ordain

TITLE 13 DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS CHAPTER 5 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS
 
13-5-3: LOADING AREA AND OFF STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS
A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to regulate parking and loading in
order to lessen traffic congestion and contribute to public safety by providing
sufficient on-site and off-site areas for the maneuvering and parking of motor
vehicles. This section also intends to recognize the barriers that expansive
off-street parking requirements pose to business growth and new business
establishment in Orting. Orting’s multimodal connectivity throughout the
downtown, its availability of on street and public parking, and its goal to
incite economic prosperity
and revitalization in the MUTC are intended to be key components in the assessment of needed off-
 street parking in Orting’s downtown.
B.   Required Automobile Parking Spaces: Off street parking spaces shall be
provided as an
accessory use in accordance with the requirements of this section at the time any building or
structure is erected, enlarged, or expanded.
C.   Size And Access: Each off street parking space shall have an area of not
less than one hundred sixty 
(160) square feet, exclusive of access drives or aisles and a width of not less than
eight feet (8'). There shall be adequate provision for ingress and egress from
each parking space.
D.   Location: Off street parking facilities shall be located as hereinafter
specified; where a distance is specified, such distance shall be the walking
distance measured from the nearest
point of the parking facilities to the nearest point of the building that such facility is required to
serve. Parking is required to be on the subject parcel unless the City approves
a proposal utilizing the off-site parking provisions of OMC 13-5-3L and/or the
shared parking provisions of OMC 13-5-3M.
1.   For a single-family dwelling or multi-
family dwelling, the parking facilities shall be located on the same lot or
building site as the building they are required to serve.
2.   For churches, hospitals, large group homes, institutions, rooming
and lodging houses,
nursing and convalescent homes, community clubs, and clubrooms, parking facilities shall be
located not farther than one hundred fifty feet (150') from the facility.
3.   For uses other than those specified, including governmental facilities, parking facilities
shall be located not farther than three hundred feet (300') from the facility.
4.   ADA accessible parking shall be located on the shortest possible route to the entrance of
the building or facility.
E.   Unit Of Measurement: In stadiums, sports arenas, churches, government
buildings
containing public assembly space and other places of assembly in which patrons or spectators
 
occupy benches, pews, or other similar seating facilities, each eighteen inches 
(18") of width or eighty 
(80) square feet of open area of such seating facilities should be counted as one seat for
the purpose of determining requirements of off street parking facilities under
this title.
F.   Expansions Or Enlargements: Where any structure is enlarged or expanded,
off street parking spaces shall be provided for said expansion or enlargement
in accordance with the
requirements of subsection I of this section. Nothing in this title shall be construed to require
off street parking spaces for the portion of said building or structure
existing at the effective date of this title. A change in use in an existing
structure shall require additional off street parking spaces as set forth in
subsection I of this section.
G.   Mixed Occupancies: In the case of two (2) or more uses in the same
building, including governmental office space and public assembly space, the
total requirements for off street parking facilities shall be the sum of the
requirements for the several uses computed
separately. Off street parking facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing required
parking facilities for any other use, except as hereafter specified in
subsection I of this section for joint use.
H.   Uses Not Specified:
 In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in subsection I of this
section, the requirements for off street parking facilities shall be determined
by the Administrator. Such determination shall be based upon the requirements
for the most comparable use specified in subsection I of this section and/or
through a parking study as required by the Administrator or their designee.
I.   Parking Spaces Required for Particular Uses:
1.   In the MUTC zone, the uses listed in this subsection are required to
provide only 50% of the number of off-
street parking spaces required by the table in OMC 13-5- 3(I)(3): Banks,
savings and loan associations, business or professional offices; bowling
alleys; establishments for the sale and consumption on the premises of food and
beverages; medical and dental clinics; retail stores; theaters; museums; and,
libraries.
2.   Parking reductions authorized by this subsection do not apply to required
ADA accessible parking; all uses in all zones shall provide ADA accessible parking stalls in a
manner compliant with the Americans Disabilities Act and its
implementing regulations.

writing with the city clerk, or designee, or the office of the city

of appeal and request for hearing is filed with the city in accordance with
subsection B of this section. Extensions may be granted by the hearing examiner
for good cause shown or when there is mutual agreement of the parties. The
failure to schedule or commence a hearing within the above stated time period
shall not be grounds for granting the relief requested by the appellant.
   D.   Type Of Hearing: An appeal of a notice of violation shall be considered
a type A adjudicative contested hearing. An appeal of a civil regulatory order
or a final determination of noncompliance or an enforcement decision of a code
enforcement officer shall be considered a type B hearing. The fact that a civil
regulatory order and a notice of violation have been combined shall not alter
the type of hearing or procedures that apply; provided however that, the
hearing examiner shall have broad discretion to establish additional procedures
that will enable the fair, efficient and orderly conduct of the two (2) hearing
types.
      1.   Type A Hearing; Procedure: A type A hearing is a hearing to contest
the existence and/or responsibility for the violation or violations that are
subject to the appeal.
The hearing examiner shall conduct an adjudicative hearing on the appeal
pursuant to the rules of procedure of the hearing examiner. The city and the
appellant shall be the parties in the hearing and each party may call witnesses
and may be represented by legal counsel. The city shall have the burden of
proof to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that violation or
violations that are the subject of the appeal has or have occurred and that the
appellant is the person responsible for compliance.
      2.   Type B Hearing; Procedure: A type B hearing is a hearing to
determine whether or not the civil regulatory order or a final determination of
noncompliance or enforcement decision was issued in error based upon one or
more of the following:
         a.   Issued in excess of the authority or jurisdiction of the city or
code enforcement officer; or
         b.   Made upon unlawful procedure; or
         c.   Affected by material error of law or fact; or
         d.   Clearly erroneous in view of the entire record as submitted; or
         e.   Order or determination was arbitrary or capricious.
The city and the appellant shall be the parties in the hearing and each party
may call witnesses and may be represented by legal counsel. The appellant shall
have the burden of proof to demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence the
claimed errors of law and/or errors of fact. The hearing examiner shall give
substantial weight to any discretionary decision, or any construction of this
code, rendered by the code enforcement officer or department director pursuant
to this chapter/title.
   E.   Stay Of Action Pending Appeal: An appellant may request the hearing
examiner to stay or suspend an action by the city to implement the decision
under review pending the outcome of the administrative appeal. The request must
set forth a statement of grounds for the stay and the factual basis for the
request. The hearing examiner may grant a stay only if the hearing examiner
finds that:
      1.   The party requesting the stay is likely to prevail on the merits;
      2.   Without the stay the party requesting it will suffer irreparable
harm;
      3.   The grant of a stay will not substantially harm other parties to the
proceedings; and
      4.   The request for the stay is timely in light of the circumstances of
the case.
The hearing examiner may grant the request for a stay upon such terms and
conditions, including the filing of security, as are necessary to prevent harm
to other parties by the stay.
   F.   Decision Of The Hearing Examiner:
      1.   Determination; Type A: The hearing examiner shall determine whether
the city has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the violation
or violations subject to the appeal has or have occurred and shall affirm or
vacate the city's decision regarding such violation or violations. If the
hearing examiner affirms the decision of the city, the hearing examiner shall
impose the penalties as set forth in the notice of violation, or such other
penalties as the hearing examiner determines are reasonable and just and in
conformance with this chapter.
      2.   Determination; Type B: The hearing examiner shall determine whether
the appellant has established by a preponderance of the evidence that the city
committed one or more errors under subsections D2a through D2e of this section.
The examiner may: a) affirm the decision of the code enforcement officer, b)
remand the matter back to the code enforcement officer for further action
consistent with the decision of the hearing examiner, c) reverse the order or
determination if the substantial rights of the appellant may have been
prejudiced because the order or determination was in violation of one or more
factors set forth in subsections D2a through D2e of this section, or d) modify
the order or decision to the extent necessary to correct the error.
      3.   Need For Corrective Action: The determination of the applicable code
enforcement officer and/or department director as to the need for the required
corrective action shall be accorded substantial weight by the hearing examiner
in determining the reasonableness of the required corrective action.
      4.   Issue Order: The hearing examiner shall issue an order to the
parties which contains the following information:
         a.   The decision regarding the matter being appealed including
findings of fact and conclusions based thereon in support of the decision; and/
or
         b.   The required corrective action; and/or
         c.   The date and time by which the correction must be completed; and/
or
         d.   The monetary penalties assessed.
      5.   Notice Of Decision: The hearing examiner shall mail a copy of the
decision to the appellant and the applicable city official within ten (10)
working days of the hearing.
   G.   Failure To Appear: If the appellant fails to appear at the scheduled
hearing, the examiner shall enter an order of dismissal of the appeal.
   H.   Failure To Comply: It shall be unlawful to fail to comply with a final
nonappealable decision of the hearing examiner. For purposes of this section,
nonappealable means that all administrative and judicial appeals have been
exhausted.
   I.   Appeal:
      1.   Final Decision: Except as provided below, the decision of the
hearing examiner shall be a final decision. A party aggrieved by a decision of
the hearing examiner may appeal or seek review of the decision in accordance
with applicable law.
      2.   City Council Review: The decision of the hearing examiner upon an
appeal of a notice of civil violation issued for a violation of title 11,
chapter 6 of this code, or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant to title 11,
chapter 6 of this code, or any project permit or approval issued or granted
pursuant to title 11, chapter 6 of this code, may be appealed to the city
council. The notice of appeal and hearing on appeal shall be governed by the
procedures set forth herein for a type B appeal. The city council shall be the
hearing body and shall determine whether or not the appellant has established
by a preponderance of the evidence that the decision of the hearing examiner
was issued in error based upon one or more factors under subsections D2a
through D2e of this section. The city council may: a) affirm the decision of
the hearing examiner, b) remand the matter back to the hearing examiner or code
enforcement officer for further action consistent with the decision of the city
council, c) reverse the order or determination of the hearing examiner if the
substantial rights of the appellant may have been prejudiced because the order
or determination was in violation of one or more factors set forth in
subsections D2a through D2e of this section, or d) modify the order or decision
of the hearing examiner to the extent necessary to correct the error.
   J.   Subsequent Repeat Violation; Failure To Abate; Misdemeanor: The
commission of a subsequent violation or the failure or refusal to abate a
violation pursuant to an order of the hearing examiner after receipt of written
notice of such order shall constitute a misdemeanor. The city attorney, or his
or her designee, shall, at his or her discretion, have authority to file a
subsequent violation as either a civil violation pursuant to this chapter, or a
civil infraction or a misdemeanor. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)
1-12-4: ADDITIONAL ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES:
The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive and may be used in addition to
other enforcement provisions authorized by this code or by law. (Ord. 912, 9-

CHAPTER 13
CODE ENFORCEMENT
SECTION:
1-13-1: General
1-13-2: Definitions
1-13-3: Methods Of Service
1-13-4: Voluntary Correction
1-13-5: Voluntary Correction Agreement
1-13-6: Civil Violations
1-13-7: Civil Regulatory Order
1-13-8: Additional Violations
1-13-9: Corporate And Personal Liability
1-13-1: GENERAL:
   A.   Purpose; Application: The purpose of this chapter is to establish an
efficient and consistent civil administrative system of enforcing city
regulations, violations of the development code, and violations of the public
health and safety code (title 5 of this code) that will enable violations to be
promptly resolved wherever possible, while providing both appropriate penalties
and a full opportunity for alleged violators to have a hearing to contest the
violations. The procedures and remedies provided herein shall apply to all
violations of the development code, the public health and safety code (title 5
of this code) and city regulations and to any title, chapter, section or
provision of the code to which zoning enforcement provisions of this code are
made applicable.
   B.   Liability; Duty: While this chapter does authorize the city of Orting
and city officials, officers, employees or agents to take action to enforce
city ordinances and regulations, it shall not be construed as placing
responsibility for code compliance or as creating any duty on the part of the
city or any city official, officer, employee or agent to any particular case,
or as creating any duty on the part of the city or any city official, officer,
employee or agent to any particular person or class of persons. This chapter
shall be enforced for the health, safety and welfare of the general public, and
not for the benefit of any particular person or class of persons. Nothing
contained in this chapter is intended nor shall be construed to create or form
the basis of any liability on the part of the city, its officials, officers,
employees or agents, for any injury or damage resulting from any act or
omission on the part of the city, its officials, officers, employees or agents.
   C.   Intent: It is the intent of this chapter to place the obligation of
complying with its requirements upon the owner, occupier or other person
responsible for the condition of the land and/or structures or responsible for
actions regulated pursuant to this chapter.
   D.   Authorization: Code enforcement officers are authorized to use the
provisions and procedures of this chapter to take action to enforce those
regulations and provisions of this code, and uncodified provisions of a city
ordinance, over which such enforcement officer has been granted enforcement
authority, including issuance of correction notices, voluntary correction
agreements, civil regulatory orders, notices of violation and notices of
infraction, to enforce compliance therewith.
   E.   Statement Of Policy: It is the policy of the city of Orting to
emphasize code compliance by education and prevention as a first step. This
policy is designed to ensure code compliance and timely action that is
available to all persons and uniform in its implementation. While warnings
through a notice of correction and voluntary compliance are desirable as a
first step, enforcement and monetary penalties should be used for remedial
purposes as needed to assure and effect code compliance. Abatement, correction,
remediation or mitigation should be pursued when appropriate and feasible, but
is not a precondition to issuance of a notice of civil violation or notice of
infraction or taking action to seek imposition of criminal penalties. Uniform
and efficient procedures, with consistent application tailored by regulation,
should be used to accomplish this policy.
   F.   Joint And Several Responsibility And Liability: Responsibility for
violations subject to enforcement under this chapter is joint and several, and
the city is not prohibited from taking action against a party where other
persons may also be potentially responsible for a violation, nor is the city
required to take action against all persons potentially responsible for
compliance.
   G.   Presumption: Proof that a violation of a regulation, the development
code or the health and safety code (title 5 of this code) exists on privately
owned (nongovernmental) property shall constitute prima facie evidence that the
owner of the property is a person responsible for compliance. However, this
shall not relieve or prevent enforcement against any other person who may also
be responsible for compliance. Proof that a violation of a regulation occurred
on property subject to a project permit shall constitute prima facie evidence
that the applicant for the project permit is a person responsible for
compliance. However, this shall not relieve or prevent enforcement against any
other person who may also be a person responsible for compliance.
   H.   Prohibited Acts Include Causing And Permitting: Whenever in this code
or the noncodified ordinances of the city, or any rule or regulation issued
pursuant thereto, any act or omission constitutes a civil violation, such act
or omission includes causing, allowing, permitting, aiding, abetting, suffering
or concealing the fact of such act or omission.
   I.   Separate Offense: Every act or omission which constitutes a civil
violation under this code or the noncodified ordinances of the city, or any
rule or regulation issued pursuant thereto, shall constitute a separate civil
violation for each and every day during any portion of which the act or
omission constituting the violation is committed, continued or permitted.
   J.   Nonexclusive: The provisions of this chapter are not exclusive and may
be used in addition to other enforcement provisions authorized by this code,
state or federal law, including, but not limited to, civil infraction
proceedings and penalties, criminal proceedings or sanctions, nuisance and
injunction actions, unfit dwelling proceedings, or other civil or equitable
actions to abate, discontinue, correct, or discourage unlawful acts in
violation of this chapter. The choice of enforcement action to be taken and the
severity of any penalty to be imposed shall be guided by the nature of the
violation, the damage or risk to the public or to public resources, and/or the
existence or degree of bad faith of the person or persons subject to the
enforcement action.
   K.   Conflicts: Except as provided in section
1-13-2, "Definitions", of this chapter, in the event of a conflict between this
chapter and any other provision of this code or other city ordinance providing
for a civil violation or civil infraction, this chapter shall control to the
extent of the conflict. In the event of a conflict between this chapter and any
mandatory provision of state or federal law, the provision of the state or
federal law shall control to the extent of the conflict. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)

person responsible for compliance is served with a written correction notice,
he or she shall be given at least ten (10) days from the date of issuance of
the notice to correct the violation(s); provided, where, the code enforcement
officer determines that a violation creates a risk of imminent harm to public
health or safety, or is a "repeat violation" as defined in this chapter, the

   F.   Extension Of Voluntary Correction Period Or Modification Of Required
Actions: An extension of the deadline for voluntary correction, or a
modification of any required corrective action noted in the written correction
notice, may be granted by the code enforcement officer if the person
responsible for compliance has, in the opinion of the code enforcement officer,
shown due diligence or made substantial progress in correcting the violations
but unforeseen circumstances, or other circumstances over which the person
responsible for compliance has no control, render correction unattainable
within the original deadline.
   G.   Revocation Of Deadline For Compliance: The original deadline for
compliance, or any extension for compliance previously granted by the code
enforcement officer, may be revoked and immediate compliance required where, in
the opinion of the code enforcement officer, circumstances make immediate

property. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)
1-13-5: VOLUNTARY CORRECTION AGREEMENT:
   A.   Voluntary Correction Agreement; General: At the sole discretion of the

has made a final determination that the signatory has failed to comply with the
terms and conditions of a voluntary correction agreement, and no appeal has
been timely filed pursuant to subsection E of this section, the city may issue
a notice of civil violation and impose monetary penalties for the underlying
violation or violations which are the subject of the voluntary correction
agreement. The filing of an appeal of the determination of noncompliance shall
not preclude the city from pursuing any other remedies available under this
chapter or at law or in equity, including issuing a notice of violation or
infraction for each continuing violation.
      3.   Abatement By The City: In addition to any other remedy provided for
in this chapter, the city may abate the violation in accordance with the

service by posting is ineffective or cannot be lawfully accomplished, service
shall be accomplished by publication.
   D.   Effect Of Notice Of Civil Violation: A notice of civil violation issued
pursuant to this section represents a determination that the violation/
violations identified in the notice of civil violation has/have been committed.
This determination is final and conclusive as to the violation or violations
set forth in the notice of violation, unless a timely appeal is filed as
provided in subsection K of this section. If a timely appeal is not filed, such
determination shall be also be final and conclusive for any subsequent notice
of violation issued for the same continuing violation or violations; provided
that, such determination shall not preclude an appeal of the determination that

criminal penalties related to the same or continuing violation or violations,

   E.   Continued Duty To Correct: Payment of a monetary penalty imposed
pursuant to this chapter does not relieve a person of the duty to correct the
violation as ordered by the code enforcement officer.
   F.   Monetary Penalty: Unless a different monetary penalty is specified in
this code or state law for a particular violation, the monetary penalty for
each violation per day or portion thereof, and each continuing day or portion

days, five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day;
      6.   For each repeat violation, five hundred dollars ($500.00) per day.
   G.   Mitigation Of Monetary Penalty: In the event that the person who is the
subject of the notice of violation enters into a voluntary compliance
agreement, upon approval by the city administrator, the code enforcement
officer may suspend, reduce or waive the monetary penalties imposed pursuant to
the notice of civil violation upon a showing of hardship, substantial
completion of the necessary correction, unforeseeable circumstances beyond the
control of the person responsible for compliance which render completion
impossible by the date established as a good cause, or other factors or
considerations establishing a basis for mitigation of the monetary penalty.
   H.   Other Action: In addition to the issuance of the notice of civil
violation, the city may take other enforcement action available at law or in
equity including, by way of example and not limitation, issuance of a notice of
civil infraction, seeking injunctive or declaratory relief, taking action to
seek imposition of criminal penalties, and rescission as set forth in Revised
Code Of Washington 90.58.140. The city may also combine a notice of civil
violation with a civil regulatory order.
   I.   Collection Of Monetary Penalty: The monetary penalty constitutes a
personal obligation of the person to whom the notice of civil violation is
directed. Any monetary penalty assessed shall be immediately due and payable
and must be paid to the city within ten (10) calendar days from the date of
service of the notice of violation. The city attorney is authorized to take
appropriate action to collect the monetary penalty. The city administrator may
issue a civil regulatory order stopping work until such penalty is paid.
   J.   Application For Remission Or Mitigation: Any person incurring a
monetary penalty for a civil violation may, within ten (10) days of service of
the notice of violation, apply in writing to the city administrator for
remission or mitigation of the monetary penalty. The city administrator shall
issue a decision on the application within fifteen (15) business days. Upon
receipt of a complete application for remission or mitigation, the city
administrator, or his/her designee, shall consider the application, together
with any information the city administrator, or his/her designee, determines is
relevant, and may remit or mitigate the penalty only upon a finding by a
preponderance of the evidence that applicant has demonstrated extraordinary
circumstances, such as the presence of information or factors not considered in
setting the original penalty. When a monetary penalty is imposed jointly by the
department of ecology and the city, the penalty may be remitted or mitigated
only upon such terms as both the department of ecology and the city agree.
   K.   Appeal: A notice of civil violation may be appealed to the hearing
examiner pursuant to the procedures set forth in chapter 12 of this title for
appeal of a notice of civil violation. In the event that a notice of civil
violation is combined with the civil regulatory order, payment of the monetary
penalty imposed shall be stayed during the pendency of any administrative
appeal. (Ord. 912, 9-14-2011)
1-13-7: CIVIL REGULATORY ORDER:
   A.   In General: A code enforcement officer may issue a civil regulatory
order when there is reasonable cause to believe that there is or has been a
violation or that failure to take action or to refrain from taking action will
result in a violation. It is the policy of the city that a civil regulatory
order may be issued, in lieu of initially seeking voluntary correction or
issuing a notice of correction, when the code enforcement officer determines,
in his or her discretion, that: 1) the nature of the violation creates a risk
of imminent harm to public health or safety, or 2) the act or omission that has
caused the violation or from which the violation arose or will arise, is
continuing or ongoing, or 3) issuance of a civil regulatory order is necessary
to prevent future or continuing violations, or 4) issuance of a civil
regulatory order is necessary to prevent imminent harm to persons or property,
or 5) issuance of a written correction notice would be ineffective or futile.
The failure of the code enforcement officer to seek voluntary correction prior
to issuance of a civil regulatory order shall not invalidate any action taken
by the code enforcement officer or the city pursuant to this chapter.
   B.   Content Of Civil Regulatory Order: The order shall set forth and
contain:
      1.   The name and address of the person responsible for compliance with
the order; and
      2.   The street address or a description sufficient for identification of
the building, structure, premises, or land upon or within which the violation
will occur, has occurred or is occurring; and

2-2-4: DUTIES AND REQUIREMENTS TO MAKE AND MAINTAIN RULES:
   A.   Generally: It shall be the duty of the commission to make and maintain
suitable rules and regulations not inconsistent with the purpose of this
chapter, for the purpose of carrying the provisions of this chapter into
effect.
   B.   Duties Enumerated; Requirements:
      1.   Rules And Regulations: The commission shall make suitable rules and
regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of Revised Code of Washington
41.12 and this chapter and necessary for this chapter's implementation as it
relates to full time employees of the Police Department. Such rules and
regulations shall provide the manner in which examinations may be held, and how
appointments, promotions, transfers, reinstatements, demotions, suspensions and
discharges shall be made where such rules and regulations are not provided in
detail within this chapter or subsequent amendments adopted by ordinance.
Further, the commission may provide for any other matter, which may be
considered desirable to carry out the purposes of this chapter. Such rules and
regulations may be changed from time to time. All rules and regulations and
amendments thereof shall be printed and copies made available to the public
upon request.
   C.   Scope And Purpose: The commission's rules shall govern the continuing
administration of the civil service system of the city and the terms and
conditions of civil service employment in the city. The purpose of such rules
is to assure that the civil service system in the city is administered in
accordance with Revised Code Of Washington chapter 41.12 and ordinances of the
city, and that all proceedings before the commission are conducted in an
orderly, fair and timely manner. The purpose of a civil service system created
pursuant to state law is to establish a system to provide for promotion on the
basis of merit, give police officers tenure, and provide for a civil service
commission to administer the system, and to investigate by public hearing,
removals, suspensions, demotions, and discharges by the appointing power to
determine whether such action was or was not made for political or religious
reasons and whether it was or was not made in good faith for cause.
The civil service system is intended to protect the honest and efficient public
employee from adverse discriminatory action, whether from political or other
improper motive, and thus to secure for the people the services of honest,
efficient and experienced public employees. At the same time it is intended
that the administrative officers shall have ample authority to correct where
possible, and to remove when necessary, dishonest or inefficient employees
without placing upon the administrators an impractical or unfair burden in the
discharge of such duties.
The objective and intent of civil service rules is to establish personnel
policies and procedures that will ensure to the people of Orting the maximum in
honest and efficient public service by attracting to and retaining in the
city's classified service the most qualified and highest motivated employees
available.
   D.   Presumption Of Validity: The civil service system implemented by this
chapter substantially accomplishes the purpose of chapter 41.12 Revised Code Of
Washington. Variation from state models are based on local conditions and are
intended to maintain the purposes of civil service systems: merit selection,
tenure, and an independent civil service commission. The commission's rules are
presumed to be valid and shall be upheld unless in direct conflict with the
purpose of chapter 41.12 Revised Code Of Washington.
   E.   Interpretation: The commission has the power and authority to interpret
its rules. (Ord. 2015-976, 12-9-2015)
2-2-5: APPLICABILITY TO POLICE DEPARTMENT:
The classified civil service and provisions of this chapter shall only include
all full time employees of the police department, excluding the chief of
police. All appointments to and promotions in classifications within the
departments shall be made solely on merit, efficiency and fitness, which shall
be ascertained by open competitive examination and impartial investigation. The
commission shall have no jurisdiction of assignments of positions or duties
within departments. No person shall be reinstated or transferred, suspended or
discharged from any such full time, monthly salaried place, position or
employment contrary to the provisions of this chapter and Revised Code Of
Washington chapter 41.12.
To further enable the appointing powers to exercise a choice in the filling of
positions, no appointment, employment, or promotion in any position in the
classified service shall be deemed complete until a period of probationary
service as specified in the collective bargaining agreement as applicable to
employees of the city police department has been completed, during which time
the appointing authority may terminate the employment of the person appointed
if, during the performance test thus offered, upon observation or consideration
of the performance of duty, the appointing power deems this person unfit or
unsatisfactory for service in the department. Whereupon the appointing power
shall again request the names of five (5) qualified applicants, who likewise
shall enter upon the duties until some person is found who is deemed fit for

   D.   It shall be unlawful for a person to engage in a business in the City
for which a business license has been revoked until such person is qualified
for, and obtains, and keeps in full force and effect, a valid business license
authorizing such person to engage in the business authorized therein.
   E.   All business licenses approved for issuance by the City Administrator
shall be and are conditioned upon compliance at all times with all ordinances,
regulations and laws of the City and the State applicable to the operation of
such business or which otherwise bears a direct relationship to the conduct of
the business licensed.
   F.   Upon issuance, unless revoked or suspended or relinquished by the
licensee, a business license shall be valid for a twelve (12) month period,
provided that licensee continues in business and pays the license fee due
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and must be renewed annually. No
business license may be issued for a period longer than twelve (12) months. No
business license may be issued for multiple years or more than one hundred
eighty (180) days in advance of the effective date of said business license.

City codes, regulations or laws, and does not permit business operation unless
the business is properly zoned and/or in compliance with all applicable laws/
rules.
   H.   Applicants for a special business license shall be required to comply
with the additional special business license requirements set forth in this
chapter. Upon issuance of a special business license, licensees shall be
subject to both the general business license requirements and the applicable
special business license requirements of this chapter. In the event of a
conflict between the general license provisions and the special business
license provisions of this chapter, the special business license provisions
shall control to the extent of the conflict.

and who does not maintain a place of business within the City, shall file a

to the Director or designee. The threshold applies to general business
licenses, not regulatory licenses or activities that require a specialized
permit. (Ord. 2018-1036, 9-26-2018)
3-2-8: LICENSEE; APPLICANT:
When a license is applied for on behalf of a person other than an individual or
sole proprietorship, the licensee shall be such person on whose behalf the
license is applied for (e.g., the corporation, limited liability company,
etc.). When a license is applied for on behalf of an individual or sole
proprietorship, the licensee shall be such individual or sole proprietor on
whose behalf for which the license is applied. When the licensee will be an
individual or sole proprietorship, the "applicant" shall be the licensee. When
the licensee is a corporation, the "applicant" shall be a principal officer
authorized by requisite board action to file a business license application on
behalf of the licensee, or a representative of licensee if the application is
accompanied by a power of attorney designating the representative as attorney
in fact for the applicant with full power and authority to complete and submit
the application on behalf of the licensee. When the licensee is a limited
liability company, "applicant" shall include the members, or if the certificate
of formation vests management of the limited liability company in a manager or
managers, the term "applicant" shall include such manager or managers. When the
licensee is a partnership, the "applicant" shall include principal partners.
Applicant shall provide, at a minimum, the business name, business address, and
telephone number of the proposed business, a listing and explanation of all
services to be provided, a description of any other business activity to be
conducted on the premises or adjoining premises owned and controlled by the
applicant, and the principal enterprise of the business if different from the
activity being licensed.
In addition to such other information deemed necessary by city administrator,
the application shall require the disclosure of the number of employees at each
location and state whether the owner, or owners, work in the business at each
specific location. If an applicant claims an exemption or deduction under the
terms of this chapter, the application shall also include a full disclosure of
those facts pertinent to the exemption or deduction.
The city administrator, upon receipt of such application, the required
information and the required sum or sums, shall issue to each person a receipt
stating therein the date, amount paid and the kind of trade, profession or
business for which such license is required. Every business license issued
under this chapter shall recite the amount paid therefor, the date of issue,
the date of expiration, to whom it is issued, and the kind of business
licensed. The business license shall also be signed by the city administrator.
Upon filing such application with the city administrator, the person shall be
entitled to be issued and to receive a business license or special event
business license, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 939,
4-30-2014)
3-2-9: FEES:
Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, a business license fee shall be
collected from every person engaging in business in the city. Unless a flat fee
is established for a particular type of business by resolution of the city
council, the license fee shall be based on the business's number of employees
as set forth in the current fee schedule as adopted by resolution of the city
council. The fee for a special event business license shall be set by
resolution of the city council and shall be a flat fee; provided that, the
special event business license fee shall be waived for city sponsored events.
(Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-10: DETERMINATION OF EMPLOYEES:
For purposes of determining the number of employees for calculating the license
fee, the following rules shall govern:
   A.   Only those individuals working in the city shall be considered in the
total number of employees. However, the fact an individual also works outside
the city shall not exclude him or her from the total sum of employees for
purposes of this chapter.
   B.   The owner or officers of a business shall be included in the total
number of employees.
   C.   Individuals working less than twenty (20) hours per week for a business
shall be considered a fraction of an employee in such amount as their average
weekly hours worked bear to forty (40) hours.
   D.   The annual license fee shall be determined by the greatest number of
employees employed by the business between January 1 and December 31 of the
preceding year in which the license is payable. The number of employees shall
be determined by the employer's highest numerical count and most recent
employer's unemployment compensation quarterly report filed with the Washington
state employment security department.
   E.   A new business that has not yet established or reported employee
information to the state shall determine their initial license fee by the
maximum number of employees estimated to be employed during that calendar year.
   F.   Businesses doing business in the city that have no employees physically
working within the city shall pay the minimum license fee required under this
chapter.
   G.   Real estate and insurance agents or salespeople shall be considered
employees of the agency/entity from which they work, and shall not be required
to obtain a separate license, but shall be included in the calculation of total
employees if the license fee is based upon the number of employees. (Ord. 939,
4-30-2014)
3-2-11: LICENSE NONTRANSFERABLE:
A license issued pursuant to this chapter is personal and nontransferable. Any
unauthorized transfer or attempt to transfer a license shall automatically void
such license. (Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-12: LICENSE TERM AND RENEWAL:
   A.   In General: A license issued pursuant to this chapter shall be valid
for a twelve (12) month period and shall be renewed annually upon application
and payment of the annual business license fee prior to expiration of the
active business license. It is the obligation of the licensee to be aware of
the time period for renewal. No person may apply for renewal of a business
license more than sixty (60) days prior to expiration. Application for renewal
shall be submitted upon such forms and in such manner as may be established
from time to time by the city administrator. No application for renewal shall
be deemed complete unless it is accompanied by payment of the applicable fees.
License fees will not be prorated.
   B.   Nonrenewal; Expiration Of License: Failure to renew the required
business license prior to its expiration shall result in the expiration of the
license and the inability to engage in business within the city.
   C.   Renewal After Expiration: Submittal of an application for a new
business license is not required to apply for renewal of an expired business
license, provided that the business activities for which the initial license
was issued have not materially changed and applicant submits a completed
application for renewal of the expired business license within sixty (60) days
following expiration. Nothing herein is intended, or shall be construed, to
authorize a person to engage in business in the city without having in place a
valid business license as required in this chapter.
(Ord. 939, 4-30-2014; amd. Ord. 2024-1124, 3-27-2024)
3-2-13: DISPLAY:
   Every license issued under this chapter shall be displayed for inspection,
by the owner or holder thereof, on demand by any city officer. Unless so
displayed upon demand, it shall be conclusively presumed that such person has
not obtained a valid business license.
(Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-14: SEPARATE LICENSE; WHEN REQUIRED:
   A separate business license shall be obtained for each branch,
establishment, or location at which the business related activity is engaged
in, and each license shall authorize the licensee to engage only in that
business or business enterprise at that location. A separate business license
shall not be required for a business activity determined by the city
administrator to be an accessory activity to a branch, establishment or
location for which a business license is issued. A separate business license
shall not be required for the renting and/or leasing of real property in
multiple locations which shall be considered a single business encompassing all
rental or leased units in the city by a single owner or property manager. A
separate business license is not required for each location at which a mobile
vendor engages in business in the city. (Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-15: CHANGE OF LOCATION:
When the physical location of a business located in the city is moved to
another location in the city, the licensee shall return the business license to
the city administrator and a new license shall be issued for the new place of
business and shall be valid for the unexpired term. The fee for a new license
shall be set by resolution of the city council. This requirement shall not
apply to mobile vendors. (Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-16: MULTIPLE BUSINESSES:
When more than one business is operated at the same location, each business
shall be required to obtain a separate business license. (Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-17: NO LIABILITY OF CITY:
Issuance of a license pursuant to this chapter does not constitute the creation
of a duty by the city to indemnify the licensee for any wrongful acts against
the public, or to guarantee the quality of goods, services or expertise of a
licensee, or lawfulness of the business activities engaged in. The issuance of
such a license does not shift responsibility from the licensee to the city for
proper training, conduct, or equipment of the licensee or its agents, employees
or representatives, even if specific regulations require standards of training,
conduct or inspection. (Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-18: QUALIFICATIONS OF LICENSEES; PERMIT REQUIREMENTS; CONDITIONAL LICENSES:
   A.   No general or special business license shall be issued, nor shall any
license be renewed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, to:
      1.   An individual who is not eighteen (18) years of age at the time of
application;
      2.   A licensee/applicant who has had a similar license revoked or
suspended pursuant to applicable city codes or other similar code provisions of
any jurisdiction, within two (2) years prior to the license application;
      3.   A licensee/applicant whose business activities, or proposed business
activities, are unlawful under state, federal or local laws;
      4.   A licensee/applicant whose business activities, or proposed business
activities, constitute a public nuisance; or
      5.   A licensee/applicant for a special business license who does not
meet the qualifications under the business license code for issuance of such
special business license.
   B.   A licensee/applicant may be denied a license by reason of the prior
conviction for a felony, gross misdemeanor or misdemeanor, if the crime for
which he or she was convicted directly relates to the business for which the
license is sought, and the time elapsed since the conviction is less than ten
(10) years for a felony or less than five (5) years for a misdemeanor or gross
misdemeanor.
   C.   No person or business may reapply for a denied or revoked business
license merely by renaming the business. The denial or revocation of a license
applies to any business entity, regardless of its name, that is operating under
the same ownership and/or management and engages substantially in the same type
of business as that of a business that has been previously denied a license or
has had its license revoked under this chapter within two (2) years of such
application for a license.
   D.   In the event an applicant seeks a business license for a business to be
located in a building or structure for which a building permit is required,
whether as a newly constructed building or structure, or a remodeled building
or structure, the building permit process, including final inspections/issuance
of occupancy permits, shall be completed prior to issuance of a business
license.
   E.   In the event an applicant seeks a business license for a business to be
located in a building or structure for which no building permit is required,
the applicant shall be entitled to receive a "conditional" business license,
assuming that all other applicable licensing requirements of this chapter have
been met. Such conditional license shall be conditioned on the business
premises being inspected for compliance with applicable life and safety codes,
and subject to the following:
      1.   The applicant shall arrange for such inspection(s) within sixty (60)
days of commencing business at the premises by contacting the city; provided,
however, that the applicant may request from the city administrator an
extension of the sixty (60) day time period, which request may be granted upon
a good cause showing of why the inspection could not be timely completed; and
      2.   Failure of the applicant to arrange for and complete the life and
safety code compliance inspection within the sixty (60) day time period shall
cause the conditional business license to be automatically canceled. Such
cancellation shall not require compliance with the provisions for denial,
revocation or suspension of business licenses set forth in this chapter.
Thereafter, until all licensing and inspection requirements have been fully
complied with, any continued operation of the business shall constitute a
violation of this chapter. (Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-19: DENIAL, REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF LICENSE:
Any business license application submitted under the provisions of this chapter
may be denied, and any business license issued under the provisions of this
chapter may be revoked, or suspended at any time, as provided for in this
chapter. No person may engage in business or continue to engage in business for
which a business license has been denied, revoked or suspended; provided that,
this prohibition shall not apply to the extent that such suspension or
revocation has been stayed pursuant to the provisions of this chapter or lawful
order of a court of competent jurisdiction. (Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-20: GROUNDS FOR DENIAL, SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION:

include any one or more of the following:
   A.   The license or application therefor was procured or submitted by fraud
or misrepresentation of fact;
   B.   The licensee/applicant has failed to comply with any of the provisions
of this chapter or other applicable state, federal or local law, or has failed
to meet the qualifications set forth in this chapter;
   C.   The licensee/applicant, or licensee's/applicant's employees or agents,
have been convicted of a crime, or suffered civil judgment or consent decree
which bears a direct relationship to the conduct of the business licensed
pursuant to this chapter; provided that, such conviction, if for a felony is
less than ten (10) years old, and if for a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor is
less than five (5) years old;
   D.   The licensee/applicant, or licensee's/applicant's employees or agents,
have violated any law or ordinance relating to the regulation of the business
licensed issued pursuant to this chapter, or any health or safety ordinance
which bears a direct relationship to the conduct of the business licensed
pursuant to this chapter;
   E.   The licensee/applicant has caused or permitted a public nuisance to
exist;
   F.   The licensee/applicant has failed to pay a civil penalty or to comply
with any lawful notice and order of the city administrator which bears a direct
relationship to the conduct of the business licensed pursuant to this chapter;
   G.   The licensee's/applicant's continued conduct of the business will, for
any other reason, result in a danger to the public health, safety or welfare;
   H.   The licensee is delinquent in the payment of taxes to the city that are
due and owing for the licensed business, and has failed to pay, or enter into
agreement with the city for payment of, such amounts due and owing within
thirty (30) days of written notice of such delinquency; and
   I.   The licensee/applicant, or licensee's/applicant's employees or agents,
have engaged in, have permitted or have acquiesced in unlawful drug activity on
the business premises. For purposes of this section, the term "permitted" shall
mean, in addition to its ordinary meaning, that licensee/applicant has actual
or constructive knowledge of the circumstances which would foreseeably lead to
the unlawful drug activity. "Unlawful drug activity" means manufacturing,
delivering, selling, storing, or giving away any controlled substance, as
defined in the Washington uniform controlled substances act 1  or the federal
controlled substances act (21 USC section 801 et seq.), in violation of state,
federal or local law. (Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)

notice and order shall set forth the facts and grounds for the denial,

the city administrator to the city hearing examiner, provided that the appeal

than a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday following the third day. "Personal
service" shall mean handing the document to the applicant/licensee or leaving
it at the applicant's/licensee's place of business in the city with a person in
charge thereof.
(Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)

this code is designated to hear appeals by applicants or licensees aggrieved by
actions of the city administrator pertaining to any denial, suspension, or

rules and regulations for conducting such appeals. Copies of all rules and
regulations so adopted shall be filed with the city clerk, who shall make them

administrator shall have the authority to issue a temporary business license in
the event that such issuance is necessary to protect appellant's
constitutionally protected rights.
   J.   Failure of any aggrieved party to file an appeal in accordance with the

administrative hearing and adjudication of the notice and order of denial,
revocation or suspension. (Ord. 939, 4-30-2014)
3-2-23: INSPECTIONS; RIGHT OF ENTRY:

3-2-25: SPECIAL BUSINESS LICENSE REQUIREMENTS - MOBILE VENDORS:
In addition to the general business license requirements, the following
additional requirements and regulations shall apply to mobile vendors:
   A.   Purpose: The general purpose of this section is to promote the health,
safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the citizens,
businesses and visitors of Orting by limiting business activities of mobile
vendors within the city and requiring that new and existing mobile food vendors
provide the community and customers with a minimum level of cleanliness,
quality, safety and security. It is the purpose and intent of the city council
in enacting this chapter, to provide mobile food vendors with clear and concise
regulations to prevent safety, traffic and health hazards, as well as to
preserve the peace, safety and welfare of the community. It is further the
purpose of this chapter to authorize and permit mobile food vendors to use the
public rights of way to provide food vending services in conformance with the
requirements of this chapter. The city does not intend this section to
otherwise authorize or allow mobile vendors to use the public rights of way to
provide vending services other than in locations zoned for such uses or
otherwise allowed pursuant to a special events permit.
   B.   Findings:
      1.   The city council hereby finds and declares that mobile vending
activity occurring on public streets and sidewalks and private property creates
or may create the following negative impacts:
         a.   An increase in the amount of litter and an increased risk of
public health and safety violations due to lack of connections to power and
water, especially when in connection with on site food preparation;
         b.   Increased concerns over health and proper sanitation because
mobile vendors do not provide bathroom facilities for vendor operators or
customers;
         c.   Difficulty in enforcing health and other regulations applicable
to mobile vendors due to the mobile nature of the business;
         d.   Trampling down lawns when mobile vendors and their customers
trespass upon or walk across private property;
         e.   Invasion of personal privacy when mobile vendors remain parked
for long periods of time in front of a person's home or business;
         f.   Heightened intensity of use to surrounding areas;
         g.   Impediments to vehicular and pedestrian traffic on public rights
of way;
         h.   Increased risk of traffic congestion, vehicle accidents and
personal injuries when vending from mobile vendor units;
         i.   Hazards to motorists, pedestrians, and mobile vendors and their
customers when operating on public and private streets and sidewalks and public
rights of way;
         j.   Traffic hazards, including disruption of traffic flow and
distracted drivers, when other vehicles stop to make purchases from such mobile
vendors;
         k.   Impediments to the clear path of travel for pedestrians and
diminished space on sidewalks, which could force pedestrians onto streets and
create particular difficulties for residents with disabilities;
         l.   Safety hazards from street geometry, traffic circulation
patterns, and from differences between motor vehicle and mobile vendor unit
travel speeds;
         m.   A heightened degree of accident vulnerability, particularly near
intersections and driveways or on streets with higher speeds and traffic
volumes, when mobile vendors operate and conduct business on the shoulders of
streets and public rights of way;
         n.   Decreased on and off street parking availability; and
         o.   Substantial public health, safety and welfare concerns requiring
a higher level of compliance monitoring and applicant screening than for other
businesses operating in the city, thereby substantially increasing city costs.
      2.   The city council hereby also finds and declares that:
         a.   There is an increased public interest and demand for access to
mobile vendors engaged in the business of selling food;
         b.   It is in the public interest to provide a business friendly
environment and balance the unmet demands that itinerant vendors can provide
within the existing business climate against the negative impacts that
activities of mobile vendors and their customers can have upon the community;
and
         c.   These public interests can be served by providing mobile vendors
with the opportunity to conduct business on private property and within public
rights of way while protecting the public health, safety and welfare through
establishment of business license requirements and regulations.
   Based upon the foregoing findings, the city council has determined that the
adoption of reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on mobile food
vending activities are necessary in order to protect the public health, safety
and welfare.
   C.   Mobile Vendor License Required:
      1.   Prohibition: It is unlawful for a mobile vendor, not otherwise
exempt from the provisions of this chapter, to engage in vending services
within the city except as provided and authorized in this chapter. No mobile
vendor may park overnight.
      2.   Mobile Food Vending Authorized: A mobile vendor is authorized to
provide food vending services upon having first obtained, and thereafter
keeping in full force and effect, a valid mobile food vendor license issued by
the city in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
      3.   Separate License Required: A separate mobile food vendor license is
required for each mobile food vendor unit operating within the city.
      4.   Compliance With Laws: All mobile food vendor licenses approved for
issuance pursuant to this chapter shall be and are conditioned upon compliance
at all times with all ordinances and regulations of the city and the laws of
the state applicable to the operation of such business or which otherwise bear
a direct relationship to the conduct of the business licensed, including, but
not limited to, compliance with the Tacoma-Pierce County health department
regulations. Issuance of a business license does not imply compliance with
applicable laws, ordinances or regulations.
      5.   Special License; Endorsement: A mobile food vendor license is a
special and limited license and authorizes the holder only to engage in
business in the city as a mobile food vendor. A mobile food vendor license
endorsed for the holder to operate as a mobile food vendor does not authorize
the holder to operate as a stationary food vendor.
      6.   Nuisance: Any mobile food vending unit being operated by a person
without a valid mobile food vendor license with the proper endorsement shall be
deemed a public safety hazard and public nuisance.
      7.   Incidental Sale Of Goods: A licensed mobile food vendor may engage
in exhibiting and selling goods that are incidental to the food vending
services being provided.

person other than an individual or sole proprietorship, the licensee shall be
such person on whose behalf the license is applied (e.g., the corporation,
limited liability company, etc.). Where the license is applied for on behalf of

principal officers of the corporation. Where the licensee is a limited
liability company, "applicant" shall include all of the members, or if the

managers. Where the licensee is a partnership, the "applicant" shall include
principal partners.

years old, and if for a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor, is less than five (5)
years old. In considering whether or not the conduct in question relates to the
applicant or licensee's ability to operate as a mobile vendor, the city may
consider, whether the conduct indicates that the applicant or licensee is unfit
to operate as a mobile vendor. The city will presume that any one of the
following categories of crimes that constitute a felony or misdemeanor under
Washington state law, or under the laws of the state or district in which the
crime was committed and for which a conviction is less than ten (10) years old

of the requirement for individual general and special business licenses for
vendors operating at the farmers' or public market or special event, to the
extent a business license would otherwise be required under the provisions of

commensurate with the term of the farmers' or public market or special event

limited to, compliance with the Tacoma-Pierce County health department

and effect, a valid solicitor or peddler license.
   C.   Compliance With Laws: All solicitor or peddler licenses issued pursuant
to this chapter shall be and are conditioned upon compliance at all times with
all ordinances and regulations of the city, state laws, and regulations of

conduct of the business licensed. Issuance of a business license does not imply
compliance with applicable laws, ordinances or regulations.
   D.   Limitation On Activities Permitted By Solicitors And Peddlers: Except
as otherwise authorized pursuant to this chapter, it shall be unlawful for a
solicitor or peddler within the city to:
      1.   Engage, or attempt to engage, in the business of soliciting or

apply to use of the public rights of way for travel and shall not prohibit
constitutionally protected activities;
      2.   While engaged, or attempting to engage, in the business of
soliciting or peddling, enter upon any other person's private property, home,
residence, apartment complex or business that conspicuously displays a "No

the occupant's desire not to be contacted by solicitors;
      3.   While engaged, or attempting to engage, in the business of
soliciting or peddling, persist or continue in any solicitation or attempted
solicitation, or peddling or attempted peddling, of any particular member of

further solicitation or peddling efforts discontinue;
      4.   While engaged, or attempting to engage, in the business of
soliciting or peddling, call attention to his or her business or the items to
be sold by means of blowing any horn or whistle, ringing any bell, crying out,
or by any other noise, so as to be unreasonably audible within an enclosed
structure;
      5.   While engaged, or attempting to engage, in the business of
soliciting or peddling, obstruct the free flow of traffic, either vehicular or
pedestrian, on any street, sidewalk, alleyway, or other public right of way;
      6.   While engaged, or attempting to engage, in the business of
soliciting or peddling, conduct business in a way so as to create a threat to
the health, safety, and welfare of any specific individual or the general
public;
      7.   Engage in or attempt to engage in business before eight o'clock (8:
00) A.M. or after eight o'clock (8:00) P.M.;

   C.   Records Outside City Jurisdiction: Where a taxpayer does not keep all

determined by jeopardy assessment, together with any penalty and/or interest,
and the total of such amounts shall thereupon become immediately due and

CHRONIC NUISANCE PROPERTIES
SECTION:
5-10-1: Purpose
5-10-2: Definitions
5-10-3: Violation
5-10-4: Determination Of Chronic Nuisance - Warning And Declaration
5-10-5: Correction Agreement
5-10-6: Commencement Of Action - Enforcement
5-10-7: Summary Closure
5-10-8: Retroactive Application
5-10-1: PURPOSE:
Chronic nuisance properties present significant health, safety and welfare
concerns, where the persons responsible for such properties fail to take
corrective action to abate the nuisance condition. Chronic nuisance properties
can have a tremendous negative impact upon the quality of life, safety and
health of the neighborhoods where they are located. Chronic nuisance properties
can also be a financial burden to the City due to repeated calls for service
necessitated by nuisance activities that repeatedly occur or exist on such
properties.
Accordingly, this chapter is enacted to:
   A.   Provide a remedy for nuisance activities that are particularly
disruptive to quality of life and repeatedly occur or exist at properties.
   B.   Provide a means by which the City may prevent and abate chronic
nuisances, declare what shall be a chronic nuisance, and abate the same, and to
impose fines upon parties who permit, create, continue, or suffer nuisances to
exist.
   C.   Exercise the specific power granted to the City by the State to provide
for the punishment of all practices dangerous to public health or safety, and
to make all regulations necessary for the preservation of public morality,
health, peace, and good order within its limits, and to provide for the arrest,
trial, and punishment of all persons charged with violating City ordinances.
   D.   Provide a practical process for ameliorating nuisance activities and
for holding accountable the persons ultimately responsible for such properties.
This remedy is not the exclusive remedy available under State or Local laws to
redress chronic nuisance properties, and may be used in conjunction with such
other laws. (Ord. 2017-1011, 3-14-2017)

5-10-4: DETERMINATION OF CHRONIC NUISANCE - WARNING AND DECLARATION:
   A.   When the Chief of Police (or their designee), or City Administrator (or
their designee), or City Code enforcement officer (or their designee), receives
specific facts and circumstances documenting the existence of a chronic
nuisance property, the Chief of Police (or their designee) or City
Administrator (or their designee), or City Code enforcement officer (or their
designee), may independently review such reports to determine whether the
property is a chronic nuisance property as defined in this chapter.
   B.   If, following the review described in subsection A of this section, the
Chief of Police (or their designee) or City Administrator (or their designee),
or City Code enforcement officer (or their designee), determines that the
property is a chronic nuisance property, the Chief of Police (or their
designee) or City Administrator (or their designee), or City Code enforcement
officer (or their designee) shall issue a warning to the person in charge of
the property, in writing, stating that the property is a chronic nuisance
property and demanding that the person in charge of the property cease and
desist from allowing nuisance activities, as defined in this chapter, to
continue.
      1.   The warning shall contain substantially the following information:
         a.   The name and address of the person to whom the letter is issued;
         b.   The location of the property by address or other description
sufficient for identification of the property;
         c.   A concise description of the documented nuisance activities upon
which the determination was based;
         d.   A warning that there is potential civil and/or criminal liability
for continuing to allow nuisance activities, as defined in this chapter, to
occur upon and/or within two hundred feet (200') of the property;
         e.   The name and telephone number of the City representative who is
responsible for handling inquiries from the person in charge of the property or
others with an interest in the property; and
         f.   A demand the owner and other persons in charge respond to City
representative within seven (7) days of service of the notice to discuss a
course of action to correct the nuisance.
      2.   The warning shall be served by means of personal service, or by
mailing a copy of the notice to the person in charge of the property at his/her
last known address, certified mail, return receipt requested, or by posting a
copy of the notice and demand conspicuously upon the property.
      3.   The warning must be served within sixty (60) days of the occurrence
of the last nuisance activity which qualified the property as a chronic
nuisance property under the definitions of this chapter.
      4.   Proof of service shall be made by a written declaration under
penalty of perjury by the person effecting the service, declaring the time and
date of service and the manner by which service was made.
      5.   When a warning is issued pursuant to this section to a person in
charge, other than an owner or an owner's agent, who has permitted a property
to become a chronic nuisance property, a copy of such warning shall also be
sent by first class mail or personally served on the owner of the property, and
a copy shall be sent by certified mail.
   C.   An owner who receives a copy of a warning pursuant to this chapter
describing a chronic nuisance property permitted by a person in charge other
than the owner or the owner's agent, shall promptly take all reasonable steps
requested in writing by the City to assist in abatement of the nuisance
property. Such reasonable steps may include the owner taking all acts and
pursuing all remedies, including pursuing eviction of the person in charge,
that are: 1) available to the owner pursuant to any lease or other agreement,
and 2) consistent with State and Local laws, including but not limited to
Revised Code of Washington 59.18.580, and the Victim Protection Limitation on
Landlord's Rental Decisions.
   D.   If the owner or person in charge or person responsible timely responds
as required by the warning issued pursuant to this chapter, and agrees to a
course of action to abate the nuisance activities, a written correction
agreement between the owner or person in charge and the City shall be executed.
If the agreed course of action does not result in the abatement of nuisance
activities to the satisfaction of the City within thirty (30) days of issuance
of the warning, or within such longer period as permitted by the Chief of
Police, City Administrator or Code enforcement officer, or their designee, in
writing the City may issue a Declaration of Chronic Nuisance Property pursuant
to this chapter.
   E.   If the City receives no response to the warning within the time
prescribed, the Chief of Police (or their designee) or City Administrator (or
their designee), or City Code enforcement officer (or their designee), shall
issue a Declaration of Chronic Nuisance Property, declaring the property to be
a chronic nuisance property, and shall post such declaration at the property
and issue the person(s) responsible a civil infraction, punishable by a maximum
penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The matter shall be referred to
the Office of the City Attorney for further action, pursuant to this chapter.
   F.   It is a defense to an action for chronic nuisance property that the
person responsible, at all material times, could not, in the exercise of
reasonable care or diligence, determine that the property had become a chronic
nuisance property, or could not, in spite of the exercise of reasonable care
and diligence, control the conduct leading to the determination that the
property is chronic nuisance property. (Ord. 2017-1011, 3-14-2017)

in charge and, if different, the owner. The agreement shall include the
following:

      2.   The street address or a description sufficient for identification of
the property, building, structure, or land upon or within which the nuisance is
occurring;

property as may be necessary to determine compliance with the correction
agreement;

nuisance and recover its costs and expenses and monetary penalties pursuant to
this chapter from the person in charge for the nuisance if the terms of the
correction agreement are not met; and
      7.   When a person in charge, other than an owner or an owner's agent,
has permitted a property to be a chronic nuisance property, an agreement by the
owner to promptly take all acts and pursue all remedies requested by the City.
(Ord. 2017-1011, 3-14-2017)
5-10-6: COMMENCEMENT OF ACTION - ENFORCEMENT:
   A.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, the City Attorney or
their designee, on behalf of the City, is authorized to take appropriate action
to enforce compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Said enforcement
action may include, but is not limited to, any of the following remedies:
      1.   Violation Citation: Issuance of a violation citation under section
1-4-1 of this Code. A violation citation issued for a violation of the
provisions of this chapter may include in its corrective action suspension or
revocation of any license issued under title 3, chapter 2 of this Code, and the
Violations Hearing Examiner is hereby granted specific authority to so order
license suspension or revocation; or
      2.   Application To Court: Application to any court of competent
jurisdiction for injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action or proceeding
to prevent continuing nuisance activities at the property and/or restraining
any person from violating any of the provisions of this chapter and compelling
compliance with the provisions herein.
      3.   Abatement Costs: All costs of abatement, including incidental
expenses, shall be billed to the person or persons to whom the violation
citation was issued and shall become due and payable thirty (30) days
thereafter. The term "incidental expenses" shall include, but not be limited
to, personnel costs, both direct and indirect, including attorney's fees
incurred by the City; costs incurred in documenting the violation; the actual
expenses and costs to the City in the preparation of notices, specifications
and contracts, and in inspecting the work; and the cost of any required
printing and mailing.
   B.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent or prohibit the
City from pursuing immediate relief from nuisance activities at a property by
any other means available by law, including but not limited to emergency relief
under subsection
5-1-7C of this title and an order of the Fire Code official under the Orting
Fire Code. Penalty and enforcement provisions provided in this chapter shall
not be deemed exclusive and the City may pursue any remedy or relief it deems
appropriate.
   C.   The failure to prosecute and/or convict an individual for the violation
(s) constituting the nuisance activities is not a defense to an action under
this chapter.
   D.   Once the matter is referred to the City Attorney, the City Attorney
shall immediately review and make a determination to initiate legal action
authorized under this chapter or State Statute, or may seek alternative forms
of abatement of the nuisance activity. The City Attorney shall obtain City
Council approval through a resolution to initiate legal action on the chronic
nuisance property and seek civil penalties and costs in Pierce County Superior
Court for the abatement of the nuisance.
   E.   In determining whether a property shall be deemed a chronic nuisance
property and subject to the court's jurisdiction, the City shall have the
initial burden of proof to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the
property is a chronic nuisance property. The City may submit official police
reports and other affidavits outlining the information that led to arrest(s),
and other chronic nuisance activity occurring or existing at the property. The
failure to prosecute an individual or the fact no one has been convicted of a
crime is not a defense to a chronic nuisance action.
   F.   Once the Superior Court determines the property to be a chronic
nuisance under this chapter, the court may impose a civil penalty against any
or all of the persons responsible for the property, and may order any other
relief deemed appropriate. A civil penalty may be assessed for up to one
hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for each day the nuisance activity continues
to occur following the date of the original warning, as described in this
chapter. In assessing the civil penalty, the court may consider the following
factors, citing to those found applicable:
      1.   The actions taken by the person responsible to mitigate or correct
the nuisance activity;
      2.   The repeated or continuous nature of the nuisance activity;
      3.   The statements of the neighbors or those affected by the nuisance
activity; and
      4.   Any other factor deemed relevant by the court.
   G.   The Superior Court which determined the property to be a chronic
nuisance property shall also assess costs against the person responsible in the
amount it costs the City to abate, or attempt to abate, the nuisance activity.
   H.   If the Superior Court determines the property to be a chronic nuisance
property, the Superior Court shall order the property closed and secured
against all unauthorized access, use and occupancy for a period up to one (1)
year, and may impose a civil penalty and costs.
   I.   Once a determination has been made by the Superior Court that the
chronic nuisance property shall be subject to closure the court may authorize
the City to physically secure the premises and initiate such closure. Costs for
such closure shall be submitted to the court for review. Any civil penalty and/
or costs awarded to the City may be filed with the City Treasurer who shall
cause the same to be filed as a lien on the property with the County Treasurer.
The City shall file a formal lis pendens notice when an action for abatement is
filed in the Superior Court.
   J.   The Superior Court shall retain jurisdiction during any period of
closure or abatement of the property. (Ord. 2017-1011, 3-14-2017)
5-10-7: SUMMARY CLOSURE:
Nothing in this chapter prohibits the City from taking any emergency action for
the summary closure of such property when it is necessary to avoid an immediate
threat to public welfare and safety. The City may take summary action to close
the property without complying with the notification provisions of section
5-10-4 of this chapter, but shall provide such notice as is reasonable under
the circumstances. (Ord. 2017-1011, 3-14-2017)
5-10-8: RETROACTIVE APPLICATION:
Actions performed prior to the effective date of this chapter may render a
person liable under this chapter if those actions contribute or have
contributed to the maintenance of a chronic nuisance property. (Ord. 2017-1011,

this chapter, to establish a Foreclosure Property Registration Program in order

process, and to identify, regulate, limit, and reduce the number of those
properties within the City of Orting. It is the policy and intent of the City
to establish a requirement that the lender or other responsible party(ies) of
properties that are in the foreclosure process register those properties with
the City, as set forth in this chapter, in order to protect the neighborhoods
from the negative impacts of absentee ownership and lack of adequate
maintenance and security for properties in the foreclosure process. (Ord. 2018-
1034, 9-26-2018)
5-11-2: DEFINITIONS:
As used in this chapter, the following terms have the meanings indicated unless
the context clearly indicates otherwise:
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OR CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS: Refers to the City's Code
Enforcement Officer (defined at section
1-13-2 of this Code) or his or her designee, the City Administrator or his or
her designee, or the building official or his or her designee.
EVIDENCE OF FORECLOSURE STATUS: Means any condition that on its own or combined
with other conditions present would lead a reasonable person to believe that
the property is a foreclosure property. Such conditions include, but are not
limited to, overgrown and/or dead vegetation; accumulation of newspapers,
circulars, flyers and/or mail; past due utility notices and/or disconnected
utilities; accumulation of trash, junk, and/or debris; statements by neighbors,
passersby, delivery agents, or government employees that the property is in
foreclosure; the presence of boards over doors, windows or other openings in
violation of applicable Building Code; and for residential properties, the
absence of window coverings such as curtains, blinds, and/or shutters; the
absence of furnishings and/or personal items consistent with residential
habitation.
FORECLOSURE: Means the legal processes described in title 61, Revised Code of
Washington, in which a mortgagee or other lien holder terminates a property
owner's equitable right of redemption to obtain legal and equitable title to
the real property pledged as security for a debt or the real property subject
to the lien. For purposes of this section, the foreclosure process is not
concluded until the property obtained by the mortgagee, lien holder, or their
designee, by certificate of title or other means, is sold to a non-related,
bona fide purchaser in an arms'-length transaction to satisfy the debt or lien.
FORECLOSURE PROPERTY: Means a property that is: a) under a current notice of
default and/or notice of trustee's sale; b) the subject of a pending Tax
Assessor's lien sale; c) the subject of a foreclosure sale where the title was
retained by the beneficiary of a deed of trust involved in the foreclosure; d)
a property title to which has been transferred under a deed in lieu of
foreclosure/sale; or e) subject to a contract forfeiture. Property acquired by
a government agency at a tax foreclosure sale under chapter 84.64 Revised Code
of Washington is not "foreclosure property" within the meaning of this section.
For purposes of this section, a property remains a foreclosure property until
it is sold at an arms'-length transaction to a non-related bona fide purchaser
or until the foreclosure action has been dismissed and any default has been
cured.
LENDER: Means any person who makes, extends, holds, or services a real estate
loan agreement and includes, but is not limited to, mortgagees; beneficiaries
under deeds of trust; underwriters under deeds of trust; vendors under
conditional land sales contracts; trustees and a successor in interest to any
mortgagee, beneficiary, vendor or trustee and any other lien holder on the
property. The term also includes any mortgagee, beneficiary or trustee that
accepts a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
OWNER: Means any individual or group of natural persons, partnership,
association, corporation or other entity having legal or beneficial title in
real property including any borrower.
PROPERTY: Means any unimproved or improved, residential or commercial real
property, or portion thereof, situated in the City, and includes the buildings
or structures located on the property regardless of condition.
RESPONSIBLE PARTY: Means any person, partnership, association, corporation, or
fiduciary having legal or equitable title to or any interest in any real
property, including but not limited to an owner, and lender, as defined in this
chapter, as well as individual property manager, property management company,
or similar person or entity, responsible for and having the authority to make
decisions and required expenditures concerning, the maintenance and security of
a foreclosure property and the abatement of nuisance conditions at the
property.
VACANT: Means a subject property that is not legally occupied. (Ord. 2018-1034,

5-11-3: REGISTRY ESTABLISHED; PROCEDURES:
The City shall establish and maintain a Foreclosure Property Registry to
implement the terms of this chapter. The registry shall be maintained by the
Building Department, in conjunction with the Code Enforcement Department, who
shall develop procedures to implement this section which are consistent with
and do not conflict with this chapter, this Code, or Washington law.
   A.   Registration Of Foreclosure Properties:
      1.   Inspection Required: Any lender who holds a security interest on a
property located within the City of Orting which is under a current notice of
default, is under a current notice of trustee's sale, is the subject of a
pending Tax Assessor's lien sale, has been the subject of a foreclosure where
the title was retained by the beneficiary of the deed of trust involved in the
foreclosure, or was transferred under a deed in lieu of foreclosure/sale must
perform an inspection of the property to determine whether the property is
vacant within fourteen (14) days of the notice of default or other applicable
proceedings to begin the foreclosure process. The Enforcement Officer can also
inspect the property and trigger the registration process. If the property is
found to be vacant or shows evidence of vacancy, it is deemed abandoned and
shall be registered with the City in accordance with this chapter.
      2.   Registration Required: Any lender(s) or other responsible party(ies)
of a foreclosure property as defined in this chapter shall register that
property with the City of Orting within ten (10) days of the property becoming
a foreclosure property within the meaning of this chapter by submitting an
application pursuant to this chapter. All registrations are valid for one year.
Once registered, the lender(s) or other responsible party(ies) shall renew the
registration of the foreclosure property with the City every twelve (12)
months, until the property is no longer a foreclosure property within the
meaning of this chapter. A separate registration is required for each property.
      3.   Application For Registry: The content of the registration
application shall include:
         a.   Proof of ownership, or financial interest, such as a lien or
loan;
         b.   The name, address, phone number, and email address for the owner,
lender, and responsible party and twenty four (24) hour contact phone number of
the respective entity; and
         c.   Documentation which adequately demonstrates the property is
foreclosed, pending foreclosure, or subject to foreclosure, trustee's sale, Tax
Assessor's lien sale or other legal proceedings. The adequacy of the
documentation provided shall be at the City's discretion.
      4.   Notice Of Change: The lender, owner, or responsible party shall
notify the City within ten (10) days of the date of any change in the
information contained in the registration. Lenders, owners, or responsible
parties who have existing foreclosure properties upon enactment of this chapter
shall have thirty (30) calendar days from the effective date to register the
property with City. A separate registration is required for each property.
      5.   Registration Fee: Upon application for the registry, the lender,
owner, or responsible party shall remit an initial registration fee to the
City, the amount of which shall be set by resolution of the City Council.
   B.   Removal From Registry: A property may only be removed from the
foreclosure property registry upon the lender's, owner's, or responsible
party's written certification that: 1) the mortgage or lien on the property has
been satisfied or legally discharged, 2) the property is no longer in mortgage
default, or 3) the foreclosure property has been sold to a non-related party in
a bona-fide, arms' length transaction. The following shall not be a valid basis
for removal from the registry: a lender's statement that it no longer desires
to pursue foreclosure; evidence of dismissal of lis pendens and/or summary of
final judgment and/or certificate of title, or similar documentation, such as
deed in lieu of foreclosure.
   C.   Transfer Of Ownership: If the mortgage on a registered foreclosure
property is transferred, the transferee shall be subject to the requirements of
this section and shall, within five (5) days of the transfer of the mortgage,
register the property as a new registration in accordance with this section.
Any previously unpaid registration fees are the responsibility of the
transferee and are due and payable upon the new registration.
   D.   Sale Of Foreclosure Property: If the mortgagee sells a foreclosure
property in an arms'-length transaction to a non- related person or entity, the
transferee is subject to the terms of this section and shall register the
property as a new registration under this section within five (5) days of the
sale. Any previously unpaid registration fees shall be the responsibility of
the new owner. For purposes of this chapter, a transfer to another entity which
is under common ownership with the lender, as determined in the sole discretion
of the City, is not an arms' length transaction. (Ord. 2018-1034, 9-26-2018)
5-11-4: MAINTENANCE AND MONITORING OF REGISTERED PROPERTIES:
   A.   Minimum Property Inspection And Maintenance Requirements: While a
foreclosure property is registered, the lender or responsible party shall be
required to inspect the foreclosure property monthly, or more frequently as
necessary to prevent the creation of a nuisance, and shall:
      1.   Maintain and keep foreclosure property free of conditions including,
but not limited to: weeds, dry brush, dead vegetation, trash, junk, debris,
building materials and junk vehicles, accumulation of newspapers, circulars,
flyers, notices (except those required by Federal, State, or local law), and
discarded personal items including, but not limited to, furniture, clothing, or
large and small appliances;
      2.   Graffiti, tagging, or similar markings shall be removed or painted
over with an exterior grade paint that matches and/or coordinates with the
color of the exterior of the structure;
      3.   Secure ponds, pools and hot tubs and ensure that they do not become
a public nuisance;
      4.   Secure the foreclosure property to prevent access by unauthorized
persons, including, but not limited to, the following: the closure and locking
of windows, doors (walk- through, sliding and garage), gates, and any other
opening of such size that it may allow a child or any other person to access
the interior of the property and/or structure(s). Securing also includes
boarding as applicable. Preferred material for boarding shall be painted with
an exterior grade paint that matches and/or coordinates with the color of the
exterior of the structure, or is of a material that mimics glazed windows and
intact doors;
      5.   Post the property with no trespassing signs and current emergency
contact information for the agent; and
      6.   Take any other action necessary to prevent giving the appearance
that the property is abandoned.
   B.   City Monitoring Of Registered Properties: Upon registration, the City
will provide regular monitoring of foreclosure properties including, but not
limited to, periodic site visitation. The City's monitoring of foreclosure
properties does not relieve the lender or other responsible party from
monitoring and maintaining the property as required by this chapter. As part of
the foreclosure property registration, the owner, lender, or responsible party,
or other person having legal authority for the property shall authorize the
City to enter onto the property for monitoring purposes. (Ord. 2018-1034, 9-26-
2018)
5-11-5: PENALTY:
Any violation of this chapter shall be subject to enforcement under the
procedures set out in title 1, chapter 13 of this Code, and the person(s)
responsible for the violation(s) shall incur a civil monetary penalty of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each day of continued non-compliance. Payment of
a monetary penalty pursuant to this chapter does not relieve the person(s)
responsible for the violation of the duty to correct the violation. Enforcement
action taken by this City in accordance with this chapter may be appealed in
accordance with the procedures set out in title 1, chapters 13 and 12 of this
Code. (Ord. 2018-1034, 9-26-2018)

including any subsequent amendments thereto:
 
9A.04.100 Proof beyond a reasonable doubt
9A.04.110 Definitions (1973 Code § 9.03.010)
 
6-1A-2: REVISED CODE OF WASHINGTON CONSTRUCTION:
   A.   Adopted By Reference: In adopting the state's statutes by reference,
only those crimes and offenses within the jurisdiction of a municipality are
intended to be adopted and in those sections adopted which deal with both
felonies and misdemeanors or gross misdemeanors, only the language applicable
to misdemeanors or gross misdemeanors is to be applied (including to the extent
that an anticipatory offense would be a misdemeanor or gross misdemeanor). By
adopting state statutes, the city intends to assume jurisdiction over and
become the jurisdictional authority for the enforcement and prosecution of
misdemeanor and gross misdemeanor crimes. Whenever the word "state" shall
appear in any statute adopted by reference in this chapter, the word "city"
shall be substituted; provided, however, the term "city" shall not be
substituted for the term "state" in those circumstances that set forth
administrative or licensing duties of the state and its subdivisions. Whenever
a state statute specifically adopted in this chapter refers to another state
statute not specifically adopted in this chapter, the statute referred to shall
be given the force and effect necessary to enforce the statute specifically
adopted in this chapter. When issuing a citation, information, or complaint for
the violation of any section of the Revised Code Of Washington adopted by this
chapter, it shall be sufficient for a commissioned officer or prosecutor to
cite to and refer to the Revised Code Of Washington section number.
   B.   Misdemeanors: With the exception of the Revised Code Of Washington
sections set forth in subsection D of this section or other Revised Code Of
Washington sections that are otherwise specifically disavowed in this code, all
Revised Code Of Washington sections that constitute misdemeanors and gross
misdemeanors and the Revised Code Of Washington sections necessary for the
investigation, arrest, prosecution, sentencing, confinement, and enforcement of
misdemeanors and gross misdemeanors are hereby adopted by reference, as well as
any future changes, amendments, recodifications, additions, or deletions to
those sections, and shall be given the same force and effect as if set forth
herein in full. The fact that sections of this code adopt by reference specific
sections of the Revised Code Of Washington shall not affect this section.
Sections of the code that specifically recite that sections of the Revised Code
Of Washington are not adopted or do not apply shall control over this section.
   C.   Class C Felony Crimes: All class C felony crimes set forth in the
Revised Code Of Washington are hereby adopted by reference, as well as any
future changes, amendments, recodifications, additions, or deletions to those
sections, for the purposes of charging a gross misdemeanor for a violation of
any of the crimes set forth in Revised Code Of Washington chapter 9A.28. The
adoption of class C felonies shall be subject to the provisions of subsections
A and B of this section.
   D.   Sections Not Adopted: The following Revised Code Of Washington sections
are specifically not adopted:
      1.   Revised Code Of Washington 9A.16.110, Defending against violent
crime - reimbursement.
   E.   Severability: If any chapter, section, subsection, sentence, or
provision of this title, or its application to any person or circumstance, is
held invalid, the remainder of this title, or the application of the chapter,
section, subsection, sentence, or provision to other persons or circumstances,
is not affected, and to this end, the chapters, sections, subsections,
sentences and provisions of this title are declared to be severable.
   F.   Public Duty: The provisions of this title are intended to create a duty
to the public in general and not to create any duty to individuals or to any
particular class of individuals. These provisions are not for the protection of
any person or class of persons.
   G.   Restitution: Restitution may be imposed as part of a sentence and shall
be ordered by the court whenever a person is convicted of a crime which results
in injury to any person or damage to or loss of property, unless extraordinary
circumstances exist that make restitution inappropriate in the court's judgment
and the court sets forth such circumstances in the record. In addition,
restitution shall be ordered to pay for an injury, loss, or damage if the
defendant pleads guilty to a lesser offense or fewer offenses and agrees with
the prosecutor's recommendation that the defendant be required to pay
restitution to a victim of an offense or offenses that are not prosecuted
pursuant to a plea agreement. The court shall identify in the judgment and
sentence the victim or victims entitled to restitution and what amount is due
each victim.
      1.   Restitution shall be ordered by the court whenever a person is
convicted of any charge of hit and run, whether involving persons, property, or
attended vehicles under FWRC 8.05.010 or Revised Code Of Washington chapter
46.52. This restitution shall include:
         a.   Damages for injury, property loss and/or lost wages attributable
to leaving the scene of the accident or collision in all cases; and
         b.   Damages for injury, property loss and/or lost wages where there
is a preponderance of evidence that the convicted person was at fault in the
underlying accident or collision.
      2.   When restitution is ordered, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution due at the sentencing hearing or within one hundred eighty (180)
days. The court may continue the hearing beyond the one hundred eighty (180)
days for good cause. Restitution ordered by a court pursuant to a criminal
conviction shall be based on easily ascertainable damages for injury to or loss
of property, actual expenses incurred for treatment for injury to persons, and
lost wages resulting from injury. Restitution shall not include reimbursement
for damages for mental anguish, pain and suffering, or other intangible losses,
but may include the costs of counseling reasonably related to the offense. The
amount of restitution shall not exceed double the amount of the offender's gain
or the victim's loss from the commission of the crime.
      3.   The city or victim may enforce the court ordered restitution in the
same manner as a judgment in a civil action. This section does not limit civil
remedies or defenses available to the victim, survivors of the victim, or
defendant. Restitution collected through civil enforcement must be paid through
the registry of the court and must be distributed proportionately according to
each victim's loss when there is more than one victim.
   H.   Violation Of Probation Order: It is a misdemeanor for any person who
has been convicted of a criminal offense, and has been placed, and remains, on
probation in connection with a suspended or deferred sentence by a court, to
knowingly violate any provision of a court's probation order.
   I.   Jurisdiction: The following persons are subject to punishment:
      1.   A person who commits in the city any crime as defined by ordinance,
in whole or part;
      2.   A person who commits out of the city any act which, if committed
within it, would be theft and is afterward found in the city with any of the
stolen property;
      3.   A person who, being out of the city, counsels, causes, procures,
aids, or abets another to commit a crime in the city; or
      4.   A person who commits an act without the city which affects persons
or property within the city which, if committed within the city, would be a
crime. (Ord. 905, 3-30-2011)

6-3B-1: INTRODUCTION; INTENT:
The city of Orting finds there is a need to accommodate farming activity
commonly referred to as urban agriculture. This can include a range of
activities, such as production of food on a single-family residential lot for a
family's personal use, urban vegetable gardens on common property for community
use, or a small commercial farm activity located in areas zoned for this use.
This article is outside the scope of interlocal agreement between Pierce County
and the city of Orting, dated September 1, 2016, relating to animal control
services and animal licensing. Pierce County is not responsible for the
enforcement of this article, unless otherwise specifically stated herein.
While agricultural activity has often been considered inconsistent with smart
growth principles of accommodating density in urban areas, the two (2) do not
need to be mutually exclusive. Urban agricultural activity for personal use on
individual single-family lots, or on common property for community agricultural
use, or in the form of small commercial urban farms, can add to the urban
fabric and create a richer context for urban neighborhoods. These beneficial
uses can be accommodated without sacrificing the objectives of the state growth
management act (GMA) and designated urban areas.
Urban agricultural activities managed in a responsible way, with sensitivity to
urban density and land use compatibility issues, can benefit the individuals
participating in the activity and the community at large by providing fresh
produce, additional food choices, economic development opportunity, a more
sustainable lifestyle and urban neighborhoods with more variety and interest.
This section has been developed with the purpose of providing Orting citizens
an opportunity to participate and benefit from these activities. (Ord. 2016-
994, 8-31-2016)
6-3B-2: DEFINITIONS:
   A.   Terms Defined: As used in this article, unless the context indicates
otherwise, the following definitions shall apply:
   ADEQUATE CARE: Providing the following to animals:
      1.   Food or feed appropriate to the species for which it is intended.
Both food and water must be in sufficient quantity, quality, and form
appropriate to sustain the animals and should be in containers designed and
situated to allow the animal easy access; and
      2.   A shelter that keeps the animals in a healthful, sanitary, warm,
dry, and safe condition, and allows the animal to turn around freely, sit,
stand, and lie without restriction, and by application does not cause injury,
disfigurement, or physical impairment to the animal.
      3.   Adequate veterinary medical care.
   ANIMAL: Any nonhuman mammal, bird, reptile or amphibian including
"livestock" and "poultry" as defined herein.
   ANIMAL CONTROL AUTHORITY: The city of Orting city administrator and/or his
designees directed to enforce the animal control laws of the city.
   ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER:
      1.   Any individual employed, contracted with or appointed by the animal
control authority for the purpose of aiding in the enforcement of this article
or any other law relating to the licensure, control or seizure and impoundment
of animals;
      2.   Any state or local law enforcement officer or code enforcement
officer; or
      3.   Any other official whose duties in whole or in part include the
seizure and impoundment of any animal.
   AT LARGE: Off the premises of the owner, whether licensed, permitted or not,
and not under control of the owner or any other person to whom the animal may
be entrusted by the owner, either by leash or cord, halter, rein, rope, or by
carrier. For the purpose of this article, the animal is presumed not to have
been under control and to be at large if the person purporting to exercise
control is unable to immediately cause the animal to come under control by
restraint or giving the appropriate voice command; or when an at large animal
interferes with pedestrian or vehicular movement or causes affront or alarm to
a person or if injury, damage has been caused by the animal or trespass has
occurred.
   BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMP): The use of best management practices, such
as pasture rotation, manure management, stream and pond buffering, planting
trees, etc., to help land and animals to remain healthy. These practices help
to keep pasture grasses in better condition, prevent soil erosion and
compaction, reduce dust and keep the air cooler in hot weather. These are
benefits that also carry over to the community as a whole. Federally regulated
stormwater best management practice policies and procedures (BMPs) are in place
(title 9, chapter 5 of this code) in addition to wetlands BMPs (section
11-4-1 of this code). All activities permitted in this code, including
facilities and farms, should comply with or exceed the BMP requirements.
Regulations cover water quality, quantity and prevention of soil erosion
related to stormwater runoff and wetlands. The City reserves the right to
develop and initiate other BMPs as may be required through other regulations,
including air quality related to dust, etc.
   HARBORS, KEEPS, AND POSSESSES, OR MAINTAINS: Providing care, shelter,
protection, refuge, food, or nourishment in such manner as to influence the
behavior of the animal; or treating the animal as living at one's property.
   HIVE: A structure intended for the housing of one bee colony.
   LAWFUL FENCE: A fence structure used to keep animals in or out of an area.

to, stone, wood, vinyl, wire, or pipe. Wire fences utilizing barbed, smooth,
woven or high tension wires must be securely fastened to substantial posts set
firmly in the ground as nearly equidistant as possible but not more than twenty
four feet (24') apart. If the posts are set more than sixteen feet (16') apart,
the wires shall be supported by stays placed no more than eight feet (8') from
each other or from the posts. Lawful fences shall be strong and as well
calculated as the fence described in Revised Code of Washington 16.60.010. For
the purposes of this article, lawful fence shall apply to agricultural
enterprises over two (2) acres within the City.

the provisions of this article.

control or custody of.
   OWNER: Any person, firm, association, partnership, organization, department,
company or corporation that owns livestock.

chickens, turkeys, ducks and geese.
   PROPER ENCLOSURE: The animal(s) shall be securely confined to the owner's
property while grazing or foraging with a secure pen or structure designed to
prevent the animal(s) from escaping during fence maintenance and provide
protection from the elements for the animal. The structure must comply with all
applicable provisions of local Building and Zoning Codes.
   PROPERLY FENCED AREA: A barrier, railing, or other upright structure,
typically of wood, wire or electric netting, enclosing an area of ground to
mark a boundary, control access or prevent escape. For the purposes of this
article, properly fenced area shall apply to Residential-Urban (RU) single-
family dwellings within the City.
   STOCKING RATIO: That formula as promulgated by the natural resources
conservation service to determine the correct balance of cattle herd size and
available forage to determine animals per acre:
      Acres of pasture needed = (animals) x (average animal weight) x (.04) x
(grazing days) / (average yield per acre).
      Conversely:
         Total number of animals = (total acreage) x (average yield per acre) /
(.04) x (average animal weight) x (grazing days).
         Average yield is based on type of grass grown on pasture and the
potential weight of bales of hay produced yearly per acre.

fence, the hive(s) may be placed at least eight feet (8') above adjacent ground
level, and comply with the remaining placement requirements.
         c.   A hive(s) adjacent to public roads shall comply with placement
requirements in such a manner as to direct bee flight at least twenty feet
(20') into the air over the road surface. In lieu of this requirement, a hive
(s) shall be placed at least one hundred feet (100') from the road right(s) of
way, with the entrance(s) parallel thereto.
      3.   Hive, Apiary Management Requirements:
         a.   Hive(s) shall be registered with the department of agriculture
and comply with chapter 15.60 Revised Code Of Washington and rules adopted
thereunder; and
         b.   All hives shall consist of movable frames and combs, unless
exempted by the department of agriculture as an educational exhibit; and
         c.   Hives shall be managed for swarm prevention and gentleness; and
         d.   Hives shall be requeened at least biannually to prevent swarming.
Annual requeening is strongly recommended; and
         e.   Hives shall be requeened if bee behavior is likely to cause a
nuisance; and
         f.   A consistent source of water shall be provided at the apiary
unless it occurs naturally within three hundred (300) yards. The water may be
"sweetened" with mineral salt or chlorine to enhance its attractiveness. This
requirement is intended to discourage bee visitation at swimming pools, hose
bibs, animal watering sources, birdbaths or where people congregate; and
         g.   Apiaries shall be managed and kept in a clean and orderly manner
and appearance to prevent a nuisance; and
         h.   Warning sign. An apiary(ies) shall be identified by placing a
sign so it is visible to passersby. Sign lettering shall be a minimum of two
inches (2") in height and shall include the name, state issued identification
number, and telephone number of the owner. Signs shall be placed in a manner to
make them conspicuous to anyone approaching the apiary. In lieu of signing, a
hive may be identified by displaying the identification number and telephone
number of the owner in at least two inch (2") characters on the sides and tops
of some colonies in each apiary. The characters shall be in a color which
contrasts with the color of the hive(s), and be conspicuous to anyone
approaching the apiary. An apiary(ies) located at the owner's residence is
exempt from marking requirements.
   B.   Mason Bees Or Similar Pollinating Varieties:
      1.   Available information states, unlike garden variety honeybees, mason
bees are nonsocial creatures that nest in holes rather than in a hive with a
queen. Orchard bees work alone, but like to nest in groups when possible; there
is no cooperation concerning the nest's construction or the rearing of the
brood, and therefore, no aggression issues. Orchard bees gain their name from
the way that the females protect their eggs: They will form an egg chamber in
the deepest part of their hole and seal it with mud, repeating the process
until the hole is full of eggs. Known for being solitary hard workers, orchard
bees only live for about eight to ten (8 - 10) weeks in the spring, typically
from mid- March until the end of May or early June (the fittest season for
pollinating fruit trees and berries!). The bees will then hibernate for about
ten (10) months and later emerge with great energy for more pollination duty.
         a.   Nesting boxes shall be provided, preferably on south facing
garage, house, or garden shed walls with food being available within about
three hundred feet (300') of the nest. A "mud pie" or other small area of open
ground should be provided for female egg laying with the soil moist, but not
soupy and not directly under the nest (young emerging bees could fall in).
         b.   Area housing bee varieties other than honeybees must be a minimum
of ten feet (10') from adjacent properties and limited in size appropriate for
pollination of the owner's lot.
   C.   Nuisance: Bees shall be considered a nuisance when any of the following
occurs:
      1.   Colonies of bees are defensive or exhibit objectionable behavior, or
interfere with the normal use of property, or the enjoyment of persons, animals
or property adjacent to an apiary(ies); or
      2.   Colonies of bees swarm; or
      3.   Hives of bees do not conform to this code; or
      4.   The hive(s) becomes deceased, as defined by the department of
agriculture; or
      5.   The hive(s) becomes abandoned.
   D.   Violations: Reported or visible violations may be corrected by order of
the city within which they occur according to established procedures as
described in this article, or by the department of agriculture. The city may
request the services of the department of agriculture to investigate violations
or to determine and suggest appropriate corrective measures. Penalties may be
levied by the city according to local ordinance or procedures, or by the
department of agriculture. (Ord. 2016-989, 8-17-2016)

7-12-1:   PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to establish an automated traffic safety camera
program that will enhance roadway safety and create a safer community. The City
of Orting recognizes automated traffic safety camera enforcement of speed
limits encourages slower speeds and reduces crashes which leads to safer
streets for citizens. (Ord. 2024-1138, 11-26-2024)
7-12-2:   DEFINITIONS:
AUTOMATED TRAFFIC SAFETY CAMERA: A device that uses a sensor installed to work
in conjunction with a speed measuring device, and a camera synchronized to
automatically record one or more sequence photographs, microphotographs, or
electronic images of the front or rear of a motor vehicle at the time the
vehicle exceeds a speed limit as detected by a speed measuring device.
SCHOOL: Includes a school as defined by RCW 28A.150.010 or 28A.150.020, and
includes a private school approved under RCW 28A.195.010.
SCHOOL SPEED ZONE: Has the same meaning as described in RCW 46.61.440 (1) and
(2), and includes areas designated as "playground zones."
SCHOOL WALK ZONE: A roadway identified under RCW 28A.160.160 or roadways within
a one-mile radius of a school that students use to travel to school by foot,
bicycle, or other means of active transportation. (Ord. 2024-1138, 11-26-2024)
7-12-3:   AUTHORIZED USE:
   A.   The use of automated traffic safety cameras is subject to the following
restrictions:
      1.   Consistent with the authority granted in chapter 46.63 RCW, City law
enforcement officers have the authority to issue a notice of traffic
infraction. Trained and authorized civilian employees of law enforcement, and
public works or transportation department performing under the supervision of a
qualified traffic engineer, and as designated by the City shall also have
authority to issue notices of infraction under this chapter.
      2.   Use of automated traffic safety cameras is restricted to those
school zones that are located within the following areas:
         a.   Washington Avenue North between Leber Street NE and Williams Blvd
NE.
         b.   Whitehawk Blvd NW between Washington Avenue North and Orting
Avenue NW.
      3.   Automated traffic safety cameras may only take pictures of the
vehicle and vehicle license plate and only while an infraction is occurring.
Pictures taken by automated traffic safety cameras may not reveal the face of
the driver or of the passengers in the vehicle. Cameras will be installed to
minimize the impact of camera flash on drivers.
      4.   Each location where an automated traffic safety camera is used shall
be clearly marked by placing signs, at least thirty (30) days prior to
activation of the camera, in a manner that clearly indicates to a driver that
the driver is entering an area where violations are enforced by an automated
traffic safety camera.
      5.   Prior to placing a new camera, or relocating any existing camera,
the City Council shall prepare an analysis of the location regarding equity
considerations, including the impact of the camera placement on livability,
accessibility, economics, education and environmental health. The analysis must
also show a demonstrated need for traffic cameras based on one or more of the
following in the vicinity of the road camera:
         a.   Travel by vulnerable road users;
         b.   Evidence of vehicles speeding;
         c.   Rates of collisions;
         d.   Reports showing near collisions; and
         e.   Anticipated or actual ineffectiveness or infeasibility of other
mitigation measures.
      6.   Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all photographs,
microphotographs, and electronic images prepared under this chapter, and as
provided in RCW 46.63.220, are not open to the public and may not be used in a
court in a pending action or proceeding unless the action or proceeding relates
to a violation under this section. No photograph, microphotograph, or
electronic image may be used for any purpose other than enforcement of
violations under this section nor retained longer than necessary to enforce
this section.
      7.   Automated traffic safety cameras may not be used on an on-ramp to a
limited access facility as defined in RCW 47.52.010.
      8.   Automated traffic safety cameras may be used to enforce speed limits
on state highways that are also classified as city streets under chapter 47.24
RCW. The City shall notify the department of transportation prior to
installation of any automated traffic safety camera in such locations. (Ord.
2024-1138, 11-26-2024)
7-12-4:   NOTICE OF INFRACTION:
   A.   A notice of infraction based on evidence detected through the use of an
automated traffic safety camera shall be mailed to the registered owner of the
vehicle within fourteen (14) days of the violation, or to the renter of a
vehicle within fourteen (14) days of establishing the renter's name and address
under subsection C of this section. The notice of infraction must include with
it a certificate or facsimile thereof, based upon the inspection of
photographs, microphotographs, or electronic images produced by an automated
traffic safety camera, citing the infraction and stating the facts supporting
the notice of infraction. This certificate or facsimile is prima facie evidence
of the facts contained in it and is admissible in a proceeding charging a
violation under this chapter. The photographs, microphotographs, or electronic
images evidencing the violation must be available for inspection and admission
into evidence in a proceeding to adjudicate the liability for the infraction. A
person receiving a notice of infraction based on evidence detected by an
automated traffic safety camera may respond to the notice of infraction by
mail.
   B.   The registered owner of a vehicle is responsible for an infraction
detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera unless the
registered owner overcomes the presumption stated in this chapter, or, in the
case of a rental car business, satisfies the conditions under subsection C of
this section. If appropriate under the circumstances, a renter identified under
subsection C1 of this section is responsible for such an infraction.
   C.   If the registered owner of a vehicle responsible for a notice of
infraction detected through the use of an automated traffic safety camera is a
rental car business, the Chief of Police or his designee shall, before such a
notice of infraction is issued, provide a written notice to the rental car
business that a notice of infraction may be issued to the rental car business
if the rental car business does not, within eighteen (18) days of receiving the
written notice, provide to the City of Orting Police Department by return mail:
      1.   A statement under oath stating the name and known mailing address of
the individual driving or renting the vehicle when the infraction occurred; or
      2.   A statement under oath that the business is unable to determine who
was driving or renting the vehicle at the time of the infraction occurred
because the vehicle was stolen at the time of the infraction. A statement
provided under this subsection must be accompanied by a copy of a filed police
report regarding the vehicle theft; or
      3.   In lieu of identifying the vehicle operator, the rental car business
may pay the applicable penalty.
      Timely mailing of the above statements to the City of Orting Police
Department relieves a rental car business of any liability under this chapter
for the notice of infraction.
   D.   Notices of infraction for infractions detected through an automated
traffic safety camera shall not be issued to the registered vehicle owner of a
marked fire engine equipped with emergency lights and siren or to an ambulance
licensed by the department of health and equipped with emergency lights and
siren. (Ord. 2024-1138, 11-26-2024)
7-12-5:   PRIMA FACIE PRESUMPTION:
   A.   In a traffic infraction case involving an infraction detected through
the use of an automated traffic safety camera under this chapter, proof that
the particular vehicle described in the notice of infraction was involved in a
violation of the speed limit in a public park zone (or other location where
automated traffic safety cameras are authorized), together with proof that the
person named in the notice of infraction was at the time of the violation the
registered owner of the vehicle, shall constitute in evidence a prima facie
presumption that the registered owner of the vehicle was the person in control
of the vehicle at the point where, and for the time during which, the violation
occurred.
   B.   This presumption may be overcome only if the registered owner states
under oath, in a written statement to the court or in testimony before the
court, that the vehicle involved was, at the time, stolen or in the care,
custody, or control of some person other than the registered owner. (Ord. 2024-
1138, 11-26-2024)
7-12-6:   PROCESSING OF INFRACTIONS:
Infractions detected through the use of automated traffic safety cameras are
not part of the registered owner's driving record and shall be processed in the
same manner as parking infractions. (Ord. 2024-1138, 11-26-2024)
7-12-7:   NONEXCLUSIVE ENFORCEMENT:
Nothing in this chapter prohibits a City of Orting law enforcement officer from
issuing a notice of traffic infraction to a person in control of a vehicle at
the time a violation occurs under RCW 46.63.030(1) as now in effect or
hereinafter amended. (Ord. 2024-1138, 11-26-2024)
7-12-8:   PENALTIES:
   A.   The maximum penalty for infractions detected through the use of an
automated traffic safety camera shall be one hundred forty five dollars
($145.00). This amount may be doubled for school speed zone infractions as per
RCW 36.63.220(16).
   B.   Revenue from fines assessed under authority of this chapter shall be
used solely for:
      1.   Subject to the requirements of RCW 46.63.220, traffic safety
activities related to construction and preservation projects and maintenance
and operations purposes including, but not limited to, projects designed to
implement the complete streets approach as defined in RCW 47.04.010, changes in
physical infrastructure to reduce speeds through road design, and changes to
improve safety for active transportation users, including improvements to
access and safety for road users with mobility, sight, or other disabilities,
which activities will be informed by the department of health's environmental
health disparities map; and
      2.   The cost to administer, install, operate, and maintain the automated
traffic safety cameras, including the cost of processing infractions.
   C.   Beginning four (4) years after an automated traffic safety camera
authorized under this chapter is initially placed and in use after the
effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, twenty-five percent
(25%) of the noninterest money received for infractions issued under this
chapter in excess of the cost to administer, install, operate, and maintain the
automated traffic safety cameras, including the cost of processing infractions,
shall be deposited into the Cooper Jones active transportation safety account
created in RCW 46.68.480.
   D.   Registered owners of vehicles who receive notices of infraction under
this chapter and who are recipients of public assistance under Title 74 RCW or
participants in the Washington women, infants, and children program, upon
request to the City, shall receive reduced penalty amounts of fifty percent
(50%) of what would otherwise be assessed for a first automated traffic safety
camera violation and for subsequent automated traffic safety camera violations
issued within twenty-one (21) days of issuance of the first automated traffic
safety camera violation. The City shall provide information to registered
owners of vehicles on their eligibility and the opportunity to apply for a
reduction in penalty amounts through the mail or internet. (Ord. 2024-1138, 11-
26-2024)
7-12-9:   COMPENSATION FOR SERVICES:
   A.   The compensation paid to the vendor of the automated traffic safety
camera equipment shall be based only upon the value of the equipment and
services provided or rendered in support of the automated traffic safety camera
equipment. Compensation paid to the vendor shall not be based upon any portion
of the fines or civil penalties imposed or the revenue generated by infractions
detected through the use of the automated traffic safety cameras.
   B.   Unless otherwise included in the vendor contract, the City will perform
a performance audit of the vendor of the equipment every three (3) years to
ensure images produced from the automated traffic safety cameras are sufficient
for evidentiary purposes as described in this chapter. (Ord. 2024-1138, 11-26-
2024)
7-12-10:   ANNUAL REPORTING:
   A.   The City shall post an annual report on the City's website which
includes the number of traffic crashes that occurred at each automated traffic
safety camera location, as well as the number of notices of infraction issued
for each camera.
   B.   Beginning January 1, 2026, the annual report shall include the
percentage of revenues received from fines issued from automated traffic safety
camera infractions that were used to pay for the costs of the automated traffic
safety camera program and shall describe the uses of revenues that exceeded the
costs of operation and administration of the automated traffic safety camera
program implemented under this chapter by the City. (Ord. 2024-1138, 11-26-

replacing the same; or to place, maintain or permit any obstruction on, under,
over or across any sidewalk, which restricts or impairs the full and free use
thereof by the public unless said obstruction is expressly permitted by the
city in accord with the municipal code; or to create, cause, maintain or permit
any condition to exist which renders any sidewalk curb, parking strip or
driveway across any sidewalk unfit or unsafe for the use by the general public.
   P.   It shall be the duty of the owner or occupant of abutting property to
keep the sidewalk, curb, gutter, parking strip and any driveway access the same
in good repair at the owner’s own expense, and to remove or correct any
condition which renders any such sidewalk, curb, gutter, parking strip or

and maintained by the City or its contracted representative. The costs incurred
shall be paid by the permittee. (1973 Code § 12.16.130)
   C.   Maintenance Of Traffic: The permittee shall maintain safe crossing for
two (2) lanes of vehicle traffic at all street intersections where possible,
and safe crossing for pedestrians at intervals of not more than three hundred

   D.   Protection Of Facilities: The permittee shall support and protect all
pipes, conduits, poles, wires, or other apparatus which may be affected in any
way by the excavation work and do everything necessary to support, sustain, and
protect them under, over, along or across the work. The permittee shall secure
approval of method of support and protection from owners of the facility.

poles, wire or pipe coating or the encasement or devices or apparatus should be
damaged, the permittee shall promptly notify the owners thereof. All damaged
facilities shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them, and the
expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee. It is the intent of
this Section that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to
facilities, and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such
facility damage and such assumption of liability is a contractual obligation of
the permittee. The only exception will be such instances where damage is
exclusively due to the negligence of the owning utility.

property, it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of
taking appropriate protective measures, the permittee shall obtain permission
from the owner of such private property for such purpose, and if he cannot
obtain such permission from such owner, the administrative authority may
authorize him to enter the private premises solely for the purpose of making
the property safe.
   C.   Shore Up And Protect Buildings: The permittee shall, at its own
expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property
likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be
responsible for all damage to public or private property or highways resulting
from its failure to properly protect and carry out the work.
   D.   Trench Through Lawns: Whenever it is necessary for the permittee to
trench through any lawn area, the area shall be reseeded or the sod shall be
carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled as
required in this Chapter. All construction and maintenance work shall be done
in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in
a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before the work began.
   E.   Remove Trees Or Shrubs From Parking Strip Areas: The permittee shall
not remove, even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip
areas or permanent BMPs without first having notified and obtained the consent
of such property owner.

All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in any
street shall be piled and maintained in such manner as not to endanger those
working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that as
little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and adjoining
property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to
permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as might be the
case in a narrow alley, the administrative authority shall have the authority
to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and
then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be the
permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all
necessary arrangement for all required storage and disposal sites. (1973 Code §
12.16.180)

ordered by the administrative authority, and in any event immediately after
completion of the work, the permittee shall at his or its own expense clean up
and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from the work,
and upon failure to do so within twenty four (24) hours after having been
notified to do so by the administrative authority, the work may be done by the
administrative authority and the cost thereof charged to the permittee. (1973
Code § 12.16.190)
8-5-18: PROTECTION OF WATERCOURSES:
The permittee shall maintain all gutters free and unobstructed for the full
depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one foot (1') in width from the
face of such curb at the gutter line. Whenever a gutter crosses an intersecting
street, an adequate waterway shall be provided and at all times maintained. The
permittee shall make provisions to take care of all surplus water, muck, silt,
slickings or other runoff pumped from excavations or resulting from sluicing or
other operations and shall be responsible for any damage resulting from its

8-8-4: MASTER PERMIT REQUIRED - EXCEPTIONS:
   A.   Master Permit Requirement: Except as otherwise provided herein, an
operator of a telecommunications facility or a private communications system
owner proposing to use the public right-of- way must obtain from the City
Council a master permit before constructing a telecommunications facility or
providing telecommunications services or constructing a private communications
system. A separate master permit shall be obtained for each use whenever a
particular master permitted communications facility may be used for multiple
purposes, unless applicable Federal or State law prohibits the City from
requiring such additional master permit. A master permit shall only become
effective after the grantee signs an acceptance of the master permit.
   B.   Exceptions: The Administrator may waive the requirement for a master
permit as follows:
      1.   Subject to the requirements of applicable law, a master permit
requirement may be waived in whole or in part for a telecommunications system
or private communications system where the City determines the use of the
public rights-of-way is de minimis (i.e., uses only a short distance of street
or occupies only a small isolated area of a specific street). For such
facilities, the City may issue a right-of-way permit. Every right-of-way permit
shall include or be read to include, as if stated therein, a reservation of
rights by the City to require the permit holder to obtain a master permit if
the City determines that the permit holder's use of the public rights-of- way
has increased substantially and is no longer de minimis use.
      2.   Any operator providing telecommunications service over an existing
telecommunications system in the City's public rights- of-way without having a
master permit from the City authorizing such use at the time this chapter
becomes effective shall apply for a master permit from the City for such use of
the public rights-of-way; provided, that if the operator has obtained a
franchise, permit, license, or other authorization from the City allowing such
use of the public right-of-way, the operator may continue its use of the public
right-of-way pursuant to such franchise, permit, license or other authorization
until the expiration or termination of such authority, at which time the
operator shall apply for and obtain a master permit under this chapter.
      3.   If an operator submits evidence satisfactory to the City that it has
an existing State-wide grant to occupy the public right- of-way, then the
requirement for obtaining a master permit will be suspended until there is a
final judicial decision resolving the issue or the City Council determines that
the best interests of the City will be served by not requiring the operator to
obtain a master permit. The suspension of any master permit requirement under
this section shall not constitute a waiver of any right of the City to require
the operator to obtain a master permit in the future or to remove any or all of
its facilities in the public right-of-way at any time upon its failure to
obtain a master permit. If an operator fails to obtain a master permit and the
master permit requirement is suspended as provided in this subsection, then the
operator shall apply for and obtain a City right-of-way permit prior to
constructing or placing any telecommunications facility in the public right-of-
way.
   C.   Nature Of Grant: Neither a master permit nor a right-of-way permit
shall convey equitable or legal title to the public rights-of-way. The right
granted is only the right to occupy those portions of the public rights-of-way
to which the City has the right to grant access, for the purposes and the time
period stated in the master permit or right-of-way permit, and the right may
not be subdivided or subleased. A master permit or right-of- way permit shall
not grant a vested right for any facility to be located or to remain at any
specific location in the public right-of-way and any right, permission or
consent to occupy any location in the public right-of-way shall be revocable
and terminable at the lawful discretion of the City and the facility therein
removed at the cost of the operator in order to allow free and unencumbered use
of the public right-of-way for public work or other public purpose as may be in
the best public or Municipal interest as determined by the City. Every master
permit shall be:
      1.   Deemed to include all of the provisions that are required to be in a
master permit under this chapter, as if fully set forth in the master permit;
      2.   Deemed to provide for forfeiture under the circumstances set forth
in the provisions of this chapter and any master permit thereunder; and
      3.   Construed to exclude the grant of any rights in any easement granted
for or in favor of any City or public utility facilities or operations, unless
the master permit or license shall expressly state otherwise.
Any reference herein, or in any master permit or right-of- way permit, to a
public right-of-way shall not be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by
the City that its interest or other right to control the use of such property
is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a master permit shall be
deemed to grant no more than those rights which the City may have the
undisputed right and power to give. (Ord. 2018-1031, 7-11-2018)
8-8-5: APPLICATION FOR A MASTER PERMIT:
   A.   Contents Of Application For Initial Or Renewal Master Permit: To obtain
an initial or renewal master permit, an operator of a telecommunications system
must apply for a master permit. The application must contain the following
information, and such information as the City may from time to time reasonably
require:
      1.   Identity of the applicant and corporate structure.
      2.   A proposal for construction of a telecommunications facility that
includes at least the following:
         a.   A description of the services that are to be provided using the
facility;
         b.   The location of proposed facility and facility design, including
a description of the miles of plant to be installed, and a description of the
size of equipment cabinets, shielding and electronics that will be installed
along the plant route, the power sources that will be used and a description of
the noise, exhaust and pollutants, if any, that will be generated by the
operation of the same; provided, however, that if some of the descriptive data
is not available at the time of application, the master permit may be issued
subject to conditions that the data be filed and approved by the City before
construction begins and that the master permit will be deemed to be forfeited
if the data is not supplied and approved;
         c.   A map of the general route the facility will follow; a
designation of the portions of the system that will be placed above ground and
the portions that will be placed underground, and the construction techniques
that the operator proposes to use in installing the system above ground and
underground; plan and profile view of the facilities, showing crossings of
existing utilities and elevation above or below ground; a schedule for
construction of the facility describing when and where construction will begin,
how it will proceed, and when it will be completed; and the expected effect on
right-of-way usage, including information on the ability of the public rights-
of-way to accommodate the proposed system, including, as appropriate given the
system proposed, an estimate of the availability of space in conduits and an
estimate of the cost of any necessary rearrangement of existing facilities;
         d.   A description, where appropriate, of how services will be
converted from existing facilities to new facilities, and what will be done
with existing facilities;
         e.   Identification of the area of the City to be served by the
proposed system, including a description of the proposed area's boundaries
under the master permit; and
         f.   An affidavit or declaration of the applicant or authorized
officer thereof certifying the truth and accuracy of the information in the
application, and certifying that the application meets all requirements of
applicable law.
   B.   Applications For Transfer: An application for a transfer of a master
permit must contain the same information required by subsection A of this
section, except that, if the transferor submitted an application under
subsection A of this section, to the extent information provided by the
transferor under subsection A2 of this section remains accurate, the transferee
may simply cross-reference the earlier application.
   C.   Confidentiality: In the event that subsections A2b and A2c or B of this
section require information that is a business or trade secret and/or
proprietary information and the operator wishes to protect the information
against disclosure, then operator shall provide said information to the City in
a separate envelope marked "Proprietary Information: DO NOT DISCLOSE". The City
will exercise good faith efforts to protect the confidentiality of the business
or trade secrets or proprietary information that is designated as such;
provided further, that: 1) if a public disclosure request is made for
information marked as proprietary, and if the City Attorney determines that
said information may be subject to being disclosed, or 2) the City determines
that the information should be disclosed in connection with its enforcement of
any provision of this chapter, or in the exercise of its police or regulatory
powers, then the City shall notify the operator of the operator's opportunity
to seek a protective order from a court with appropriate jurisdiction. If a
protective order is not obtained within the time limitation set forth in State
law for the City's disclosure of public records, then the City may disclose
said information. The operator is obligated to reimburse and indemnify the City
for all costs, damages and attorneys' fees that may be awarded or assessed by
the court for any actions the City took at the request of operator.
   D.   City Review: The City may request such additional information as it
finds reasonably necessary, and require such modifications to the system
proposed as may be necessary and lawful in the exercise of the City's police
power authority over the use of its public rights-of-way for telecommunications
systems. Once the information required by the City has been provided, the
application shall be subject to review by the City and any approval shall be
subject to the City's determination that:
      1.   The applicant will accept the modifications required by the City to
its proposed system. This section does not authorize the City to exercise
authority it does not otherwise have under applicable law.
      2.   The applicant will accept a master permit satisfactory to the City
and comply with any conditions precedent to its effectiveness.
      3.   In the case of a transfer, any approval will also be subject to a
determination that:
         a.   There will be no adverse effect on the public interest as it
relates to the right-of-way, or the City's interest in the master permit;
         b.   Transferee will agree to be bound by all the conditions of the
master permit and to assume all the obligations of its predecessor; and
         c.   Any outstanding compliance issues will be resolved or preserved
to the satisfaction of the City.
      4.   Unless the applicant agrees to an extension, the City shall approve,
conditionally approve, or disapprove an application no later than one hundred
twenty (120) days after a complete application has been filed. Whenever the
City disapproves an application it shall set forth its reasons in writing based
on the substantial evidence in the written record.
   E.   Inaccurate Information: An applicant shall not be issued a master
permit if it files or has previously filed materially inaccurate or misleading
information in a master permit application or intentionally withheld
information that the applicant lawfully is required to provide. (Ord. 2018-
1031, 7-11-2018)
8-8-6: COMPENSATION:
   A.   Every operator of a telecommunications facility shall compensate the
City for its actual costs that are related to receiving and approving a master
permit or right-of-way permit, to inspecting plans and construction pursuant
thereto, or to the preparation of a detailed statement pursuant to chapter
43.21C Revised Code of Washington.
      1.   Costs shall be billed to the operator on a time and material basis
in the manner and at the rates provided in a resolution adopted by the City
Council.
      2.   Fees must be paid within thirty (30) days of receipt of the City's
billing.
      3.   On request of an operator, the City will submit proof of any charges

request a written estimate from the Administrator, in advance of costs planned
to be expended by the City, and the operator may object to any costs by filing
a written protest with the Administrator. The Administrator shall decide the
protest within five (5) business days, and the decision shall be the final
decision of the City.
   B.   Every operator of a telecommunications facility shall compensate the
City for its actual incremental costs necessarily incurred on City public works

business days, and the decision shall be the final decision of the City.
   C.   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the City from collecting a site-
specific charge pursuant to an agreement between the City and a service
provider of personal wireless services acceptable to the parties for:
      1.   The placement of new structures in the right-of-way regardless of
height, unless the new structure is the result of a mandated relocation in
which case no charge will be imposed if the previous location was not charged;
      2.   The placement of replacement structures when the replacement is
necessary for the installation or attachment of wireless facilities, the
replacement structure is higher than the replaced structure, and the overall
height of the replacement structure and the wireless facility is more than
sixty feet (60'); or

not apply to the placement of personal wireless facilities on existing
structures, unless the structure is owned by the City. (Ord. 2018-1031, 7-11-
2018)
8-8-7: GENERAL CONDITIONS GOVERNING USE OF PUBLIC RIGHTS-OF-WAY:
   A.   Right-Of-Way Permit Required: Before any work is performed in the
public right-of-way, a communications system operator or a private
communications system owner shall obtain a right-of-way permit in accordance
with section
8-5-3 of this title. An application for a right-of-way permit by a grantee
shall be approved or disapproved within thirty (30) days of the date of the
filing of a complete application. A right-of-way permit shall incorporate the
requirements of this chapter in addition to the requirements of section
8-5-3 of this title.
   B.   Responsibility For Costs: Except as expressly provided otherwise, any
act that a communications system operator, its contractors or subcontractors is
required to perform under this section shall be performed at their cost. If a
communications system operator fails to perform work that it is required to
perform within the time provided for performance, the City may perform the work
and bill the communications system operator therefor. The communications system
operator shall pay the amounts billed within thirty (30) days.
   C.   Construction Procedures And Placement Of Facilities - Obligation To
Minimize Interference With Use Of Public Rights-Of- Way:
      1.   The construction, operation, and repair of communications facilities
are subject to the supervision of all of the authorities of the City with
jurisdiction over such matters and shall be performed in compliance with all
laws, ordinances, departmental rules and regulations affecting such system.
      2.   The construction, operation, and repair shall be performed in a
manner consistent with high industry standards and shall meet applicable City
of Orting development standards. Persons engaged in the construction,
operation, or repair of communications facilities shall exercise reasonable
care in the performance of all their activities and shall use commonly accepted
methods and devices for preventing failures and accidents that are likely to
cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public or to property.
      3.   Construction, operation, or repair of a communications system shall
not commence until all required permits have been properly filed for and
obtained from the proper City officials and all required permits and associated
fees paid and bonds or other performance security provided. In any permit so
issued, the City may impose as a condition of the granting of the permit such
conditions and regulations as may be necessary to the management of the rights-
of-way, including, by way of example and not limitation, for the purpose of
protecting any structures in the public rights-of-way, for the proper
restoration of such public rights-of-way and structures, and for the protection
of the City and the public and the continuity of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic.
      4.   A master permit or right-of-way permit may provide for the
conditions under which emergency work may be undertaken before obtaining City
permits where such work is necessary to immediately remedy an emergency
situation involving an imminent danger to health, safety or property or to
temporarily restore communications system services that have been disrupted by
storms, earthquakes, riots or other unexpected accidents. A communications
system operator undertaking such emergency work shall be required:
         a.   To give notice to the City of the commencement of the emergency
work as quickly as practical;
         b.   To apply for the permits which would otherwise be required for
such work by the next business day from the commencement of such work; and
         c.   To conform any work performed prior to the approval of the
required permit and to carry out any other work in the area involved in
accordance with the requirements of the permit.
      5.   Operators of communications systems must follow City- established
requirements for placement of facilities in public rights-of-way, including the
specific location of facilities in the public rights-of-way, and must install
facilities in a manner that minimizes interference with the use of the public
rights-of- way by others. The City may require the installation of facilities
at a particular time, at a specific place, or in a particular manner as a
condition of access to a particular right- of-way; it may require a person
using the rights-of-way to cooperate with others to minimize adverse impacts on
the rights- of-way through joint trenching, joint use of facilities and other
arrangements; it may deny access if an operator is not willing to comply with
the City's requirements; it may remove, or require removal of, any facility
that is not installed in compliance with the requirements established by the
City, or that is installed without prior City approval of the time, place, or
manner of installation; and it shall charge the operator of the facility for
all the costs associated with removal.
      6.   Upon order of the Administrator, all work that does not comply with
the permit, the approved plans or specifications for the work, or the
requirements of this chapter or other applicable law shall be removed.
      7.   Unless otherwise agreed or provided in a master permit or right-of-
way permit, a communications systems operator shall be required to reimburse
and hold harmless the City for any cost or expense reasonably incurred by the
City in planning, construction, installing, altering, or implementing any
public work as a result of the construction or the presence in the public
right-of-way of the facility of such communications system operator.
      8.   The specific location within the right-of-way and the method of
installing facilities underground or overhead will be subject to approval by
the City Engineer. Cutting of pavement in the public right-of-way shall be
prohibited where the City Engineer approves locating underground facilities in
the unimproved portions of the right-of-way or in the sidewalk areas or
requires alternative methods for undergrounding not requiring trenching or the
cutting of pavement.
      9.   Except to allow for compliance with State or Federal law, cutting of
pavement shall be prohibited in any event in a newly constructed or
reconstructed street for a period of five (5) years from the paving of such
street or in a street where a trench was previously available for a period of
three (3) years from the date the trench was available. The City may require as
a condition to the occupancy of the rights-of-way that communications
facilities be located in existing underground ducts or conduits wherever the
capacity exists; provided, however, the City Engineer may in his or her
discretion permit pot-holing (subject to conditions to alleviate the harmful
effects) where conduit is to be placed underground by means of directional
boring and the person seeking permission has provided evidence satisfactory to
the City Engineer that:
         a.   Such pot-holing is necessary to avoid interference with existing
utilities;
         b.   Such pot-holing is the only reasonable alternative available to
locate existing utilities; and
         c.   Such pot-holing will result in little or no visual or other
detrimental impact to the street.
      10.   Any and all public rights-of-way, public property, or private
property that is disturbed or damaged during the construction, operation,
repair or removal of a communications facility shall be promptly repaired by
the communications system operator that disturbed or damaged the public rights-
of-way, public property or private property. Public property and public rights-
of-way must be restored to the satisfaction of the City and to a condition as
good as or better than before the disturbance or damage occurred.
      11.   A communications system operator shall continue to maintain the
restored street area, which may consist of curb, gutter, sidewalk, pavement, or
other restored appurtenances, in a condition as good as or better than the
condition of the adjacent undisturbed area of the street for the life of the
street when such maintenance or restoration is required as:
         a.   A result of the restored street area being defective or otherwise
inferior to the adjacent undisturbed area of the street; or
         b.   A result of the presence of the facilities of the communications
system operator until the restored area is repaved or reconstructed by a
different party.
      12.   Tree trimming shall not be performed without the permission of the
City and other affected authorities, and tree trimming must be performed in
strict accordance with this Code.
      13.   Within forty eight (48) hours after notice from the City, a
communications system operator shall remove any graffiti on any part of its
communications system in the public rights-of-way. If the operator fails to do
so, the City may remove the graffiti and bill the operator for the cost
thereof.
   D.   Relocation And Abandonment Of Facilities:
      1.   A communications system operator shall, by a time specified by the
City, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove any of its
property when required by the City by reason of traffic conditions; public
safety; public right-of-way construction; public right-of-way repair (including
resurfacing or widening); change of public right-of-way grade; construction,
installation or repair of sewers, drains, water pipes, power lines, signal
lines, tracks, or any other type of government- owned communications system,
public work, public facility or improvement, or any government-owned utility;
public right-of-way vacation; or for any other purpose where the work involved
would be aided by the removal or relocation of the communications facility.
Collectively, such matters are referred to below as the "public work".
         a.   Except in the case of emergencies, the City shall provide written
notice describing where the public work is to be performed as soon as practical
but at least thirty (30) days prior to the deadline by which a communications
system operator must protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate or
remove its facilities. A communications system operator may seek an extension
of the time to perform such tasks where they cannot be performed in thirty (30)
days or by the completion time specified even with the exercise of its best
efforts, and such request for an extension shall not be unreasonably refused.
         b.   In the event of an emergency, or where a communications facility
creates or is contributing to an imminent danger to health, safety, or
property, the City may protect, support, temporarily disconnect, remove, or
relocate any or all parts of the communications facility without prior notice,
and charge the communications system operator for costs incurred.
         c.   If a communications system operator does not comply with the
requirements of this chapter and the applicable master permit or right-of-way
permit does not provide otherwise, and if not prohibited by applicable law, the
City shall have the right to revoke any right of a communications system
operator to have its facilities remain at a specific location in the public
right-of- way at any time the City determines that the facilities of such
communications system operator must be removed from their present location or
from the street in order to facilitate a public work in the public right-of-way
and upon revocation of the master permit, license or right-of-way permit of the
communications system operator as to the affected designated facilities the
communications system operator shall remove the same and restore the street at
its cost.
      2.   If any person that is authorized to place facilities in the rights-
of-way requests another communications system operator to protect, support,
temporarily disconnect, remove, or relocate its facilities to accommodate the
construction, operation, or repair of the facilities of such other person, the
communications system operator shall, after thirty (30) days' advance written
notice, take action to effect the necessary changes requested. Unless the
matter is governed by a valid contract or a State or Federal law or regulation,
the reasonable cost of the same shall be borne by the person requesting the
protection, support, temporary disconnection, removal, or relocation and at no
charge to the City, even if the City makes the request for such action on
behalf of such party.
      3.   A communications system operator shall, on the request of any person
holding a valid permit issued by a governmental authority, temporarily raise or
lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings or other objects. The expense
of such temporary removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the
person requesting the same. A communications system operator shall be given not
less than seven (7) days' advance notice to arrange for such temporary wire
changes.
      4.   A grantee may abandon and surrender its master permit to the City on
six (6) months' written notice to the Administrator, with copies served on the
Mayor and City Attorney. Abandonment shall be subject to acceptance by the
City, by a resolution of acceptance adopted by the City Council. Upon
abandonment, nonrenewal, revocation or expiration of this master permit, and if
no extension is granted, grantee may, at the discretion of the Administrator,
be required, in part or entirely, to remove all its fiber, wire, poles,
fixtures, and other facilities or equipment installed or used in the enjoyment
of the master permit. Alternatively, the Administrator may direct, limit or
condition grantee's removal, sale or continued use or abandonment of grantee's
facilities and equipment, either by agreement or through means of any other
lawful Municipal power or right. The City may continue to invoke any provision
of this master permit against grantee or any successor entity enjoying de facto
master permit privileges after revocation or expiration. The City may take all
other actions deemed necessary and proper by the City to accommodate the
transition to any successor as may be in the best interests of the City and its
residents.
   E.   Facility Subject To Inspection - Operator Must Provide Information:
Every communications facility shall be subject to the right of periodic
inspection by the City to determine compliance with the provisions of this
chapter, a master permit or right-of-way permit, or other applicable law. The
City shall have the right, upon request, to be notified and be present when the
communications system is inspected by the operator to determine compliance with
the provisions of this chapter, a master permit, right-of-way permit, or
applicable law where the City has enforcement authority. Each operator must
respond to requests for information regarding its system and plans for the
system as the City may from time to time issue, including requests for
information regarding its plans for construction, operation and repair and the
purposes for which the plant is being constructed, operated, or repaired to the
extent such plant is or will be in the public right-of-way or has been or will
be provided under any master permit or right-of-way permit granted by or
requested from the City.
   F.   Underground Services Alert: Each operator of a communications system
that places facilities underground shall be a member of the regional
notification center for subsurface installations and shall field mark the
locations of its underground communications facilities upon request. The
operator shall locate its facilities for the City at no charge. Each operator
shall reasonably cooperate with City initiatives to coordinate underground
fixture locations and installations. Each operator shall be familiar with
chapter 19.122 Revised Code of Washington, Washington State's Underground
Utilities Statute. Each operator shall certify that it understands local
procedures, custom and practice relating to facilities locating, and shall
ensure that its contractors or others working in the right-of-way on grantee's
behalf are similarly well informed.
   G.   Undergrounding Of Lines: Each operator shall recognize the City's right
to preserve and control of the public right-of-way, particularly with respect
to policies regarding the undergrounding of overhead lines for aesthetic
reasons. Consistent with any general Municipal undergrounding policy or program
now or hereafter developed, the City reserves the right to require each
operator's participation in Municipally imposed undergrounding or related
requirements as may now or hereafter arise, as a condition of the operator's
new installation or major maintenance or restoration construction activities of
overhead facilities under this franchise. Each operator shall coordinate its
underground installation and planning activities with the City's underground
plan and policies; provided, in no event shall any third party beneficiary
rights be implied or created. Nothing in this section shall be permitted in
conflict with Revised Code of Washington 35.99.060, and the provisions of this
section shall be applied in conformity thereto.
   H.   Reimbursement: A communications system operator may request
reimbursement from the City as provided in Revised Code of Washington 35.99.060
(3)(a) through (c) and if so requested the City shall make reimbursement as
provided therein.
   I.   Plans For And Publicizing Work:
      1.   Work shall be publicized as the City may direct from time to time to
notify the public and operators of other communications systems of the
impending work, to minimize inconvenience and disruption to the public and to
allow for cooperative construction and for joint use of trenches and
facilities.
      2.   Each communications system operator shall provide the City a plan
for any initial system construction, or for any substantial rebuild, upgrade or
extension of its facility, which shall show its timetable for construction of
each phase of the project, and the areas of the City that will be affected.
      3.   Each operator shall supply and maintain updated, at no cost, any
information requested by the Administrator to coordinate Municipal functions
with the operator's activities and fulfill any Municipal obligations under
State law. The Administrator may request information concerning an installation
inventory, location of existing or planned facilities, maps, plans, and as-
built drawings of the operator's installations in the City. The information may
be requested either in hard copy and/or electronic format compatible with the
City's database system. Each operator shall keep the Administrator informed of
its long- range plans for coordination with the City's long-range plans.
      4.   Each communications facility operator shall maintain accurate maps
and improvement plans which show the location, size, and a general description
of all facilities installed in the public rights-of-way and any power supply
sources (including voltages and connections). Maps shall be based upon post-
construction inspection to verify location. The operator of each communications
facility shall provide a map (on 24-inch by 36- inch bond and/or PDF) to the
City showing the location of its facilities, in such detail and scale as may be
directed by the City Engineer. Vertical and horizontal tolerance limits shall
be +/- 0.01 foot. New system maps shall be promptly submitted to the City when
the facility expands or is relocated. Copies of maps shall be provided on disk,
in a commercially available electronic format specified by the City Engineer or
in such alternate form as approved by the City Engineer.
      5.   The Administrator may, when the City receives application for a
permit to use a particular route, or on the Administrator's own initiative,
designate by published order a route or proposed route for installation of
communications facilities and may:
         a.   Require all persons who wish to place underground facilities
along that route or any part thereof to install them during a specified period;
and
         b.   To the extent allowed by law, otherwise prohibit placement of
such facilities along the route or any part thereof for thirty six (36) months
or for such other, longer period as is necessary to protect the public. (Ord.
2018-1031, 7-11-2018)
8-8-8: PROTECTION OF THE CITY AND RESIDENTS:
   A.   Indemnification: No master permit or right-of-way permit issued to a
communications system operator or a private communications system owner shall
be valid or effective until and unless the City obtains an adequate indemnity
from such operator or owner. Unless otherwise agreed, in writing, adequate
indemnity must:
      1.   Release the City from and against any and all liability and
responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation, or maintenance
of the communications facility in the public right-of-way by the communications
facility operator or private communications system owner; and
      2.   Provide that the indemnification provision shall survive the term of
any master permit or other authorization and continue in full force and effect
as to the communications facility operator's or private communications system
owner's responsibility to indemnify.
   B.   Insurance: A master permit or right-of-way permit issued to a
communications system operator or a private communications system owner shall
not be valid or effective until and unless the City obtains assurance that the
insurance required by the City's insurer is in effect. A communications system
operator or a private communications system owner shall procure and maintain
for the duration of the master permit or right-of-way permit, insurance against
claims for injuries to persons or damage to property which may arise from or in
connection with operations or activities performed by the communications system
operator or a private communications system owner or on their behalf with the
issuance of the master permit or right-of-way permit.
      1.   A grantee or right-of-way permit holder shall not commence
construction or operation of any facilities without obtaining all insurance
required by the City and approval of such insurance by the City, nor shall a
grantee or right-of-way permit holder allow any contractor or subcontractor to
commence work on its contract or subcontract until all such similar insurance
required of the same has been obtained and approved. The required insurance
must be obtained and maintained for the entire period the grantee or right-of-
way permit holder has facilities in the rights-of-way, and for a period
thereafter as specified. If the operator, its contractors, or subcontractors do
not have the required insurance, the City may order such entities to stop
operations until the insurance is obtained and approved.
      2.   Certificates of insurance reflecting evidence of the required
insurance, coverage, endorsements, and ratings shall be filed with the
Administrator. The grantee or right-of-way permit holder shall furnish the City
with original certificates and a copy of the amendatory endorsements, including
the additional insured endorsement, evidencing the insurance requirements of
the grantee or right-of-way permit holder before issuance of the master permit
or right-of-way permit.
      3.   If the insurance certificate provided indicates that the insurance
shall terminate or lapse during the period of the master permit or license,
then the grantee or right-of-way permit holder shall furnish, at least thirty
(30) days prior to the expiration date of such insurance, a renewed certificate
of insurance as proof that equal and like coverage has been or will be obtained
prior to any such lapse or termination to be in effect during the balance of
the period of the master permit or right-of-way permit under which the
communications system operates. Failure on the part of the grantee or right-of-
way permit holder to maintain the insurance as required shall constitute a
material breach of the master permit or right-of-way permit, upon which the
City may, after giving five (5) business days' notice to the grantee or right-
of-way permit holder to correct the breach, immediately terminate the master
permit or right-of-way permit or, at its discretion, procure or renew such
insurance and pay any and all premiums in connection therewith, with any sums
so expended to be repaid to the City on demand.
      4.   Policies shall be issued by companies authorized to do business
under the laws of the State of Washington. Financial ratings must be no less
than "A:VII" in the latest edition of "Bests Key Rating Guide", published by
A.M. Best Guide.
      5.   In every master permit or license agreement, the City shall reserve
the right to require any other insurance coverage it deems necessary depending
upon the exposures.
   C.   Performance/Payment Bonds: Every operator of a communications facility
may be required to obtain performance bonds and, if necessary, payment bonds to
ensure the faithful performance of its responsibilities under this chapter and
any master permit, right-of-way permit or license, including a sufficient
amount to cover removal of facilities and/or restoration of City facilities
within rights-of-way. The amount of the performance and payment bonds shall be
set by the Administrator or may be set in a master permit in light of the
nature of the work to be performed and is not in lieu of any additional bonds
that may be required through the permitting process. The bond shall be in a
form acceptable to the City Attorney. The City may from time to time increase
or decrease the amount of the required performance bond to reflect changes in
risks to the City and to the public. (Ord. 2018-1031, 7-11-2018)
8-8-9: ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES:
   A.   Administrator's Responsibilities: The Administrator is responsible for
enforcing and administering this chapter, and the Administrator is authorized
to give any notice required by law or under any master permit, including, by
way of example and not limitation, a notice required under 47 USC section 546.
The Administrator is also authorized to seek information from any
communications system operator, and to take all other actions necessary or
appropriate to the administration of this chapter or any master permit. Master
permits may be denied, issued or revoked only by the City Council. General
administration of the master permit for the City is through the Office of the
Administrator. However, the Administrator may delegate this authority and
responsibility to other agents of the City. All questions of application,
interpretation, conflict or ambiguity arising out of or in connection with a
master permit may be determined through communications with the Administrator,
except where otherwise specifically stated.
   B.   Minimum Contents Of Every Master Permit Or Right-Of-Way Permit: In
addition to satisfying the other applicable requirements of this chapter, every
master permit or right-of-way permit for a communications system shall contain
the following provisions:
      1.   The master permit or right-of-way permit shall provide that neither
the granting of any master permit or right-of-way permit, or any provision
thereof, shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental
right or power, police power, or regulatory power of the City as may exist at
the time the master permit or license is issued or thereafter be obtained.
      2.   The master permit or right-of-way permit shall only authorize
occupancy of the right-of-way to provide the services and for the purposes
described in the master permit or license.
      3.   A master permit or right-of-way permit shall be a privilege that is
held in the public trust and personal to the original grantee or permit holder.
The master permit or right-of-way permit shall ensure that no transfer of the
master permit or license may occur, directly or indirectly, without the prior
consent of the City.
      4.   The master permit or license shall contain appropriate provisions
for enforcement, and protection of the public, consistent with the other
provisions of this chapter.
      5.   The master permit or license shall be for a specified term, set
forth in the master permit or license. A master permit issued under this
chapter shall be for a term of no longer than five (5) years, unless the City
Council determines that a longer period would be in the City's interest. A
right-of-way permit issued under this chapter shall be for a term of no longer
than one year.
   C.   Penalties: Any person found to have occupied or carried out activities
in the public rights-of-way without first having obtained or having in effect a
valid master permit, license, or right-of-way permit as required by this
chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished by a fine not
exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or by imprisonment not exceeding
ninety (90) days or by both such fine and imprisonment. Each day that any such
occupancy or activity shall continue in violation of this chapter shall
constitute a separate offense.
   D.   Revocation, Reduction Of Term, Or Forfeiture Of Master Permit Or Right-
Of-Way Permit:
      1.   Revocation Of Permits: A master permit or right-of-way permit may be
revoked for violation of any terms and conditions of the master permit or other
City ordinances, resolutions or policy including but not limited to the
following:
         a.   Construction or operation in the public rights-of-way of the City
or on City property in a manner in violation of a master permit or right-of-way
permit;
         b.   Construction or operation at an unauthorized location in the
public rights-of-way of the City or on City property;
         c.   Misrepresentation by or on behalf of the operator in any material
respect in any application or written statements or documents to the City on
which the City relies in making the decision to grant, review, or amend the
master permit or right- of-way permit;
         d.   Abandonment of telecommunications facilities in the public
rights-of-way or on City property;
         e.   Failure to relocate or remove facilities as required by this
chapter, master permit, or right-of-way permit;
         f.   Failure to pay taxes, compensation, fees, or costs when and as
due the City under this chapter;
         g.   Insolvency or bankruptcy of the operator; or
         h.   Violation of any material provision of this chapter or master
permit which is not timely cured on notice to the operator by the City.
      2.   Written Notice: If the City believes that grounds exist for
revocation of the master permit, the operator shall be given written notice of
the apparent violation or noncompliance, providing a short and concise
statement of the grounds for revocation. The notice shall provide the operator
a reasonable period of time not exceeding thirty (30) days to furnish evidence:
         a.   That corrective action has been or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued to remedy the violation or noncompliance;
         b.   That rebuts the alleged violation or noncompliance; or
         c.   That it would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or
sanction less than revocation.
      3.   Administrator Actions: If the Administrator determines that the
operator has failed to comply with the master permit, the Administrator shall
enter a written order of violation and impose sanctions, including revocation
of the master permit, a requirement for curative actions, and/or a fine not to
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00). The decision of the Administrator
shall be based upon the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the
violation as reflected by one or more of the following factors:
         a.   Whether the misconduct was egregious;
         b.   Whether substantial harm resulted;
         c.   Whether the violation was intentional;
         d.   Whether there is a history of prior violations of the same or
other requirements;
         e.   Whether there is a history of overall compliance; and
         f.   Whether the violation was voluntarily disclosed, admitted or
cured; provided, that no opportunity for cure is allowed for fraud, which shall
be deemed incurable.
      4.   Appeals:
         a.   The operator may appeal any decision of the Administrator to the
hearing examiner by filing a written notice of appeal with the City Clerk
within ten (10) calendar days of the date of issuance of the Administrator's
decision. The notice of appeal must include a copy of the Administrator's
decision and a complete record originally submitted to the Administrator by the
operator. The City Clerk shall forward the appeal and the record to the hearing
examiner who shall set the matter for hearing as provided in the adopted rules
for hearing examiner appeals.
         b.   The hearing examiner shall consider the record before the
Administrator and written and oral argument based upon that record; provided,
that the hearing examiner may, upon a showing of good cause, allow appellant to
introduce additional evidence and the City shall be allowed to rebut such
evidence. The operator shall have the burden of establishing that the
Administrator's decision is not supported by a preponderance of the evidence.
         c.   The hearing examiner shall accord substantial weight to the
Administrator's decision. The hearing examiner shall either affirm or reverse
the Administrator's decision. The hearing examiner's decision shall be the
final decision of the City.
      5.   Master Permit Forfeited: Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City may
declare a master permit forfeited without opportunity to cure or the notice
required by subsection D3 of this section where the operator fails to begin to
exercise its rights under the master permit within a period specified in the
master permit. However, an operator shall have the right to receive thirty (30)
days' prior notice of intent to declare a master permit forfeited, and shall
have the opportunity to show cause why the master permit should not be
forfeited.
      6.   Automatic Termination: Notwithstanding the foregoing, a master
permit or right-of-way permit will automatically terminate by force of law one
hundred twenty (120) calendar days after an assignment for the benefit of
creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take over the business
of the operator, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy
assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or proceeding.
However, the master permit or right-of-way permit may be reinstated within that
120-day period if: a) such assignment, receivership or trusteeship has been
vacated; or b) such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the master permit or right-of- way
permit and has executed an agreement, approved by any court having
jurisdiction, assuming and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of
this chapter and the master permit or right-of-way permit. However, in the
event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment
or property of an operator, the City may revoke the master permit or right-of-
way permit, following a public hearing before the City Council, by serving
notice on the operator and the successful bidder at the sale, in which event
the master permit or right-of- way permit and all rights and privileges of the
master permit or right-of-way permit will be revoked and will terminate thirty
(30) calendar days after serving such notice, unless: a) the City has approved
the transfer of the master permit or right-of-way permit to the successful
bidder; and b) the successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the City to
assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the master permit or right-
of-way permit and this chapter.
   E.   Sale, Lease, Assignment:
      1.   This master permit or license shall not be sold, leased, assigned,
or otherwise alienated without the express consent of the City, and no rule of
estoppel shall be invoked against the City in case the City shall assert the
invalidity of any attempted transfer in violation of this section. The City
agrees not to withhold consent where the operator demonstrates that the
requested assignment is in the nature of a change of name or a change in the
nature of a reorganization or merger of or with an entity controlled by,
controlling, or under the common control of the operator, there being no other
change in the resulting entity's ability to meet its master permit or license
obligations.
      2.   The City reserves the right to invoke any or all provisions of this
master permit or license upon the operator's successors or assigns, judgment
creditors, or distributers of facilities or property used in enjoyment of
privileges conferred herein, whether or not stated elsewhere, all without
waiver of the right to withhold consent not expressly given of any such
transfer and/or require a new master permit or license.
      3.   The operator shall not permit installations by others in the
permitted areas, without written approval from the Administrator. Such approval
shall not be in lieu of a master permit or license or other requirements of the
City. Whether or not permitted, the operator shall remain responsible for all
third party users permitted or allowed by the operator for compliance with the
master permit or license. The intent of this provision is so third parties who
might otherwise desire to use the operator's facilities are also required to
comply with City requirements regarding master permit or right-of-way permit,
as may apply.
   F.   Effect Of Termination Or Forfeiture: Upon termination or forfeiture of
a license or master permit, whether by action of the City as provided above, or
by passage of time, the operator shall be obligated to cease using the
communications system for the purposes authorized by the master permit. The
City may either take possession of some or all of the operator's facilities in
the public rights-of-way or require the operator or its bonding company to
remove some or all of the operator's facilities from the public rights-of-way
and restore the public rights-of-way to its same, or better, condition. If the
operator neglects, refuses, or fails to remove such facility, the City may
remove the facility at the expense of the operator. The operator's obligation
to remove shall survive the termination of the master permit or right-of-way
permit for a period of two (2) years; provided, that this provision does not
permit the City to take possession of, or require the operator to remove, any
facilities that are used to provide another service for which the operator
holds a valid master permit or right-of-way permit issued by the City.
   G.   Remedies Cumulative: All remedies under this chapter and any master
permit or right-of-way permit are cumulative unless otherwise expressly stated.
The exercise of one remedy shall not foreclose use of another, nor shall the
exercise of a remedy or the payment of liquidated damages or penalties relieve
a communications system operator of its obligations to comply with its master
permit or license. Remedies may be used singly or in combination; in addition,
the City may exercise any rights it has at law or equity. Recovery by the City
of any amounts under insurance, the performance bond, the Security Fund or
letter of credit, or otherwise, does not limit a communications system
operator's duty to indemnify the City in any way; nor shall such recovery
relieve a communications system operator of its obligations under a master

      1.   Every applicant for a new service connection to the city's public
water system shall be assessed and pay a general facilities charge as
authorized herein pursuant to Revised Code Of Washington 35.92.025. The general
facilities charge for the water system shall represent payment to the city of
the applicant's pro rata share of the capital costs associated with the utility
facilities and may be assessed upon the property.
      2.   The general facilities charge shall be based upon equivalent
residential units and based upon the city engineer's recommendation; provided
that, general facilities charges that have been paid as a result of prior
development activities on the property, or portion thereof, or through
participation in an LID or ULID shall not be reassessed. The determination of
the number of ERUs for each applicant is based on the intended use of the
building/facility/improvements at full capacity.
      3.   The applicant for a subdivision or planned unit development
(resulting in creation of greater than 4 building lots) shall be assessed and
pay the general facility charge upon submission of an application for approval
of the final plat or final plan approval for each phase of the planned unit
development; provided that, if the property is to be subdivided by a
subdivision, at the time of submission of a completed application for final
plat approval. The applicant for a binding site plan shall pay the general
facilities charge prior to and as a condition of approval of the binding site
plan. The city and applicant may agree to include a different schedule or
method for payment of general facilities charges in a development agreement or
other binding agreement between the city and the property owner relating to
development of the property. The applicant for a building permit for single lot
construction (up to 4 building lots) shall pay the general facility charge at
the time, and as a condition, of building permit issuance and prior to physical
service connection to the city's water system. (Ord. 907, 6-29-2011)
      4.   The base general facilities charge for each equivalent residential
unit and any additional surcharges shall be set by ordinance or resolution of
the city council. (Ord. 2016-1002, 12-14-2016, eff. 1-1-2017)
   B.   Connection Charges: There shall be established a connection fee which
the property owner shall be required to pay to the city for the cost of
installation of the meter (when applicable), and inspections of the water
service line and connection. The connection fees are reflective of the
inspection time costs associated with installation of different sized water
meters. The connection fee is to be paid at the time of permit issuance. If the
connection fee is not paid, the city will not allow connection to the water
main. The connection fees are hereby established as follows:
 
                          Rate  
In city classification:
 Residential/commercial/ $475.00
  industrial
Outside city limits classification:
 Residential/commercial/ 515.00
  industrial
 
(Ord. 853, 8-29-2007)
   C.   Disconnection Charges: There shall be established a disconnection fee
which the property owner shall be required to pay to the city for the cost of
disconnection of water service (when applicable). The disconnection fees are
reflective of the direct and indirect costs associated with disconnection of
water service. The disconnection fee, when disconnection is requested by the
property owner or customer, is to be paid at the time of the request. The
disconnection fees are hereby established as follows:
 
                        Rate  
In city classification:  
 Residential           $100.00
 Commercial            200.00

 Residential           200.00
 Commercial            300.00
 
(Ord. 904, 3-9-2011)
   D.   Equitable Adjustment Of General Facilities Charges: There is hereby
established an equitable adjustment to the general facilities charges
applicable to the applicant, or applicant's successor, for a subdivision,
planned unit development or binding site plan pursuant to subsection A of this
section, to be known as the "general facilities equitable adjustment charge".
The general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall be assessed and paid
at the time of building permit issuance based upon the number of equivalent
residential units assigned to the building/facility/improvements to be
constructed under the building permit. The amount of the general facilities
equitable adjustment charge shall be calculated for each equivalent residential
unit as follows:
The difference between the rate for the general facilities charge effective
upon the date that the completed application for the building permit is filed
and the rate for the general facilities charge effective on the date of
assessment of the general facilities charge, or if prepaid, at the time of
payment. In the event that there has been no increase in the rate for the
general facilities charge between the date of assessment of the general
facilities charge, or if prepaid, at the time of payment, and the date the
completed building permit application is filed, the equitable adjustment will
be zero. In the event that there has been a decrease in the rate for the
general facilities charge between the date of assessment of the general
facilities charge, or if prepaid, at the time of payment, and the date the
completed building permit application is filed, the equitable adjustment will
be zero. For purposes of this section, prepaid shall mean general facilities
charges paid prior to the date of assessment.
Payment of the general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall be a
precondition to issuance of the building permit and approval of a service
connection to the water main; provided that, the applicant and the city may
agree to a different schedule or method for payment of the general facilities
equitable adjustment charge pursuant to a development agreement or other
binding agreement between the city and the property owner relating to
development of the property.
   E.   Application Of General Facilities Equitable Adjustment Charge: General
facilities charges are intended to ensure that historic costs of water system
development are equitably shared by property owners who have not contributed to
the costs of system development. General facilities charges assessed upon final
plat, planned unit development or binding site plan approval will not include
costs of water system development, if any, incurred after such assessment but
prior to connection to the water system. The general facilities equitable
adjustment charge is therefore intended to apply to all applicants, and their
successors, who have paid general facilities charges pursuant to subsection A
of this section, whether or not paid before or after the effective date hereof;
provided that, the provisions in this subsection are not intended to and shall
not be construed to amend or alter the provisions set forth in a binding
development agreement or other binding agreement between the city and the
property owner relating to development of the property.
   F.   Exception: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection E of this
section, the general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall not apply to
property, or any portion thereof, for which a service connection is made
pursuant to a building or connection permit that was issued on or before the
later of: 1) June 16, 2013; or 2) two (2) years following the date of
assessment of the general facilities charge. (Ord. 907, 6-29-2011)

month period and may only be applied to one billing period. If a leak adversely
affects two (2) bills and the customer showed due diligence in fixing the leak
in a timely manner, a second adjustment will be considered by the City
Treasurer. To be eligible for this rate adjustment, the following must apply:
      1.   The affected water line must be owned by or be subject to the
exclusive control of the customer;
      2.   The increase of water usage for which an adjustment is sought must
be due to a verifiable water leak in the water line between the customer's side
of the water meter and the customer's residence or structure;
      3.   The water usage sought for adjustment must exceed two (2) times the
customer's highest usage in any single billing period during the twelve (12)
months prior to the billing period sought for adjustment;
      4.   The customer must apply for a water leak rate adjustment within
thirty (30) days of the City's issuance of the water bill sought for
adjustment; and
      5.   The customer must provide proof that the affected water line has
been repaired, such as photos of repair or a receipt from a licensed plumber.
   C.   Following a request for a water leak rate adjustment, the City
Treasurer, or his/her designee, shall review the request and determine whether
or not to approve a water leak rate adjustment. In order to make a proper
determination, City staff shall be entitled to access, inspect, and approve the
customer's water line repair prior to granting a water leak rate adjustment.
   D.   If approved, the City shall make a water leak rate adjustment by
issuing a credit to the customer's account. The adjustment shall not exceed the
total water usage for the billing period sought for adjustment minus the
customer's average water usage. For purposes of this subsection, the "average
water usage" shall be computed by determining the total volume of water
consumed, under normal use conditions, during the preceding twelve (12) months
and dividing that total volume by the number of times the City would typically
read the customer's water meter in a twelve (12) month period. For customers
who have been receiving service for less than twelve (12) months, the average
water usage shall be based on average usage during the months of service. In no
instance shall the water leak adjustment exceed eight hundred dollars
($800.00). (Ord. 2016-984, 5-25-2016)

partial payments shall be applied in the following order of priority: interest,
penalties or fees assessed by the City, sewer, stormwater, water. Remaining

past due or when the delinquent utility bill is against the property or
business to which the application for permit or license pertains. This
requirement shall remain in effect until the past due account is paid in full.

reason(s) for the protest; 2) a description of all acts or omissions; and 3)
the relevant basis for the protest. The customer must file a written protest by
no later than fifteen (15) calendar days from the bill date of the bill being

contamination of the plumbing system within his/her premises and the purveyor's
distribution system that may occur from backflow through a cross connection.
These measures shall include the prevention of backflow under any backpressure
or backsiphonage condition, including the disruption of the water supply from
the purveyor's system that may occur during routine system maintenance or
during emergency conditions, such as a water main break.
      2.   The customer shall install, operate, and maintain at all times his
plumbing system in compliance with the current edition of the Uniform Plumbing
Code having jurisdiction as it pertains to the prevention of contamination and
protection from thermal expansion, due to a closed system that could occur with

plumbing or water use, or performed periodically (annually or less frequently)
where the purveyor considers the customer's plumbing system to be complex or
subject to frequent changes in water use. The cost of the re- survey shall be
borne by the customer.
      10.   Within thirty (30) days of a request by the purveyor, a residential

all changes in water use, and alterations and additions to the plumbing system,
and shall comply with any additional requirements imposed by the purveyor for
cross- connection control.
      12.   The customer shall immediately notify the purveyor and the local
health jurisdiction of any backflow incident occurring within the customer's
premises (i.e., entry of any contaminant/pollutant into the drinking water) and
shall cooperate fully with the purveyor to determine the reason for the
backflow incident.
      13.   Where the purveyor imposes mandatory premises isolation in
compliance with DOH regulations, or agrees to the customer's voluntary premises
isolation through the installation of a RPBA immediately downstream of the
purveyor's water meter, the customer shall comply with the other cross-
connection control regulations having jurisdiction (i.e., Uniform Plumbing
Code).
      14.   The customer shall indemnify and hold harmless the purveyor for all
contamination of the customer's plumbing system or the purveyor's distribution
system that results from an unprotected or inadequately protected cross
connection within the customer's premises. This indemnification shall pertain
to all backflow conditions that may arise from the purveyor's suspension of
water supply or reduction of water pressure, recognizing that the air gap
separation otherwise required would require the customer to provide adequate
facilities to collect, store, and pump water for his/her premises.
      15.   In the event legal action is required and commenced between the
purveyor and the customer to enforce the terms and conditions herein, the
substantially prevailing party shall be entitled to reimbursement of all
incurred costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable
attorney's fees as determined by the court.
      16.   The purveyor has the right, in keeping with changes to Washington
State regulations, industry standards, or the purveyor's risk management
policies, to impose retroactive requirements for additional cross-connection
control measures.
      17.   The customer shall acknowledge that the purveyor's survey of a
customer's premises is for the sole purpose of establishing the purveyor's
minimum requirements for the protection of the public water supply system,
commensurate with the purveyor's assessment of the degree of hazard.
It shall not be assumed by the customer or any regulatory agency that the
purveyor's survey, requirements for the installation of backflow prevention
assemblies, lack of requirements for the installation of backflow prevention
assemblies, or other actions by the purveyor's personnel constitute an approval
of the customer's plumbing system or an assurance to the customer of the
absence of cross connections therein.
   C.   Enforcement And Penalties: The Public Works Director is charged with
the enforcement of this article.
The purveyor shall deny or discontinue water service to any customer and/or
property owner failing to cooperate in the installation, maintenance, repair,
testing or inspection of backflow prevention assemblies as required by the
purveyor within seventy two (72) hours of giving notice to the customer and/or
property owner, or a lesser period of time if required to protect public
health.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, in lieu of discontinuing
water service, the purveyor may install an RPBA on the service pipe to provide
premises isolation, and recover all costs for the installation and subsequent
maintenance and repair of the assembly, appurtenances, and enclosure from the
customer as fees and charges for water. The customer shall be subject to all
applicable inspection and permitting fees, which shall be established by the
City Council by resolution or by ordinance. The failure of the customer to pay
these fees and charges may result in termination of water service in accordance
with the purveyor's water billing policies.
In addition to the remedies set forth in this article, any person charged with
a violation of this article shall be subject to a civil regulatory order and
the related civil penalties, set forth in section
1-13-7 of this Code. (Ord. 2017-1012, 4-26-2017)
9-1E-4: INSPECTION OF PREMISES 1 :
Authorized employees of the Water Department, properly identified, shall have
free access at reasonable hours of the day, to all premises served by the City
water system for the purpose of ascertaining conformity to this article. (Ord.
2016-980, 2-10-2016)
 
Notes
1 1. See section 1-7-9 of this Code.
9-1E-5: DESIGN STANDARDS:
In addition to the requirements set out in this article and in the plan
developed and implemented pursuant to this article, customers shall comply with
all design standards pertaining to the City's water system adopted by the City.
Design standards shall be adopted from time to time by the Council upon the
recommendation of the Public Works Director and the City Engineer and one copy
of the same shall be maintained on file at the Office of the City Clerk. (Ord.
2017-1012, 4-26-2017)
9-1E-6: BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES:
   A.   Compliance With Cross Connection Control Program And Plan Standards:
The customer's plumbing system, starting from the termination of the purveyor's
water service pipe, shall be considered a potential high-health hazard
requiring the isolation of the customer's premises by a DOH-approved, customer-
installed and maintained reduced-pressure principle backflow assembly (RPBA) or
reduced-pressure detector assembly (RPDA). The RPBA or RPDA shall be located at
the end of the purveyor's water service pipe (i.e., immediately downstream of
the meter). Water shall only be supplied to the customer through a DOH-
approved, customer-installed and maintained RPBA or RPDA.
Notwithstanding the aforesaid, the purveyor, upon an assessment of the risk of
contamination posed by the customer's plumbing system and use of water, may
allow:
      1.   A single-family or duplex residential customer to connect directly
to the water service pipe, i.e., without a purveyor- approved DCVA or RPBA.
      2.   Any customer other than a single-family or duplex residential
customer, as a minimum, to be supplied through a DOH-approved, customer-
installed and maintained double-check valve assembly (DCVA), reduced-pressure
principle backflow assembly (RPBA) or double-check detector assembly (DCDA).
The Public Works Director shall require the installation of backflow prevention
devices on any premises being serviced by the water system, pursuant to the
terms of this chapter and the City's Cross Connection Control Program plan,
including but not limited to when in the judgment of the Public Works Director,
acting upon the advice and recommendation of the Cross Connection Control
Manager, Cross Connection Control Specialist or City Engineer, the nature and
extent of activities on the premises or materials stored on the premises would
present an immediate and dangerous hazard to health should a cross connection
occur. The cost of such devices and the installation thereof shall be borne by
the customer and/or owner of the premises affected. The control or elimination
of cross connections shall be in accordance with the cross connection control
regulation in Washington State (rules and regulations of the State Board of
Health regarding public water supplies, WAC 246-290-490). The Cross Connection
Control Program plan shall identify the procedures and criteria for determining
appropriate levels of protection, and shall be in accordance with the "Cross
Connection Control Manual - Accepted Procedure and Practice published by the
Pacific Northwest Section of American Waterworks Association, Seventh Edition",
and all subsequent editions or amendments thereto.
   B.    Condition For Service: Water service to any premises shall be
contingent upon the customer provided cross-connection control in a manner
approved by the City.
   C.   Acceptable Model: Backflow devices required to be installed shall be a
model acceptable to the Washington State Department of Health and consistent
with WAC 246-290.
   D.   Annual Inspections Required; Fees For Inspections: All backflow
preventers that the City relies upon for protection of the water system will be
subject to annual inspection and testing. Inspection shall be performed, at the
customer's expense, by a DOH-certified backflow assembly tester and shall be
done: 1) at the time of installation; 2) annually after installation; 3) after
a backflow incident; 4) after repair, reinstallation, relocation or re-
plumbing; and 5) when necessary to protect against a high-health hazard or when
it repeatedly fails tests or inspections. The inspection and testing shall be
performed by a DOH-certified BAT employed by the customer at the customer's
sole expense, or by the City pursuant to the City of Orting Water Department's
annual testing program.
The cost of the program and testing will be included in the customer's water
bill on an annual basis. Any devices found to be defective shall be immediately
repaired by the affected water customer. (Ord. 2017-1012, 4-26-2017)

equivalent to seven hundred forty eight (748) gallons. The flow rate for
customers with a connection to city water service will be based upon the amount
of water that flows through the customer's water meter and is measured in
hundred cubic feet (CCF). The flow rate for customers authorized pursuant to
section
9-2C-5 of this chapter to measure wastewater flow will be based upon the amount
of wastewater (sewage) that flows through the customer's wastewater meter and
discharges into the city's sewer system and is measured in hundred cubic feet
(CCF). (Ord. 944, 11-13-2013)
9-2B-2: GENERAL FACILITIES CHARGE:
   A.   Assessment And Payment Of Charge: The applicant for every new
connection to the sanitary sewer system of the city shall be assessed and pay a
general facilities charge as authorized herein pursuant to Revised Code Of
Washington 35.92.025. The general facilities charge for the sanitary sewer
system shall represent payment to the city of the property owner's pro rata
share of the capital costs associated with the sanitary sewer sewage works and
may be assessed upon the property.
   B.   Basis Of Charge: The general facilities charge shall be based upon
equivalent residential units and based upon the city engineer's recommendation;
provided that, general facilities charges that have been paid as a result of
prior development activities on the property, or portion thereof, or through
participation in an LID or ULID shall not be reassessed. The determination of
the number of ERUs for each applicant is based on the intended use of the
building/facility/improvement at full capacity.
   C.   Charge To Be Paid Upon Submission Of Application: The applicant for a
subdivision or planned unit development (resulting in creation of greater than
4 building lots) shall be assessed and pay the general facility charge upon
submission of its application for approval of the final plat or final plan
approval for each phase of the planned unit development; provided that, if the
property is to be subdivided by a subdivision, at the time of submission of a
completed application for final plat approval. The applicant for a binding site
plan shall be assessed and pay the general facilities charge prior to and as a
condition of approval of the binding site plan. The city and applicant may
agree to include a different schedule or method for payment of general
facilities charges in the development agreement. The applicant for a building
permit for single lot construction shall pay the general facility charge at the
time of building permit issuance. (Ord. 907, 6-29-2011)
   D.   Charge Established: The base general facilities charge for each
equivalent residential unit and any additional surcharges shall be set by
ordinance or resolution of the city council. (Ord. 2016-1002, 12-14-2016, eff.
1-1-2017)
   E.   Equitable Adjustment Of General Facilities Charges: There is hereby
established an equitable adjustment to the general facilities charges
applicable to the applicant, or applicant's successor, for a subdivision,
binding site plan or planned unit development pursuant to subsections A through
D of this section, to be known as the "general facilities equitable adjustment
charge".
The general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall be assessed and paid
at the time, and as a condition, of building permit issuance based upon the
number of equivalent residential units assigned to the building/facility/
improvements to be constructed under the building permit. The amount of the
general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall be calculated for each
equivalent residential unit as follows:
The difference between the rate for the general facilities charge effective
upon the date that the completed application for the building permit is filed
and the rate for the general facilities charge effective on the date of the
assessment of the general facilities charge, or if prepaid, at the time of
payment. In the event that there has been no increase in the rate for the
general facilities charge between the date of the assessment of the general
facilities charge, or if prepaid, at the time of payment, and the date the
completed building permit application is filed, the equitable adjustment will
be zero. In the event that there has been a decrease in the rate for the
general facilities charge between the date of the assessment of the general
facilities charge, or if prepaid, at the time of payment, and the date the
completed building permit application is filed, the equitable adjustment will
be zero. For purposes of this section, prepaid shall mean general facilities
charges paid prior to the date of assessment.
Payment of the general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall be a
precondition to issuance of the building permit and approval of a service
connection to the sewer main; provided that, the applicant and the city may
agree to a different schedule or method for payment of the general facilities
equitable adjustment charge pursuant to a development agreement or other
binding agreement between the city and the property owner relating to
development of the property.
   F.   Application Of General Facilities Equitable Adjustment Charge: General
facilities charges are intended to ensure that historic costs of sanitary
sewerage system development are equitably shared by property owners who have
not contributed to the costs of system development. General facilities charges
assessed upon final plat or binding site plan approval will not include costs
of sanitary sewerage system development, if any, incurred after such assessment
but prior to connection to the sanitary sewerage system. The general facilities
equitable adjustment charge is therefore intended to apply to all applicants,
and their successors, who have paid general facilities charges pursuant to
subsections A through D of this section, whether or not paid before or after
the effective date hereof; provided that, the provisions in this subsection are
not intended to and shall not be construed to amend or alter the provisions set
forth in a binding development agreement or other binding agreement between the
city and the property owner relating to development of the property.
   G.   Exception: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection F of this
section, the general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall not apply to
the property, or any portion thereof, for which a sewerage service connection
is made pursuant to a building or connection permit that was issued on or
before the later of: 1) June 16, 2013; or 2) two (2) years following the date
of assessment of the general facilities charge. (Ord. 907, 6-29-2011)
9-2B-3: CONNECTION CHARGE:
   A.   Connection Fee: In addition to the general facilities charge, each
person connecting property to the sewer system shall pay a connection fee that
shall be based on the city's expense in said connection and inspection. If the
connection fee is not paid, the city will not allow the connection. The
connection fees are hereby established as follows:
 
                        Rate  
In city classification:  
 Residential           $100.00
 Commercial            200.00
Outside city limits classification:    
 Residential           200.00
 Commercial            300.00
 
   B.   Disconnection Charges: There shall be established a disconnection fee
which the property owner shall be required to pay to the city for the cost of
disconnection of sanitary sewer service (when applicable). The disconnection
fees are reflective of the direct and indirect costs associated with
disconnection of sanitary sewer service. The disconnection fee, when
disconnection is requested by the property owner or customer, is to be paid at
the time of the request. The disconnection fees are hereby established as
follows:
 
                        Rate  
In city classification:  
 Residential           $100.00
 Commercial            200.00

pumped by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.
   C.   Sewer Meters: Sewer meters monitor, measure, record and totalize the
flow of wastewater (sewage) discharged into the city sewer system. This
information is then used to generate a sewage bill for the site. Installation
of sewer meters is discouraged by the city; however, the city engineer may
determine that a sewer meter is the only appropriate device that will allow for
the accurate measurement of flow for purposes of determining sewer service
charges that include a flow rate. Sites where a sewer meter may be allowed or
required include, but are not limited to, sites where the water source is not
metered or sites where industrial processes remove a significant amount of
metered water from the waste stream.
   D.   Sewer Service Agreement: If allowed or required by the city engineer,
the sanitary sewer meter shall be installed, maintained, monitored and operated
pursuant to the conditions set forth in a sewer service agreement between the
city and the person having ownership or control over the real property. The
sewer service agreement shall provide for, among other things, the term of the
agreement; ownership of the sewer meter and related equipment; the terms and
conditions upon which the meter and related equipment will be installed,
monitored, and maintained on the property; city access to the property to
monitor the meter and related equipment; calibration of the sewer meter and
related equipment; disconnection of the sewer connection for noncompliance
with, or termination or expiration of, the agreement; a monitoring surcharge to
be paid to the city; and, recording of the agreement. (Ord. 944, 11-13-2013)

ALTERNATIVE SEWER LINE EXTENSION: For circumstances in which the City relocates
a public sewer line, thereby severing an existing private sewer connection, an
alternative sewer line shall be extended to the shared boundary of the right-
of-way and private property line, and the City shall reconnect any service
lines that it has severed. This extension will enable the City to reconnect to
the property owner's side sewer in compliance with City standards. The City's
public works department shall ensure that the alternative sewer line is
installed up to the boundary, maintaining the continuity and integrity of the
municipal sewer system.
BUILDING SIDE SEWER OWNERSHIP: The building side sewer located in the public
right-of-way or city utility easement shall become the property of the city and
will be maintained, repaired and replaced by the city's public works
department. The portion of the building side sewer located on the customer's
property is owned by the property owner and shall be the owner's responsibility
to keep their portion in good working order and free from extraneous ground
water or surface runoff water. A cleanout shall be provided at the property
line for all new building side sewer installations. At such time the city's
public works department or the property owner makes repairs and/or replaces an
old side sewer that does not have a cleanout at the property line, the party
performing the work shall install a clean-out in accordance with the Orting
Development Specifications and Standard Details in effect at the time.
SIDE SEWER CARDS: Cards documenting the technical and legal specifications of
sewer connections shall be made available in both physical and digital formats
by the city's Public Works Department. A digital copy of each side sewer card
shall be made available in a municipal online database for property owners and

samples taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has
been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be in the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer
is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property.
   B.   Composite Or Grab Sample: The particular analyses involved will
determine whether a twenty four (24) hour composite of all outfalls of a
premises is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD5 and suspended solids analyses are obtained from
twenty four (24) hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH is determined from
periodic grab samples. The individual discharges shall be responsible for the
cost of testing, either periodically and/or as requested by the city. (1973

9-2E-9: BONDS AND LIABILITY INSURANCE REQUIRED:
   A.   General Surety Requirements: The city engineer is authorized to require
all persons constructing retention/detention facilities to post with the city
treasurer surety and cash bonds. Where such persons have previously posted, or
are required to post, other such bonds with the city treasurer, either on the
facility itself or on other construction related to the facility, such persons
may, with the permission of the city treasurer and to the extent allowable by
law, combine all such bonds into a single bond; provided, that at no time shall
the amount thus bonded be less than the total amount which would have been
required in the form of separate bonds, and provided further, that such a bond
shall on its face clearly delineate those separate bonds which it is intended
to replace.
   B.   Construction Bond: Prior to commencing construction, the person
constructing the facility shall post a construction bond in an amount
sufficient to cover the cost of conforming said construction with the approved
drainage plans. After determination by the city engineer that all facilities
are constructed in compliance with the approved plans, the construction bond
shall be released.

city an additional insured, and which shall protect from any liability up to
those amounts for any accident, negligence, failure of the facility, or any
other liability whatsoever, relating to the construction or maintenance of the
facility. The liability policy shall be maintained for the duration of the
facility by the owner of the facility. (Ord. 958, 7-9-2014)
9-2E-10: FACILITY RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITY AND DEVELOPER:
   A.   City Responsibility: In the event that public benefits would accrue due
to modification of the drainage plan for the subject property to better
implement the recommendations of the comprehensive drainage plan, the city
engineer may recommend that the city should assume responsibility for the
further design, construction, operation and maintenance of drainage facilities
on the subject property. Such decision shall be made concurrently with review
and approval of the plan as specified in section
9-2E-7 of this article.
   B.   Contribution By Developer: In the event that the city decides to assume
responsibility for design, construction, operation and maintenance of the
facilities, the developer will be required to contribute a pro rata share to
the construction cost of the facilities. The developer may be required to
supply additional information at the request of the city engineer to aid
determination by the city. (1973 Code § 13.72.110)
9-2E-11: DEVELOPMENT IN CRITICAL AREAS:

9-5A-1: FINDINGS OF FACT:
The city council hereby finds that:
   A.   Stormwater pollution is a problem associated with land utilization and
development and the common occurrence of potential pollutants such as
pesticides, fertilizers, petroleum products, pet wastes and numerous others.
   B.   Land utilization and development is also known to increase both the
volume and duration of peak flows. The resulting erosion, scouring, and
deposition of sediment affect the ecological balance in surface waters.
   C.   Sedimentation and stormwater pollution can cause diversity of species
to decrease and allow more tolerant (and usually less desirable) species to
remain.
   D.   Stormwater pollution can cause or contribute to closures or other
restrictions on public use of the waters within the city.
   E.   An expanding population and increased development of land have led to:
      1.   Water quality degradation through discharge of nutrients, metals,
oil and grease, toxic materials, and other detrimental substances including,
without limitation, insect and weed control compounds;
      2.   Drainage and stormwater and surface water runoff problems within the
city; and
      3.   Safety hazards to both lives and property posed by uncontrolled
water runoff on streets and highways.
   F.   In the future, such problems and dangers will be reduced or avoided if
existing properties and future development of private or public properties
provide for stormwater quality treatment and flow control.
   G.   Stormwater quality treatment and flow control can be achieved when land
is developed or redeveloped by implementing appropriate best management
practices (BMPs).
   H.   BMPs can be expected to perform as intended only when properly
designed, constructed and maintained.
   I.   Sites protected by levees may become temporary closed depressions
because of backwater effects on stormwater drainage systems due to increases in
river elevations.
   J.   The city is a permittee under the western Washington phase II municipal
stormwater permit issued by the Washington state department of ecology under
the federal clean water act and the state of Washington water pollution control
law.
   K.   Not providing for stormwater management practices will lead to water
quality degradation, erosion, property damage, endangerment of the health and
safety of the inhabitants of the city, and/or violation of the provisions of
the phase II municipal stormwater permit. (Ord. 911, 8-31-2011)
9-5A-2: NEED:
The city finds that this article is necessary in order to:
   A.   Minimize water quality degradation.
   B.   Prevent erosion and sedimentation in creeks, streams, ponds, lakes and
other water bodies.
   C.   Protect property owners on or adjacent to existing and developing lands
from increased runoff rates which could cause erosion or flooding of abutting
property.
   D.   Preserve and enhance the suitability of waters for contact recreation,
fishing, and other beneficial uses.
   E.   Preserve and enhance the aesthetic quality of the water.
   F.   Promote sound development policies which respect and preserve city
surface water and groundwater.
   G.   Ensure the safety of city roads and rights of way.
   H.   Protect the health, safety, and welfare of the inhabitants of the city.
(Ord. 911, 8-31-2011)

The purpose of this article is to:
   A.   Minimize water quality degradation and sedimentation in streams, ponds,
lakes, wetlands and other water bodies;
   B.   Minimize the impact of increased runoff, erosion and sedimentation
caused by land development and maintenance practices;
   C.   Maintain and protect surface water and groundwater resources;
   D.   Minimize adverse impacts of alterations on ground and surface water
quantities, locations and flow patterns;
   E.   Decrease potential landslide, flood and erosion damage to public and
private property;
   F.   Promote site planning and construction practices that are consistent
with natural topographical, vegetational and hydrological conditions;
   G.   Maintain and protect the city's stormwater management infrastructure
and those downstream;
   H.   Provide a means of regulating clearing and grading of private and
public land while minimizing water quality and flow impacts in order to protect
public health and safety;
   I.   Provide minimum development regulations and construction procedures
which will preserve, replace or enhance, to the maximum extent practicable,
existing vegetation to preserve and enhance the natural qualities of lands,
wetlands and water bodies. (Ord. 911, 8-31-2011)

applicants, and/or their contractors, constructing stormwater facilities to
post with the city treasurer a surety bond, cash deposit or other security
(hereafter collectively referred to as "financial guarantee") as required in
this article, in the form, amounts and content approved by the director. Where
such persons have previously posted, or are required to post, other such
financial guarantees with the city treasurer, either on the stormwater facility
or on other construction related to the stormwater facility, such persons may,
with the permission of the director and to the extent allowable by law, combine
all such financial guarantees into a single financial guarantee; provided, that
at no time shall the amount thus bonded or otherwise guaranteed be less than
the total amount which would have been required in the form of separate
financial guarantees, and provided further, that such a single financial
guarantee shall on its face clearly delineate those financial guarantees which
it is intended to replace.
   B.   Construction Bond: Prior to commencing construction, the applicant,
and/or its contractor, constructing the stormwater facility shall post a
construction bond in an amount sufficient to cover the estimated cost of
construction of said stormwater facility in conformance with the approved
drainage plans. After determination by the director that all stormwater
facilities are constructed in compliance with the approved plans and that a
maintenance bond has been filed as required below, the city shall release the
construction bond. The construction bond shall be a noncancelable commitment
issued by a surety to the city (obligee) guaranteeing that the applicant and/or
the applicant's contractor will complete construction of the stormwater
facilities in compliance with the approved drainage plans and further
guaranteeing that all subcontractors, labor and material suppliers will be paid
leaving the project lien free.
   C.   Maintenance Bond: After satisfactory completion of the stormwater
facilities and release of the construction bond by the city, the applicant
shall commence a two (2) year period of satisfactory maintenance of the
stormwater facility. A cash deposit, in a form and content approved by the
director, to be used at the discretion of the director to correct deficiencies
in maintenance affecting public health, safety and welfare, must be posted and
maintained throughout the two (2) year maintenance period. The amount of the
cash deposit, and the form of any written instrument governing the same, shall

program or whenever there is cause to believe that a violation of this article
has been or is being committed through illicit connection, illicit discharge or
other means, or violation of the stormwater source control requirements, the
director is authorized to inspect during regular working hours and at other
reasonable times all public or private stormwater drainage systems within the
city to determine compliance with the provisions of this article.
   B.   Procedures: Prior to making any inspections, the director shall present
identification credentials, state the reason for the inspection and request
entry.

unoccupied, the inspector shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the
owner or other person(s) having charge or control of the property or portions
of the property and request entry.
      2.   If after reasonable effort, the inspector is unable to locate the
owner or other person(s) having charge or control of the property, and has
reason to believe the condition of the stormwater drainage system creates an
imminent hazard to persons or property, the inspector may enter.
      3.   The director may inspect the stormwater drainage system without
consent, if:
         a.   The inspection can be conducted while remaining on public
property or other property on which permission to enter is obtained; or
         b.   A warrant has been lawfully issued.
   C.   Inspection Schedule: The director shall establish a master inspection
and maintenance schedule to inspect appropriate stormwater facilities that are
not owned by the city. Critical stormwater facilities may require a more
frequent inspection schedule.
   D.   Inspection And Maintenance Records: As existing stormwater facilities
or operational source control BMPs are encountered, they shall be added to the
master inspection and maintenance schedule. For existing business or activities
in Chapter 9-5A-9.J.1 Table 1 permitted prior to August 1, 2022, documentation
shall be prepared and retained supporting the basis of the selected operational
control BMPs required per Chapter 9-5A-9.J.3 OMC. Records of new stormwater
facilities shall include the following:
      1.   As built plans and locations;
      2.   Findings of fact from any exemption granted by the local government;
      3.   Operation and maintenance requirements and records of inspections,
maintenance actions and frequencies; and
      4.   Engineering reports, as appropriate.
   E.   Reporting Requirements: The director shall report annually to the
utility committee of the city council about the status of the inspections. The
annual report may include, but need not be limited to, the proportion of the

resources needed to comply with the schedule, and comparisons with previous
years.
   F.   Illicit Connections, Illicit Discharges, Or Stormwater Source Control
Violations:
      1.   Access For Inspection: Access to the following shall be obtained by
the city in accordance with the provisions of this section:
         a.   Areas known or thought to contain illicit connections or illicit
discharges or activities contributing to illicit discharges or stormwater
source control violations; and
         b.   Locations identified through the city’s illicit discharge
detection and elimination program as documented in the stormwater management

that orders the cessation of any activity that is in violation of this article
or any prohibition upon an illicit connection or illicit discharge or
stormwater source control violation pursuant to article A of this chapter,
whether occurring on public or private property. The director shall have
authority to include in the civil regulatory order, or to issue and serve in a
separate civil regulatory order, an order to take corrective action to bring
any noncompliant activity, structure, or condition into compliance with this
article. The director shall have the authority to serve a person responsible
for the violation a civil regulatory order if an action is being undertaken in
violation of this article, or for any prohibition upon an illicit connection or
illicit discharge or stormwater source control pursuant to article A of this
chapter.
      1.   Posting And Notice: The director shall prominently post a civil
regulatory order at the subject property and shall make reasonable attempts to
serve the civil regulatory order pursuant to section
1-13-7 of this code.
      2.   Effect: When a civil regulatory order has been posted on the subject
property or otherwise served in accordance with subsection G1 of this section,
it is a violation of this article for any person with actual or constructive
knowledge of the order to conduct any activity or work upon the subject
property prohibited by the order until such time as the director has removed or
authorized removal of the order. It is further a violation of this article for
any person to fail to take corrective action, as required by the director in
the stop work/corrective action order, to bring the unlawful activity or
condition into compliance with this article.
      3.   Effective Date: The civil regulatory order issued under this section
shall become effective immediately upon the earlier of posting on the subject
project or receipt by the person to whom the order is directed.
      4.   Extension: Upon written request received prior to the correction

person other than the director, to remove, relocate, alter, conceal, damage,
deface or destroy a civil regulatory order posted on the subject property
pursuant to this subsection.
      6.   Compliance: Failure to comply with the terms of a civil regulatory
order, including timely completion of requirements for taking corrective

(Ord. 911, 8-31-2011; amd. Ord. 2022-1098, 7-27-2022)
9-5B-12: ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT/PENALTY:
   A.   Monetary Penalties: Any person in violation of this article, or any
prohibition upon an illicit connection or illicit discharge or stormwater
source control violation pursuant to article A of this chapter, may, in
addition to any other penalty imposed pursuant to this article, be subject to
monetary penalties per day or portion thereof for each civil violation.
Monetary penalties imposed, or to be imposed shall be specified in the notice
of violation.
   B.   Penalty: Except as may be otherwise set forth herein, the monetary
penalty assessed shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for
each such day that a violation occurs or continues to occur. The monetary
penalty constitutes a personal obligation of the person to whom the notice of
violation is directed. The maximum monetary penalty for each violation may be
trebled for:
      1.   Repeat violation, which means an additional violation of a
requirement of this article for which the responsible party has previously
received a notice of civil violation and failed to correct the violation by the
compliance date;
      2.   A violation resulting in physical harm to persons or to private or
public property;
      3.   A knowing or deliberate violation;
      4.   A violation resulting from gross negligence or reckless conduct.
   C.   Collection Of Penalty: The city attorney, on behalf of the city, is
authorized to collect the monetary penalty by use of appropriate legal
remedies, the seeking or granting of which shall neither stay nor terminate
accrual of additional per diem monetary penalties so long as the violation
continues.
   D.   Failure To Pay Penalty: Failure to timely pay a monetary penalty
imposed herein shall be and constitute a misdemeanor.
   E.   Correction Of Violation: Payment of a monetary penalty pursuant to this
subsection does not relieve a person of the duty to cease the unlawful activity
or correct the violation as ordered by the director.
   F.   Application For Remission Or Mitigation: Any person incurring a
monetary penalty may apply in writing for remission or mitigation of such
penalty pursuant to section
1-13-6 of this code. The decision may be appealed to the superior court of
Pierce County pursuant to the standards set forth in chapter 36.70C Revised
Code Of Washington.
   G.   Penalties Due: Monetary penalties imposed under this section shall
become due and payable pursuant to section
1-13-6 of this code. Whenever an application for remission or mitigation is
made, penalties shall become due and payable thirty (30) days after receipt of
the decision regarding the remission or mitigation. Whenever an appeal of a
monetary penalty is filed, the penalty shall become due and payable after all
review proceedings and a final decision has been issued confirming all or part
of the penalty. If the amount of a penalty owed the city is not paid within the
time specified, the city may take actions necessary to recover such penalty.
   H.   Voluntary Correction Agreement:
      1.   Initiation: Either the person responsible for the violation or the
director may initiate negotiations for a voluntary correction agreement at any
time pursuant to section
1-13-5 of this code and the requirements of this subsection H. The director has
no obligation to enter into any voluntary correction agreement.
      2.   Contents: A voluntary correction agreement shall set forth actions
to be taken by the responsible party that will correct past or existing
violations of this article, or any prohibition upon an illicit connection or
illicit discharge or stormwater source control violation pursuant to article A
of this chapter. It may also set forth actions to mitigate the impacts of
violations. The voluntary correction agreement shall set forth a schedule for
completion of the corrective and mitigating actions. It shall contain a
provision allowing the director to inspect the premises to determine compliance
with the voluntary compliance agreement.
      3.   Effect Of Voluntary Compliance Agreement:
         a.   A voluntary compliance agreement is a binding contract between
the party executing it and the city. It is not enforceable by any other party.
All voluntary compliance agreements shall provide that the responsible party
agrees the city may perform the actions set forth in the voluntary compliance
agreement if the responsible party fails to do so according to the terms and
schedule of the agreement, and the responsible party will pay the costs,
expenses, and damages the city incurs in performing the actions. By entering
into a voluntary compliance agreement, a responsible party admits the violation
and waives the right to an administrative appeal of the stop work/corrective
action order.
         b.   Monetary penalties may be reduced or waived if violations are
corrected or mitigated according to the terms and schedule of a voluntary
correction agreement. If the responsible party fails to perform according to
the terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance agreement, penalties for
each violation addressed in the agreement may be assessed starting from the
date the violation occurred.
      4.   Modification: The terms and schedule of the voluntary compliance
agreement may be modified by mutual agreement of the responsible party and the
director if circumstances or conditions outside the responsible party's
control, or unknown at the time the agreement was made, or other just cause
necessitate such modifications.
   I.   Adherence Required: If the voluntary correction agreement or civil
regulatory order is not adhered to, the city may provide such actions as needed
to repair, restore, or maintain the stormwater drainage system. If at any time
the city determines that the existing stormwater drainage system creates any
eminent threat to public health or welfare, the city may take immediate
measures to remedy said threat. No notice to the owner of the facility shall be
required under such circumstances.
   J.   Responsibility For Cost: The owner and persons in control of stormwater
facilities are responsible for the cost of any maintenance and for repairs to
the stormwater facility. Such responsibility shall include reimbursement to
city within thirty (30) days of the receipt of the invoice for any such work
performed by or on behalf of the city. Overdue payments will require payment of
interest at the current legal rate for liquidated judgments. If legal action
ensues, any costs or fees incurred by city will be borne by the parties
responsible for said reimbursements.
   K.   Failure To Pay Costs: In the event owner or person in control of the
subject property fails to pay the city within thirty (30) days from the date
that the costs were incurred, the city shall have the right to file a lien
against the real property for all charges and expenses incurred. A lien
specifying the expenses incurred and giving a legal description of the premises
sought to be charged shall be filed with the county auditor within ninety (90)
days from the date of the completion of the work. The same may at any time
thereafter be collected in the manner provided for foreclosure of mechanic's
liens under the laws of the state of Washington.
   L.   Businesses or activities that were permitted prior to August 1, 2022
and are identified in Chapter
 9-5A-9.J.1 Table 1 for which source control BMPs were not previously required
shall be subject to the full provisions of Chapter
9-5B-12 and in full compliance with Chapter
9-5A-9.J OMC by January 1, 2023. (Ord. 911, 8-31-2011; amd. Ord. 2022-1098, 7-

this article, unless the context clearly requires otherwise. (Ord. 911, 8-31-
2011)
9-5C-2: CREATION AND OWNERSHIP:
There is hereby created and established pursuant to Revised Code Of Washington
35A.80 and 35.67, a stormwater and surface water utility to be known as the
stormwater management utility. All references to the "utility" in this article
refer to the stormwater management utility. The utility will have primary
authority and responsibility for carrying out the city's comprehensive drainage
and storm sewer plan, including responsibilities for planning, design,
construction, maintenance, administration, and operation of all city stormwater
and surface water facilities, as well as establishing standards for design,
construction, and maintenance of improvements on private property where these
may affect stormwater and surface water and management. (Ord. 697, 8-14-1997)
9-5C-3: RATE POLICY:
   A.   It shall be the policy of the city that the rate structure to be
applied in establishing the amount of service charges and general facilities
charges assessed against each parcel of developed real property within the
boundaries of the utility shall be based upon the amount of impervious ground
cover contained within each parcel of property as measured by section
9-5C-4 of this article, except for those properties set forth in section
9-5C-7 of this article.
   B.   It shall be the policy of the city that the rate structure to be
applied in establishing the amount of service charges assessed against each
parcel of undeveloped real property within the boundaries of the utility shall
be based upon acre units per parcel. (Ord. 829, 6-14-2006)
9-5C-4: CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY:
The utility shall measure the impervious ground cover of each parcel of
developed real property within the boundaries of the utility to determine the
number of equivalent residential units contained therein; two thousand five
hundred (2,500) square feet, or less, of impervious ground cover shall equal
one equivalent residential unit. All detached single-family residences and
mobile homes are deemed to contain one equivalent residential unit. For all
other developed real properties within the utility boundaries, the utility
shall determine the number of equivalent residential units contained thereon by
dividing the number of square feet of impervious ground cover on each property
by two thousand five hundred (2,500); the total thus obtained will be rounded
to the nearest whole number representing the equivalent residential unit. (Ord.
697, 8-14-1997)
9-5C-5: UNDEVELOPED REAL PROPERTY:
In accordance with the policy established in subsection
 9-5C-3B of this article that the service charges for undeveloped real property
be determined by the amount of acre units contained on each parcel, the utility
shall determine the acreage of each parcel of undeveloped real property within
the boundaries of the utility to determine the number of acres contained
therein; forty three thousand five hundred sixty (43,560) square feet or less,
of undeveloped real property shall equal one acre unit. For all undeveloped
real property within the utility boundaries, the utility shall determine the
number of equivalent acreage units contained thereon by dividing the number of
square feet of undeveloped real property on each parcel by forty three thousand
five hundred sixty (43,560); the total thus obtained will be rounded to the
nearest whole number representing the equivalent acreage unit. (Ord. 697, 8-14-
1997)
9-5C-6: SERVICE CHARGE RATES:
   A.   In accordance with the rate structure set forth in sections
9-5C-2 and
9-5C-3 of this article, there is hereby levied upon all developed and
undeveloped real property within the boundaries of the utility service area
located in the city, a monthly service charge as established by ordinance of
the city council.
   B.   For all undeveloped real property within the boundaries of the utility,
except for exempt property as set forth in section
9-5C-7 of this article, the monthly service charge shall be multiplied by the
number of equivalent acreage units determined by the utility to be contained in
such parcel pursuant to section
9-5C-5 of this article. (Ord. 936A, 1-9-2013, eff. 1-17-2013)
9-5C-7: PROPERTY EXEMPT FROM SERVICE CHARGES:
The following special categories of property are exempt from service charges
and system development charges:
   A.   City street rights of way, all of which are a part of the system
pursuant to the plan.
   B.   State of Washington highway rights of way, so long as the state shall
agree to maintain, construct, and improve all drainage facilities contained
within such rights of way as required by the utility in conformance with all
utility standards for maintenance, construction, and improvement hereafter
established by the utility and so far as such maintenance, construction, and
improvements shall be achieved at no cost to the utility or to the city.
   C.   All foothills trail rights of way so long as each trail right of way
drainage facility is as required by the utility and in conformance with all
utility standards for the maintenance, construction, and improvements of such
facilities hereafter established by the utility, at no cost to the utility or
to the city, and so long as the city, on behalf of the utility, has a perpetual
easement for the purposes of storm drainage over the entire trail right of way
within the boundaries of the utility.
   D.   Those lands designated as stormwater receiving areas. (Ord. 697, 8-14-
1997)
9-5C-8: GENERAL FACILITIES CHARGE:
   A.   Assessment And Collection Of Charge: Every applicant for a new
connection to the stormwater system of the city and every applicant for a
project permit to develop undeveloped real property, or a portion thereof,
shall pay a stormwater utility general facilities charge to be established
pursuant to Revised Code Of Washington 35.92.025 and 35.67.020. The general
facilities charge shall be assessed against, and shall be collected from the
owners of, each parcel of real property or portion to be changed from an
undeveloped to a developed state, or for which a new connection is to be made.
Such general facilities charge shall be assessed for the purposes of assessing
against such previously undeveloped property or portion thereof and such real
property or portion thereof to which a new connection is made, a proportionate
share of the utility's historic capital costs that provide a benefit to each
subsequently developed property or portion thereof, or to each property or
portion thereof subject to a new connection, in order that such property or
portion thereof may bear its fair share of the cost of the utility.
   B.   Determination Of Amount To Be Charged: The general facilities charge
shall be assessed in an amount determined by multiplying the base charge as
established from time to time by the total number of equivalent residential
units contained on that property or portion of property being altered from an
undeveloped to a developed condition, which number shall not be less than one
and shall be determined by the utility at the time of the assessment. Provided
that, general facilities charges that have been paid as a result of prior
development activities on the property, or portion thereof, or through
participation in an LID or ULID shall not be reassessed.
   C.   Payment Of Charge Required: Except as may be otherwise provided in a
binding development agreement or other agreement between the city and property
owner, the general facilities charge shall be assessed and must be paid:
      1.   For a connection or development of property not associated with
development of the property or portion therefor pursuant to an approved
subdivision, a planned unit development, or a binding site plan, at the time a
building, connection or construction permit is issued by the city authorizing
development of the property or a new connection to the stormwater system;
      2.   For a subdivision, at the time of submission of a completed
application for final plat approval;
      3.   For a binding site plan, at the time of submission of a completed
application for approval of the binding site plan; and
      4.   For a planned unit development, prior to and as a condition of final
plan approval for each phase of the planned unit development; provided that, if
the property is to be subdivided by a subdivision or short subdivision, at the
time of submission of a completed application for final plat or short plat
approval.
   D.   Equitable Adjustment Of General Facilities Charges: There is hereby
established an equitable adjustment to the general facilities charges
applicable to the applicant, or applicant's successor, for a subdivision,
planned unit development or binding site plan pursuant to subsection A of this
section, to be known as the "general facilities equitable adjustment charge".
The general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall be paid at the time of
building permit issuance based upon the number of equivalent residential units
assigned to the building/facility/improvements to be constructed under the
building permit. The amount of the general facilities equitable adjustment
charge shall be calculated for each equivalent residential unit as follows:
The difference between the rate for the general facilities charge effective
upon the date that the completed application for the building permit is filed
and the rate for the general facilities charge effective at the time of the
assessment of the general facilities charge, or if prepaid, at the time of
payment. In the event that there has been no increase in the rate for the
general facilities charge between the date of the assessment of the general
facilities charge, or if prepaid, the date of payment, and the date the
completed building permit application is filed, the equitable adjustment will
be zero. In the event that there has been a decrease in the rate for the
general facilities charge between the date of the assessment of the general
facilities charge, or if prepaid, at the time of payment, and the date the
completed building permit application is filed, the equitable adjustment will
be zero. For purposes of this section, prepaid shall mean general facilities
charges paid prior to the date of assessment.
Payment of the general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall be a
precondition to issuance of the building permit and to approval of a service
connection to the stormwater system; provided that, the applicant and the city
may agree to a different schedule or method for payment of the general
facilities equitable adjustment charge pursuant to a development agreement or
other binding agreement between the city and the property owner relating to
development of the property.
   E.   Application Of General Facilities Equitable Adjustment Charge: General
facilities charges are intended to ensure that historic costs of stormwater
system development are equitably shared by property owners who have not
contributed to the costs of system development to the extent such property is
benefited by the stormwater system. General facilities charges assessed upon
final plat, planned unit development or binding site plan approval will not
include costs of stormwater system development, if any, incurred after such
assessment but prior to issuance of the building permit. The general facilities
equitable adjustment charge is therefore intended to apply to all applicants,
and their successors, who have paid general facilities charges pursuant to
subsections A through C of this section, whether or not paid before or after
the effective date hereof; provided that, the provisions in this subsection are
not intended to and shall not be construed to amend or alter the provisions set
forth in a binding development agreement or other binding agreement between the
city and the property owner relating to development of the property.
   F.   Exception: Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection E of this
section, the stormwater general facilities equitable adjustment charge shall
not apply to any property, or portion thereof, for which general facilities
charges were paid pursuant to an application for a subdivision, planned unit
development or binding site plan, which property, or any portion thereof, was
developed pursuant to a building permit issued on or before the later of: 1)
June 16, 2013; or 2) two (2) years following the date of assessment of the
general facilities charge. (Ord. 907, 6-29-2011)
9-5C-9: COLLECTION:
   A.   All service charges, general facilities charges, and all other fees or
charges hereafter established by ordinance of the city council shall be deemed
to be levied upon the premises themselves.
   B.   The city shall have a lien for all delinquent and unpaid charges and
fees for stormwater purposes, including, without limitation, service charges
and general facilities charges, assessed against all premises to which service
was furnished, which lien shall have the superiority established by Revised
Code Of Washington 35.67.200 and shall be foreclosed in the manner provided in
Revised Code Of Washington 35.67.220 et seq. (Ord. 843, 1-31-2007)
   C.   The base general facilities charge for each equivalent residential unit
and any additional surcharges shall be set by ordinance or resolution of the
city council. (Ord. 2016-1002, 12-14-2016, eff. 1-1-2017)
9-5C-10: ANNUAL REVIEW OF CHARGES AND FEES:
The charges and fees established by ordinance of the city council shall be
reviewed annually by the utility. Subsequent to such review, the utility shall
present to the city council a yearly budget for the utility and proposed
amendments to any rates and charges necessary to enable the city to pay all
costs to be incurred by the utility. (Ord. 829, 6-14-2006)
9-5C-11: EFFECTIVE DATE OF SERVICE CHARGE:
The service charge herein established shall apply to all developed property
within the utility, as provided herein on or after January 1, 1998, and shall
be billed beginning in February 1998. (Ord. 697, 8-14-1997)

further disturbance to those remains. The area of the find shall be secured and
protected from further disturbance until the State provides notice to proceed.
The discovery of human skeletal remains shall be reported to the county medical
examiner/coroner and local law enforcement in the most expeditious manner
possible. The remains shall not be touched, moved, or further disturbed. The
county medical examiner/coroner shall assume jurisdiction over the human
skeletal remains and make a determination of whether those remains are forensic
or non-forensic. If the county medical examiner/coroner determines the remains
are non-forensic, then they shall report that finding to the Department of
Archaeology and Historic Preservation (DAHP) who shall then take jurisdiction
over the remains. The DAHP shall notify any appropriate cemeteries and all
affected tribes of the find. The State Physical Anthropologist shall make a
determination of whether the remains are Indian or Non-Indian and report that
finding to any appropriate cemeteries and the affected tribes. The DAHP shall
handle all consultation with the affected parties as to the future
preservation, excavation, and disposition of the remains.

and beneficial biological and physical functions that benefit the city and its
residents; certain critical areas may also pose a threat to human safety or to
public and private property. By limiting development and alteration of these
critical areas, this chapter seeks to:
   A.   Protect members of the public and public resources and facilities from
injury, loss of life, or property damage due to flooding, erosion, volcanic
eruptions, landslides, seismic events, or steep slope failures;
   B.   Protect unique, fragile and valuable elements of the environment,
including wildlife and its habitat;
   C.   Mitigate unavoidable impacts to environmentally critical areas by
regulating alterations in and adjacent to critical areas;
   D.   Prevent cumulative adverse environmental impacts to water quality and
wetlands;
   E.   Meet the requirements of the Washington growth management act 1  with
regard to the protection of critical area lands;

deposits and acidic waters. Vegetation includes sedges, sphagnum moss, shrubs
and trees.
BUFFER OR BUFFER AREA: A naturally vegetated and undisturbed or revegetated
zone surrounding a critical area that protects the critical area from adverse
impacts to its integrity and value, or is an integral part of the resource's
ecosystem.

operation and maintenance of existing ditches or irrigation systems; changes
from one type of agricultural activity to another agricultural activity; and
normal maintenance, repair, and operation of existing serviceable structures,
facilities, or improved areas. Activities which bring a nonagricultural area
into agricultural use are not part of an ongoing operation. An operation ceases
to be ongoing when the area on which it is conducted is converted to a
nonagricultural use or has lain idle for more than five (5) years.
FACULTATIVE WETLAND PLANTS: Plants that occur usually (estimated probability
greater than 67 percent to 99 percent) in wetlands, but also occur (estimated
probability 1 percent to 33 percent) in nonwetlands.
FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT CONSERVATION: Land management for maintaining
populations of species in suitable habitats within their natural geographic
distribution so that the habitat available is sufficient to support viable
populations over the long term and isolated subpopulations are not created.
This does not mean maintaining all individuals of all species at all times, but
it does mean not degrading or reducing populations or habitats so that they are
no longer viable over the long term. Counties and cities should engage in
cooperative planning and coordination to help assure long term population
viability.
Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas contribute to the state's
biodiversity and occur on both publicly and privately owned lands. Designating
these areas is an important part of land use planning for appropriate
development densities, urban growth area boundaries, open space corridors, and
incentive based land conservation and stewardship programs.
FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT CONSERVATION AREAS: Areas that serve a critical role
in sustaining needed habitats and species for the functional integrity of the
ecosystem, and which, if altered, may reduce the likelihood that the species
will persist over the long term. These areas may include, but are not limited
to, rare or vulnerable ecological systems, communities, and habitat or habitat
elements including seasonal ranges, breeding habitat, winter range, and
movement corridors; and areas with high relative population density or species
richness. Counties and cities may also designate locally important habitats and
species.
FISH HABITAT: Habitat that is used by fish at any life stage at any time of the
year, including potential habitat likely to be used by fish that could be
recovered by restoration or management and includes off channel habitat.
FLOOD HAZARD AREAS: Those areas subject to inundation by the base flood. These
areas consist of the following components, as determined by the city:
   A.   Floodplain: The total area subject to inundation by the base flood.

floodplain that is necessary to contain and discharge the base flood flow
without increasing the base flood elevation more than one foot (1').
FORESTED WETLAND: A wetland with at least twenty percent (20%) of the surface
area covered by woody vegetation greater than twenty feet (20') in height.
GEOLOGIC HAZARD AREAS: Lands or areas characterized by geologic, hydrologic,
and topographic conditions that render them susceptible to potentially
significant or severe risk of landslides, erosion, or volcanic or seismic
activity.
GRADING: Any excavating, filling, clearing, leveling, or contouring of the
ground surface by human or mechanical means.
GROUNDWATER: All water found beneath the ground surface, including slow moving
subsurface water present in aquifers and recharge areas.

concentration as to pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human
health, wildlife, or the environment because such wastes or constituents or
combinations of such wastes:
      1.   Have short lived, toxic properties that may cause death, injury, or
illness or have mutagenic, teratogenic, or carcinogenic properties; or
      2.   Are corrosive, explosive, flammable, or may generate pressure
through decomposition or other means.
   B.   "Extremely hazardous waste" means any waste which:
      1.   Will persist in a hazardous form for several years or more at a

Orting region and which can be expected to naturally occur on a site. Native
vegetation does not include noxious weeds.
NOXIOUS WEED 1 : Any plant which, when established, is highly destructive,
competitive, or difficult to control by cultural or chemical practices. The
state noxious weed list in chapter 16-750 is the officially adopted list of
noxious weeds by the state noxious weed control board.

probability greater than 99 percent) in wetlands under natural conditions, but
which may also occur rarely (estimated probability less than 1 percent) in
nonwetlands.
PRIORITY HABITAT: A habitat type with unique or significant value to one or
more species. An area classified and mapped as priority habitat must have one
or more of the following attributes:
   A.   Comparatively high fish and wildlife density;
   B.   Comparatively high fish and wildlife species diversity;
   C.   Important fish and wildlife breeding habitat;

species are those native fish and wildlife species legally designated as
endangered (WAC 232-12-014), threatened (WAC 232-12-011), or sensitive (WAC
232-12-011). State candidate species are those fish and wildlife species that
will be reviewed by the department of fish and wildlife (POL-M-6001) for
possible listing as endangered, threatened, or sensitive according to the
process and criteria defined in Washington administrative code 232-12-297.
Federal candidate species are evaluated individually to determine their status
in Washington and whether inclusion as a priority species is justified.
   B.   Criterion 2: Vulnerable aggregations. Vulnerable aggregations include
those species or groups of animals susceptible to significant population
declines, within a specific area or statewide, by virtue of their inclination
to congregate. Examples include heron rookeries, seabird concentrations, marine

water streams from receding glaciers.
SALMONID FISH USE: Those waters used by salmonid or anadromous fish for
spawning, rearing or migration. If salmonid fish use has not been determined,
salmonid fish use shall be presumed for waters having the following
characteristics:
   A.   Stream segments having a defined channel of two feet (2') or greater
within the bankfull width and having a gradient of sixteen percent (16%) or
less;
   B.   Stream segments having a defined channel or two feet (2') or greater

make them incapable of supporting fish; or
   B.   Sufficient information is available to support a departure from the
characteristics of this definition, as determined in consultation with the
department of fish and wildlife, affected tribes and interested parties.
SEISMIC HAZARD AREAS: Areas that, due to a combination of soil and groundwater
conditions, are subject to severe risk of ground shaking, subsidence, or
liquefaction of soils during earthquakes. These areas are typically underlain
by soft or loose saturated soils (such as alluvium), have a shallow groundwater
table and are typically located on the floors of river valleys. Geologic
material is weighted most heavily in the following classification of seismic
risk:
   A.   Class I/high: All areas with lands designated as alluvium and

game species.
SPECIES, PRIORITY: Any fish or wildlife species requiring protective measures
and/or management guidelines to ensure their persistence as genetically viable
population levels as classified by the department of fish and wildlife,
including endangered, threatened, sensitive, candidate and monitor species, and
those of recreational, commercial, or tribal importance.
SPECIES, THREATENED: Any fish or wildlife species that is likely to become an
endangered species within the foreseeable future throughout a significant
portion of its range without cooperative management or removal of threats, and
is listed by the state or federal government as a threatened species.
TEMPORARY EROSION CONTROL: On site and off site control measures that are
needed to control conveyance or deposition of earth, turbidity, or pollutants
during development, construction, or restoration.
UTILITY LINE: Pipe, conduit, cable or other similar facility by which services
are conveyed to the public or individual recipients. Such services shall
include, but are not limited to, water supply, electric power, gas,
communications and sanitary sewers.
VOLCANIC HAZARD AREAS: Areas that are subject to pyroclastic flows, lava flows,
and inundation by debris flows, mudflows, or related flooding resulting from
geologic and volcanic activity on Mount Rainier. Areas at risk to volcanic
hazards from Mount Rainier are classified as follows:
   A.   High: Valley floor areas in which there could be a high degree of
danger from mudflows of similar magnitude to the electron mudflow (as
identified in "map showing potential hazards from future eruptions of Mount
Rainier, WA, USGS").
   B.   Moderate: Valley floor areas which could be covered by a mudflow as
large as the electron mudflow, in valleys in which mudflows have been
relatively frequent (as identified in "map showing potential hazards from
future eruptions of Mount Rainier, WA, USGS").
   C.   Low: Valley floor areas which could be covered by a mudflow of similar
magnitude to the electron mudflow, in valleys where mudflows have been
relatively infrequent, and areas in the other valleys which might be subject to
flooding (as identified in "map showing potential hazards from future eruptions
of Mount Rainier, WA, USGS").
WETLAND: Areas that are inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater
at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal
circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life
in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs,
and similar areas. Wetlands do not include those artificial wetlands
intentionally created from nonwetland sites, including, but not limited to,
irrigation and drainage ditches, grass lined swales, canals, detention
facilities, wastewater treatment facilities, farm ponds, and landscape
amenities, or those wetlands created after July 1, 1990, that were
unintentionally created as a result of the construction of a road, street, or
highway. Wetlands may include those artificial wetlands intentionally created
from nonwetland areas created to mitigate conversion of wetlands.

council in accordance with the procedures set forth in title 13 of this code,
zoning. In granting such a variance, the city council, after review and
recommendation by the planning commission, shall find:
   A.   Because of the special circumstances applicable to the subject
property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, or the
size or nature of the critical area, the strict application of this title would
deprive the property owner of reasonable use of their property;
   B.   The granting of the variance is the minimum necessary to accommodate
the development proposal and will not be materially detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zone
in which the property is situated, or contrary to the goals and purposes of
this title. (1973 Code § 15.28.010)

      2.   Removal Of Vegetation Within The Buffer: Removal or alteration of
existing vegetation in the buffer areas shall be prohibited or limited as
necessary to preserve the wetland. Any disturbance of the buffer area shall be
replanted with a diverse plant community of native vegetation appropriate for
the site and approved by the city.
      3.   Buffer Averaging: The city administrator may allow modification of
the standard wetland buffer width in accordance with an approved critical area
report and the best available science on a case by case basis by averaging
buffer widths. Averaging of buffer widths may only be allowed where a qualified
wetlands professional demonstrates that:
         a.   It will not reduce wetland functions or values;
         b.   The wetland contains variations in sensitivity due to existing
physical characteristics or the character of the buffer varies in slope, soils,
or vegetation, and the wetland would benefit from a wider buffer in places and
would not be adversely impacted by a narrower buffer in other places;
         c.   The total area contained in the buffer area after averaging is no
less than that which would be contained within the standard buffer; and
         d.   The buffer width is not reduced to less than seventy five percent
(75%) of the standard width.
   D.   Wetland Mitigation And Restoration:
      1.   Mitigation: All adverse impacts to wetlands shall be mitigated to
the extent feasible and reasonable. Mitigation actions by an applicant or
property owner shall occur in the following preferred sequence:
         a.   Avoiding the impact altogether by not taking certain actions or
parts of actions;
         b.   Minimizing impacts by limiting the degree or magnitude of the
action and its implementation;
         c.   Rectifying the impact by repairing, rehabilitating, or restoring
the affected environment;
         d.   Reducing or eliminating the impact over time by preservation and
maintenance operations during the life of the action;
         e.   Compensating for the impact by replacing or providing substitute
resources or environments; and/or
         f.   Monitoring the impact and taking appropriate corrective measures.
      2.   Monitoring Program And Contingency Plan: A monitoring program shall
be implemented by the applicant to determine the success of the mitigation
project and any necessary corrective actions. This program shall determine if
the original goals and objectives are being met.
         a.   A contingency plan shall be established for indemnity in the
event that the mitigation project is inadequate or fails. A performance and
maintenance bond or other acceptable security device financial guarantee is
required to ensure the applicant's compliance with the terms of the mitigation
agreement. The amount of the performance and maintenance bond shall equal one
hundred twenty five percent (125%) of the cost of the mitigation project for a
minimum of five (5) years. The bond may be reduced in proportion to work
successfully completed over the period of the bond. The bonding period shall
coincide with the monitoring period.
         b.   Monitoring programs prepared to comply with this section shall
reflect the following guidelines:
            (1)   Scientific procedures shall be used to establish the success
or failure of the project.
            (2)   For vegetation determinations, permanent sampling points
shall be established.
            (3)   Vegetative success shall, at a minimum, equal eighty percent
(80%) survival of planted trees and shrubs and eighty percent (80%) cover of
desirable understory or emergent plant species at the end of the required
monitoring period. Additional standards for vegetative success, including, but
not limited to, minimum survival standards following the first growing season,
may be required after consideration of a report prepared by a qualified
consultant.
            (4)   Monitoring reports on the current status of the mitigation
project shall be submitted to the city.
            (5)   The reports are to be prepared by a qualified consultant and
reviewed by the city or a consultant retained by the city and should include
monitoring information on wildlife, vegetation, water quality, water flow,
stormwater storage and conveyance, and existing or potential degradation, as
applicable, and shall be produced on the following schedule: at the time of
construction; thirty (30) days after planting; early in the growing season of
the first year; at the end of the growing season of the first year; twice
during the second year; and annually thereafter.
            (6)   Monitoring programs shall be established for a minimum of
five (5) years.
            (7)   If necessary, failures in the mitigation project shall be
corrected.
            (8)   Dead or undesirable vegetation shall be replaced with
appropriate plantings.
            (9)   Damage caused by erosion, settling, or other geomorphological
processes shall be repaired.
            (10)   The mitigation project shall be redesigned (if necessary)
and the new design shall be implemented and monitored.
      3.   Mitigation Ratios:
         a.   Equivalent Areas: Where wetland alterations are permitted by the
city, the applicant shall create or enhance wetland areas to compensate for
wetland losses. Equivalent areas shall be determined according to acreage,
function, type, location, timing factors and projected success of restoration
or creation.
         b.   Acreage Replacement Ratio: When creating or enhancing wetlands,
the following acreage replacement ratios shall be used where the first number
specifies the acreage of replacement wetlands and the second number specifies
the acreage of wetlands altered:
 
                      Wetland Creation                  Wetland Enhancement
Wetland Type          Replacement Ratio  Rehabilitation Ratio (Area)
                      (Area)
Category I: Bogs,     Not considered     Case by case   Case by case
natural heritage site possible
Category I: Mature    6:1                12:1           24:1
forested
Category I: Based on  4:1                8:1            16:1
functions
Category II           3:1                6:1            12:1
Category III          2:1                4:1            8:1
Category IV           1.5:1              3:1            6:1
 
         c.   Increased Replacement Ratios: The city administrator may increase
the ratios under the following circumstances:
            (1)   Uncertainty exists as to the probable success of the proposed
restoration or creation;
            (2)   A significant period of time will elapse between impact and
replication of wetland functions;
            (3)   Proposed mitigation will result in a lower category wetland
or reduced functions relative to the wetland being impacted;
            (4)   The impact was an unauthorized impact; or
            (5)   Where mitigation is to occur off site.
      4.   Restoration: Restoration is required when a wetland or its buffer
has been altered in violation of this title. The following minimum performance
standards shall be met for the restoration of a wetland, provided that if it
can be demonstrated by the applicant that greater functional and habitat values
can be obtained, these standards may be modified:
         a.   The original wetland configuration should be replicated including
depth, width, and length at the original location;
         b.   The original soil types and configuration shall be replicated;
         c.   The wetland and buffer areas shall be replanted with native
vegetation which replicates the original in species, sizes and densities; and
         d.   The original functional values shall be restored, including water
quality and wildlife habitat functions.
      5.   Wetland Mitigation Actions: Mitigation shall be in the same drainage
basin as the altered wetland. Wetland mitigation actions shall be conducted in
the same subbasin unless a higher level of ecological functioning would result
from an alternate approach.
      6.   Wetland Mitigation Banks:
         a.   Credits from a wetland mitigation bank may be approved for use as
compensation for unavoidable impacts to wetlands when:
            (1)   The bank is certified under state rules;
            (2)   The administrator determines that the wetland mitigation bank
provides appropriate compensation for the authorized impacts; and
            (3)   The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and
conditions of the certified bank instrument.
         b.   Replacement ratios for projects using bank credits shall be
consistent with replacement ratios specified in the certified bank instrument.
         c.   Credits from a certified wetland mitigation bank may be used to
compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the
certified bank instrument. In some cases, the service area of the bank may
include portions of more than one adjacent drainage basin for specific wetland
functions.
      7.   In Lieu Fee: To aid in the implementation of off site mitigation,
the city may develop an in lieu fee program. This program shall be developed
and approved through a public process and be consistent with federal rules,
state policy on in lieu fee mitigation, and state water quality regulations. An
approved in lieu fee program sells compensatory mitigation credits to
permittees whose obligation to provide compensatory mitigation is then
transferred to the in lieu program sponsor, a governmental or nonprofit natural
resource management entity. Credits from an approved in lieu fee program may be
used when subsections D7a through D7f of this section apply:
         a.   The approval authority determines that it would provide
environmentally appropriate compensation for the proposed impacts.
         b.   The mitigation will occur on a site identified using the site
selection and prioritization process in the approved in lieu fee program
instrument.
         c.   The proposed use of credits is consistent with the terms and
conditions of the approved in lieu fee program instrument.
         d.   Land acquisition and initial physical and biological improvements
of the mitigation site must be completed within three (3) years of the credit
sale.
         e.   Projects using in lieu fee credits shall have debits associated
with the proposed impacts calculated by the applicant's qualified wetland
scientist using the method consistent with the credit assessment method
specified in the approved instrument for the in lieu fee program.
         f.   Credits from an approved in lieu fee program may be used to
compensate for impacts located within the service area specified in the
approved in lieu fee instrument.
   E.   Transfer Of Development Rights: If a site contains a regulated wetland
and/or buffer, a property owner may transfer residential development rights
from the regulated wetland and/or buffer to another site or sites within the
city. The transfer of development rights (TDR) shall meet the following
criteria:
      1.   The idea of transfer of development rights is based upon the legal
concept of property law that the right to develop real estate is one of the
"bundle of rights" included in fee simple ownership of land. Fee simple
ownership of real estate allows the owner to sell, lease, or trade any one or
all of the "bundle of rights" to his property which includes the right to use,
lease, sell, or abandon the property or any of its components of ownership not
retained by a previous owner such as mineral, oil, gas, air, and/or development
rights. These rights of ownership are subject to the limitation and legislative
powers of the local government.
      2.   A development right is a simple extension of the rights normally
associated with land ownership. When legally established, a development right
has value separate from the land itself. It can be subject to reasonable
regulation by local government under the police power. The development right
can be transferred by the owner, by means of gift or sale, to another property.
The landowner may sell the development rights and still retain the title to the
land and the right to use the surface of the land on a limited basis.
      3.   The planning commission shall consider the request for TDR at the
public hearing for the land use proposal for the receiving parcel.
      4.   To assure that the sending parcel is adequately protected, a
restriction shall be placed on the deed which expressly prohibits all regulated
activities within the wetland and/or buffer. This restriction shall be required
regardless of the number of dwelling units for which the development rights are
transferred. A memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the applicant and the city
shall be recorded with the city clerk. The MOA shall refer to all deed
restrictions related to the property.
      5.   If the wetland and/or buffer is degraded as a result of human or
agricultural activity, the applicant may be required to enhance the wetland
and/or buffer according to an enhancement plan approved by the planning
commission.
      6.   Except for required enhancement, the buffer and wetland shall remain
in a natural condition. This shall be indicated by a note on the face of any
final plat, final site plan, or other final approval for activity on the
sending site. In the case of a formal subdivision, the wetland and buffer shall
be placed in a separate tract.
      7.   TDR shall not exceed the number of dwelling units which would be
allowed on the sending parcel according to the zoning designation of the
sending parcel, if there were no development restrictions tied to wetland
areas. This number of dwelling units shall be equal to the number of dwelling
units that could be produced on the wetland and/or buffer if the sending parcel
were subdivided in terms of the minimum requirements of the underlying zone as
evidenced by a preliminary plan sketch.
      8.   TDR may go to more than one receiving parcel; however, this shall
not increase the total number of transferred dwelling units which are allowed.
      9.   The increased number of dwelling units on the receiving parcel shall
not be more than twenty five percent (25%) above the number of dwelling units
allowed according to the zoning designation on the receiving parcel(s).
      10.   TDR shall be allowed only if the land use proposal on the receiving
parcel(s) is designed in such a way that the increased density:
         a.   Is consistent with any land use plan associated with the
receiving parcel and with goals, purposes, and intents of the zoning
designation of the receiving parcel; and
         b.   Is compatible with the existing and likely future developments in
the vicinity; and
         c.   Adequately addresses infrastructure, natural and other
constraints, and does not result in significant environmental impacts.
      11.   TDR shall not be approved until final plat approval or other final
approval for the receiving parcel is granted by the city council. (Ord. 2016-
985, 7-13-2016)
11-4-2: LANDSLIDE HAZARD AREAS:
Development proposals on sites containing class I and class II landslide
hazards shall meet the following requirements:
   A.   Buffer Requirement: A buffer shall be established from all edges of
landslide hazard areas. The size of the buffer shall be determined by the city
administrator to eliminate or minimize the risk of property damage, death, or
injury resulting from landslides caused in whole or part by the development,
based upon review of and concurrence with a landslide hazard special study. The
buffer shall be equal to the height of the slope or fifty feet (50'), whichever
is greater. The buffer may be reduced when a qualified professional
demonstrates to the city administrator's satisfaction that the reduction will
adequately protect the proposed development, adjacent developments, and uses
and the subject critical area. The buffer may be increased where the city
administrator determines a larger buffer is necessary to prevent risk of damage
to proposed and existing development.
   B.   Alterations: Alterations of a landslide hazard area and/or buffer may
only occur for activities for which a hazards analysis is submitted and
certifies that:
      1.   The development will not increase surface water discharge or
sedimentation to adjacent properties beyond predevelopment conditions;
      2.   The development will not decrease slope stability on adjacent
properties; and
      3.   Such alterations will not adversely impact other critical areas.
   C.   Impervious Surface Ratio: An impervious surface ratio is a measurement
of the    amount of the site that is covered by any material that substantially
reduces or prevents the infiltration of stormwater into previously undeveloped
land. Impervious surfaces are defined in Title 9, Chapter 5A, Section 4 of this
code. The maximum impervious surface ratios for class I and class II landslide
hazard areas are set forth in table 2 of this section.
   D.   Native Vegetation: Native vegetation is plant species that are
indigenous and naturalized to the Orting region and which can be expected to
naturally occur on a site. Native vegetation does not include noxious weeds.
The minimum percentage of native vegetation that must be retained on sites
including class I or class II landslide hazard areas is set forth in table 2 of
this section.
TABLE 2
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE AND NATIVE VEGETATION REQUIREMENTS FOR LANDSLIDE HAZARD
AREAS
 
Landslide Hazard Class Maximum Impervious Surface Minimum Percentage Of Native
                       Ratio                      Vegetation Retained
      Class II   0.30                       65%
      Class I    0.20                       75%
 
   E.   Development Design:
      1.   Structures and improvements shall be clustered to retain as much
open space as possible and to preserve the natural topographic features of the
site.
      2.   Structures and improvements shall conform to the natural contour of
the slope.
      3.   Structures and improvements shall be located to preserve the most
critical portion of the site and its natural landforms and vegetation.
      4.   The use of retaining walls which allow the maintenance of existing
natural slope area is preferred over graded artificial slopes.
   F.   Additional Standards For Class I Landslide Hazards:
      1.   Alteration of class I landslide hazard areas is permitted only if
the development proposal can be designed so that the landslide hazard to the
project and the adjacent property is eliminated or mitigated and the
development proposal on that site is certified as safe by a geotechnical
engineer licensed in the state of Washington.
      2.   Development or alteration shall be prohibited on parcels with a lot
slope of greater than forty percent (40%). These parcels shall be eligible for
transfer of development rights as set forth in subsection G of this section.
   G.   Transfer Of Development Rights:
      1.   The idea of transfer of development rights is based upon the legal
concept of property law that the right to develop real estate is one of the
"bundle of rights" included in fee simple ownership of land. Fee simple
ownership of real estate allows the owner to sell, lease, or trade any one or
all of the "bundle of rights" to his property which includes the right to use,
lease, sell, or abandon the property or any of its components of ownership not
retained by a previous owner such as mineral, oil, gas, air, and/or development
rights. These rights of ownership are subject to the limitation and legislative
powers of the local government.
      2.   A development right is a simple extension of the rights normally
associated with land ownership. When legally established a development right
has value separate from the land itself. It can be subject to reasonable
regulation by local government under the police power. The development right
can be transferred by the owner, by means of gift or sale, to another property.
The landowner may sell the development rights and still retain the title to the
land and the right to use the surface of the land on a limited basis.
      3.   For the purposes of this chapter, the owner of any vacant and/or
undeveloped parcel of land with a lot slope of greater than forty percent (40%)
may transfer the development rights (TDR) allocated to the parcel of land to
any person at any time.
      4.   The planning commission shall consider the request for TDR at the
public hearing for the land use proposal for the receiving parcel.
      5.   To assure that the sending parcel is adequately protected, a
restriction shall be placed on the deed which expressly restricts the use of
said property in perpetuity to open space uses. The restriction shall be
required regardless of the number of dwelling units for which the development
rights are transferred. A memorandum of agreement (MOA) between the applicant
and the city shall be recorded with the city clerk. The MOA shall refer to all
deed restrictions related to the property.
      6.   TDR shall not exceed the number of dwelling units which would be
allowed on the sending parcel according to the zoning designation of the
sending parcel, if there were no development restrictions tied to steep slopes.
This number of dwelling units shall be equal to the number of dwelling units
that could be produced on the parcel if the sending parcel were subdivided in
terms of the minimum requirements of the underlying zone as evidenced by a
preliminary plan sketch.
      7.   TDR may go to more than one receiving parcel; however, this shall
not increase the total number of transferred dwelling units which are allowed.
      8.   The increased number of dwelling units on the receiving parcel shall
not be more than twenty five percent (25%) above the number of dwelling units
allowed according to the zoning designation on the receiving parcel(s).
      9.   TDR shall be allowed only if the land use proposal on the receiving
parcel(s) is designed in such a way that the increased density:
         a.   Is consistent with any land use plan associated with the
receiving parcel and with goals, purposes, and intents of the zoning
designation of the receiving parcel; and
         b.   Is compatible with the existing and likely future developments in
the vicinity; and
         c.   Adequately addresses infrastructure, natural and other
constraints, and does not result in significant environmental impacts.
      10.   TDR shall not be approved until final plat approval or other final
approval for the receiving parcel is granted by the city council.

11-4-3: EROSION HAZARD AREAS:
Alteration of a site containing a critical erosion hazard area shall meet the
following requirements:
   A.   All alteration proposals shall submit an erosion control plan
consistent with this section prior to receiving approval.
   B.   Clearing on erosion hazard areas is allowed from April 1 to November 1
only.
   C.   Only that clearing necessary to install temporary sedimentation and
erosion control measures shall occur prior to clearing for roadways or
utilities.
   D.   Clearing limits for roads, water, wastewater, and stormwater utilities,
and temporary erosion control facilities shall be marked in the field and
approved by Orting prior to any alteration of existing native vegetation.
   E.   The authorized clearing for roads and utilities shall be the minimum
necessary to accomplish project specific engineering designs and shall remain
within approved rights of way.

12-4-4: SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS FOR UNIT LOT SUBDIVISION:
   A.   Purpose: This subsection complies with RCW 58.17.060 as amended by the
state legislature in 2023 and sets out procedures for unit lot short
subdivisions. These procedures allow the division of a parent lot into nine (9)
or fewer separately owned unit lots. Portions of the parent lot not subdivided
for individual unit lots shall be owned in common by the owners of the
individual unit lots, or by a homeowners' association comprised of the owners
of the individual unit lots. A unit lot short subdivision provides for fee-
simple ownership of lots of which dwellings are place which can advance
affordable housing opportunities and increase housing options.
   B.   Applicability: The process for a unit lot short subdivision can be used
for existing development including duplexes, cottage developments, multifamily
attached dwellings such as townhouse developments, or a combination thereof.
The provisions of this section apply exclusively to the unit lot short
subdivision of land proposed to be developed with dwellings in which the
proposed building type and use is permitted. In all instances, unit lot short
subdivisions shall apply to the division or redivision of land into nine (9) or
fewer lots, tracts, parcels, sites or divisions for the purpose of sale, lease,
or transfer of ownership.

need not conform to the minimum lot area, minimum density, or dimensional
requirements, provided, however, that any structure located upon a unit lot
shall comply with the maximum building height requirements; provided further
that unit lot short subdivisions shall comply with the dimensional standards
set forth in OMC 12-4-4D2. The overall development of the parent parcel shall
meet the development and design standards of the underlying Land Use District.
      3.   Setbacks or buffers shall be required from any critical area or
shoreline features per Title 11 of this code.
      4.   Within the parent parcel, required parking for an attached
multifamily dwelling unit may be provided on a different unit lot than the lot
with the dwelling unit if the right to use that parking is formalized by an
easement or covenant recorded with the Pierce County auditor.
      5.   A unit lot subdivision shall make adequate provisions through
easements for ingress, egress, emergency services, and utilities access to and
from each unit lot created by reserving such common areas or other areas over,
under, and across the parent parcel as necessary to comply with all applicable
development standards. Such easements shall be recorded with the Pierce County
auditor.
      6.   Access easements, joint use agreements, covenants, and maintenance
agreements identifying the rights and responsibilities of property owners and
any homeowners association shall be established for the use and maintenance of
common garage, parking, and vehicle access areas, landscaping, underground
utilities, common open space, exterior building facades and roofs, any portions
of the parent parcel not subdivided for individual unit lots, and other similar
features, and shall be recorded with the Pierce County auditor.

public transportation, and architectural design review will be considerations
throughout master planning and development approvals for projects in this zone.
      2.   Master Development Plan Required: Development in the MUTCN (Mixed
Use Town Center North) requires approval of a master development plan that
shall include a planned unit development and an approved development agreement
with site specific design guidelines, and a parcel map if future phases are
anticipated. The development agreement shall set forth the conditions for
development, public improvements, and phasing, if applicable. The master
development plan approval process is a Type 4 permit per section
15-4-1 of this Code. All development and uses shall be in accordance with the
adopted master development plan. Provisions for allowed and conditional uses,
site specific locations of public streets, parks and open spaces, and design
standards described in this section shall be interpreted and modified as
appropriate during the master plan review and planned unit development approval
process based on evidence provided by the applicant.
      3.   Master Plan Elements: The master development plan shall contain, at
a minimum, the following:
         a.   A master site plan showing the location of:
            (1)   Buildings;
            (2)   Streets, alleys, and major driveways;
            (3)   Off street parking areas;
            (4)   Open spaces (plazas, squares, courtyards, permanent BMPs, and
other spaces intended for public enjoyment) based on the proposed uses and
whether they are intended to serve the public;
            (5)   Critical areas and buffers;
            (6)   Shorelines;
            (7)   Floodplains;
            (8)   Pedestrian walks and paths;

site plan approval and architectural design review per this title.
      4.   Principal Uses: Section
13-3-3, Table 1, of this chapter, shows the allowed principal and conditional
uses in the MUTCN Zone. Uses not listed are prohibited. All development within
the MUTCN is subject to Architectural Design Review.
      5.   Bulk And Dimensional Requirements: The following bulk and
dimensional requirements apply to the MUTCN district:
         a.   Non-Residential Space: A minimum of fifteen (15) acres of non-
residential uses (Commercial, Light Industrial and Light Manufacturing, with
associated streets, sidewalks, parking, and Cultural and/or Public Uses per OMC
13-3-3, Table 1) shall be located primarily along Washington Avenue N/SR 162,
and/or adjacent to Rocky Road, the Orting Wastewater Treatment Plant and/or the
Orting School District property per the adopted site master plan. Prior to
certificates of occupancy for up to every one hundred (100) residential
dwellings, a minimum of three thousand five hundred (3,500) square feet of
retail and/or office space along SR162 and a minimum of one thousand five
hundred (1,500) square feet of Light Industrial or Light Manufacturing
commercial uses shall be developed for commercial uses ready for tenant
improvement and occupancy. Retail development fronting on SR162 may be phased.
Initial commercial development shall start at the White Hawk Blvd/SR162
intersection and then move north and south.
         b.   Public Open Space: In addition to the required commercial plazas
and courtyards and the community open space required in this title, the
district shall contain a minimum of five (5) acres of useable open community
park space that is not part of a critical areas buffer or shoreline buffer,
required landscaping or perimeter buffering, part of a required easement, or
part of a stormwater facility. These five (5) acres of open community park
space may not be subdivided into more than two smaller tracts and subject to
the proportional size of the tax parcels. Public access to park space shall be
compliant with the American Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101, et seq.,
including wheelchair accessibility. Park equipment shall have ADA accessible
features including wheelchair accessibility. An ADA accessible pathway shall be
provided for access to the Carbon River levy. Development of this park space
with improvements shall be dedicated to the City for public access and use and
may be provided by the applicant, or may be financed by park impact fees paid
by the applicant. Exceptions to this provision may be granted when
circumstances make compliance infeasible or when a park impact fee is proposed,
pursuant to section
15-6-7 (B) of this code.
         c.   Residential Density: There shall be a maximum of twenty (20)
buildable acres allowed for residential construction including streets,
sidewalks and neighborhood parks and open space. The minimum residential
density is six (6) dwelling units per gross buildable acre. The maximum
residential density for any non-senior residential development parcel is twelve
(12) dwelling units per buildable acre. Buildable acreage does not include
critical areas or flood plain acreage. There shall be a mix of housing
including detached, attached, and multi-family units within the residential
acreage and avoidance of a segregation of housing types into specific areas.
Detached single family residences in the non-senior housing can only be Cottage
Housing per sections
13-2-4,
13-3-3,
13-5-1g of this code. Attached housing in non-senior housing must be three (3)
or more units.
      Senior housing minimum density is six (6) dwelling units per gross
buildable acre and a maximum of twenty (20) units per gross buildable acre.
Senior housing shall include a mix of housing including detached single family
residences, attached housing, and multifamily units. Residential uses over
retail uses in the same structure have no maximum density restrictions and do
not count toward the density total.
         d.   Each of the above totals shall be proportionate in acreage to the
parcel size for each lot of record existing as of the date of adoption of this
code. This provision shall run with the land and be in effect whether the
parcels remain in their existing configuration or are subsequently divided.
         e.   Height is restricted to a maximum of thirty-five feet (35') for
commercial and residential construction fronting SR162 and Rocky Road. Height
is restricted to a maximum of forty-five feet (45') east of commercial

         g.   Streetscape design for improvements in public rights-of-way
including sidewalk finishes, street trees, lighting, and street furniture;
         h.   Landscaping of parking areas, open spaces, and project
perimeters; and
         i.   Use of low impact design techniques for stormwater management.
      7.   MUTCN Design Guidelines : The following guidelines are supplementary
to other adopted design standards and guidelines:
         a.   Pedestrian Oriented Street Frontage: Buildings shall provide
pedestrian entries along streets. Sidewalks along SR 162/Washington Avenue
North, one side of Daffodil Avenue NE, and one side of Rocky Road and in the
non-residential shall be a minimum of eight feet (8') in width with greater
widths at entries. Sidewalks along all other roadways must be a minimum of five
feet (5') in width. All streets shall have street trees spaced no more than
thirty feet (30') apart. All streets shall be public streets built to the City
of Orting Public Works standards. Buildings on public street frontages shall
provide at least two (2) of the following pedestrian amenities:
         (1)   Window displays along at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the

         b.   Off Street Parking Access: Off street parking between streets and
buildings shall be minimized. Curb cuts providing driveways to off street
parking lots shall be minimized. The building street frontage facade shall not
be broken by parking lots for more than sixty-five feet (65') at any location.
No more than fifty percent (50%) of the total frontage along SR162 may be
occupied by parking areas. Those parking lots may not be deeper than seventy-
five feet (75') including planter strips and must be screened with landscaping.
         c.   Off Street Parking Management: Absolute compliance with parking
requirements may be waived if a parking demand analysis demonstrates that
shared parking can be accomplished through the following:
            (1)   Parking lots/areas are connected by driveways and pedestrian
walkways.
            (2)   Multiple projects are treated collectively in the master
development plan.
            (3)   Daytime and nighttime parking demand can be balanced.
            (4)   Parking areas in adjacent or nearby projects (within five
hundred feet (500')) are dedicated to serving demand.
            (5)   Employee parking demand is addressed through carpooling and/
or remote parking areas.
         d.   Service Areas: Loading areas, outdoor storage, waste facilities,
and other services shall be located and screened from public views and adjacent
properties with a combination of location, landscaping and solid fencing.
         e.   Building Design: All buildings shall be designed in compliance
with the architectural design review (ADR) standards set forth in section
13-6-7 of this title.
         f.   Signage: The master development plan shall include a signage plan
including a unifying theme, and details for all typical signs such as monument
signs, major building signs, projecting signs, storefront signs, lighting, and
directional signs.
         g.   Plazas And Courtyards: Plazas and courtyards are required in all
non-residential areas, except for light industrial use areas. Plazas are major
open space features intended to provide significant opportunities for public
use and enjoyment including special events. Courtyards are smaller open space
features intended to provide quiet spaces for resting and relaxing. For each
ten thousand (10,000) square feet of building area, a combination of plazas
and/or courtyards totaling one thousand (1,000) square feet is required. The
minimum area of a courtyard is two hundred fifty (250) square feet. The minimum
area of plaza is one thousand (1,000) square feet. At least twenty- five
percent (25%) of all plazas and courtyards shall be landscaped with trees,
shrubs, and ground cover at grade or in planters. At least twenty-five percent
(25%) shall be paved with decorative materials. Seating (1 linear foot of
seating area for each sixty (60) square feet of plaza or courtyard area), trash
receptacles, public art, water features, and other furnishings shall be
provided.
      h.   Residential Open Space: Small scale, usable open space is required
in all residential areas. All residential open space areas must be relatively
level; located on useable space that is not part of a critical areas or
shoreline buffer and    must provide access and inclusive uses for all persons,
including those with mobility issues and other disabilities. Areas required for
perimeter buffering,
   landscaping, screening, utilities or storm water facilities may not be
counted as residential open space. For every fifty (50) dwelling units, a
combination of open space areas including tot lots, pedestrian amenities,
picnic areas, etc. totaling two thousand (2,000) square feet is required. The
minimum area of an individual open space is one thousand (1,000) square feet.
No side dimension of the open space may be less than thirty feet (30'). At
least fifty percent (50%) of all residential open space shall be landscaped
with trees, shrubs, and ground cover at grade or in planters. At least twenty-
five percent (25%) shall be improved with play structures, unless the
development is predominantly senior housing. Seating (one (1) linear foot of
seating area for each sixty (60) square feet of residential open space), trash
receptacles, public art, water features, and other furnishings shall be
provided.
      i.   Low Impact Design: In conjunction with standard stormwater
management practices, site design for stormwater conveyance, detention, and
treatment shall include measures such as biofiltration, irrigation reuse, and
other techniques integrated with the overall landscape design to minimize high
volumes of discharge and pollution, where reasonably practicable.
      j.   Mt. Rainier Site lines: It is preferable that the Master Development
Plan proposal protect views of Mt. Rainier along the SR162 corridor and from
the internal community parks.
      k.   Commercial setbacks fronting SR162: A minimum of fifty percent (50%)
of retail development along SR162 shall have a minimum setback of twenty-five
feet (25') from the street curb with pedestrian entry in the front. See
Sections 5 and 7 of this chapter.

13-3-4: ZONING MAP:
   A.   Map Established: The official zoning map used as the basis for this
zoning regulation is the same as the adopted Comprehensive Plan Future Land Use
Map and shall be maintained by the City. Each property in the City is
classified under this title and is subject to the requirements of this title.
Zoning classifications on the official zoning map shall use the symbols shown
in this chapter. (Ord. 2018-1026, 4-25-2018)
   B.   Urban Growth Area Boundary: The official zoning map shall include the
designation of the comprehensive plan urban growth area boundary for the City.
Any reference to the urban growth area boundary in this title shall mean that
mapped designation.
   C.   Interpretation Of Boundaries: When uncertainty regarding zone
classification boundaries arises, the following rules shall apply:
      1.   Where zoning or urban growth area boundaries are indicated as
following the centerline of streets, alleys or highways; the right-of-way
centerline shall be the boundary.
      2.   Where zoning or urban growth area boundaries are indicated as
following lot or tract lines, the lot or tract lines shall be the boundaries.
      3.   Unmapped shore lands shall be considered to be within the same
zoning classification or urban growth area designation as the adjacent upland.
      4.   Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned,
the zone classification applicable to the property abutting the vacated portion
shall apply to the vacated or abandoned street or alley.
      5.   Where zoning or urban growth area boundaries divide a parcel created
prior to January 11, 1996, the entire parcel shall be considered to be within
the classification of the majority of the parcel, i.e., the portion which is
greater than fifty percent (50%) of the area. The property owner(s) may
petition the City for relief from this provision based on hardship created by
unique or special circumstances, such as natural features. If the City finds
that such hardship exists, the boundary line may be moved within the lot area
to a location which provides relief from said hardship so long as the action
does not create hardships upon adjacent properties or conflict with other
provisions of this Code.
      6.   Where these rules (subsections C1 through C5 of this section) do not
clarify a boundary issue, the Administrator shall make the determination based
on an analysis of the specific parcel(s) with written findings and conclusions.
The Administrator's determination in these matters may be appealed according to
title 15, chapter 10 of this Code. (Ord. 792, 7-29-2004; amd. Ord. 2024-1136,
12-11-2024)
13-3-5: INTERPRETATION OF USES:
   A.   Typical Uses Within Use Types: The descriptions of use types in this
chapter may contain examples of usual and customary uses. These uses are
intended to be typical and are not intended to represent all permissible uses.
   B.   Interpretation By Administrator: Where there is a question regarding
the inclusion or exclusion of a particular proposed use within a particular use
category or use type, the Administrator shall have the authority to make the
final determination based on an analysis of the specific question with written
findings and conclusions. The Administrator's determination in these instances
may be appealed according to title 15, chapter 10 of this Code. (Ord. 792, 7-
29-2004)
13-3-6: EXEMPTED USES:
   A.   Applicability To Other Chapters: Unless otherwise stated, the uses
exempted in this section are also exempted from chapters 5 and 6 of this title

Council, Orting City Council, Washington State Governor, or the President of
the United States.
   C.   Repair And Maintenance: The provisions of this chapter shall not be
construed to regulate the maintenance and repair of any use or facility
exempted or permitted in this chapter. (Ord. 792, 7-29-2004; amd. Ord. 873, 2-
25-2009; Ord. 2024-1136, 12-11-2024)

anywhere on the property that is otherwise in compliance with this subsection
G.1.;
         f.   It shall be the obligation of the owner or user of such cargo
container to secure it in a manner that does not endanger the safety of persons

the street address at which the cargo container has been placed (and assessor’s
tax parcel number if available), the delivery date, removal date, and a
description of the cargo container and its location on the registered property.
The effective date of the registration shall be the date of approval of the
registration application and the registration shall be conspicuously posted on
the cargo container. A cargo container may be located upon the registered
property for a period not to exceed sixty (60) days from the date of approval.
No property may be registered more than one time in any one hundred eighty
(180) day period.
      3.   Revocation: A violation of any of the provisions of this subsection
shall, in addition to any other penalties provided herein, subject the
registration approval to revocation by the city administrator.
      4.   Removal: The owner or occupant of the residential property is
responsible for removing the cargo container from the property at the
expiration of the registration approval or sooner if the registration is
revoked by the city administrator.
      5.   Penalties: A violation of any of the provisions of this subsection
shall be and constitute a class IV civil infraction for each day that such
violation continues, and any person found to have committed such a violation
shall be subject to a maximum fine of twenty five dollars ($25.00) for each
such violation. Imposition of such penalties shall not preclude the city from
exercising any other rights or remedies it may have to require or seek removal
of a cargo container located in violation of this subsection.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2284.png]
      1.   Setback Measurement: A setback is measured from the edge of a street
right of way, access easement or private road. Where there is no street right
of way, access easement or private road, a setback is measured from the
property line.
      2.   Designation Of Required Setbacks: All lots except pipestem lots must
contain at least one front yard setback. A front yard setback shall be required
abutting each right of way on corner lots and through lots. All lots must
contain one rear yard setback except for corner, through, and pipestem lots.
All other setbacks will be considered side yard setbacks.
      3.   Through Lots: In the case of a through lot, a front yard setback is
required abutting each street right of way.
      4.   Front Yard Setback Averaging: Averaging may be used to reduce a
front yard setback requirement when a principal building has been established
on an adjacent lot within the required yard. This provision shall not apply if
the adjacent lot has received a reduced setback based upon a discretionary land
use approval. This exception shall be calculated as follows:
         a.   Averaging shall be calculated by adding the existing front yard
setbacks of the adjacent lots together and dividing that figure by two (2).
         b.   When an adjacent lot is vacant, averaging shall be calculated by
adding the front yard setback of the adjacent developed lot with the minimum
front yard setback of the zone in which the construction is proposed and
dividing that figure by two (2).
      5.   Slopes: If the topography of a lot is such that the minimum front
yard setback line is eight feet (8') or more above the street grade, and there
is no reasonable way to construct a driveway up to the dwelling unit level, a
garage/carport may be built into the bank and set at least five feet (5') back
from the right of way.
      6.   Accessory Structures, Interior Yard and Rear Yard Exceptions:
Detached one-story accessory structures shall maintain a minimum five-foot (5')
setback, except in the MUTC zone. This does not apply to accessory dwelling
units.
      7.   Reserved.
      8.   Bus Shelters: Bus shelters for school district or transit authority
purposes may be located within a front yard setback when located on private
property if they do not exceed fifty (50) square feet of floor area and one
story in height, provided all applicable site distance requirements are met.
      9.   Projection Exception:
         a.   Fireplace structures, bay or garden windows, enclosed stair
landings, ornamental features, or similar structures may project into any
setback, provided such projections are:
            (1)   Limited to two (2) per required yard.
            (2)   Not wider than ten feet (10').
            (3)   Not more than eighteen inches (18") into a side yard setback
or two feet (2') into a rear yard setback.
            (4)   Not more than three feet (3') into a front yard setback.
         b.   Uncovered porches and decks which do not exceed thirty inches
(30") from finished lot grade may project into any setback, provided such
projections do not extend more than six feet (6') into a front yard setback or
no closer than five feet (5') to the side lot line.
         c.   Wheelchair ramps may project into any required setback.
      10.   Rear Yards, Exception: In the case of triangular or otherwise
irregularly shaped lots, a line ten feet (10') in length entirely within the
lot, parallel to and at a maximum distance from the front lot line may be
considered the "rear lot line" at the owner's discretion. If the owner does not
select such a line, the city may do so.
   D.   Height Standards: (See figure 13.35-1 set forth in subsection D3 of
this section for measuring building heights.)
      1.   Measurement: The height of a fence located on a rockery, retaining
wall, or berm shall be measured from the top of the fence to the ground on the
high side of the rockery, retaining wall, or berm.
         a.   Walls, fences, and berms up to three feet (3') in height may be
located on any part of a lot. Open fences may be up to four feet (4') in
height.
         b.   Walls, fences and berms up to six feet (6') in height may be
located to the rear of the front wall line of the principal residence unless
otherwise determined to provide a site distance hazard by the building
inspector.
         c.   The provisions of this section shall not apply to fences required
by state law to surround public utility installations, or to fences enclosing
school grounds and public playgrounds. A building permit shall be required for
construction of any wall or fence located within the city.
      2.   Exceptions: Height standards shall not apply to the following:
         a.   Church spires, belfries, domes, chimneys, antennas, satellite
dishes, ventilation stacks, or similar structures, provided the structure is
set back from all property lines a distance equal to the height of the
structure.
         b.   Rooftop mechanical equipment. All rooftop mechanical equipment
may extend ten feet (10') above the height limit of the zone, provided all
equipment is set back ten feet (10') from the edge of the roof.
         c.   Utility towers and poles subject to review of site location.

IMAGES/0-0-0-2286.png]
   E.   General Development Standards:
      1.   Existing Lot; Single-Family Dwelling Permitted: In any zone that
permits a single-family dwelling unit, a single-family dwelling unit and
permitted accessory structures may be constructed or enlarged on one lot which
cannot satisfy the density requirements of the zone where the lot was legally
created prior to the effective date of this regulation. This section shall not
waive the requirements for setbacks and height of the zone in which the lot is
located.
      2.   Combining Lots; Interior Yard Setback Exception: Where two (2) or
more lots are used as a building site and where principal buildings cross lot
lines, interior yard setbacks shall not be required from those lot lines
crossed by the principal building.
      3.   Legally Created Lots; Development Permitted Proof:
         a.   Development shall be permitted only on legally created lots.
         b.   To establish that a lot has been legally created, the applicant
must provide one of the following:
            (1)   A copy of formal plat, short plat, or large lot subdivision
approved by Pierce County separately describing the lot.
            (2)   A copy of the boundary line adjustment or lot combination
separately describing the lot.
            (3)   Documentation that the creation of the lot was exempt from
the provisions of the subdivision title.
            (4)   A deed, contract of sale, mortgage, recorded survey, or tax
segregation that separately describes the lot.
      4.   Pipestem (Flag) Lots: Pipestem (flag) lots in all residential zones
are discouraged. In the RC and RMF Zones, pipestem (flag) lots may be approved
subject to the criteria provided in subsection
12-8-1A of this Code, general approval requirements. Development on pipestem
(flag) lots in the RU Zone shall be subject to the design standards provided in
subsection F of this section. The Planning Commission shall conduct a site plan
review of the proposal as a type 3a permitting action to determine if the
proposal complies with the standards in subsection F of this section.
      5.   Bulkheads And Retaining Walls: Any structure constructed and erected
between lands of different elevations used to resist the lateral displacement
of any material, control erosion, or protect structures may be placed within
required setbacks to a maximum height of six feet (6'), provided all applicable
site distance requirements are met.
   F.   RU Zone Pipestem (Flag) Lot Development Standards: (See figures 13-5-1A
and 13-5-1B of this section.) Road and access standards (including private
roads, public roads, and driveways) are per the City’s adopted development
standards for public works.
      1.   Configuration Of New Pipestem (Flag) Lots: The area of new pipestem
(flag) lots in the RU Zone, exclusive of the area of the driveway portion,
shall be ten thousand (10,000) square feet minimum. The shape of any new
pipestem (flag) lot in the RU Zone shall be such that a minimum forty-foot
(40') diameter building circle can be sited within the required setbacks of the
zone. The driveway portion of any new pipestem (flag) lot in the RU Zone shall
be no longer than one hundred feet (100') and at least twenty feet (20') wide.
In all other zones the minimum street frontage for a flag lot shall be fifteen
feet (15') unless a building will be sited one hundred fifty feet (150') or
further from the curb line in which there must be fire access provided with a
minimum width of twenty feet (20').

      2.   Development Standards For All Pipestem (Flag) Lots In The RU Zone:
All pipestem (flag) lots in the RU Zone, irrespective of when platted, shall
meet the following standards, subject to site plan review:
         a.   All development of principal residences, accessory dwellings,
garages, sheds, and other structures shall be built within the required
setbacks.
         b.   The “building area” within the setbacks shall be large enough to
accommodate a forty-foot (40') diameter building circle to ensure that the
shape of the lot is adequate to support development that results in attractive,
usable open spaces.
         c.   Hard surface coverage of the lot shall not be greater than forty-
five percent (45%), not including the driveway portion in the stem section of
the lot.
         d.   The maximum height of any structure shall not be greater than
twenty-feet (20').
         e.   The perimeter treatment of the lot including the driveway portion
may include fencing or landscaping to screen the development from adjacent
properties.
   G.   Cottage Housing Development Standards, Except As Modified During
Binding Site Plan Review or Unit Lot Subdivision approval:
      1.   Minimum site area: Two thousand two hundred fifty (2,250) square
feet of gross site area per dwelling unit.
      2.   Project size: Four (4) units minimum and twelve (12) units maximum.
      3.   Minimum common open space: Four hundred (400) square feet per unit.
      4.   Perimeter setbacks per underlying zoning.
      5.   Minimum building separation: Ten feet (10').
      6.   Maximum building height: Eighteen feet (18'), twenty five feet (25')
to roof peak.
      7.   Maximum building coverage: Forty percent (40%).

hundred fifty (650) square feet ground floor.
      10.   Accessory dwellings: Four hundred (400) square feet maximum,
attached or detached.
      11.   Minimum street frontage: Twenty feet (20').
   H.   Duplex Development Standards:
      1.   Duplexes shall be designed to blend in with the single-family
character of the neighborhood.
      2.   If located on a corner lot, each unit of the duplex shall face onto
an adjacent street, and no two (2) units' front doors and garages are permitted
to face the same street frontage.
      3.   Lot size requirements for duplexes in residential zones are as
follows:
         a.   Residential Conservation (RC):
            (1)   Duplex minimum lot size: Two (2) acres.
         b.   Residential Urban (RU):
            (1)   Duplex minimum lot size: 9,075 square feet.
         c.   Residential Multi- Family (RMF):
            (1)   Duplex minimum lot size: 7,000 square feet.
   I.   Lot Size Averaging:
      1.   Purpose: To allow flexibility in the creation of new subdivisions to
accommodate development barriers including, but not limited to, shorelines,
wetlands, and critical areas, provided that the average lot size in the
development as a whole meets the district's minimum lot size and the density as
a whole does not exceed the districts maximum density standards.
      2.   Applicability: Lot size averaging provisions of this chapter apply
to and may be used by developers of land who are dividing land in conformance
with the provisions of this title, and in which the land is located in the
following zones:
         a.   RC Residential-Conservation Zone (subsection
13-3-2A).
         b.   RU Residential-Urban Zone (subsection
13-3-2B).
         c.   RMF Residential-Multi-Family Zone (subsection
13-3-2C).
      3.   Standards:
         a.   Lot size averaging cannot result in a parcel being divided into a
greater number of lots than would result from development at the normal minimum
lot size required in the applicable zone.
         b.   In approved short plats and subdivisions, the individual lots
shall be considered in compliance with minimum area requirements if the average
of the areas of all the lots in the short plat or subdivision meets the minimum
requirement for the zone in which the short plat or subdivision is located.
         c.   Lot size averaging only applies to creation of lots for detached
single-family residences.
         d.   Lot size averaging shall not be used to create lots for duplexes
or multi-family dwellings as defined by section
13-2-14.
         e.   No individual single-family lot shall be reduced more than twenty
five percent (25%) from the district minimum required area.
         f.   No single-family lot shall be reduced in width to less than forty
feet (40') (regardless of lot depth).
         g.   No single-family lot shall be reduced in depth to less than
seventy feet (70') (regardless of lot width).
         h.   All of the following are to be subtracted from the net square
footage of a lot for the purpose of determining the area of a lot proposed for
lot averaging:

13-5-2: LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish standards for
landscaping and screening, to maintain or replace existing vegetation, provide
physical and visual buffers between differing land uses, lessen environmental
and improve aesthetic impacts of development and to enhance the overall
appearance of the city. Street trees shall be selected from the approved list
of trees, on file with the City of Orting.
   B.   Applicability: The standards set forth in this section shall apply to
all uses of land which are subject to site plan or architectural design review,
to the construction or location of any multi-family structure of three (3) or
more attached dwelling units, to any new subdivision, and to projects
implementing native vegetation retention, native vegetation revegetation, and
dispersion low impact development (LID) best management practices (BMPs) for
permanent on-site stormwater management.
   C.   Landscape Plan: A plan of the proposed landscaping and screening of
projects subject to this section shall be provided as part of the application
and shall contain the following:

13-5-3: LOADING AREA AND OFF STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to regulate parking and loading
in order to lessen traffic congestion and contribute to public safety by
providing sufficient on-site and off-site areas for the maneuvering and parking
of motor vehicles. This section also intends to recognize the barriers that
expansive off-street parking requirements pose to business growth and new
business establishment in Orting. Orting’s multimodal connectivity throughout
the downtown, its availability of on street and public parking, and its goal to
incite economic prosperity and revitalization in the MUTC are intended to be
key components in the assessment of needed off-street parking in Orting’s
downtown.
   B.   Required Automobile Parking Spaces: Off street parking spaces shall be
provided as an accessory use in accordance with the requirements of this
section at the time any building or structure is erected, enlarged, or
expanded.
   C.   Size And Access: Each off street parking space shall have an area of
not less than one hundred sixty (160) square feet, exclusive of access drives
or aisles and a width of not less than eight feet (8'). There shall be adequate
provision for ingress and egress from each parking space.
   D.   Location: Off street parking facilities shall be located as hereinafter
specified; where a distance is specified, such distance shall be the walking
distance measured from the nearest point of the parking facilities to the
nearest point of the building that such facility is required to serve. Parking
is required to be on the subject parcel unless the City approves a proposal
utilizing the off-site parking provisions of OMC
13-5-3L and/or the shared parking provisions of OMC 13-5-3M.
      1.   For a single-family dwelling or multi-family dwelling, the parking
facilities shall be located on the same lot or building site as the building
they are required to serve.
      2.   For churches, hospitals, large group homes, institutions, rooming
and lodging houses, nursing and convalescent homes, community clubs, and
clubrooms, parking facilities shall be located not farther than one hundred
fifty feet (150') from the facility.
      3.   For uses other than those specified, including governmental
facilities, parking facilities shall be located not farther than three hundred
feet (300') from the facility.
      4.   ADA accessible parking shall be located on the shortest possible
route to the entrance of the building or facility.
   E.   Unit Of Measurement: In stadiums, sports arenas, churches, government
buildings containing public assembly space and other places of assembly in
which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews, or other similar seating
facilities, each eighteen inches (18") of width or eighty (80) square feet of
open area of such seating facilities should be counted as one seat for the
purpose of determining requirements of off street parking facilities under this
title.
   F.   Expansions Or Enlargements: Where any structure is enlarged or
expanded, off street parking spaces shall be provided for said expansion or
enlargement in accordance with the requirements of subsection I of this
section. Nothing in this title shall be construed to require off street parking
spaces for the portion of said building or structure existing at the effective
date of this title. A change in use in an existing structure shall require
additional off street parking spaces as set forth in subsection I of this
section.
   G.   Mixed Occupancies: In the case of two (2) or more uses in the same
building, including governmental office space and public assembly space, the
total requirements for off street parking facilities shall be the sum of the
requirements for the several uses computed separately. Off street parking
facilities for one use shall not be considered as providing required parking
facilities for any other use, except as hereafter specified in subsection I of
this section for joint use.
   H.   Uses Not Specified: In the case of a use not specifically mentioned in
subsection I of this section, the requirements for off street parking
facilities shall be determined by the Administrator. Such determination shall
be based upon the requirements for the most comparable use specified in
subsection I of this section and/or through a parking study as required by the
Administrator or their designee.
   I.   Parking Spaces Required For Particular Uses:
      1.   In the MUTC zone, the uses listed in this subsection are required to
provide only fifty percent (50%) of the number of off-street parking spaces
required by the table in OMC 13-5-3(I)(3): Banks, savings and loan
associations, business or professional offices; bowling alleys; establishments
for the sale and consumption on the premises of food and beverages; medical and
dental clinics; retail stores; theaters; museums; and, libraries.

13-5-6 for accessory dwelling unit off street parking requirements.
         2.   Stationary vendor units used to provide food vending services are
exempt from off street parking requirements; provided that, the principal use
meets the established parking requirements for such principal use.
   J.   Required Loading Areas:
      1.   In any commercial and manufacturing zones, and for any institutional
use in whatever zone it may be located, every building or portion of building
hereafter erected or structurally altered to provide additional floor space
shall be provided with a minimum of one off street or off alley loading space
for each ten thousand (10,000) square feet of usable floor space within the
building, which usable floor space is intended to be used for or is used for
merchandising, manufacturing, warehousing, or processing purposes. If the
building contains less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of usable floor
space, the requirement for an off street or off alley loading space may be
waived by the building inspector.
      2.   If the building contains more than twenty four thousand (24,000)
square feet of floor space so used, then there shall be one additional loading
space provided for each additional twenty four thousand (24,000) square feet of
floor space.
      3.   Each loading space shall measure not less than thirty feet by twelve
feet (30' x 12'), and shall have an unobstructed height of fourteen feet (14'),
and shall be made permanently available for such purpose, and shall be
surfaced, improved, and maintained. Such facilities shall be so located that
trucks using the same shall not encroach upon or interfere with areas reserved
for off street parking nor project into any public right-of-way and shall be
adjacent to the building to be served thereby. If the site upon which such
loading space or spaces is to be located abuts upon an alley, such loading
space or spaces shall be off alley. If the loading space is incorporated within
a building then, as to location, the requirements of this section shall not
apply.
      4.   Any floor area provided by additions to or structural alterations to
a building shall be provided with loading space or spaces as set forth herein
whether or not loading spaces have been provided for the original floor space.
   K.   Commercial Vehicles, Recreational Vehicles, And Boats: The following
special requirements and performance standards shall apply to private
properties located in the Residential-Urban, Residential-Multi-Family, and
Residential-Conservation Zones, except as otherwise authorized by the City

vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats, and vehicle accessories is permitted in
the residential zones, provided the following standards are met. For purposes
of this section, “storage” means the keeping of such vehicles and accessories
on any portion of any parcel of property for a period of seventy-two (72)
continuous hours or longer.
         a.   Recreational Vehicles and Boats: A recreational vehicle or boat
shall not be stored in the front yard of a lot. In no instance shall a
recreational vehicle or boat be stored such that any portion of the vehicle
encroaches upon a site distance area that would create a traffic hazard; nor
shall a recreational vehicle or boat be stored on or overhang a public right-
of-way. A maximum of one recreational vehicle and/or one boat may be located at
a parcel in the residential zones. It is prohibited to store two recreational
vehicles or two boats in the City’s residential zoning districts. If located
within a required side yard that fronts a street, the storage area for a
recreational vehicle or boat shall be improved with a durable and dustless
surface and screened from views from adjacent properties. In this context, a
boat or recreational vehicle shall be considered to be “screened from views”
provided an opaque fence of at least 6-feet in height separates the boat or
recreational vehicle from public view, or similar vegetative or structural
screening as approved by staff separates the boat or recreational vehicle from
public view. See OMC 13-5-1(D) for provisions related to the dimensional and
permitting requirements for fences.
         b.   Inoperable Vehicles And Motor Vehicle Accessories: No more than
two (2) inoperable vehicles may be stored on a lot. The outdoor storage of

both the use and off-site parking are located within the MUTC Zone. However,
OMC 13-5-3D4 applies.
            (2)   Maximum distances to off-site parking do not apply if there
is a shuttle in place between the off-site parking and the sponsoring use.
            (3)   All Other Zones: All provisions of OMC 13-5-3D apply.
      3.   The City Administrator may approve a proposal to modify the distance
to off-site parking or allow the required parking to be provided on-street if a
Transportation Management Plan or other acceptable transportation system will
adequately provide for the parking needs of the use and the conditions below
are met.
         a.   Decision Criteria: Whenever there are practical difficulties
involved in carrying out the provisions of this Title, the Department
Administrator may grant modifications for individual cases provided he/she
shall first find that a specific reason makes the strict letter of this Code
impractical, that the intent and purpose of the governing land use designation
of the Comprehensive Plan is met and that the modification is in conformity
with the intent and purpose of this Code, and that such modification:
            (1)   Substantially implements the policy direction of the policies
and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan Land Use Element and the Architectural
Design Guidelines and the proposed modification is the minimum adjustment
necessary to implement these policies and objectives;
            (2)   Will meet the objectives and safety, function, appearance,
environmental protection and maintainability intended by the Code requirements,
based upon sound engineering judgment;
            (3)   Will not be injurious to other property(ies) in the vicinity;
            (4)   Conforms to the intent and purpose of the Code;
            (5)   Can be shown to be justified and required for the use and
situation intended; and
            (6)   Will not create adverse impacts to other property(ies) in the
vicinity.
   M.   Joint Use Parking Facilities:
      1.   When Permitted: Joint use of parking facilities may be authorized
for those uses that have dissimilar peak-hour demands or when it can be
demonstrated that the parking facilities to be shared are underutilized.
      2.   Agreement Required: A parking agreement ensuring that joint use
parking is available for the duration of the uses shall be approved by the
Community and Economic Development Administrator, following review by the City
Attorney. Notice of termination of the agreement shall be provided to the
Administrator and additional parking must be provided if the agreement is
terminated, consistent with subsection I of this Section.
      3.   Maximum Distance To Joint Use Parking:
         a.   Within the MUTC, MUTCN and Public Facilities Zones: No distance
requirements apply when both the use and joint use parking are located within
the MUTC, MUTCN or Public Facilities zones. However, OMC 13-5-3D4 applies.
         b.   All Other Zones: All provisions of OMC 13-5-3-D apply.
      4.   Special Provisions For Subdivision Of Shopping Center: Parking areas
in shopping centers may operate as common parking for all uses. If a shopping
center is subdivided, easements and/or restrictive covenants must grant use and
provide for maintenance of common parking and access areas.
   N.   Administrative Parking Waiver: The Administrator may issue a waiver
from the number of off-street parking stalls required by this chapter for uses
in the downtown core in response to a requested waiver by the property owner.
The requested waiver shall only be considered by the Administrator upon showing
of a good faith effort by the applicant that attempts have been made to enter
into joint use parking agreements as governed by OMC 13-5-3M. The waiver
request shall include a statement of justification for the request and shall
document the number of off-street parking stalls for which the applicant is
requesting relief. The Administrator may require a parking study be prepared
and provided by the applicant that considers the use of the site subject to the
request, the availability of parking proximal to the site, and the totality of
approved parking waivers and its impact on the entire community’s access to
parking and public enjoyment of the downtown core. In no instance may a parking
waiver grant relief from the dimensional standards of parking stalls, nor
overwhelm dimensional standards governed by the Orting Development Standards
regulating the space needed for safe maneuverability of a parking lot, nor
approve relief from the number of off-street parking stalls that has otherwise
been denied by the City’s Hearing Examiner after considering a variance
application from the standards set forth in this chapter, not waive required
accessible parking stalls as governed by the International Building Code or
Title 10 of the OMC. (Ord. 792, 7-29-2004; amd. Ord. 889, 9-8-2010; Ord. 943,

1086, 10-27-2021)
13-5-6: ACCESSORY DWELLING UNITS:
   A.   Purpose: Accessory dwelling units (ADUs) are intended to increase the
supply of affordable and independent housing for a variety of households,
provide supplemental earnings for people with limited incomes, and increase
residential densities with minimal cost and disruption to existing
neighborhoods. This should occur by utilizing the existing infrastructure and
community resources while providing a housing type that blends in well with
existing neighborhoods including low density residential neighborhoods. The
provisions of this chapter do not apply to lots designated with critical areas
or their buffers as designated by Title 11 OMC or by Orting's Shoreline Master
Program.
   B.   Procedures: Any owner/occupant seeking to establish an ADU shall apply
for approval in accordance with the following:
      1.   Application: The owner/occupant shall apply for a building permit
for an ADU. A complete application form must demonstrate that all size
thresholds and design standards are met.
      2.   Occupancy And Use: Occupancy of ADUs shall be reserved for
residential uses only. Occupancy of ADUs shall be used for long-term
residential purposes and may not be used for transient occupancy or short-term/
vacation rental purposes. Persons residing in ADUs shall live in such
residences for longer than one hundred eighty (180) days each calendar year.
      3.   Impact Fees: Impact fees are set forth in the fee schedule in a
manner consistent with RCW 36.70A.681(1)(a): The city may not assess impact
fees on the construction of accessory dwelling units that are greater than
fifty percent (50%) of the impact fees that would be imposed on the principal
unit.
   C.   General Requirements: The creation of an ADU shall be subject to the
following general requirements:
      1.   Number: A maximum of two (2) ADUs (either attached, detached, or a
combination of the two (2)) shall be allowed per lot of record in conjunction
with any detached single-family dwelling, subject to building and impervious
surface coverage maximums on the lot of record as per Table 1 in OMC
13-5-1 . ADUs are exempt from the residential density standards of this code.
      2.   Lot Standards: Both attached and detached ADUs shall be permitted on
all parcels containing single-family homes, provided the lot meets the minimum
size for the principal unit.
      3.   Type Of Unit:
         a.   An ADU shall be permitted as a subordinate dwelling unit attached
to or detached from the principal dwelling.
         b.   A detached ADU may be any dwelling permitted in the applicable
land use classification.
         c.   A recreational vehicle, tiny house with wheels as defined in RCW
35.21.686, manufacture home, or mobile home shall be not used as an ADU.
However, modular homes with a manufactured off site may be allowed.
      4.   Size: An ADU shall be no greater than one thousand two hundred
(1,200) square feet. Spaces in the ADU that are not habitable, such as for
enclosed parking, will not be included in the square footage for the purposes
of this section.
      5.   Parking: One (1) off-street parking space is required for each ADU
up to seven hundred (700) square feet in size. For ADUs greater than seven
hundred (700) square feet in size two (2) off-street parking spaces are
required unless the lot is less than 6,000 square feet in size and then one (1)
off- street parking space is required per ADU. Off- street parking spaces for
ADUs shall be in addition to that which is required for the primary dwelling
unit.
      6.   Design: An ADU shall be designed to maintain the appearance of the
principal dwelling as a single-family residence.
         a.   The primary entrance to an attached ADU shall be located in such
a manner as to be clearly secondary to the main entrance to the principal unit.
         b.   Detached ADUs shall be no closer to the front lot line than the
front face of the principal dwelling. This provision shall not apply to
waterfront lots regulated pursuant to the city shoreline management program.
         c.   New construction of a detached ADU or conversion of an existing
detached structure to an ADU shall not be permitted within the required front,
side or rear yard setback as provided in section

if the rear yard abuts an alley in which case a detached ADU may be adjacent to
the lot line abutting the public alley.
         d.   If an ADU is created by constructing a new detached structure,
the building height of the ADU shall not be greater than the principal
dwelling’s building height or twenty-four feet (24') measured from the ground
to the top plate, whichever is less. The roof pitch may not exceed that of the
principal dwelling.
         e.   An ADU may be created by adding on to or converting an existing
detached structure, even if the existing structure is non-conforming to
required setbacks or lot coverage as long as other applicable codes and
requirements are met, such as for fire and safety, and as long as any existing
non-conforming components of the existing structure are not expanded upon. The
height of the ADU shall not exceed the principal dwelling's building height or
twenty- four feet (24'), whichever is greater.
         f.   An ADU shall have similar facade, roof pitch and siding to the
principal dwelling unit.
         g.   Right-of-way improvements shall not be required as a condition of
approval of a permit for an ADU. (Ord. 792, 7-29-2004; amd. Ord. 2019-1053, 11-
25-2019; Ord. 2021-1073, 3-10-2021; Ord. 2024-1136, 12-11-2024)
13-5-7: ADULT BUSINESSES:
   A.   Purpose: The intent of this section is to establish regulations for
activities or uses which, because of their adult orientation, are recognized as
having objectionable characteristics and need to be distanced from other uses
such as residential, schools, parks and community centers. Special regulations
for these uses are necessary to:
      1.   Prevent inappropriate exposure of such businesses to the public;
      2.   Ensure that adverse effects of these uses will not contribute to the
blighting or downgrading of surrounding neighborhoods; and
      3.   Protect property values and quality of life from potential adverse
impacts.
   B.   Location Standards: Adult businesses shall be subject to the provisions
of this section.
      1.   Separation Requirements I: Adult businesses are prohibited from

(Rep. by Ord. 889, 9-8-2010)
13-5-9: NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide standards and
conditions to regulate lots, structures and uses which were legally established
prior to the adoption, revision or amendment of this title and which remain
legal, but have become nonconforming as a result of this title's application,
or by acquisition of land in public interest. This section provides reasonable
alternatives to property owners for the limited expansion and continuance of
nonconformities. The provisions of this section shall not be applicable to any
discretionary land use action specifically authorized prior to or after the
adoption of this title. Discretionary land uses shall comply with conditions
and restrictions set forth in the approval through which it was authorized.
   B.   Basic Standards: The basic standards apply to all nonconforming uses,
structures, developments and lots. These standards provide for actions that are
allowed outright. Limited exceptions to the standards in this section are
allowed through a nonconforming use permit in section
13-6-6 of this title.
      1.   Expansion Of Nonconforming Uses And Structures: Nonconforming uses
and structures shall not be enlarged, expanded, extended, replaced or altered
except as expressly permitted in this section.
      2.   Expansion Beyond Original Parcel: Nothing in this section shall be
construed to permit expanding or extending a nonconforming use or structure
beyond the confines of the lot or parcel of land upon which it was located on
the date the use or structure became nonconforming.
      3.   Continuation Of Use: A nonconforming use may be continued by
successive owners or tenants where the use continues unabandoned (see
subsection I of this section).
      4.   Normal Upkeep, Repairs And Maintenance: Normal upkeep, repairs,
maintenance, strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any
nonconforming building or structure or part thereof shall be permitted subject
to the provisions of this section.
      5.   Compliance With Development Regulations: Any additions or expansions
of nonconforming uses or nonconforming structures shall comply with the
development standards in this chapter for the zone classification in which the
nonconformity is located; provided, that portions of nonconformities that
legally existed prior to adoption of this section shall not be subject to this
provision.
      6.   Nonconforming Use Within Structure: A nonconforming use, within an
existing structure, which is nonconforming by reason of zone classification may
be extended throughout such structure.
      7.   Structures And Uses Accessory To Residential: Structures and uses
accessory to an existing nonconforming residential use shall be allowed as
provided in chapter 3 of this title.
   C.   Expansion Standards For Nonconforming Uses: Expansion of nonconforming
uses or replacement of structures occupied by nonconforming uses shall be
subject to the following provisions, provided the basic standards of this
section are satisfied:
      1.   Where a nonconforming use of a structure exists, that structure can
be replaced, provided the original footprint is not relocated or altered,
except as provided in the expansion standards below.
      2.   An expansion of existing nonconforming uses shall be allowed under
one of the following provisions:
         a.   The proposed expansion of the nonconforming use or the
nonconforming use of a structure does not exceed ten percent (10%) of the floor
area of the total existing use or structures, nor create more than ten percent
(10%) additional pad sites for manufactured home parks and RV parks; or
         b.   The proposed expansion of the nonconforming use or the
nonconforming use of a structure does not create impervious cover exceeding
twenty five percent (25%) of the existing impervious area of the lot or parcel,
nor exceed twenty five percent (25%) of the developed area for manufactured
home parks and RV parks. Expansion of impervious cover shall meet the
stormwater mitigation requirements of Title 9 Chapter 5 of this code. Expansion
of impervious cover beyond the limits allowed in this paragraph may be allowed
provided that such impervious cover meets the criteria for on-site stormwater
management LID BMPs or infiltration facilities so that the effective impervious
area expansion does not exceed the limits allowed in this paragraph.
   D.   Change Of Use Standards: A nonconforming use may change outright to a
conforming use allowed within the zone classification in which the use is
located. A nonconforming use may change to another use within another
nonconforming use only after review and approval using the criteria in section
13-6-6 of this title; or
   E.   Nonconforming Structure Standards: A nonconforming structure may be
enlarged, altered or replaced, provided the basic standards of this section are
satisfied, and provided:
      1.   When a nonconforming structure is occupied by a nonconforming use it
shall comply with the expansion standards of this section;
      2.   A structure which is nonconforming due to height or yard
requirements may be structurally altered, enlarged or replaced, provided the
degree of nonconformity is not extended or increased; and
      3.   The nonconforming portion of the structure shall not be expanded or
the footprint of that portion altered, except as specifically authorized
through a variance (see section
13-6-3 of this title).
   F.   Nonconforming Lot Standards: Any permitted uses or structures,
including any accessory uses or structures permitted in conjunction with a
principal use, shall be allowed to be built or expanded on a nonconforming lot.
Applicable development standards in this chapter shall be complied with.
   G.   Nonconforming Development Standards: Existing uses or structures may be
expanded or new uses and structures added, provided the nonconforming
development is brought into conformance with the development standards of this
chapter for the lot or parcel on which it is located.
   H.   Restoration Standards For Damaged Or Destroyed Nonconforming Structures
And Uses: Any nonconforming structure damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion,
wind, flood, earthquake or other calamity may be completely restored or
reconstructed. Damaged or destroyed nonconforming structures must be restored
under the following provisions:
      1.   Restoration or reconstruction shall not serve to extend or increase
the nonconformance of the original structure or use, except as provided by
nonconforming structures standards.
      2.   To the extent reasonably possible, restoration should retain the
same general architectural style as the destroyed structure.
      3.   Permits shall be applied for within one year of damage. Restoration
or reconstruction must be substantially completed within eighteen (18) months
of permit issuance. When deemed reasonable and necessary, the city may grant a
time extension.
   I.   Discontinuance Standards: Should a nonconforming use of a property or
structure be discontinued for more than one year, the use of the property and
structure shall be deemed abandoned and shall conform to a use permitted in the
zone classification in which it is located. If the intended discontinued use of
a property or structure is temporary in nature as opposed to abandonment, then
the applicant may apply for a nonconforming use permit to reestablish the
nonconforming use.
   J.   Cargo Containers; Loss Of Nonconforming Status: Cargo containers that
have been legally located on property in any zone of the city prior to the
adoption of subsection
13-4-2D of this title shall be a legal nonconforming use of the property.
Notwithstanding any provision of subsections A through I of this section to the
contrary, cargo containers shall lose legal nonconforming status under the
circumstances set forth as follows:
      1.   If the legal nonconforming cargo container is moved to a different
location on the property.
      2.   If a legal nonconforming cargo container is removed from a property,
any subsequent cargo containers placed on the property shall comply with the
requirements of subsection
13-4-2D of this title.
      3.   If a legal nonconforming cargo container is moved off of a
residential zoned property, no new cargo container may be moved onto the
property.
      4.   All nonconforming cargo containers shall be made to conform to the
requirements of subsection
13-4-2D of this title or removed from the property by ninety (90) days after
approval of this section.

CHAPTER 6
SPECIAL USE PERMITS
SECTION:
13-6-1: General
13-6-2: Conditional Use Permit
13-6-3: Variances
13-6-4: Planned Unit Developments
13-6-5: Cottage Developments
13-6-6: Nonconforming Use Permit
13-6-1: GENERAL:
All special use permits shall be processed in accordance with the provisions of
title 15, "Development Code Administration", of this code. (Ord. 792, 7-29-
2004)
13-6-2: CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT:
   A.   Purpose:
      1.   The purpose of this section is to establish decision criteria and
procedures for special uses, called conditional uses, which possess unique
characteristics. Conditional uses are deemed unique due to factors such as
size, technological processes, equipment, or location with respect to
surroundings, streets, existing improvements, or demands upon public
facilities. These uses require a special degree of control to assure
compatibility with the comprehensive plan, adjacent uses, and the character of
the vicinity.
      2.   Conditional uses will be subject to review by the city and the
issuance of a conditional use permit. This process allows the city to:
         a.   Determine that the location of these uses will not be
incompatible with uses permitted in the surrounding areas; and
         b.   Make further stipulations and conditions that may reasonably
assure that the basic intent of this title will be served.
   B.   Decision Criteria: The city shall review conditional use permits in
accordance with the provisions of this section and may approve, approve with
conditions, modify, modify with conditions, or deny the conditional use permit.
The city may modify bulk requirements, off street parking requirements, and use
design standards to lessen impacts, as a condition of the granting of the
conditional use permit.
      1.   Required Findings: The city may use design standards and other
elements in this title to modify the proposal. A conditional use permit may be
approved only if all of the following findings can be made regarding the
proposal and are supported by the record:
         a.   The granting of the proposed conditional use permit will not:
            (1)   Be detrimental to the public health, safety, and general
welfare;
            (2)   Adversely affect the established character of the surrounding
vicinity; nor
            (3)   Be injurious to the uses, property, or improvements adjacent
to, and in the vicinity of, the site upon which the proposed use is to be
located.
         b.   The granting of the proposed conditional use permit is consistent
and compatible with the intent of the goals, objectives and policies of the
comprehensive plan and any implementing regulation.
         c.   All conditions necessary to lessen any impacts of the proposed
use are conditions that can be monitored and enforced.
         d.   The proposed use will not introduce hazardous conditions at the
site that cannot be mitigated to protect adjacent properties, the vicinity, and
the public health, safety and welfare of the community from such hazard.
         e.   The conditional use will be supported by, and not adversely
affect, adequate public facilities and services; or that conditions can be
imposed to lessen any adverse impacts on such facilities and services.
         f.   The level of service standards for public facilities and services
are met in accordance with the concurrency management requirements. See title
15, chapter 8 of this code.
         g.   Will not preclude the use of LID BMPs if LID BMPs are feasible
for existing site conditions or existing site characteristics.
      2.   Burden Of Proof: The applicant has the burden of proving that the
proposed conditional use meets all of the criteria in subsection B1 of this
section.
   C.   Application: Submittal of an application for a conditional use permit
shall include:
      1.   A completed application form.
      2.   A base map showing property boundary lines, existing lots, tracts,
utility or access easements and streets, topography, existing development
features, water bodies, wetlands and buffers, and flood prone areas.
      3.   A legal description and vicinity map of the property.
      4.   A site plan showing the location and ground elevation of any
proposed structures, parking areas, common use areas, landscaping, utilities,
grading and drainage, mitigation for critical area impacts, fences and other
proposed features. (If easements or covenants are proposed, their location and
design must be shown.)
      5.   Mailing labels of all property owners as provided in title 15,
chapter 7 of this code.
      6.   A written statement addressing the decision criteria (see subsection
B of this section) and any other information required by the city at the
preapplication meeting.
(Ord. 792, 7-29-2004; amd. Ord. 889, 9-8-2010; Ord. 2019-1057, 1-8-2020)
13-6-3: VARIANCES:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to provide a means of altering
the requirements of this title in specific instances where the strict
application of those requirements would deprive a property of privileges
enjoyed by other properties within the identical regulatory zone because of
special features or constraints unique to the property involved.
   B.   Granting Of Variances: The city shall have the authority to grant a
variance from the provisions of this title, when, in the judgment of the
hearing examiner, the conditions as set forth in subsection C of this section
have been found to exist. In such cases a variance may be granted which is in
harmony with the general purpose and intent of this title so that the spirit of
this title shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and
substantial justice done.
   C.   Decision Criteria: Before any variance may be granted, it shall be
shown:
      1.   That there are special circumstances applicable to the subject
property or to the intended use such as shape, topography, location, or
surroundings that do not apply generally to the other property or class of use
in the same vicinity and zone;
      2.   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right or use possessed by other property in the same
vicinity and zone but which because of special circumstances is denied to the
property in question;
      3.   That the granting of such variance will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvement
in such vicinity and zone in which the subject property is located;
      4.   That the granting of such variance will not adversely affect the
comprehensive plan.
      5.   That the granting of such variance will not preclude the use of LID
BMPs if LID BMPs are feasible for existing site conditions or existing site
characteristics.
   D.   Conditions On Variances: When granting a variance, the hearing examiner
shall determine that the circumstances do exist as required by subsection C of
this section, and attach specific conditions to the variance which will serve
to accomplish the standards, criteria, and policies established by this title.
   E.   Application: Submittal of an application for a variance shall include:
      1.   A completed application form.
      2.   A site plan showing all information relevant to the request
including, but not limited to: location of existing and proposed structures,
roads, property lines, parking areas, landscaping and buffers.
      3.   Mailing labels of all property owners as provided in title 15,
chapter 7 of this code.
      4.   A written statement addressing the decision criteria (see subsection
C of this section) and any other information required by the city at the
preapplication meeting.
(Ord. 792, 7-29-2004; amd. Ord. 889, 9-8-2010; Ord. 2019-1057, 1-8-2020)
13-6-4: PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS:
   A.   Purpose: A PUD is a flexible zoning concept that results in as good or
better use of land than that produced through the standards of the regular zone
classifications. The uses within the PUD depend on the uses in the underlying
zone. The residential densities and bulk and scale of the development within
the PUD may vary to provide more flexibility and creativity in addressing the
site and project aesthetics, natural areas, and open space planning. An
approved PUD is an overlay zone, enacted as part of the final approval action
which may also include subdivision, binding site plan, or master plan approval.
   B.   Classifications Of Planned Unit Development Districts: Planned
developments may be either residential or nonresidential in character. A
"residential PUD" means that the principal purpose of the PUD is to provide one
or more types of housing at densities of dwellings the same as densities
permitted by the underlying zone and where all other uses shall be considered
accessory, supportive, or adjunct to housing. A "nonresidential PUD" means a
development where the majority of uses are intended for purposes other than
housing such as: retail, service, industrial and manufacturing, and where
residential uses as are allowed by the underlying zone secondary in purpose to
intended use of the project.
   C.   Minimum Area Required:
      1.   Residential PUD: One acre.
      2.   Nonresidential PUD: None.
   D.   Staging: The applicant may elect, or the city may require that the
development of a PUD be accomplished or constructed in stages; provided, that
when a residential PUD is developed in stages, the cumulative density of all
phases shall not exceed the approved overall density of the entire PUD.
   E.   Redevelopment; Street Vacations: When the city determines that the
location, configuration and/or condition of existing structures on site may
threaten the public health, safety or welfare, it may require the removal of
all or portions of existing structures. It is the further purpose of this
section to encourage development of a PUD upon contiguous land and property.
When deemed appropriate and necessary, the city may require the vacation of all
or portions of existing streets within the PUD project area. The city may, as
an alternative to vacation of streets, permit the inclusion of existing rights
of way within a PUD, when it can be shown that the existing rights of way serve
a functional purpose for the PUD and do not act to separate or divide a PUD
into noncontiguous units. Rights of way within the context of this section
shall not include freeways, limited access highways or major arterials.
   F.   Uses Permitted In PUD:
      1.   Residential: Housing concepts of all types limited only by the
density commensurate with the underlying zone upon land either subdivided into
two (2) or more ownerships or held in common, unified, or single ownership.
Examples include the following:
         a.   Condominiums, apartments and townhouses.
         b.   Customary accessory uses and structures common to individual or
group dwellings.
         c.   Group residence.
         d.   Manufactured home parks and subdivisions.
         e.   Nonresidential uses such as schools, churches, libraries or other
conditional uses allowed in residential zones.
      2.   Nonresidential: Uses permitted by the underlying zone.
      3.   Unclassified And Conditional Uses: Unclassified uses and conditional
uses, if permitted in the underlying zone and as specifically authorized by the
final development plan.
   G.   Procedure For Approval: The approval of a PUD shall be considered an
amendment to the official maps and, except as provided in this section, shall
be processed as is any other amendment with respect to notice, hearings, and
appeals pursuant to this title. A two (2) step procedure shall be followed in
the approval of a PUD as follows:
      1.   The approval of a preliminary development plan after public notice
and hearing.
      2.   The final PUD approval shall not become final and effective until
the date the final development plan is approved and overlay zone is adopted.
The final development plan may be approved and adopted by stages. The final
development plan shall be approved when the City determines that the
development conforms with the approved conditions established in the
preliminary development approval.
   H.   Decision Criteria: The action by the City to approve a preliminary
development plan for a proposed PUD with or without modifications shall be in
writing based upon the following findings:
      1.   The proposed development is in substantial conformance with the
comprehensive plan, the intent of the underlying zoning, and applicable City
design standards.
      2.   Exceptions from the standards of the underlying district are
warranted by the design and amenities incorporated in the development plan and
program.
      3.   The proposal does not adversely impact the surrounding area or its
potential future use.
      4.   The system of ownership and means of developing, preserving, and
maintaining common open space is consistent with the size, design and scale of
the project.
      5.   The approval will result in a beneficial effect upon the area which
could not be achieved under other zoning districts.
      6.   The proposed development or units thereof will be pursued and
completed in a conscientious and diligent manner.
      7.   The proposed development will not preclude the use of LID BMPs if
LID BMPs are feasible for existing site conditions or existing site
characteristics.
   I.   Project Limitation: The City, in order to protect the public health,
safety, welfare, and general interest may limit or restrict development in a
PUD or any portion thereof in relationship to the size of the area being
developed or redeveloped with the nature of uses intended, lot coverage,
parking and loading requirements, provisions for open space, adequacy of roads
and utility systems to accommodate the use as well as to minimize the impact
the development will have on the existing or intended development of adjacent
lands and the general neighborhood.
   J.   Permissive Variation From Standard Requirements: In considering a
proposed development plan, the approval may involve modifications in the
regulations, requirements, and standards of the underlying zone in which the
project is located so as to appropriately accomplish the purpose of this
section. In making such modifications as are deemed appropriate, the following
guidelines shall apply:
      1.   Off Street Parking And Loading: The total required off street
parking facilities should not be less than the sum of the required parking
facilities for the various uses computed separately.
      2.   Common Walls: In projects receiving final approval where units
intended for individual ownership will have common walls, the City may issue
building permits for construction of those units prior to approval of a final
PUD, although occupancy of said units will not be allowed until the final
approval.
      3.   Height Of Buildings: The height of buildings and structures within a
PUD should be limited to the height permitted by the underlying zone, or as
required as a special limitation. The height of buildings and structures may be
increased in relationship to provisions for greater open space and separation
between buildings on the same or adjoining property and when adequate provision
is made for light, air, and safety.
      4.   Lot Area Coverage: The maximum lot coverage within a PUD or any
portion thereof shall be determined at the time of consideration of a
preliminary development plan.
      5.   Yards: The requirement for yards in a PUD should be same as required
by the underlying zone for those yards abutting the exterior boundary of the
PUD. Yard requirements for any yard not abutting or adjoining the exterior
boundary of the PUD shall be as authorized in the preliminary development plan.
   K.   Subdivisions: When it is the intention of an applicant to subdivide or
resubdivide all or portions of property within a proposed PUD, a preliminary
subdivision approval shall be considered concurrently with an application for
approval of a preliminary development plan. The minimum lot provisions
specified in the underlying zone district may be qualified if the design of the
subdivision is in accordance with the intent and purpose of this section and
the resulting overall density of the project is consistent with the underlying
zoning.
   L.   Final Development Plan; Time Limitation: A final development plan
meeting all requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the City for
approval within seven (7) years of the date of preliminary plat approval if the
date of preliminary plat approval is on or before December 31, 2014, and within
five (5) years of the date of preliminary plat approval if the date of
preliminary plat approval is on or after January 1, 2015. A final development
plan meeting all requirements of this chapter shall be submitted to the City
for approval within ten (10) years of the date of preliminary plat approval if
the project is not subject to requirements adopted under chapter 90.58 Revised
Code of Washington and the date of preliminary plat approval is on or before
December 31, 2007. Nothing contained in this section shall act to prevent the
City from adopting by ordinance procedures which would allow extensions of time
that may or may not contain additional or altered conditions and requirements.
When deemed reasonable and appropriate, the Administrator may grant an
extension of one year for such submittal. If at the date of expiration of the
time period provided herein, a final development plan has not been filed for
approval, the preliminary PUD approval shall expire and the applicant shall be
required to resubmit an application for preliminary approval to reinstate the
project. In instances when a planned unit development is requested concurrent
with an application for subdivision, short subdivision, or binding site plan,
the final plat, final short plat, or final binding site plan shall satisfy the
final development plan required by this chapter.
   M.   Application: Submittal of an application for preliminary PUD approval
shall include:
      1.   A completed application form;

13-6-5: COTTAGE DEVELOPMENTS:
   A.   Purpose:
      1.   The purpose of this section is to establish decision criteria and
procedures for cottage developments which possess unique characteristics due to
factors such as size, residential density, ownership, and location with respect
to their surroundings. These uses require a special degree of control to assure
compatibility with the comprehensive plan, adjacent uses, and the character of
the vicinity.
      2.   Cottage developments are subject to review by the city and the
issuance of a binding site plan (or approval of a unit lot subdivision) and
architectural design review approval. This process allows the city to:
         a.   Determine that the location of these uses will not be
incompatible with uses permitted in the surrounding areas; and
         b.   Make further stipulations and conditions that may reasonably
assure that the basic intent of this title will be served.
   B.   Decision Criteria: The city shall review cottage development permit
applications in accordance with the provisions of this section and may approve,
approve with conditions, modify, modify with conditions, or deny the binding
site plan approval. The city may modify bulk requirements, off street parking
requirements, and use design standards to lessen impacts, as a condition of the
granting of the binding site plan approval.
      1.   Required Findings: The city shall use design standards and other
elements in this title to modify the proposal. A cottage development binding
site plan shall be approved only if all of the following findings regarding the
proposal can be made and are supported by the record:
         a.   The granting of the proposed binding site plan will not:
            (1)   Be detrimental to the public health, safety, and general
welfare;
            (2)   Adversely affect the established character of the surrounding
vicinity; nor
            (3)   Be injurious to the uses, property, or improvements adjacent
to, and in the vicinity of, the site upon which the proposed use is to be
located.
         b.   The granting of the proposal is consistent and compatible with
the intent of the goals, objectives, and policies of the comprehensive plan and
any implementing regulation.
         c.   All conditions necessary to lessen any impacts of the proposal
are conditions that can be monitored and enforced.
         d.   The proposal will not introduce hazardous conditions at the site
that cannot be mitigated to protect adjacent properties, the vicinity, and the
public health, safety and welfare of the community from such hazard.
         e.   The cottage development will be supported by, and not adversely
affect, adequate public facilities and services; or that conditions can be
imposed to lessen any adverse impacts on such facilities and services.
         f.   The level of service standards for public facilities and services
are met in accordance with the concurrency management requirements (see title
15, chapter 8 of this code).
      2.   Burden Of Proof: The applicant has the burden of proving that the
proposed cottage development meets all of the criteria in subsection B1 of this
section.
   C.   Application: Cottage development proposals shall be subjected to a two
(2) step process. No more than two (2) cottage developments shall be approved
in a calendar year. Preliminary applications shall be accepted at any time, but
the first two (2) submitted after January 1 shall be allowed to proceed through
the full application review and approval process if they meet the criteria
stated in subsection C1 of this section. If one or both of the first two (2)
applications in any year drop out, the next in line will be notified that the
city will accept a full application for review.
      1.   Step one preliminary application:
         a.   Each applicant should schedule a meeting with the city
administrator to discuss the location, size, and features of the proposal. No
written application is required at this point. The administrator will advise
the applicant of any known issues with respect to the location, parcel(s) to be
developed, or city facilities necessary to serve a cottage development.
         b.   The administrator will schedule a briefing for the planning
commission. The administrator will introduce the applicant and summarize the
discussion at the initial meeting. The applicant shall have the opportunity to
describe the proposal, using conceptual plans or drawings. The planning
commission may offer informal comments.
         c.   The applicant will schedule a community meeting and notify all
residents and property owners within five hundred feet (500') of the site by
mail. The applicant shall provide the mailing address list and proof of the
mailing to the city. The meeting shall be held in Orting on a weeknight. The
applicant shall be responsible for conducting the meeting and providing an
attendance list and printed transcript, and copy of a tape recording of the
meeting to the city administrator.
         d.   Upon receipt of the community meeting tape and transcript, the
administrator shall advise the applicant of any additional application
requirements beyond those specified below.
      2.   Step two full application: Submittal of an application for a cottage
development binding site plan and ADR approval shall be in accordance with
section
12-10-3 of this code and subsection
13-6-7E of this chapter. Review of the application shall be conducted as a type
4 permit as described in section
15-4-1 of this code. The community meeting transcript shall become part of the
application record for use by the city in reviewing the application. (Ord. 830,
6-28-2006; amd. Ord. 2024-1136, 12-11-2024)
13-6-6: NONCONFORMING USE PERMIT:
   A.   Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish decision criteria
and procedures to allow reasonable limited expansion and continuance of
"nonconformities" as defined in section
13-5-9 of this title. Nonconformities require a special degree of control to
ensure compliance with applicable regulations and compatibility with the
comprehensive plan, adjacent uses and the character of the surrounding areas.
Limited exceptions, expansions or changes of use are allowed after approval of
a nonconforming use permit by the city or after approval of an administrative
nonconforming use permit. (Ord. 792, 7-29-2004; amd. Ord. 830, 6-28-2006)
   B.   Nonconforming Use Permit: Exceptions to the nonconforming standards,
section
13-5-9 of this title, are allowed after city approval of a nonconforming use
permit. Any application for a building permit or land use permit affecting an
existing nonconformity shall require a nonconforming use permit. The city may
impose such conditions as deemed necessary to ensure proposals conform to the
intent of the comprehensive plan and this title.
      1.   Required Findings For Nonconforming Use Permit: The city shall grant
a nonconforming use permit if documentary evidence is provided by the applicant
to support the administrator's findings that:
         a.   Granting a nonconforming use permit is necessary to adapt the
nonconforming use and associated structures to changes in technology,
merchandising, or other generally recognized trends which affect the utility of
structures or the applicant's ability to compete;
         b.   Granting a nonconforming use permit will not introduce any
(additional) hazards or interfere with the potential development of nearby
properties in accordance with present zoning regulations;
         c.   The nonconforming use and associated structures will comply with
the requirements of subsection
13-5-9B5 of this title;
         d.   The applicant's proposal will result in improvements in
functionality or safety, or in exterior appearance, screening, access and other
features which will make the use or structure more compatible with allowed
uses; and
         e.   Granting a nonconforming use permit will not detract from the
intent of the comprehensive plan and any implementing regulation.
      2.   Abandonment: An exception to the discontinuance standards in
subsection
13-5-9I of this title may be granted by the city. Documentary evidence shall be
provided by the applicant to show that the discontinuance was beyond the
control of the applicant. If the city is satisfied by evidence that the
discontinuance was beyond the control of the applicant, nonconforming rights
shall be continued for the property or structure. The city may consider
circumstances such as, but not limited to, the following:
         a.   The property or structure has been involved in litigation.
         b.   Attempt to lease the site is ongoing due to:
            (1)   Length of time involved for marketing of premises;
            (2)   The structure is a specialized type of building requiring a
specialized type of use due to equipment, processes or configuration; or
            (3)   There is a uniqueness to the property giving the use special
operating characteristics such as its location in relationship to
transportation facilities, open spaces needed for operations or its proximity
to other critical activities such as mineral extraction. (Ord. 889, 9-8-2010)
   C.   Approval: A nonconforming use permit may be approved, approved with
additional requirements above those specified in this title, or approved with
modification of the proposal to ensure that surrounding land uses or the
character of the area are not adversely impacted.
   D.   Denial: A nonconforming use permit may be denied if the use is
incapable of complying with specific standards set forth in this title and if
any of the above required findings are not supported by evidence in record.
   E.   Application: Submittal requirements for a nonconforming use permit
shall be the same as those for a variance. (See section
13-6-3 of this chapter.) (Ord. 792, 7-29-2004; amd. Ord. 830, 6-28-2006)

13-7-14: Severability
13-7-1: FINDINGS AND PURPOSE: 
   A.   Findings. The City Council finds as follows:
      1.   Signs are a means of personal free expression;
      2.   The use and display of signs is a legitimate use of public and
private property, and is an integral part of the business and marketing
functions of the local economy and serves to promote and protect private
investments in commerce and industry, and is a necessary component of a
commercial environment;
      3.   Signs can promote the efficient transfer of information by providing
messages and information needed and sought by the public, allowing businesses
and services to identify themselves; and, ensuring that customers and other
persons may locate a business or service;
      4.   Easily read and properly designed and placed signage can be valuable
to the public by assisting with way-finding, orientation, and decision making
and therefore contribute in a positive way to the health, safety, and welfare
of the public;
      5.   In the absence of regulation, the number of signs tends to
proliferate, with property owners' desiring ever increasing numbers and sizes
of signs, leading to cluttered and aesthetically blighted property and
thoroughfares, and escalation in the size of signs erected by competing
businesses;
      6.   The competition among competing sign owners for visibility of their
signs contributes to safety hazards for both vehicles and pedestrians, and
undermines the sign owners' original purpose of presenting a clear message of
its idea or identification of its premises;
      7.   Persons exposed to signs can be overwhelmed by the number of
messages presented, and may not be able to exercise freedom of choice to
observe or ignore said messages, according to the observer's purpose;
      8.   Regulations restricting the size, material, construction, location
and number of signs can create a pleasing environment for the entire community
and enhance public safety;
      9.   Signs erected by the City are, in part, erected for the purpose of
maintaining the public safety either through direct control of traffic or
through provision of such type of signage as street signs which enable the
traveling public to know where they are located and to find where they are
going. With the exception of signs identifying government buildings and signs
providing information on government-sponsored community events, virtually all
government signs are erected purely for public safety purposes. Moreover, their
use in the public right-of-way is necessary to ensure their visibility to the
motoring public;
      10.   Public utility signs are frequently of the same nature as those
signs erected by governmental entities in that they provide necessary
information to safeguard the public from downed power lines and from street
excavations. Even where signs serve a propriety purpose, such as identifying
markings on utility poles, those signs are marked primarily for the purpose of
benefiting the public generally through identification of locations where there
may be temporary losses of power and identifying potential hazards;
      11.   Some signage has a single targeted function and identification of
such signage by description is impossible without referring to its function.
For instance, address numerals are used for the sole purpose of locating
addresses, which is of benefit to persons looking for those addresses and is
essential to public safety personnel responding to emergencies. Subdivision
signs at the entrances to subdivisions favor a similar purpose in enabling both
the traveling public and emergency personnel to quickly locate subdivision
entrances for the purpose of either visitation or responding to emergency
calls. While such signage is often referenced based upon the function it serves
within the context of this ordinance, whenever possible, it is the intent of
this ordinance to refer to signs unrelated to the content of the message
provided;
      12.   Driver distraction is a significant cause of motor vehicle
accidents leading to property damage and personal injury;
      13.   Signs visible from motor vehicles being driven upon streets in the
City have a visual impact upon the drivers of those vehicles;
      14.   Signs can overwhelm the public, unduly distract and confuse
motorists by diverting attention away from the roadway, and result in safety
threats to vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
      15.   Signs can create traffic hazards by confusing or distracting
motorists and pedestrians, or by impairing the driver's ability to see
pedestrians, obstacles, or other vehicles, or to read traffic signs;
      16.   Brightly lit signs, flashing electronic signs, and overly animated
signs waste valuable energy, contribute to light pollution, produce hazardous
glare, and create the potential for distracting or confusing motorists, thereby
negatively impacting the health, safety, and welfare of the public;
      17.   Signs which are unregulated as to size, location and appearance can
increase the level of distraction of motorists, interfere with early
identification of traffic control devices, and hinder the smooth and safe
movement of traffic;
      18.   Portable signs contribute to visual clutter and present
distractions to drivers and pedestrian users of the public sidewalks,
crosswalks and other pedestrian pathways;
      19.   Lightweight design and easy mobility of portable signs create a
potential for extraordinary safety hazards. Portable signs are often placed in
close proximity to public rights-of-way in order to optimally attract the
attention of motorists. Such placement creates visual obstruction of oncoming
pedestrian and vehicular traffic for motorist's ingressing or egressing from a
place of business;
      20.   Portable signs also have a tendency to be blown about in strong
winds causing and creating visual clutter, obstruction of pedestrian and
vehicular passage, safety hazards, and damage to landscaping;
      21.   Portable signs with electrical connections and components, if
improperly maintained, pose a serious public safety hazard;
      22.   Improperly constructed and poorly maintained signs may be safety
hazards that constitute a public health risk;
      23.   Moving signs are intended to distract the attention of drivers and
pedestrians to call attend to the message on the sign and create a greater
distraction to drivers and pedestrians than stationary signs of similar size
and appearance;
      24.   Signs can constitute aesthetic harm by cluttering the rural
landscape and highway corridors and adversely affecting the naturally scenic
views and native environment;
      25.   Signs may conceal or obstruct windows, doors, or significant
architectural features or details of buildings;
      26.   Signs can create a hazard due to collapse, fire, collision, decay
or abandonment;
      27.   Signs can obstruct firefighting or police surveillance;
      28.   Signs can arbitrarily deny the use of the lines of vision from the
public right-of way;
      29.   Regulation of signs can protect the public welfare and enhance the
appearance and economic value of the City and protect or increase property
values;
      30.   The regulatory standards set forth in this Code are consistent with
customary use in this City and will properly carry out the purposes of this
Code.
   B.   Purpose: This Chapter establishes regulations governing the
installation, alteration, relocation, maintenance, use, and removal of signs in
the City in a manner that recognizes the importance of signage for the economic
well-being of businesses within the City while promoting a quality visual
environment and protecting our views and vistas. These regulations are further
intended to balance the need to protect the public safety and welfare, the need
for a well-maintained and attractive community, the need for adequate
identification, communication and advertising; and, to protect free expression.
      Specifically, this Chapter seeks to accomplish the following:
      1.    Encourage commercial communication which is responsive to the needs
of the public in locating a business establishment by identification address,
product, and/or service information; and
      2.   Promote the enhancement of business and residential properties and
neighborhoods by fostering the erection of signs complementary to the buildings
and uses to which they relate and which are harmonious with their surroundings;
and
      3.    To protect and enhance the visual character and identity of the
community by the thoughtful placement and design of signs; and
      4.   To reflect and support the desired character and development
patterns of the various zones of the City by requiring that signs, adhere to
section
13-6-7 of this title pertaining to the architectural design style for the City.
Section
13-6-7 of this title states that these regulations are intended to implement
and further the comprehensive plan of the City by ensuring that all development
in the mixed use-town center and mixed use-town center north, and all
commercial and public development within the City limits, is designed to be
consistent with the adopted architectural theme of "turn of the century:
western or Victorian"; and
      5.    Ensure that signs, including indoor signs visible from streets or
ways open to the public, do not create obstructions to motorists by interfering
with sight lines or directional traffic signs or in any other way endanger the
safety, health, or welfare of citizens and visitors to the City; and
      6.    To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed and
maintained according to minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property
and public welfare; and
      7.   To ensure that the constitutionally guaranteed right of free speech
is protected by regulating signs in a content-neutral manner; and
      8.    To improve pedestrian and traffic safety; and
      9.   Eliminate clutter and visual distraction by ensuring signs are
appropriate in size and relationship to the subject property, street frontage
and building size; and
      10.   Allow sufficient flexibility and incentive for creative and
innovative sign designs; and
      11.   Safeguard and enhance property values, attract new residents, and
encourage orderly City development; and
      12.   Allow for limited temporary commercial signage in the public right
of way, to provide a flow of truthful and legitimate commercial information to
consumers to enable them to make vital decisions, particularly as it relates to
the purchase of a home, and to further the critical public goal of providing
for equal access to housing; and
      13.    Ensure consistency with the goals and policies of the
Comprehensive Plan.

13-7-10: SIGN VARIANCES:
Any person, business or entity seeking to utilize a sign that is not permitted
pursuant to the regulations stated in this Chapter may seek a variance from
these regulations. The planning commission reviews sign variance applications
and determines if the variances are to be granted using the following criteria:
   A.   The granting of the sign variance would not be materially detrimental
to the property owners in the vicinity, and the variance sought is of minimum
sign size, height, and scope to meet the conditions and needs of the applicant;
   B.   The granting of the variance would not be contrary to the objectives of
this Chapter and section
13-6-7 of this title;
   C.   The signage of the property in question cannot be adequately met under
the literal interpretation and strict application of this Chapter; and
   D.   The granting of the variance is necessary because of special
circumstances relating to property location, topography, shape, size, sight
distance, and limited view to property.

these regulations, in the same location affixed in a permanent manner to the
ground or the building without modification other than routine maintenance and

activity; and
      4.   The sign fails to meet one (1) or more requirements of this Chapter.
   B.   All on-site and off-site nonconforming signs not otherwise prohibited
by the provisions of this Chapter, installed prior to the year 2000, shall be
removed or altered to conform to the provisions of this Chapter when:

      2.   The nature of the business conducted on the premises changes and the
sign is changed or modified either in shape, size, or legend;
      3.   The name of the business changes and the sign is changed or modified
either in shape, size, or legend; or
      4.   The business is discontinued. In this event, the sign(s) and
supporting structure(s) shall be removed by the property owner. If said sign(s)
is not removed within the specified time period, the City may remove the sign
and file a lien against the property to cover costs associated with said
removal.
   C.   Nonconforming signs may not be enlarged or altered in a way which would
increase nonconformity.
   D.   Should any nonconforming sign be damaged by any means to an extent of
more than fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost at time of damage, it
shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this
Chapter.
   E.   A nonconforming sign as defined by this section shall be deemed lawful
subject to all requirements of this Chapter and this title with the following

the property owner of the existence of the public nuisance and shall direct the
owner to remove the sign within ten (10) calendar days after the notice.
Failure to remove the sign in accordance with the notice shall also constitute
a civil violation, in accordance with section 1-13-6 of this code. The City
shall be entitled to recover all costs of abatement from the property owner,
including attorney's fees and costs pursuing abatement for continued
violations.
      2.   The City may remove signs which violate the provisions of this
Chapter and constitute a public nuisance from public rights of way and public
property, at any time. The owner of the sign, if known, shall be given written
notice that the sign shall be destroyed if it is not claimed within ten (10)
days of the notice. Failure to remove the sign in accordance with the notice

1-13-6 of this code. The City shall be entitled to recover all costs of
abatement from the property owner, including attorney's fees and costs pursuing
abatement for continued violations.

thereof, be held as assuming such liability by reason of a permit or inspection
authorized herein or a certificate of inspection issued by the City or any of
its agents.

empted by state or federal law or regulation, such decision or pre-emption
shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Chapter or its
application to other persons or circumstances.

CHAPTER 8
MEDICAL CANNABIS
SECTION:
13-8-1: Findings
13-8-2: Definitions
13-8-3: Applicability
13-8-4: Restrictions On Medical Cannabis For Personal Use
13-8-5: Collective Gardens
13-8-6: Violations
13-8-7: Penalties
13-8-1: FINDINGS:
The council adopts all of the "whereas" sections of the ordinance codified
herein as findings to support this chapter, as well as the following:
   A.   Through its amendment/adoption of Revised Code Of Washington chapter
69.51A, the state of Washington has found that there is medical evidence to
show that some patients with terminal or debilitating medical conditions
benefit from the medical use of cannabis.
   B.   The state of Washington has determined that qualifying patients with
terminal or debilitating medical conditions, who, in the judgment of their
healthcare professionals, may benefit from the medical use of cannabis, shall
not be arrested, prosecuted or subject to other criminal sanctions or civil
consequences under state law, based solely on their medical use of cannabis,
notwithstanding any other provision of law.
   C.   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to supersede Washington
state law relating to the acquisition, possession, manufacture, sale or use of
cannabis for nonmedical purposes. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
supersede legislation prohibiting persons from engaging in conduct that
endangers others, or to condone the diversion of cannabis for nonmedical
purposes.
   D.   Cannabis plants, whether grown indoors or outdoors, especially as they
mature prior to harvest, may produce a distinctive odor that may be detectable
far beyond property boundaries.
   E.   Where cannabis plants have been grown outdoors in other states, local
authorities have received a significant number of formal complaints of odor
that may be detectable far beyond property boundaries.
   F.   Cannabis, whether grown for medicinal purposes or diverted to the black
market, may be sold for thousands of dollars per pound.
   G.   The strong smell of cannabis may create an attractive nuisance,
alerting persons to the location of the plants, and creating a risk of
burglary, robbery and armed robbery.
   H.   Cannabis that is grown indoors may require excessive use of electricity
which may overload standard electrical systems, creating an unreasonable risk
of fire.
   I.   The ability of qualified patients to cultivate cannabis in collective
gardens for medical purposes does not confer upon them the right to create or
maintain a public nuisance. No more than forty five (45) cannabis plants are
allowed on any one legal parcel, which should keep the complaints regarding
odor and the risks of fire and crime to a minimum.
   J.   Pursuant to Revised Code Of Washington 69.51A.130, no civil or criminal
liability may be imposed by any court on cities, towns, or counties or other
municipalities and their officers and employees for actions taken in good faith
under this chapter and within the scope of their assigned duties. (Ord. 941, 7-

   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate the placement, construction,
modification and appearance of wireless communications services facilities, in
order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, while not
unreasonably interfering with the deployment of competitive wireless
communications services facilities throughout the City. The purpose of this
chapter may be achieved through adherence to the following objectives:
      1.   Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts that wireless communications services facilities might create,
including but not limited to negative impacts on aesthetics, environmentally
sensitive areas, historically significant locations, and health and safety of
persons and property;
      2.   Establishment of clear and nondiscriminatory local regulations
concerning wireless communications services facilities and services that are
consistent with federal and state laws and regulations;
      3.   Encourage providers of wireless communications services facilities
to locate facilities, to the extent feasible, in areas where the adverse impact
on the public health, safety and welfare is minimal;
      4.   For macro facilities, encourage the location of those facilities in
nonresidential areas and allow macro facilities in residential areas only when
necessary to meet functional requirements of the communications industry as
defined by the Federal Communications Commission;
      5.   Minimize the total number of macro facilities in residential areas;
      6.   Encourage and, where legally permissible, require cooperation
between competitors and, as a primary option, joint use of new and existing
towers, tower sites and suitable structures to the greatest extent possible,
where doing so would significantly reduce or eliminate additional negative
impact on the City;
      7.   Ensure wireless communications services facilities are configured in
a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the facilities, as viewed
from different vantage points, through careful design, landscape screening,
minimal impact siting options and camouflaging techniques, dispersion of
unscreened features to lessen the visual impact upon any one location, and
through assessment of current location options, siting, future available
locations, and innovative siting techniques;
      8.   Enable wireless communication companies to enter into lease
agreements with the City to use city property for the placement of wireless
facilities, where consistent with other public needs, as a means to generate
revenue for the City;
      9.   Balance the City's intent to minimize the adverse impacts of
wireless communications services facilities with the ability of the providers
of communications services to deploy such services to the community quickly,
effectively and efficiently;
      10.   Provide for the prompt removal of wireless communications services
facilities that are abandoned or no longer inspected for safety concerns and
building code compliance, and provide a mechanism for the City to cause these
abandoned wireless communications services facilities to be removed as
necessary to protect the citizens from imminent harm and danger;
      11.   Avoid potential damage to people and adjacent properties from tower
failure and falling equipment, through strict compliance with state building
and electrical codes; and
      12.   Disperse the adverse impacts of small cell facilities as evenly as
possible throughout the community, especially when joint use does not minimize
additional visual impact.
   B.   In furtherance of these objectives, the City shall give due
consideration to the zoning code, existing land uses, and environmentally
sensitive areas when approving sites for the location of wireless
communications services facilities.
   C.   These objectives were developed to protect the public health, safety
and welfare, to protect property values, and to minimize and disperse visual
impact, while furthering the development of enhanced communications services in
the City. These objectives were designed to comply with the Telecommunications
Act of 1996 and its implementing regulations. The provisions of this chapter
are not intended to, and any ambiguities herein shall not be interpreted in
such a manner that would materially inhibit the deployment of wireless
communications services facilities. This chapter shall not be applied in such a
manner as to unreasonably discriminate between providers of functionally
equivalent wireless facilities.
   D.   To the extent that any provision of this chapter conflicts with any
other city ordinance, this chapter shall control. Otherwise, this chapter shall
be construed consistently with the other provisions and regulations of the
City.
   E.   In reviewing any application to place, construct or modify wireless
communications services facilities, the City shall act within federally
required time periods. Any decision to deny an application shall be in writing,
supported by substantial evidence contained in a written record. The City shall
approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application in accordance with
this title, this chapter, the adopted Orting comprehensive plan, and other
applicable ordinances and regulations.
   F.   Alternative Methods of Compliance: The City Administrator or designee
in consultation with other City staff, as applicable, may accept alternative
methods of complying with the development regulations of this chapter, provided
it can be demonstrated that the alternative method is at least equivalent to
such standards in terms of implementing the general purpose of this chapter.
The City Administrator or designee shall not accept alternative methods of
compliance that are inconsistent with the City Comprehensive Plan or with
conditions of approval imposed through a land use action. Decisions on
alternative methods of compliance need to be documented in the project file and
can be appealable in the same manner as an administrative interpretation. The
City Administrator or designee shall periodically forward decisions on
alternative methods of compliance to the Planning Commission for its
information.

(Ord. 2019-1049, 9-25-2019)
13-9-5: GENERAL MACRO FACILITY SITING CRITERIA AND DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS:
   A.   The City of Orting encourages wireless communication providers to use
existing sites or more frequent, less noticeable sites instead of attempting to
provide coverage through use of taller towers. To that end, applicants shall
consider the following priority of preferred locations for wireless
communications services facilities:
      1.   Co-location, without an increase in the height of the building, pole
or structure upon which the facility would be located;
      2.   Co-location, where additional height is necessary above existing
building, pole, or structure;
      3.   A replacement pole or structure for an existing one;
      4.   A new pole or structure altogether.
   B.   Co-location shall be encouraged for all wireless communications
services facilities applications and is implemented through less complex permit
procedures.
      1.   To the greatest extent technically feasible, applicants for new
monopole facilities shall be required to build mounts capable of accommodating
at least one other carrier.
      2.   New macro wireless communications services facilities that are not
co-located will require a conditional use permit (C) under the provisions of
section
13-6-2 of this code and shall be processed in accordance with Title 15 of this
code for a Type III permit. Separation requirements will be a condition of
approval.
   C.   Noise: Any facility that requires a generator or other device which
will create noise audible beyond the boundaries of the site must demonstrate
compliance with Chapter 5-8 of this code, Noise Control. A noise report,
prepared by an acoustical engineer, shall be submitted with any application to
construct and operate a wireless communications services facility that will
have a generator or similar device.
      The City may require that the report be reviewed by a third-party expert
at the expense of the applicant.
   D.   Business License Requirement: Any person, corporation or entity that
operates a wireless communications services facility within the City shall have
a valid business license issued annually by the City. Any person, corporation
or other business entity which owns a monopole also is required to obtain a
business license on an annual basis.
   E.   Signage: Only safety signs or those mandated by a government entity
with jurisdiction may be located on wireless communications services
facilities. No other types of signs are permitted on wireless communications
services facilities.
   F.   Any application must demonstrate that there is sufficient space for
temporary parking for regular maintenance of the proposed facility.
   G.   Finish: A monopole may be constructed of laminated wood, fiberglass,
steel, or similar material. The pole shall be a neutral color so as to reduce
its visual obtrusiveness, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or
FCC.
   H.   Design: The design of all buildings and ancillary structures shall use
materials, colors, textures, screening and landscaping that will blend the
facilities with the natural setting and built environment. All macro towers
must be approved by the Architectural Design Board.
   I.   Color: All antennas and ancillary facilities located on buildings or
structures other than monopoles shall be of a neutral color that is identical
to or closely compatible with the color of the supporting structure so as to
make the antenna and ancillary facilities as visually unobtrusive as possible.
   J.   Lighting: Monopoles shall not be artificially lighted unless required
by the FAA, FCC or other government entity with jurisdiction. If lighting is
required and alternative lighting options are permitted, the City shall review
the lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least
disturbance to the surrounding area. No strobe lighting of any type is
permitted on any monopole, unless required by the FAA.
   K.   Advertising: No advertising is permitted at wireless communications
services facilities sites or on any ancillary structure or facilities equipment
enclosure.
   L.   Equipment Enclosure: Each applicant shall use the smallest equipment
enclosure practical to contain the required equipment and a reserve for
required co-location.
   M.   Radio Frequency Emissions Compliance: The applicant shall demonstrate
that the project will not result in levels of radio frequency emissions that
exceed FCC standards, including FCC Office of Engineering Technology (OET)
Bulletin 65, Evaluating Compliance with FCC Guidelines for Human Exposure to
Radio Frequency Electromagnetic Fields, as amended.
   N.   Landscaping And Screening:
      1.   The visual impacts of wireless communications services facilities
should be mitigated and softened through landscaping or other screening
materials at the base of a monopole, facility equipment compound, equipment
enclosures and ancillary structures. If the antenna is mounted flush on an
existing building or camouflaged as part of the building and other equipment is
housed inside an existing structure, no landscaping is required. The City may
reduce or waive the standards for those sides of the wireless communications
services facilities that are not in public view, when a combination of existing
vegetation, topography, walls, decorative fences or other features achieve the
same degree of screening as the required landscaping; in locations where the
visual impact of the facility would be minimal; and in those locations where
large wooded lots not capable of subdivision and natural growth around the
property perimeter provide a sufficient buffer.
      2.   Landscaping shall be installed on the outside of fences. Existing
vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and may be used
as a substitute for or as a supplement to landscaping or screening
requirements. The following requirements apply:
         a.   A solid screen of evergreen trees or shrubs shall be placed
around the perimeter of the equipment cabinet enclosure, except that a maximum
ten-foot (10’) portion of the fence may remain without landscaping in order to
provide access to the enclosure.
         b.   Landscaping area shall be a minimum of five feet (5’) in width
around the perimeter of the enclosure.
         c.   Vegetation selected should be native and drought tolerant.
         d.   Landscaping shall be located so as not to create sight distance
hazards or conflicts with other surrounding utilities.
      3.   When landscaping is used, the applicant shall submit a performance
assurance pursuant to section
13-5-2 (H) of this code.
      4.   The use of chain link, plastic, or wire fencing is prohibited.
Ornamental metal, stone, wood, or vinyl fencing materials are preferred.
(Ord. 2019-1049, 9-25-2019)
13-9-6: PERMITS AND SHOT CLOCKS:
   A.   No person may place, construct, reconstruct, modify or operate a
wireless communications services facility, subject to this chapter, without
first having in place a master permit agreement for right-of-way locations with
a subsequent right-of-way permit and/or a building permit, as applicable,
issued in accordance with this chapter. Except as otherwise provided herein,
the requirements of this chapter are in addition to the applicable requirements
of this title and Title 8 (Public Ways and Property) and Title 11 (Critical
Areas and Shoreline Management) of this code.
   B.   Applications will be reviewed based on the type of wireless
communications services facilities requested to be permitted. Each wireless
communications services facility requires the appropriate type of project
permit review, as shown in Table A. In the event of uncertainty on the type of
a wireless facility, the City Administrator or designee shall have the
authority to determine what permits are required for the proposed facility.

   C.   Timelines:
      1.   Macro Cell: The application review period begins when all required
application materials have been received and fees paid. If the City determines
that the application is incomplete and provides notice to the applicant within
thirty (30) calendar days of the date of application, the clock stops. The
clock restarts when the City receives the applicant's supplemental submission
in response to the City's notice of incompleteness. For subsequent
determinations of incompleteness, the clock tolls (pauses) if the City provides
written notice within ten (10) days that a supplemental submission did not
provide the requested information. For new structures or monopoles, see section
13-9-5 (B)(2) above for C Permit requirement.
      2.   Small Wireless Facility (Small Cell Node): The application review
period begins when all required application materials have been received and
fees paid. If the City determines that the application is incomplete and
provides notice to the applicant within ten (10) calendar days of the date of
application, the clock stops. The clock resets to zero (0) when the City
receives the applicant's supplemental submission in response to the City's
notice of incompleteness. For subsequent determinations of incompleteness, the
clock tolls (pauses) if the City provides written notice within ten (10) days
that a supplemental submission did not provide the requested information.
   D.   Batched Small Wireless Facility (Small Cell Node) applications: If an
applicant is applying for a small wireless network in a contiguous service
area, multiple identical small wireless facilities may be batched into one
application. The City may approve, deny or conditionally approve all or any
portion of the small wireless facilities proposed in the application. The
denial of one or more small wireless facility locations within one submission
shall not be the sole basis for a denial of other locations or the entire
batched application for small wireless facilities. Should an applicant file a
single application for a batch that includes both collocated and new structures
for small wireless facilities, the longer 90-day shot clock shall apply to
ensure the City has adequate time to review the new construction sites.
   E.   Any application submitted pursuant to this chapter for projects located
on public or private property shall be reviewed and evaluated by the City as
described in this chapter. The Public Works Director or his/her designee shall
review all proposed wireless communications services facilities that are
located partially or fully within the City rights-of-way. All applications will
be reviewed and evaluated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   F.   All applications for wireless communications services facilities shall
be reviewed for compliance with the applicable design standards. Permits for
all macro towers must be approved by the Architectural Design Board.
   G.   The applicant is responsible for obtaining all other permits and
approvals from any other appropriate governing body or agency with jurisdiction
(i.e., Washington State Department of Labor and Industries, Federal Aviation
Administration, Puget Sound Energy, etc.).
   H.   No provision of this chapter shall be interpreted to allow the
installation of a wireless communications services facilities which minimizes
parking, landscaping, or other site development standards established by this
code.
   I.   Wireless communications services facilities that are governed under
this chapter shall not be eligible for variances under section
13-6-3 of this code. Any request to deviate from this chapter shall be based
solely on the exceptions set forth in this chapter, including alternative
methods of compliance under section
13-9-1 (F) of this code.
   J.   Third-Party Review: Applicants may use various methodologies and
analyses, including geographically based computer software, to determine the
specific technical parameters of the services to be provided utilizing the
proposed wireless communications services facilities, such as expected coverage
area, antenna configuration, capacity, and topographic constraints that affect
signal paths. In certain instances, a third-party expert may be needed to
review the engineering and technical data submitted by an applicant for a
permit. The City may at its discretion require third-party engineering and
technical review as part of a permitting process. The costs of the technical
third-party review shall be borne by the applicant.
      1.   The selection of the third-party expert is at the discretion of the
City. The third-party expert review is intended to address interference and
public safety issues and be a site- specific review of engineering and
technical aspects of the proposed wireless communications services facilities
and/or a review of the applicants' methodology and equipment used, and is not
intended to be a subjective review of the site which was selected by an
applicant. Based on the results of the expert review, the City may require
changes to the proposal. The third-party review shall address the following:
         a.   The accuracy and completeness of submissions;
         b.   The applicability of analysis techniques and methodologies;
         c.   The validity of conclusions reached;
         d.   The viability of other site or sites in the City for the use
intended by the applicant; and
         e.   Any specific engineering or technical issues designated by the
City.
   K.   Notwithstanding other remedies that may be available under federal law,
failure of the City to issue permits within or otherwise comply with the FCC
shot clock requirements does not provide a "deemed" grant of approval for macro
or small wireless facilities, as it does for an eligible facilities request. No
work may occur until the permit issues.
(Ord. 2019-1049, 9-25-2019)
13-9-7: APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS:

   E.   Radio Frequency (RF) emissions standards. The applicant shall provide
the certification of an RF engineer with knowledge of the proposed development
that the wireless communications services facilities will comply with RF
standards adopted by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The City
recognizes that the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 gives the FCC sole
jurisdiction in the field of regulation of RF emissions and wireless facilities
that meet FCC standards shall not be conditioned or denied on the basis of RF
impacts.
   F.   Application for architectural design review.
   G.   Any other documentation deemed necessary by the City in order to issue
a decision.
(Ord. 2019-1049, 9-25-2019)
13-9-8: ELIGIBLE FACILITIES REQUESTS:
This section implements section 6409 of the Spectrum Act (codified at 47 U.S.C.
1455), which requires the City of Orting to approve any eligible facilities
request for a modification of an existing tower or base station that does not
substantially change the physical dimensions of such tower or base station.
   A.   Definitions: The following definitions only apply to eligible
facilities requests as described in this section and do not apply throughout
this chapter.
      1.   BASE STATION: Is a structure or equipment at a fixed location that
enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user
equipment and a communications network. The term does not encompass a tower as
defined herein nor any equipment associated with a tower. Base station
includes, without limitation:
         a.   Equipment associated with wireless communications services as
well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as
microwave backhaul.
         b.   Radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable,
regular and back-up power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of
technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems ("DAS") and
small cell networks).
         c.   Any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant
application is filed (with jurisdiction) under this section, supports or houses
equipment described in subsections (A)(1)(a) and (b) of this section that has
been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or
under another State or local regulatory review process, even if the structure
was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing that support.
      The term does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant
application is filed with the City under this section, does not support or
house equipment described in subsections (A)(1)(a) and (b) of this section.
      2.   COLLOCATION: The mounting or installation of transmission equipment
on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting and/or
receiving radio frequency signals for communication purposes.
      3.   ELIGIBLE FACILITIES REQUEST: Any request for modification of an
existing tower or base station that does not substantially increase the
physical dimensions of such tower or base station, involving:
         a.   Collocation of new transmission equipment;
         b.   Removal of transmission equipment; or
         c.   Replacement of transmission equipment.
      4.   ELIGIBLE SUPPORT STRUCTURE: Any tower or base station as defined in
this section; provided, that it is existing at the time the relevant
application is filed with the City.
      5.   EXISTING: A constructed tower or base station is existing if it has
been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or
under another State or local regulatory review process; provided, that a tower
that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when
it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for purposes of this
definition.
      6.   SITE: For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the
current boundaries of the leased or owned property surrounding the tower and
any access or utility easements currently related to the site, and, for other
eligible support structures, further restricted to that area in proximity to
the structure and to other transmission equipment already deployed on the
ground.
      7.   SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE: A modification substantially changes the
physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it meets any of the
following criteria:
         a.   For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it
increases the height of the tower by more than ten percent (10%) or by the
height of one (1) additional antenna array with separation from the nearest
existing antenna, not to exceed twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater; for
other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by
more than ten percent (10%) or more than ten feet (10’), whichever is greater.
            (1)   Changes in height should be measured from the original
support structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated
horizontally, such as on buildings' rooftops; in other circumstances, changes
in height should be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station,
inclusive of originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were
approved prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act;
         b.   For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, it
involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude
from the edge of the tower more than ten feet (10’), or more than the width of
the tower structure at the level of the appurtenance, whichever is greater; for
other eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the
body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by
more than six feet (6’);
         c.   For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of
more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology
involved, but not to exceed four (4) cabinets; or, for towers in the public
streets and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment
cabinets on the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated
with the structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are
more than ten percent (10%) larger in height or overall volume than any other
ground cabinets associated with the structure;
         d.   It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site;
         e.   It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support
structure; or
         f.   It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting

STANDARDS:
   A.   Generally: Wireless communications services facilities located on the
roof or on the side of the building shall be grouped together, integrated to
the maximum possible degree with the building design, placed toward the center
of the roof and/or thoroughly screened from residential building views and from
public views using radio frequency-transparent panels. Building-mounted
wireless communications services facilities shall be painted with nonreflective
colors to match the existing surface where the antennas are mounted.
   B.   Height: The following requirements shall apply:
      1.   Mixed-Use Town Center And Mixed-Use Town Center North Zones: For
buildings at, or which exceed, the height limit of the underlying zone,
antennas shall be flush-mounted, and no portion of the antenna may extend above
the building on which it is mounted. For buildings below the height limit,
antennas may be built to the maximum height of the zone provided they are
screened consistent with the existing building in terms of color, architectural
style and material. Flush-mounted antennas may encroach into a required setback
or into the City right-of-way if a right-of-way use agreement is established
with the City. Antennas shall not project into the right-of-way by more than
two feet (2’) and shall provide a minimum clearance height of 20 feet (20’)
over any pedestrian or vehicular right-of-way.
      2.   Outside The Mixed-Use Town Center And Mixed-Use Town Center North
Zones: The maximum height of building- mounted facilities and equipment shall
not exceed ten feet (10’) above the top of the roof on which the facility is
located. This standard applies to all buildings regardless of whether they are
at or above the maximum height of the underlying zone. Such antennas must be
well integrated with the existing structure or designed to look like common
rooftop structures such as chimneys, vents and stovepipes.
   C.   Equipment Enclosure: Equipment enclosures for building-mounted wireless
communications services facilities shall first be located within the building
on which the facility is located. If an equipment enclosure within the building
is reasonably unavailable, then an equipment enclosure may be incorporated into
the roof design provided the enclosure meets the height requirement for the
zone. If the equipment can be screened by placing the equipment below existing
parapet walls, no additional screening is required. If screening is required,
then the screening must be consistent with the existing building in terms of
color, architectural style and material. Finally, if there is no other choice
but to locate the equipment enclosure on the ground, the equipment must be
enclosed within an accessory structure which meets the setbacks of the
underlying zone and be screened in accordance this chapter.
   D.   Feed Lines And Coaxial Cables: Feed lines and cables should be located
below the parapet of the rooftop, if present. If the feed lines and cables are
visible from a public right-of-way or adjacent property, they must be painted
to match the color scheme of the building.

CHAPTER 10
ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN REVIEW
SECTION:
13-10-1: Architectural Design Review
13-10-1: ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN REVIEW:
   A.   Purpose: These regulations are intended to implement and further the
comprehensive plan of the city by ensuring that all development in the mixed
use-town center and mixed use-town center north, and all commercial and public
development within the city limits, is designed to be consistent with the
adopted theme of "turn of century: western or Victorian". All new installation,
replacement, construction, renovation, remodel or alteration of, or other
modifications to, buildings, miscellaneous structures and street furniture
located on private property, public ways and other exterior public property in
the mixed use-town center and mixed use-town center north; all buildings,
miscellaneous structures and street furniture located on private property,
public ways and other exterior public property used for commercial business or
public facilities within the city limits; all multi-family buildings (which
expressly does not include duplexes) and cottage developments within the city
limits; and, all signs made subject to the requirements of this section
pursuant to chapter 7 of this title, are subject to architectural design review
and approval as described in this section. These regulations are adopted for
the following purposes:
      1.   To promote the public welfare and to provide for the enhancement of
the city and its development in keeping with its historical heritage;
      2.   To attract visitors to the city;
      3.   To improve the visual quality of site development and architecture
of private and public buildings, recognizing the interdependence of land
values, aesthetics and good site planning;
      4.   To minimize discordant and unsightly development, to avoid
inappropriate and poor quality building designs, to enhance the beauty and
balance of the community, which are proper and necessary concerns of city
government;
      5.   To promote economic and environmental well being through the
distinctive character and natural attractiveness of the city; and
      6.   To recognize environmental and aesthetic design as an integral part
of the planning and development process.
   B.   Exemptions: The regulations in this section do not apply to landmarks,
in-kind maintenance, repair, or replacement activities on, or of, existing
structures, signs, street furniture, paint, or other exterior features,
existing as of the time of adoption of this chapter, that are otherwise subject
to these guidelines.
   C.   Turn Of Century: Western Or Victorian: A style of building,
architecture and exterior lighting used in the city and the area from statehood
in 1889, through World War I, adopted as the architectural theme for all
buildings in the mixed use town center (MUTC) zone and all commercial buildings
in all other zones. Examples of such architectural style may be found in the
following publications:
      1.   "The History Of The Town Of Orting", Alice Rushton, Warren's
Printing And Graphic Arts Center, Olympia, Washington.
      2.   "Historic Preservation Of Tacoma", city of Tacoma, department of
community development, Tacoma, Washington, 1979.
      3.   "Ghost Towns Of The West", William Carter, Sunset Publishing
Corporation, Menlo Park, California, 1992.
      4.   "A Victorian Housebuilders Guide", George E. Woodward and Edward G.
Thompson, Dover Publications, Inc., 31 E. 2nd St., Mineola, NY 11501, 1988.
      Copies of said publications, exterior paint color charts, and similar
related reference works shall be available at the Orting City Hall for review
by the public.
   D.   Architectural Design Review And Approval: Any building, structure,
development, sign or other property subject to ADR and approval pursuant to
this section shall conform in exterior design to the turn of century: Western
or Victorian theme according to the design standards adopted by the city. No
building or sign permit shall be issued for any installation, replacement,
construction, renovation, alteration or remodel of, or other modifications to,
any building, structure, development or sign subject to ADR and approval
pursuant to this section, without first obtaining architectural design approval
pursuant to the requirements of this section; this requirement does not
overwhelm nonconforming rights that may apply to a structure as governed by OMC
13-5-9. Evaluation of a project, and the Planning Commission's resulting
decision on an application for architectural design review (ADR) will be based
on an application's consistency with the guidelines, standards, or criterion
set forth in the ADR Guidelines (adopted by reference herein) or in this
chapter.
      1.   ADR applications shall be processed in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this section and Title 15 of this code. Staff shall
consult the applicant during the review of the ADR permit, as needed, to verify
details of the application. The Planning Commission shall, during no more than
one public meeting, review and consider the final submittal for the ADR
application, the staff report, any comments or submittals from the public or
applicant, the provisions of this chapter and other applicable provisions of
this code, the city of Orting Comprehensive Plan, and any other applicable
laws, rules, regulations and design standards. The planning commission, based
on the above-stated considerations, shall either approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the submittal with written findings. Approvals may be
conditioned by the planning commission to resolve any inconsistencies between
the proposal and the ADR standards. The decision of the planning commission may
be appealed as per title 15, chapter 10 of this code.
   E.   Architectural Design Review Standards: The following standards shall be
employed in determining whether the application is consistent with turn of
century: Western or Victorian design theme:
      1.   Relationship To Building Site:
         a.   The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition
with the streetscape and to facilitate pedestrian movement. This can be
achieved by:
            (1)   Installing planted areas or planter boxes separating the
building from the pedestrian path;
            (2)   Installing outdoor customer seating or plaza area;
            (3)   Locating parking behind or between buildings, when feasible;
            (4)   Locating service areas in a manner which is screened from
public view; or
            (5)   Through other methods of connecting the site to its fronting
street and pedestrian paths proposed by the applicant.
         b.   The height and scale of each building shall be compatible with
its site and adjoining buildings. This can be achieved by:
            (1)   Maintaining alignment of horizontal elements along adjoining
buildings, including window heights, windowsills, moldings, or height of
commercial ground floor space; or
            (2)   Through other methods of creating consistency among the scale
of a building and its surrounding buildings proposed by the applicant.
      2.   Relationship Of Building And Site To Adjoining Area:
         a.   Harmony in design with adjoining areas in materials, building
scale, and other architectural design features is encouraged. This can be
achieved by:
            (1)   Paint that is complementary and contrasting to adjoining
structures;
            (2)   Using building materials, colors, textures, and other design
features that vary from adjoining buildings; or
            (3)   Through other methods of creating consistency among the scale
of the building and its surrounding buildings proposed by the applicant.
         b.   Attractive landscape transitions to adjoining properties will be
provided. This can be achieved by:
            (1)   Adhering to the "Landscaping & Site Treatment" provisions in
the ADR Guidelines and as codified in OMC 13-10-1(E)(3).
      3.   Landscape And Site Treatment:
         a.   Preserve existing physical features through site design and
create inviting landscaped areas. Inviting landscaped areas include those that:
            (1)   Include street trees listed on the City's Approved Street
Tree List, or other trees approved through the ADR permitting process;
            (2)   Include plantings that are maintained to not obstruct
walkways or limit pedestrian movement;
            (3)   Do not include nuisance species, which are chiefly those with
thorns, spines, spinose teeth, or prickles, and
            (4)   Do not include any species included on the State or County
noxious weed lists.
            The City maintains all above-referenced lists at City Hall and can
provide them, on request.
         b.   Design landscape treatments that enhance architectural features,
strengthen vistas, and provide shade. This can be accomplished by:
            (1)   Installing landscaping in a manner that frames views of
vistas. When landscaping to frame views of vistas, applicants are encourage to
select deciduous species; or
            (2)   Using landscaping to add depth, texture, or interruption to a
building façade; or
            (3)   Through other methods of designing landscape treatments to
enhance architectural features, strengthen vistas, and provide shade proposed
by the applicant.
         c.   Provide screening of service areas using landscaping, fences,
walls, or a combination thereof. In this context, service areas shall be
considered "screened" provided an opaque fence of at least six feet (6') in
height, or similar vegetative or structural screening, separates the service
area from public view.
         d.   Provide exterior lighting that is subtle and attractive and that
enhances the building and site. This can be achieved by:
            (1)   Shielding light sources so that light bulbs do not extend
below the horizontal plane of the bottom of the shield; or
            (2)   On lighting affixed to structures, directing light at an
angle toward the structure; or
            (3)   Selecting era-appropriate lighting fixture styles. Lighting
fixture styles representative of the early twentieth century typify Orting's
adopted architectural theme and are encouraged; these include carriage lamp
fixtures and gaslights of wrought iron and glass.
      4.   Building Design: The adopted architectural theme in Orting is "turn
of century: Western or Victorian". The Planning Commission's evaluation of a
project design will include a review of the building design's consistency with
the following standards:
         a.   Western architecture of the 1800s and early 1900s usually
involved wooden false front effects, wooden porches, cornices, and wooden post
supported canopies. Building styles also included    exteriors of masonry,
brick, and stone. Dimensional lumber or rough sawn unplugged plywood with
wooden batts, spaced not more than eighteen inches (18") on center, can be used
as an exterior building material, as well as masonry, brick, and stone. Siding
with metal, T1-11, particle board, chipboard, and other similar wood product is
prohibited.
         b.   On site construction is the preferred building method for
commercial structures subject to this chapter. The use of factory-built
structures, mobile homes, and trailers is discouraged because of the difficulty
in modifying them to meet the requirements of this chapter. Construction
trailers are allowed temporarily and must comply with OMC 13-4-2.
         c.   The front facade of the building shall provide a well-
proportioned and interesting three-dimensional spatial quality. In this
context, "well-proportioned and interesting" can be achieved by incorporating
one or more of the following:
            (1)   Horizontal Or Vertical Shifts.
               (A)   A façade may not exceed eighty feet (80') in length
without a horizontal shift in the building footprint measuring one-tenth of the
façade length. A shift alteration in the roof design shall accompany horizontal
shifts.
               (B)   No single run of ridge, cornice, or fascia (excluding
eaves) may exceed eighty feet (80') in length without a five-foot transition in
height. Cupolas and other minor projections above roof lines do not meet the
vertical shift requirement.
            (2)   Visual Terminus To Tops Of Buildings.
               (A)   A roof must have a minimum 4/12 pitch with eaves extending
at least two feet (2') beyond exterior building walls, or must be a flat roof
with projecting cornices.
            (3)   Use false fronts to enhance the front façade of low-rise
buildings with flat rooflines.
            (4)   Through other methods of designing the building to be well-
proportioned and interesting proposed by the applicant.
         d.   All facades of the building shall be compatible with the front
facade. This can be achieved by:
            (1)   Maintaining alignment of horizontal elements along facades,
including window heights, windowsills, moldings, or height of commercial ground
floor space.
            (2)   Using building materials, colors, textures, and other design
features similar to the front façade.
            (3)   Incorporating other design solutions that create
compatibility among all building facades proposed by the applicant.
         e.   Canopies, awnings or marquees can be pitched and covered with
shake shingles or other period material. Flat canopies/porches enclosed by an
ornate wooden banister and toprail are allowed. Ornate banisters and trim may
be used to enhance building design as representative of the adopted design
theme, "turn of the century: Western or Victorian."
         f.   Window shapes shall be square, arched, or rectangular and shall
incorporate grids creating the appearance of more than one window pane. A
wooden window frame with mullions, grilles, muntins, or similar material
creating the appearance of multiple panes is appropriate. Decorative pediments
and sills may be used to enhance window design as representative of Orting's
adopted design theme, "turn of the century: Western or Victorian."
         g.   Colors shall be harmonious with adjacent buildings and
characteristics of colors used in the early 1900s. City of Orting Planning
staff maintain a color palette of acceptable colors for use in Orting that can
be provided to applicants for reference of permissible exterior paint colors.
      5.   Signs: The following standards may be used by the Planning
Commission to interpret and apply the provisions of OMC 13-7-4 to site specific
conditions:
         a.   Signs are part of the architectural theme. Size, materials,
color, lettering, location, number, and arrangement shall be characteristic of
the early 1900s;
         b.   The number and size of signs shall be minimized to avoid visual
clutter;
         c.   All exterior signs subject to ADR shall comply with the
provisions of this section and chapter 7 of this title. The following signs
shall be exempt:
            (1)   Flags, insignias, the United States flag are exempt, not to
include flutter signs (as they are defined in OMC 13-7-2);
            (2)    Commemorative plaques with engraved lettering less than one
inch (1") in height;
            (3)   Window signs;
            (4)   Temporary signs, provided they are used for only a period of
less than thirty (30) days. Temporary signs are limited in size to six (6)
square feet per side of the sign or twelve (12) square feet in area in total.
Only one temporary sign visible from the public right-of-way is allowed per
tenant in a commercial space;
         d.   Illuminated exterior signs are not characteristic of early 1900s
design and shall not be allowed as the primary business sign; and
         e.   Signs are preferred to be illuminated by indirect lighting which
shall be lighted in such a manner that glare from the light source is not
visible to pedestrian or vehicle traffic.
   F.   Applications: Applications for ADR shall be submitted to the City and
processed as a Type 2a permit application in accordance with OMC 15-4-2. ADRs

feedback of the Planning Commission. ADR Preapplication meetings are offered at
no charge to the applicant.
      Participation in an ADR Preapplication meeting could afford an
opportunity for the applicant to incorporate any feedback from staff and
Planning Commission into its proposal before applying for an ADR permit. The
ADR Preapplication is voluntary; it does not constitute a formal required
component of the design review process, and its review by the Planning
Commission does not amount to the limit of one public meeting allowed for
review of ADR applications set forth via OMC 13-10-1(G).
   I.   Financial Security: The city may require a reasonable bond, letter of
credit, assignment of funds or similar financial instrument, to secure the
installation of required improvements that are a condition of design review
approval.
   J.   Time Limit: Unless the owner submits a fully completed building or sign
permit application necessary to bring about the approved installation,
replacement, construction, renovation, alteration, remodel, or other
modifications, or if no building or sign permit application is required,
substantially commences the uses allowed, within eighteen (18) months from the
date of ADR approval, such ADR approval shall expire and be null and void. For
the purposes of this section, the date of approval shall be the date on which
the final written decision of the Planning Commission as adopted is transmitted
to the applicant. In the event of appeal, the date of approval shall be the
date on which a final decision is entered by the City Council or court of
competent jurisdiction. A request for extension may be granted as a minor
amendment in accordance with section 15-12-2 of this code; provided that, a
written request is submitted at least thirty (30) calendar days prior to the
expiration date, the extension is for no longer than twelve (12) months, and
good cause in the opinion of the Administrator is shown for the requested
      extension. The applicant is responsible for knowledge of the expiration
date. (Ord. 886, 9-8-2010; amd. Ord. 943, 5-14-2014; Ord. 2019-1057, 1-8-2020;

14-1-1: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state of Washington has delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city of
Orting does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord.
913, 9-28-2011)
14-1-2: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   Areas of Orting are subject to periodic inundation and channel
migration which results in loss of life and property, health, and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for protection and relief from flooding and channel migration, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.
   B.   When floodplains and watersheds are developed without taking
appropriate care and precautions, flood heights, frequencies, and velocities
increase, causing a greater threat to humans, damage to property, destruction
of natural floodplain functions, and adverse impacts to water quality and
habitat.
   C.   Rivers, streams, lakes, estuarine and marine areas and their
floodplains are major elements of healthy aquatic and riparian habitats and
conveyance of floodwaters. If watersheds, rivers, streams, lakes, estuaries,
floodplains and other systems are not viewed holistically as biological and
geomorphologic units, it can lead to serious degradation of habitat and
increased flood hazards to people and human development.
   D.   Over the years, natural processes have evolved that manage floodwaters
and channel flows in the most effective and efficient manner. Disruption of
these processes by altering land cover, stream channels, wetlands, and other
water bodies leads to increased flood hazards, loss of life and property,
threats to public health, and loss of habitat. (Ord. 2017-1006, 2-22-2017)
14-1-3: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life, health, safety and welfare from the dangers of
flooding;
   B.   To the extent possible, retain the natural channel, shoreline, and
floodplain creation processes and other natural floodplain functions that
protect, create, and maintain habitat for threatened and endangered species;
   C.   Prevent or minimize loss of hydraulic, geomorphic, and ecological
functions of floodplains and stream channels;
   D.   Minimize expenditure of public money and costly flood control projects;
   E.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   F.   Minimize prolonged business and governmental interruptions;
   G.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, roadways, and bridges and
culverts located in areas of special flood hazard;
   H.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   I.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard;
   J.   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   K.   Qualify the city for participation in the national flood insurance
program, thereby giving citizens and businesses the opportunity to purchase
flood insurance;
   L.   Maintain the quality of water in rivers, streams, lakes, estuaries, and
marine areas and their floodplains so as to protect public water supplies,
areas of the public trust, and wildlife habitat protected by the endangered
species act;
   M.   Retain the natural channel, shoreline, and floodplain creation
processes and other natural floodplain functions that protect, create, and
maintain habitat for threatened and endangered species; and
   N.   Prevent or minimize loss of hydraulic, geomorphic, and ecological
functions of floodplains and stream channels. (Ord. 2017-1006, 2-22-2017)
14-1-4: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
This chapter shall apply to the regulatory floodplain, which is comprised of
the special flood hazard area and all protected areas within the jurisdiction
of the city.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   A.   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   B.   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage throughout their intended
life span;
   C.   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   D.   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage;
   E.   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas;
   F.   Defining and clarifying the terms and phrases used in section
14-1-5 of this chapter;
   G.   Identifying the regulatory floodplain, the special flood hazard area,
and the protected area and the supporting technical data needed to delineate
those areas;
   H.   Establishing a permit requirement in section
14-1-8 of this chapter so that all human development that may affect flood
hazards, water quality, and habitat are reviewed before it is constructed;
   I.   Setting minimum protection standards in section
14-1-10 of this chapter for all development to ensure that the development will
not increase the potential for flood damage or adversely affect natural
floodplain functions; and
   J.   Setting minimum standards to protect new and substantially improved
structures from flood damage in section
14-1-9 of this chapter. (Ord. 2017-1006, 2-22-2017)

NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, structures for which the
"start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date hereof and
includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
PARTICIPATING COMMUNITY: Also known as an eligible community, means a community
in which FEMA has authorized the sale of flood insurance.
PROTECTED AREA: Comprised of those lands that lie within the boundaries of the
floodway, the riparian habitat zone, and the channel migration zone. Because of

flood hazard area is also referred to as the area of special flood hazard or
SFHA subject to a one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in a given
year.
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement or other improvement was
within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing and grading; nor does it include
the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
a basement, footings, piers, or foundation or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main

cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred. Substantial damage also means flood related damage sustained
by a structure on two (2) separate occasions during a ten (10) year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average,
equals or exceeds twenty five percent (25%) of the value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT:
   A.   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure either:
      1.   Before the improvement or repair is started, or
      2.   If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement"
is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor,
or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that
alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
   B.   The term does not, however, include either:
      1.   Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which has been
previously identified by the local code enforcement official and which is
solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      2.   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter.
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the
elevation certificate, or other certifications, or other evidence of compliance
required in this chapter is presumed to be a violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.
WATER DEPENDENT: A structure for commerce or industry which cannot exist in any
other location and is dependent on the water by reason of the intrinsic nature
of its operations.
WATER TYPING: A system for classifying water bodies according to their size and
fish habitat characteristics. The Washington department of natural resources'
forest practices water typing classification system (222-16 WAC) is hereby
adopted by reference. The system defines four (4) water types:
   A.   Type "S" = Shoreline: Streams that are designated "shorelines of the
state", including marine shorelines.
   B.   Type "F" = Fish: Streams that are known to be used by fish or meet the
physical criteria to be potentially used by fish.
   C.   Type "Np" = Nonfish perennial streams.
   D.   Type "Ns" = Nonfish seasonal streams.
ZONE: One or more areas delineated on the FIRM. The following zones may be used
on the adopted FIRM. The special flood hazard area (SFHA) is comprised of the A
and V zones.
   A: SFHA where no base flood elevation is provided.
   A#: Numbered A zones (e.g., A7 or A14), SFHA with a base flood elevation.
   AE: SFHA with a base flood elevation.
   AO: SFHA subject to inundation by shallow flooding usually resulting from
sheet flow on sloping terrain, with average depths between one and three feet
(3'). Average flood depths are shown.
   AH: SFHA subject to inundation by shallow flooding (usually areas of
ponding) with average depths between one and three feet (3'). Base flood
elevations are shown.
   B: The area between the SFHA and the 500-year flood of the primary source of
flooding. It may also be an area with a local, shallow flooding problem or an
area protected by a levee.
   C: An area of minimal flood hazard, as above the 500-year flood level of the
primary source of flooding. B and C zones may have flooding that does not meet
the criteria to be mapped as a special flood hazard area, especially ponding
and local drainage problems.
   D: Area of undetermined but possible flood hazard.
   V: The SFHA subject to coastal high hazard flooding including waves of three
feet (3') or greater in height. There are three (3) types of V zones: V, V#,
and VE, and they correspond to the A zone designations.

14-1-6: GENERAL PROVISIONS:
   A.   Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This chapter shall apply to the
regulatory floodplain, which is comprised of the special flood hazard area and
all protected areas within the city.
   B.   Basis For Establishing The Special Flood Hazard Area: The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the federal insurance administration in a
scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study For
Pierce County And Incorporated Areas" dated March 7, 2017, and any revisions
thereto, with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM) and any revisions
thereto are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this
chapter. The flood insurance study and the FIRM special flood hazard area
(SFHA) is the area subject to flooding by the base flood and subject to the
provisions of this chapter. The flood insurance study and the FIRM are on file
at city offices at 110 Train Street SE.
Upon receipt of a floodplain development permit application, the floodplain
administrator shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood
elevation. A development project is not subject to the requirements of this
chapter if it is located on land that can be shown to be:
      1.   Outside the protected area, and
      2.   Higher than the base flood elevation.
The administrator shall inform the applicant that the project may still be
subject to the flood insurance purchase requirements unless the owner receives
a letter of map amendment from FEMA.
   C.   Flood Hazard Data:
      1.   Base Flood Elevation For SFHAs In The City Of Orting: The base flood
elevation for the SFHAs of the city of Orting shall be as delineated on the
100-year flood profiles in the adopted Pierce County flood insurance study and
FIRM.
      2.   Base Flood Elevations For SFHAs In The AH Or AO Zone: The base flood
elevation for each SFHA delineated as a "zone AH" or "zone AO" shall be that
elevation (or depth) delineated on the flood insurance rate map. Where base
flood depths are not available in zone AO, the base flood elevation shall be
considered to be two feet (2') above the highest grade adjacent to the
structure.
      3.   Base Flood Elevation For Other SFHAs: The "base flood elevation" for
all other SFHAs shall be as defined in section
14-1-5 of this chapter.
      4.   Flood Protection Elevation: The flood protection elevation (FPE)
shall be the base flood elevation plus one foot (1').
      5.   Uses Of Other Base Flood Data: When base flood elevation data has
not been provided (in A or V zones) in accordance with subsection B of this
section, the city shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source,
in order to administer subsections
14-1-9B and C of this chapter.
   D.   Protected Area:
      1.   The protected area is comprised of those lands that lie within the
boundaries of the floodway, the riparian habitat zone, and the channel
migration area.
      2.   In riverine areas, where a floodway has not been designated in
accordance with this chapter the protected area is comprised of those lands
that lie within the boundaries of the riparian habitat zone, the channel
migration area, and the SFHA.
   E.   Riparian Habitat Zone: The riparian habitat zone includes those
watercourses within the SFHA and adjacent land areas that are likely to support
aquatic and riparian habitat.
      1.   The size and location of the riparian habitat zone is dependent on
the type of water body. The riparian habitat zone includes the water body and
adjacent lands, measured perpendicularly from ordinary high water on both sides
of the water body:

and marine shorelines: Two hundred feet (200').
         c.   Type F streams less than five feet (5') wide and lakes: One
hundred fifty feet (150').
         d.   Type N (nonsalmonid bearing) perennial and seasonal streams with
unstable slopes: Two hundred twenty five feet (225').
         e.   All other type N (nonsalmonid bearing) perennial and seasonal
streams: One hundred fifty feet (150').
      2.   The riparian habitat zone shall be delineated on the site plan by
the applicant at the time of application for subdivision approval or floodplain
development permit for all development proposals within three hundred feet
(300') of any stream or shoreline.
   F.   Channel Migration Area: In areas with base flood elevations (but a
regulatory floodway has not been designated), no new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
zones A1-30 and AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing or
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot (1') at any point.
      1.   The channel migration area shall be the channel migration zone as
delineated by Pierce County.
   G.   New Regulatory Data:
      1.   All requests to revise or change the flood hazard data, including
requests for a letter of map revision and a conditional letter of map revision
shall be reviewed by the administrator.
         a.   The administrator shall not sign the community acknowledgment
form for any requests for development, unless the applicant for the letter
documents that such development is in compliance with this chapter.
      2.   Where base flood elevation data are not available, applicants for
approval of new subdivisions and other proposed developments (including
proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than fifty (50)
lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include such data with
their permit applications.
      3.   Where channel migration zone data are not available in accordance
with this chapter, the permit applicant shall either:
         a.   Designate the entire SFHA as the channel migration zone; or
         b.   Identify the channel migration zone for the area one river mile
upstream to one river mile downstream of the site in accordance with "Regional
Guidance For NFIP-ESA Floodplain Mapping", published by FEMA region X.
      4.   All new hydrologic and hydraulic flood studies conducted pursuant to
this chapter shall consider future conditions and the cumulative effects from
anticipated future land use changes in accordance with "Regional Guidance For
Hydrologic And Hydraulic Studies In Support Of The Model Ordinance For
Floodplain Management Under The National Flood Insurance Program And The
Endangered Species Act", FEMA region X, 2010.
   H.   Floodways:
      1.   Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, and other development is prohibited unless certification by a
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering
practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is
prohibited within designated floodways, except for: a) repairs, reconstruction,
or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and
b) repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which
does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
either:
         a.   Before the repair, or reconstruction is started, or
         b.   If the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before
the damage occurred.
Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of
state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been
identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or to structures identified as
historic places, may be excluded in the fifty percent (50%).
      3.   If subsections H1 and H2 of this section are satisfied, all new
construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable
flood hazard reduction provisions of section
14-1-10 of this chapter.
   I.   Penalties For Noncompliance:
      1.   Compliance; Violation A Misdemeanor: No structure or land shall
hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
Violation of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any of
its requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established
in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor.
      2.   Penalty Imposed: Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject
to penalty as provided in section
1-4-1 of this code, for each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and
expenses involved in the case.
      3.   Remedial Action: Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city
from taking such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any
violation.
   J.   Abrogation Of Greater Restrictions: This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   K.   Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this chapter,
all provisions shall be:
      1.   Considered as minimum requirements;
      2.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      3.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   L.   Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the city, any officer or employee thereof, or FEMA, for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made hereunder.
   M.   Severability: The provisions of this section shall be deemed separable
and the invalidity of any portion of this chapter shall not affect the validity
of the remainder. (Ord. 2017-1010, 3-6-2017)
14-1-7: HABITAT IMPACTS:
   A.   Nondevelopment Activities: Activities that do not meet the definition
of "development" are allowed in the regulatory floodplain without the need for
a floodplain development permit under this chapter, provided all other federal,
state, and local requirements are met. The following are examples of activities
not considered development or "manmade changes to improved or unimproved real
estate".
      1.   Routine maintenance of landscaping that does not involve grading,
excavation, or filling;
      2.   Removal of noxious weeds and hazard trees and replacement of
nonnative vegetation with native vegetation;
      3.   Normal maintenance of structures, such as reroofing and replacing
siding, provided such work does not qualify as a substantial improvement;
      4.   Normal maintenance of aboveground utilities and facilities, such as
replacing downed power lines and utility poles;

repaving, and installing signs and traffic signals, but not including expansion
of paved areas; and
      6.   Normal maintenance of a levee or other flood control facility
prescribed in the operations and maintenance plan for the levee or flood
control facility are allowed in the regulatory floodplain without need for a
floodplain development permit. Normal maintenance does not include repair from
flood damage, expansion of the prism, expansion of the face or toe or addition
for protection on the face or toe with rock armor.
   B.   Activities Allowed With A Floodplain Permit: The following activities
are allowed in the regulatory floodplain without the habitat impact assessment
required under subsection C of this section, providing all other requirements
of this chapter are met, including obtaining a floodplain development permit:
      1.   Repairs or remodeling of an existing structure, provided that the
repairs or remodeling are not a substantial improvement or a repair of
substantial damage.
      2.   Expansion of an existing structure that is no greater than ten
percent (10%) beyond its existing footprint, provided that the repairs or
remodeling are not a substantial improvement or a repair of substantial damage.
This measurement is counted cumulatively from the effective date hereof. If the
structure is in the floodway, there shall be no change in the dimensions
perpendicular to flow.
      3.   Activities with the sole purpose of creating, restoring or enhancing
natural functions associated with floodplains, streams, lakes, estuaries,
marine areas, habitat, and riparian areas that meet federal and state
standards, provided the activities do not include buildings, liquid or gas
storage tanks, or impervious surfaces.
      4.   Development of open space and recreational facilities, such as
parks, trails, and hunting grounds, that do not include structures, fill,
impervious surfaces or removal of more than five percent (5%) of the native
vegetation on that portion of the property in the regulatory floodplain.
      5.   Repair to on site septic systems provided the ground disturbance is
the minimum necessary.
   C.   Habitat Impact Assessment: Unless allowed under subsections A and B of
this section, a permit application to develop in the regulatory floodplain
shall include an assessment of the impact of the project on federal, state or
locally protected species and habitat, water quality and aquatic and riparian
habitat. The assessment shall be:
      1.   A biological evaluation or biological assessment developed per 50
CFR 402.12 to initiate federal interagency consultation under endangered
species act section 7(a)(2); or
      2.   Documentation that the activity fits within section 4(d) of the
endangered species act; or
      3.   Documentation that the activity fits within a habitat conservation
plan approved pursuant to section 10 of the endangered species act, where any
such assessment has been prepared or is otherwise made available; or
      4.   An assessment prepared in accordance with "Regional Guidance For
Floodplain Habitat Assessment And Mitigation", FEMA region X, 2010. The
assessment shall determine if the project would adversely affect:
         a.   Species that are federal, state or local listed as threatened or
endangered,
         b.   The primary constituent elements for critical habitat, when
designated,
         c.   Essential fish habitat designated by the national marine
fisheries service,
         d.   Fish and wildlife habitat conservation areas,
         e.   Other protected areas and elements necessary for species
conservation.
   D.   Habitat Mitigation Plan:
      1.   If the assessment conducted under subsection C of this section
concludes the project is expected to have an adverse effect on water quality
and/or aquatic or riparian habitat or habitat functions, the applicant shall
provide a plan to mitigate those impacts, in accordance with "Regional Guidance
For Floodplain Habitat Assessment And Mitigation", FEMA region X, 2010.
         a.   If the project is located outside the protected area, the
mitigation plan shall include such avoidance, minimization, restoration, or
compensation measures as are appropriate for the situation.
         b.   No new stream crossings are allowed within the special flood
hazard zone, but outside the protected area.
         c.   If the project is located in the protected area, the mitigation
plan shall stipulate avoidance measures as are needed to ensure that there is
no adverse effect during any phase of the project.
      2.   The plan's habitat mitigation activities shall be incorporated into
the proposed project. The floodplain development permit shall be based on the
redesigned project and its mitigation components.
      3.   The floodplain administrator shall not issue a certification of use
or a certificate of occupancy until all work identified in the biological
evaluation, biological assessment, or mitigation plan has been completed or the
applicant has provided the necessary assurance that unfinished portions of the
project will be completed. (Ord. 913, 9-28-2011)

basis on a current FEMA floodproofing certificate (FEMA form 81-65),
professional engineer, currently licensed in the state of Washington.
   D.   Development Permits: All required land use and building permits granted
by the city shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter.
      1.   Establishment; Development Permit Required: A development permit
shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of
special flood hazard established in this chapter. The permit shall be for all
structures including manufactured homes, as set forth in this chapter, and for
all development including fill and other activities, also as set forth in this
chapter.
      2.   Application For Development Permit: Application for a development
permit shall be made on forms furnished by the city and may include, but not be
limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:
         a.   Elevations of the area of development in relation to mean sea
level (such as a contour map) for both existing and proposed development;
         b.   Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement) of all structures;

         f.   Certification by a registered professional surveyor that the
floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing
criteria in subsection
14-1-9B2 of this chapter;
         g.   Existing and proposed infrastructure. If the proposed project
includes a new structure, substantial improvement, or repairs to a
substantially damaged nonresidential structure that will be dry floodproofed,
the application shall include the FPE for the building site and the elevation
in relation to the datum of the effective FIRM to which the structure will be
dry floodproofed and a certification by a registered professional engineer or
licensed architect that the dry floodproofing methods meet the floodproofing
criteria;
         h.   Description of the extent to which a watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development;
         i.   Description of the extent to which a stream, lake, or other water
body, including its shoreline, will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development;

habitat areas identified for conservation or protection under state or federal
or local laws or regulations (e.g., endangered species act, Magnuson-Stevens
fishery conservation and management act, growth management act, shorelines
management act, priority habitat and species list);
         k.   Existing native vegetation and proposed revegetation;
         l.   Documentation that the applicant will apply for all necessary
permits required by federal, state, or local law. The application shall include
written acknowledgment that the applicant understands that the final
certification of use or certificate of occupancy will be issued only if the
applicant provides copies of the required federal, state, and local permits or
letters stating that a permit is not required. The floodplain permit is not
valid if those other permits and approvals are not obtained prior to any ground
disturbing work or structural improvements; and
         m.   Acknowledgment by the applicant that representatives of any
federal, state or local unit of government with regulatory authority over the
project are authorized to enter upon the property to inspect the development.
      3.   Construction Stage: If the floodplain encroaches five feet (5') into
the subject property line, then a flood floor elevation certificate will be
required. Upon placement of the lowest floor, or floodproofing by whatever
means, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain
management administrator a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor
or floodproofed elevation, as built in relation to mean sea level. A registered
land surveyor who is authorized to certify such information in the state of
Washington shall prepare said certification. Any work undertaken prior to the
submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk.
The administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation and floodproofing
certificate. Should these documents be found not in conformance with the
requirements of this chapter the permit holder shall immediately cease further
work, and shall correct the deficiencies. Failure of the permit holder to
submit the surveyed lowest floor elevation and floodproofing certificates, and
failure to correct said deficiencies required, shall be the cause to issue a
stop work order for the project.
   E.   Administration By City; Grant Or Deny Permits: The city is hereby
appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying
development permit applications in accordance with its provisions.
   F.   Duties And Responsibilities Of City: Duties of the city shall include,
but not be limited to:
      1.   Alteration Of Watercourses:
         a.   Notify adjacent communities and the Washington state department
of ecology prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification to the federal insurance administration.
         b.   Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is
not diminished.
   G.   Certificate Of Occupancy:
      1.   A certification of use for the property or a certificate of
occupancy for a new or substantially improved structure or an addition shall
not be issued until:
         a.   The permit applicant provides a properly completed, signed and
sealed elevation or floodproofing certificate showing finished construction
data as required by this chapter;
         b.   If a mitigation plan is required by this chapter, all work
identified in the plan has been completed according to the plan's schedule;
         c.   The applicant provides copies of all required federal, state, and
local permits noted in the permit application instructions; and
         d.   All other provisions of this chapter have been met.
      2.   The floodplain administrator may accept a performance bond or other
security that will ensure that unfinished portions of the project will be
completed after the certification of use or certificate of occupancy has been
issued.
   H.   Floodplain Development Permit Expiration: If there has been no start of
construction, a floodplain development permit shall expire one hundred eighty
(180) days after the date of issuance. Where the applicant documents a need for
an extension beyond this period due to conditions beyond the applicant's
control, the floodplain administrator may authorize one or more extensions.
   I.   Variance Procedure: Variances from the provisions of this chapter shall
be processed as described in title 15 of this code. Approved variances shall
permit structures to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base
flood elevation and shall assert that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation. The findings and conclusions of approved variances shall be recorded
with the Pierce County auditor and shall run with the land.
      1.   Variance Considerations: In considering such variances, the hearings
examiner shall consider the following factors:
         a.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands at the
risk of injury to others;
         b.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         c.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
         d.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         e.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         f.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         g.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         h.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      2.   Conditions For Variances:
         a.   Upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
of a historic structure will not preclude the structure's continued designation
as a historic structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         b.   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         c.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
         d.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         e.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         f.   Variances may be issued for nonresidential buildings in very
limited circumstances to allow a lesser degree of floodproofing than watertight
or dry floodproofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low
damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria in this section and
otherwise complies with subsections of this chapter. (Ord. 2017-1010, 3-6-2017)
14-1-9: PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION:
   A.   General Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards, the following
standards are required:
      1.   Anchoring:
         a.   All new construction including manufactured housing and
substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure.
         b.   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors
(reference FEMA's "Manufactured Home Installation In Flood Hazard Areas"
guidebook for additional techniques).
      2.   Construction Materials And Methods:
         a.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
         b.   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
         c.   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise
elevated or located at least one (1) foot above the base flood elevation.
      3.   Utilities:
         a.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
         b.   Water wells shall be located on high ground that is not in the
floodway;
         c.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into floodwaters; and
         d.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. A habitat impact
assessment shall be conducted in accordance with subsection
14-1-7B5 of this chapter as a condition of approval of an on site waste
disposal system to be located in the regulatory floodplain.
      4.   Subdivision Proposals 1 : This section applies to all subdivision
proposals, short subdivisions, short plats, planned developments, and new and
expansions to manufactured housing parks.
         a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
         b.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
         c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided
to reduce exposure to flood damage;
         d.   Where base flood elevation data has not been provided or is not
available from another authoritative source, it shall be generated for
subdivision proposals and other proposed developments which contain at least
fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less);
         e.   The proposed subdivision should have one or more new lots in the
regulatory floodplain set aside for open space use through deed restriction,
easement, subdivision covenant, or donation to a public agency. The density of
the development in the portion of the development outside the regulatory
floodplain may be increased to compensate for the amount of land in the
regulatory floodplain preserved as open space in accordance with Orting
development regulations. Optionally, the city may choose to accept a mitigation
contribution in lieu of dedicated open space; and
         f.   The final recorded subdivision plat shall include a notice that
part of the property is in the SFHA, riparian habitat zone and/or channel
migration area, as appropriate.
      5.   Review Of Building Permits: Where elevation data is not available
either through the flood insurance study, FIRM, or from another authoritative
source, applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that
proposed construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of
reasonableness is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high
water marks, photographs of past flooding, etc., where available. Failure to
elevate at least two feet (2') above the highest adjacent grade in these zones
may result in higher insurance rates.
      6.   Shoreline Modifications:
         a.   The proposed project must be designed and located so that new
structural flood protection is not needed.
         b.   Bank stabilization measures must be minimized to the maximum
extent possible. If bank stabilization measures are necessary, bioengineered
armoring of stream banks must be used per the "Integrated Streambank Protection
Guidelines" 2003.
      7.   Hazardous Materials: No new development shall create a threat to
public health, public safety, or water quality. Chemicals, explosives,
gasoline, propane, buoyant materials, animal wastes, fertilizers, flammable
liquids, pollutants, or other materials that are hazardous, toxic, or a threat
to water quality are prohibited from the regulatory floodplain. This
prohibition does not apply to small quantities of these materials kept for
normal household use. This prohibition does not apply to the continued
operations of existing facilities and structures, reuse of existing facilities
and structures, or functionally dependent facilities or structures. If the
proposed project cannot meet these requirements, then a habitat assessment must
be conducted in accordance with section
14-1-7 of this chapter.
   B.   Specific Standards: In all areas of special flood hazards where base
flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in subsection
14-1-6B of this chapter, the following provisions are required:
      1.   Residential Construction:
         a.   New construction, substantial improvements and/or reconstruction
due to substantial damage of any residential structure, including machinery and
equipment shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot
(1') or more above base flood elevation.
         b.   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor shall be used solely
for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage. These enclosed areas
shall be designed and constructed to allow for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria:
            (1)   A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
            (2)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
(1') above grade.
            (3)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      2.   Nonresidential Construction: New construction and substantial
improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated one foot (1')
or more above the level of the base flood elevation; or, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
         a.   Be floodproofed so that below one foot (1') above the base flood
level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water;
         b.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
         c.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting provisions of this subsection based on their
development and/or review of the structural design, specifications and plans.
Such certifications shall be provided to the official;
         d.   Nonresidential structures that are elevated, not floodproofed,
must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
subsection B1b of this section; and
         e.   Applicants floodproofing nonresidential buildings shall be
notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot
(1') below the floodproofed level (e.g., a building floodproofed to 1 foot
above the base flood level will be rated as at the base flood level).
      3.   Critical Facility: Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of
new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible
alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA
shall have the lowest floor elevated to three feet (3') or more above the level
of the base flood elevation at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures
must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or
released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of the
base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the
maximum extent possible.
      4.   Manufactured Homes: All manufactured homes to be placed or
substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM
shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is one foot (1') or more above the base flood elevation; and
be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system in accordance
with the provisions of subsection A.1.b. of this section.
      5.   Site Design:.
         a.   Structures and other development shall be located to avoid flood
damage.
            (1)   If a lot has a buildable site out of the regulatory
floodplain, all new structures shall be located in that area, when possible.
            (2)   The structure shall be aligned parallel with the direction of
flood flows where practicable.
            (3)   If a lot does not have a buildable site out of the regulatory
floodplain, all new structures, pavement, and other development must be sited
in the location that has the least impact on habitat by locating the structures
as far from the water body as possible or placing the structures on the highest
land on the lot.
            (4)   A minimum setback of fifteen feet (15') from the protected
area shall be required for all structures.
            (5)   If the proposed project does not meet the criteria of this
section, a habitat impact assessment shall be conducted pursuant to subsection
14-1-7C of this chapter and, if necessary, a habitat mitigation plan shall be
prepared and implemented pursuant to subsection
 14-1-7D of this chapter.
         b.   All new development shall be designed and located to minimize the
impact on flood flows, flood storage, water quality, and habitat.
            (1)   Stormwater and drainage features shall incorporate LID BMPs
in accordance with section
9-5A-9D of this code unless, based on the Stormwater Management Manual, LID
BMPs are infeasible.
            (2)   If the proposed project will create new impervious surfaces
where no more than ten percent (10%) of the lot in the regulatory floodplain is
covered by impervious surface, it must comply with title 9, chapter 5,
"Stormwater Regulations", of this code, and mitigate adverse impacts as
provided by this chapter.
            (3)   Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is
prohibited within designated floodways, except for: a) repairs, reconstruction,
or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area, and
b) repairs, reconstruction, or improvements which do not exceed fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure as specified in Washington
administrative code 173-158-070.
   C.   Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
subsection
14-1-6B of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply:
      1.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless certification by a
registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating through
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard
engineering practices that encroachments shall not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      2.   Construction or reconstruction of residential structures is
prohibited within designated floodways, except for: a) repairs, reconstruction,
or improvements to a structure which do not increase the ground floor area; and
b) repairs, reconstruction or improvements to a structure, the cost of which
does not exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
either: 1) before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement is started, or 2)
if the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the damage
occurred. Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or to structures
identified as historic places shall not be included in the fifty percent (50%).
      3.   If subsection B of this section is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this section.
   D.   Wetlands Management: To the maximum extent possible avoid the short and
long term adverse impacts associated with the destruction or modification of
wetlands, especially those activities that limit or disrupt the ability of the
wetland to alleviate flooding impacts. The following process should be
implemented:
      1.   Review proposals for development within base floodplains for their
possible impacts on wetlands located within the floodplain.
      2.   Ensure that development activities in or around wetlands do not
negatively affect public safety, health, and welfare by disrupting the
wetlands' ability to reduce flood and storm drainage.
      3.   Request technical assistance from the department of ecology in
identifying wetland areas. Existing wetland map information from the national
wetlands inventory (NWI) can be used in conjunction with the community's FIRM
to prepare an overlay zone indicating critical wetland areas deserving special
attention.
   E.   Native Vegetation: The site plan required in section
14-1-8 of this chapter shall show existing native vegetation.
      1.   In the riparian habitat zone, native vegetation shall be left
undisturbed, except as provided in sections 7.1 and 7.2.C.
      2.   Outside the riparian habitat zone, removal of native vegetation
shall not exceed thirty five percent (35%) of the surface area of the portion
of the site in the regulatory floodplain. Native vegetation in the riparian
habitat zone portion of the property can be counted toward this requirement.
      3.   If the proposed project does not meet the criteria of sections 7.4.A
and B, a habitat impact assessment shall be conducted pursuant to section 7.7
and, if necessary, a habitat mitigation plan shall be prepared and implemented
pursuant to section 7.8.
   F.   Compensatory Storage: New development shall not reduce the effective
flood storage volume of the regulatory floodplain. A development proposal shall
provide compensatory storage if grading or other activity eliminates any
effective flood storage volume. Compensatory storage shall:
      1.   Provide equivalent volume at equivalent elevations to that being
displaced. For this purpose, "equivalent elevation" means having similar
relationship to ordinary high water and to the best available 10-year, 50-year
and 100-year water surface profiles;
      2.   Be hydraulically connected to the source of flooding;
      3.   Provide compensatory storage in the same construction season as when
the displacement of flood storage volume occurs and before the flood season
begins; and
      4.   The newly created storage area shall be graded and vegetated to
allow fish access during flood events without creating fish stranding sites.
   G.   Additional Standards; Crawl Space Construction For Buildings Located In
Special Flood Hazard Areas:
      1.   The interior grade of a crawl space below the BFE must not be more
than two feet (2') below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as D
in figure 3 of this section.
      2.   The height of the below grade crawl space, measured from the
interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation wall
must not exceed four feet (4') (shown as L in figure 3 of this section) at any
point. The height limitation is the maximum allowable unsupported wall height
according to the engineering analyses and building code requirements for flood
hazard areas.
      3.   There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters
from the interior area of the crawl space. The enclosed area should be drained
within a reasonable time after a flood event. The type of drainage system will
vary because of the site gradient and other drainage characteristics, such as
soil types. Possible options include natural drainage through porous, well
drained soils and drainage systems such as perforated pipes, drainage tiles, or
gravel or crushed stone drainage by gravity or mechanical means.
      4.   The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet
(5') per second for any crawl space. For velocities in excess of five feet (5')
per second, other foundation types should be used.
      5.   Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated
above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the
system components during flood conditions. Ductwork, in particular, must either
be placed above the BFE or sealed from floodwaters.
      6.   Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with
materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation
walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building, but also any joists,
insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE.
      7.   Below grade crawl space construction in accordance with the
requirements listed above will not be considered basements.

   H.   Critical Facilities:
      1.   Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent
possible, located outside the limits of the regulatory floodplain (SFHA).
Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes
elevated to or above the level of the base flood elevation shall be provided to
all critical facilities to the maximum extent possible.
      2.   Construction of new critical facilities in the regulatory floodplain
shall be permissible if no feasible alternative site is available, provided:
         a.   Critical facilities shall have the lowest floor elevated three
feet (3') above the base flood elevation or to the height of the 500-year
flood, whichever is higher. If there is no available data on the 500-year
flood, the permit applicants shall develop the needed data in accordance with
FEMA mapping guidelines.
         b.   Access to and from the critical facility shall be protected to
the elevation of the 500-year flood.

2024)
15-6-7: CALCULATION OF IMPACT FEES:
   A.   School impact fees are based on planned school facility development
provided by the Orting School District and included in the comprehensive plan
and in Pierce County code 4A.30.
      1.   The impact fee schedule is calculated based upon the formula set
forth in table
15-6-1 of this section. The formula in table
15-6-1 of this section is the city's determination of the appropriate
proportionate share of the costs of public school capital facilities needed to
serve new growth and development to be funded by school impact fees.
      2.   The impact fee schedule, as enacted, includes a maximum fee
obligation. The actual fee obligation is the lesser of the fee calculation or
the maximum fee obligation.
      3.   Separate fees shall be calculated for single-family and multi-
family types of dwelling units, because of their different impact on school
facilities. Separate student generation rates (student factor) must be
determined by the district for each type of dwelling unit. For purposes of this
title, mobile homes shall be subject to the single-family dwelling unit fee and
duplexes and zero lot line homes shall be subject to the multi-family dwelling
units fee.
      4.   The fee calculations shall be made on a districtwide basis to assure
maximum utilization of all school facilities in the district currently used for
instructional purposes.
      5.   The formula in table
15-6-1 of this section also provides for a credit for school sites or
facilities actually provided by a fee payer which are included in a school
district capital facilities plan and that are required by the city as a
condition of development approval. (Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003)
      6.   Effective February 13, 2007, the maximum fees for single- family
dwelling units shall be two thousand seven hundred eighty dollars ($2,780.00)
and for multi-family dwelling units shall be one thousand four hundred sixty
five dollars ($1,465.00). The maximum fee obligation in this chapter continues
until adjusted by ordinance. (Ord. 845, 1-31-2007)
SCHOOL IMPACT FEE SCHEDULE, TABLE 15-6-1
Given the following variables:
A  = Full cost fee for site acquisition costs = A1+A2+A3
A1 = Elementary school site cost per student x the student factor
A2 = Middle school site cost per student x the student factor
A3 = High school site cost per student x the student factor
B  = Full cost fee for school construction = B1+B2+B3
B1 = Elementary school construction cost per student x the student factor
B2 = Middle school construction cost per student x the student factor
B3 = High school construction cost per student x the student factor
C  = Full cost fee for temporary facilities construction = C1+C2+C3
C1 = Elementary school temporary facility cost per student x the student factor
C2 = Middle school temporary facility cost per student x the student factor
C3 = High school temporary facility cost per student x the student factor
D  = State match credit = D1+D2+D3
D1 = Cost index x SPI square footage per student for elementary school x state
     match % x student factor
D2 = Cost index x SPI square footage per student for middle school x state
     match % x student factor
D3 = Cost index x SPI square footage per student for high school x state match
     % x student factor
TC = Tax payment credit = the net present value of the average assessed value
     for the dwelling unit type in the school district,
   <(1+I)n>-1
   I(1=I)nx the current school district capital property tax levy rate, I
     (1+I)n, where
   I=the current interest rate for outstanding bond issues
   n=the number of years left before the bond or capital levy is retired, up
     to a maximum of 10 years.
FC = Facilities credit = the per dwelling unit value of any site or facilities
     provided directly by the development
   FC = value of fee payer's contribution
   number of dwelling units in the development
 
Then the unfunded need (UN):
UN = A+B+C-D-TC-FC
The fee obligation:
Total unfunded need x 50% = fee calculation
Fee obligation is the lesser of the fee calculation or the maximum fee
obligation as set by resolution of the city council.
Where:
"Capacity" means the number of students a school district's facilities can
accommodate districtwide at each grade span, based on the district's adopted
level of service.
"Classrooms" means educational facilities of the district required to house
students for its basic educational program. The classrooms are those facilities
the district determines are necessary to serve its student population.
Specialized facilities identified by the district, including, but not limited
to, gymnasiums, cafeterias, libraries, administrative offices, special
education classrooms not suitable for general use because of design or
equipment needs, and child daycare centers, shall not be counted as classrooms.
"Construction Cost Per Student" means the estimated cost of construction of a
permanent school facility in the district for the grade span of school to be
provided, as a function of the district's design standard per grade span and
taking into account the requirements of students with special needs. A district
shall establish construction costs based upon the district's experience with
comparable projects, adjusted for inflation, or the cost of similar projects in
other districts.
"Cost Index" means the area allowance for school construction determined under
WAC 180-27-060.
"Facilities Credit" means the value of any site, school facilities, or monetary
compensation the district has agreed to accept as an offset against a school
impact fee from a fee payer regarding the development activity.
"Grade Span" means the categories into which a district groups its grades of
students; i.e., elementary, middle or junior high school, and high school.
"Level Of Service (For Schools)" means the standard adopted by each district
that identifies the program year, the class size by grade span, and taking into
account the requirements of students with special needs, the number of
classrooms presently available of facilities the district believes will best
serve its student population, the student population for new school facilities
per grade span, and other factors as identified by the school district. Unless
a district adopts by board resolution, a standard of service that specifically
deems all or any portion of its relocatable facilities to be permanent
facilities, a district's standard of service shall not include any classrooms
or other educational facilities housed in relocatable facilities or in
transitional facilities. Except as otherwise defined by the school board
pursuant to a board resolution, transitional facilities shall mean those
facilities, including relocatable facilities or leased space, that are used to
cover the time required for the construction of permanent facilities called for
in the capital facilities plan.
"Permanent Facilities" means facilities of the district with a fixed foundation
that are not relocatable facilities.
"Relocatable Or Temporary Facilities" means any factory built structure,
transportable in one or more sections that is designed to be used as an
education space and is needed to prevent the overbuilding of school facilities,
to meet the needs of service areas within a district, or to cover the gap
between the time that families move into new residential developments and the
date that construction is completed on permanent school facilities.
"Relocatable Or Temporary Facilities Cost Per Student" means the estimated cost
of purchasing and siting a relocatable facility in the district for the grade
span of school to be provided, as a function of the district's design standard
per grade span and taking into account the requirements of students with
special needs.
"Site Cost Per Student" means the estimated cost of a site in the district for
the grade span of school to be provided as a function of the district's design
standard per grade span and taking into account the requirements of students
with special needs. A district shall determine site costs based on past
experience or the acquisition costs for similar sites in comparable school
districts.
"SPI Square Footage Per Student" means the space allocations per grade span
determined by WAC 180-27-035. State board of education.
"State Matching Credit" means the calculation set forth in attachment A of the
district's Boeckh index times SPI square footage per student per grade span
times state match percentage times applicable student factor.
"State Match Percentage" means the percentage of school construction costs for
which a district is eligible to receive state funding pursuant to Revised Code
of Washington 28A.525.166 and the rules applicable thereto.
"Student Factor" means the number derived by a school district to describe how
many students of each grade span are expected to be generated by development
activity. Student factors shall be based on district records of average actual
student generated rates for new developments constructed over a period of not
more than five (5) years prior to the date of the fee calculation; provided
that, if such information is not available in the district or if there are no
developments in the district similar to that being proposed, the district may
use data from districts with similar demographics, or, if no other data sources
are reasonably available, countywide averages. Student factors shall be
separately determined for single-family dwelling units and dwelling units
within multi-family residences. For purposes of this chapter, mobile homes
shall be considered single-family residences.
"Tax Payment Credit Or ’TC’" means the calculation set forth in attachment A of
the district's average real property tax determined value for single-family
dwelling units or multi-family dwelling units times the district's capital
property tax rate as adjusted by the current interest rate for any bonds being
retired by a capital tax and the number of years each capital levy tax shall be
imposed, up to ten (10) years. The district's capital tax rate consists of
authorized tax levies to retire bonded indebtedness incurred for school
district capital purposes under chapter 28A.530 Revised Code of Washington and
school facility levies for construction, remodeling, and modernization under
Revised Code of Washington 84.52.053.
   B.   Park impact fees are based on the level of service standards for parks
and trails established in the comprehensive plan.
      1.   It is the city’s intent to maintain the ratio of park land to
population established in the comprehensive plan land use element. Dedication
of land for public parks and recreation facilities is the preferred method for
mitigating impacts on such facilities caused by the development of new
households.
      2.   When creation of a new household (in the form of a subdivision,
short plat, planned unit development, manufactured housing park, or residential
building permit on a lot for which a parks impact fee has not been collected)
is proposed, the city shall require dedication of land necessary to meet the
park land to population ratio established in the comprehensive plan land use
element. In the event that land dedication is determined by the city to be
unfeasible, a mitigation fee in accordance with table
15-6-3 of this section shall be assessed. The amount of land to be dedicated
for each dwelling unit shall be as shown in table
15-6-2 of this section:
PARKS LAND DEDICATION FORMULA, TABLE 15-6-2
   Park land area per household: 8*43,560/322.58 = 1,080 square feet/ household
(rounded)
   Given the following variables:
   a)   Comprehensive plan park land-to-population ratio = eight (8) acres per
thousand (1,000)
   b)   Average household size = three and one-tenth (3.1) persons per
household
   c)   Households per thousand (1,000) = 1,000/3.1 = 322.58
   3.   The fee value of land to be dedicated may be determined by either of
the following methods:
      a.   The applicant may provide a fair market appraisal of the improved
property value. The appraisal shall be prepared by a member of the Appraisal
Institute (MAI).
      b.   The city may calculate the average improved land value using Pierce
County assessor’s data for all new dwelling units constructed in the previous
calendar year.
   4.   Park impact fee (PIF) assessments in lieu of land dedication shall be
collected based on table 15-6-3 of this section and specified by city council
resolution:
   TABLE 15-6-3
   PARKS IMPACT FEE FORMULA
Given the following variables:
           Adjustment in accordance with Revised Code of Washington 82.02.050
A    =     and 060 to provide a balance between impact fees and other sources
           of public funds to meet capital facilities needs. For park
           improvements this adjustment is fifty (50) percent, so that A = 0.5.
HS   =     Average household size of three and one-tenth (3.1) persons.
PLOS =     Adopted park land level of service standard of eight (8) acres per
           thousand (1,000) population.
PLR  =     Proportionate land requirement per new household of two-one-
           hundredths (0.0248) acre calculated as PLOS ÷ 1,000 x HS.
           Park land value of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) per acre and
PV   =     park improvement value of one hundred and four thousand dollars
           ($104,000).
TLOS =     Adopted trails level of service standard of one-fourth mile per
           thousand (1,000) population.
TV   =     Trails land and improvement value of thousand dollars ($44,000) per
           mile.
PTR  =     Proportionate trail requirement per new household of 0.000775
           calculated as TLOS ÷ 1,000 x HS.
           PIF = A x [PLR x PV + PTR x TV]
Therefore: PIF = 0.5 x [0.0248 x $119,000 + 0.000775 x $44,000] = $1,492 per
           new household (unless amended by city council resolution)

10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003)
15-6-9: USE OF FUNDS:
   A.   Impact fees shall be used for public facility improvements that will
reasonably benefit the new development; shall not be imposed to make up for
deficiencies in the facilities serving existing developments; and shall not be
used for maintenance or operation.
   B.   Impact fees may be spent for improvements, including, but not limited

costs previously incurred to the extent that new growth and development will be
served by the previously constructed improvements or incurred costs.
   D.   In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are or have been
issued for the construction of public facility or system improvements for which
impact fees may be expended, impact fees may be used to pay debt service on
such bonds or similar debt instruments to the extent that the facilities or
improvements provided are consistent with the requirements of this section and
are used to serve the new development. Capital facilities plans using impact
fees for the purpose of assisting in the provision of capital facilities or
facility systems must clearly differentiate between funds used for new
improvement and those funds used to correct existing deficiencies. (Ord. 778,
10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003)
15-6-10: ASSESSMENT AND COLLECTION:
   A.   Fee Determination: For all development activity subject to this
chapter, the city shall determine the total impact fee at the time of
application for a building permit or for installation of a mobile/manufactured
home, based on the capital facilities plan element of the Orting comprehensive
plan and the resulting fee schedule in effect at the time of application. (Ord.
778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003)
   B.   Collection Time: Collection shall occur prior to the time of building
permit issuance unless the fee payer requests a deferral as outlined below and
provides the city with proof that a voluntary impact fee lien in the form
provided for in subsection C of this section has been executed by all legal
owners of the property upon which the development activity allowed by the
building permit is to occur, and the form has been recorded in the office of
the Pierce County auditor. If a voluntary impact fee lien has been recorded,
then the following collection shall occur:
      1.   Pursuant to Revised Code Of Washington 82.02.050, applicants for
single-family attached or single-family detached residential building permits
may request to defer payment, for no more than eighteen (18) months from the
date of building permit issuance, of required impact fees until final
inspection, which request shall be granted so long as the requirements of this
chapter are satisfied. If a deferral request is granted under this section, the
city may withhold certification of final inspection until the impact fees have
been paid in full.
         a.   A request for impact fee deferral shall be made in writing on a
form provided by the city, and submitted contemporaneously with the associated
building permit application. Any request for impact fee deferral must be
accompanied by an administrative fee in an amount determined by resolution of
the city council.
         b.   The deferral entitlements allowed under this chapter shall be
limited to the first twenty (20) single-family residential construction
building permits per applicant, as identified by contractor registration number
or other unique identification number, per year.
      2.   For dwelling units other than single-family, prior to the issuance
of the certificate of occupancy. The applicant must provide evidence to the
county that the fee has been paid.
      3.   If development activity originally excluded from the scope of this
chapter is converted to a residential use creating an impact on schools and/or
parks, the appropriate fee shall be immediately determined and become due for
payment. (Ord. 2016-991, 8-31-2016)
   C.   Title Notification: The owner of any property for which a school impact
fee is not paid prior to issuance of a building permit shall record a voluntary
impact fee lien with the Pierce County auditor in the applicable form set forth
below:
VOLUNTARY IMPACT FEE LIEN
   Parcel Number:
   Address:
   Legal Description:
   Present Owner:
Notice: The site was the subject of a development proposal for building permit
application number (# ) filed on (date).
A (school) (park) (transportation) impact fee in the amount established in
15-6-6 is due to the City of Orting upon the earlier of: transfer of title,
refinancing, or 18 months from the date of issuance of the building permit. The
fees are a lien on the property. In the event the fee is not paid when due,
Orting shall foreclose it in the same manner as an assessment. This lien shall
earn interest at the applicable statutory rate from the date of default. The
owner shall also pay the City's reasonable attorney's fees and costs incurred
in the foreclosure process. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the City shall not
commence foreclosure proceedings less than 30 calendar days prior to providing
written notification to the then present owner of the property via certified
mail with return receipt requested advising of its intent to commence
foreclosure proceedings. If the present owner cures the default within the 30-
day cure period, no attorney's fees and/or costs will be owed.
Signature of Owner(s)
   D.   Collection Of Fee Or Record Of Lien: The city shall not issue a
building permit for any development activity until applicable school and parks
impact fees are paid or the fee payer has provided the city with satisfactory
evidence that the applicable voluntary impact fee lien has been recorded
against the property for which the building permit is issued. Notwithstanding
the recording of a voluntary impact fee lien, the city may collect the fee when
it becomes due from either the person or entity: 1) whose development activity
creates the demand for additional public facilities which requires approval, 2)
who applies for issuance of the building permit, or 3) the owner of the real
property subject to the lien; provided the city shall not collect from any one
or all of the above referenced persons and/or entities an amount that exceeds
the fee, if any, due for the dwelling unit(s), including interest, attorney
fees and costs authorized by the lien. If the fee is collected from a person or
entity who is or which is not the current owner of the real property subject to
the lien, the city shall assign its interest in the lien to the person or
entity who or which paid the fee.
   E.   Record Satisfaction Of Lien: Unless the city has assigned its interest
in the lien as provided for in subsection D of this section, upon payment of
any voluntary impact fee lien, the city shall promptly record a satisfaction of
lien. (Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003)
15-6-11: ADJUSTMENTS, INDEPENDENT CALCULATIONS:
   A.   A fee payer may request an adjustment to the impact fees set forth in
this title by preparing and submitting to the city and Orting school district
(for school impact fees) an independent fee calculation for the development
activity for which a building permit is sought. The documentation submitted
shall show the basis upon which the independent fee calculation was made.
      1.   If the city agrees with the independent fee calculation, a written
agreement shall be transmitted to the fee payer for recording.
      2.   If the city does not agree with the independent fee proposal, the
fee payer may request a third party review. The third party reviewer will be
selected by the city.
         a.   The fee payer shall pay the third party reviewer for services and
the city for analysis of the independent fee calculation.
         b.   While there is a presumption that the calculations set forth in
the capital facilities plan element of the comprehensive plan are valid, the
third party reviewer shall consider the documentation submitted by a fee payer
and the analysis prepared by the city.
         c.   The third party reviewer may result in the city acceptance,
rejection, or revision of the independent fee calculation after consideration
of documentation submitted in support of or in opposition to the independent
fee calculation, the specific characteristics of the development, principles of
fairness, and/or other relevant information. The fees or alternative fees and
the calculations shall be set forth in writing and shall be mailed to the fee
payer, and the school district (for school impact fees).
   B.   Determinations made pursuant to this section may be appealed to the
hearing examiner subject to the procedures set forth in this title. (Ord. 778,

impact fee component for the value of any dedication of land for, improvement
to, or new construction of any system improvements provided by the fee payer,
to facilities that are identified in the capital facilities plan and that are
required by the city as a condition of approval for the development activity.
   B.   The amount of the credit shall be the higher of either the value of the
land or improvements established in the adopted comprehensive plan capital
facilities element or by an appraisal conducted by an independent professional
appraiser mutually agreeable to the city and the fee payer. Either the fee
payer or the city may request an appraisal, in which event the cost of the
appraisal shall be borne by the requesting party. Determinations made pursuant
to this section may be appealed to the examiner subject to the procedures set
forth in this title.
   C.   After the effective date of this chapter, the developer shall be
entitled to a credit for the value of the land or actual costs of capital
facility construction against the fee that would be chargeable under the
formula provided by this chapter, whenever a development is granted approval
subject to the following conditions: that the developer actually provide school
sites, school facilities, or improvements to school facilities that are
identified in the comprehensive plan capital facilities element, or whenever
the developer has agreed, pursuant to the terms of a voluntary agreement with
the school district, to provide land, provide school facilities, or make
improvements to existing facilities. The land value or costs of construction
shall be determined pursuant to subsection B of this section.
   D.   After the effective date of this chapter, the developer shall be
entitled to a credit for the value of the land or actual costs of capital
facility construction against the fee that would be chargeable under the
formula provided by this chapter, whenever a development is granted approval
subject to the following condition(s): that the developer park, open space, or
linear trail park facilities that are identified in the capital facilities
element, or whenever the developer has agreed, pursuant to the terms of a
voluntary agreement with the city, to provide land for parks, open space, or
linear trails that are identified in the capital facilities element, or make
improvements to existing facilities. The land value or costs of construction
shall be determined pursuant to subsection B of this section.
   E.   When a subdivision or other type of development is conditioned upon the
dedication of land, or purchase, installation or improvement of school, park,
or transportation facilities, a final plat, final PUD, or short plat shall not
be recorded, nor a building permit issued until:
      1.   The city has determined in writing that any land to be dedicated is
shown on the face of the final plat, final PUD, or short plat, or a deed
conveying the land to the city or school district, as appropriate, has been
recorded with the Pierce County auditor; and
      2.   The city has determined in writing, after consultation with the
designated public owner responsible for permanent, continuing maintenance and
operation of the facilities, that the developer has satisfactorily undertaken,
or guaranteed to undertake in a manner acceptable to the city, any required
purchase, installation or improvement of the required school, park, or
transportation facilities. (Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord.

deposited with the United States postal service addressed to the owner of the
property as shown in the county tax records.
      2.   An owner's request for a refund must be submitted to the Orting
School District superintendent in writing within one year of the date the right
to claim the refund arises or the date that notice is given, whichever date is
later.
   C.   Any impact fees that are not expended or encumbered within these time
limitations, and for which no application for a refund has been made within
this one year period, shall be retained and expended consistent with the
provisions of this section.
   D.   Refunds of impact fees shall include any interest earned on the impact
fees.
   E.   Should the city seek to terminate any or all impact fee requirements,
all unexpended or unencumbered funds, including interest earned, shall be
refunded to the current owner of the property for which an impact fee was paid.
Upon the finding that any or all fee requirements are to be terminated, the
city shall place notice of such termination and the availability of refunds in
a newspaper of general circulation at least two (2) times and shall notify all
potential claimants by first class mail addressed to the owner of the property
as shown in the county tax records. All funds available for refund shall be
retained for a period of one year. At the end of one year, any remaining funds
shall be retained by the city, but must be expended for the original purposes,
consistent with the provisions of this section. The notice requirement set
forth above shall not apply if there are no unexpended or unencumbered balances
within the account or accounts being terminated.
   F.   An owner/applicant may request and shall receive a refund, including
interest earned on the impact fees, when:

activity as required by statute, city code, or the uniform building code; and
      2.   The district or the city has not expended or encumbered the impact
fees in good faith prior to the application for a refund. In the event that the
district or the city has expended or encumbered the fees in good faith, no
refund shall be forthcoming. However, if within a period of three (3) years,
the same or subsequent owner of the property proceeds with the same or
substantially similar development activity, the owner shall be eligible for a
credit. The owner must petition the city in writing and provide receipts of
impact fees paid by the owner for a development of the same or substantially
similar nature on the same property or some portion thereof. The city shall
determine whether to grant a credit, and such determinations may be appealed by
following the procedures set forth in this title.
   G.   The amount to be refunded shall include the interest earned by this
portion of the account from the date that it was deposited into the impact fee
fund. (Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord. 2024-1136, 12-11-2024)

provisions of this article at the time that the applicable building permit is
ready for issuance. The fee paid shall be the amount in effect as of the date
of the building permit being deemed completed.
   B.   All developers shall pay an impact administrative fee at the time of
issuance of a building permit as set forth in section
15-6-16 of this chapter.
   C.   If the development is modified or conditioned in such a way as to alter
the trip generation rate for the development after building permit issuance,
the impact fee will be recalculated accordingly.
   D.   No building permit shall be issued until the transportation impact fee
is paid.
   E.   Impact fees may be paid under protest in order to obtain a permit or
other approval of development activity. (Ord. 808, 6-30-2005)
15-6A-9: PROJECT LIST:
   A.   The director shall recommend annual updates to city's comprehensive
plan, capital facilities element, the six (6) year TIP, and the projects in
attachment A as referenced in section
15-6A-2 of this article and shall:
      1.   Identify proportion of each project that is growth related;
      2.   Forecast the total funding available from taxes and other public
sources for transportation improvements necessary in the next six (6) years;
      3.   Calculate the amount of impact fees associated with those projects
that have already been paid.
   B.   The director may use this information to prepare an annual draft
amendment to attachment A as referenced in section
15-6A-2 of this article, which shall comprise:
      1.   The projects on the comprehensive plan that are growth related and
that should be funded with forecast public monies and the impact fees already
paid;
      2.   The projects already built or funded pursuant to this article whose
performance capacity has not been fully utilized; and
      3.   An update of the estimated costs of the projects listed.
   C.   The council, at the same time that it adopts the annual budget and
appropriates funds for capital improvement projects, shall by separate
ordinance establish the annual attachment A as referenced in section
15-6A-2 of this article by adopting, with or without modification, the
director's draft list.
   D.   Once a project is placed on attachment A as referenced in section
15-6A-2 of this article, a fee shall be imposed on every development that
impacts the project until the project is removed from the list by one of the
following means:
      1.   The council by ordinance removes the project from attachment A as
referenced in section
15-6A-2 of this article, in which case the fees already collected will be
refunded if necessary to ensure that impact fees remain reasonably related to
the traffic impacts of development that have paid an impact fee; provided, that
a refund shall not be necessary if the council transfers the fees to the budget
of another project that the council determines will mitigate essentially the
same traffic impacts; or
      2.   The impact fee share of the project has been fully funded, in which
case the director shall administratively remove the project from the project
list. (Ord. 808, 6-30-2005)
15-6A-10: FUNDING OF PROJECTS:
For funding of projects, see the provisions contained in this chapter. (Ord.
808, 6-30-2005)
15-6A-11: REFUNDS:
See section
15-6-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 808, 6-30-2005)
15-6A-12: APPEALS:
A developer may appeal the amount of an impact fee determined by the director
as provided in section
15-6-14 of this chapter. The developer shall bear the burden of proving:
   A.   That the director committed material and substantial error in
calculating the developer's proportionate share, as determined by an individual
fee calculation or, if relevant, as set forth in the fee schedule, or in
granting credit for the benefit factors; or
   B.   That the director's decision was based on data that was materially and
substantially incorrect and which, therefore, necessarily resulted in an
erroneous decision. (Ord. 808, 6-30-2005)
15-6A-13: RELATIONSHIP TO SEPA:
   A.   All development shall be subject to environmental review pursuant to
SEPA and other applicable city ordinances and regulations. The need for a
traffic impact analysis (TIA) and requirements for a TIA are established in the
city of Orting 2030 transportation plan technical appendices "Traffic Impact
Analysis Guidelines".
   B.   Payment of the impact fee shall constitute satisfactory mitigation of
those traffic impacts related to the specific improvements identified on the
project list. (See attachment A as referenced in section
15-6A-2 of this article.)
   C.   Further mitigation in addition to the impact fee shall be required for
identified adverse impacts appropriate for mitigation pursuant to SEPA that are
not mitigated by an impact fee.
   D.   Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit the city's
authority to deny building permits when a proposal would result in significant
adverse traffic impacts identified in an environmental impact statement and
reasonable mitigation measures are insufficient to mitigate the identified
impact. (Ord. 808, 6-30-2005)
15-6A-14: RELATIONSHIP TO CONCURRENCY:
Neither compliance with this article or the payment of any fee hereunder shall
constitute a determination of concurrency under section
15-8-4 of this title. (Ord. 808, 6-30-2005)

15-8-4: CONCURRENCY PROCEDURES:
   A.   Concurrency Review Procedures: Concurrency of necessary public
facilities shall be determined during the processing of all nonexempt permit
applications through a review process conducted by the city in consultation
with the individual service providers prior to the issuance of any permit.
   B.   Concurrency Review; Roles:
      1.   The administrator shall provide the overall coordination of the test
for concurrency by:
         a.   Notifying the service providers of all applications requiring a
test for concurrency.
      2.   Service providers as defined in section
15-8-1 of this chapter shall:
         a.   Be responsible for providing the city with current information
describing system capacities, available services, and any factors affecting the
review and approval of applications;
         b.   Reserve the capacity needed for each application; and
         c.   Charge applicable fees to recover the costs of concurrency
testing and monitoring their concurrency systems.
   C.   Capacity: For sanitary sewer and domestic water supply, only available
capacity shall be used in conducting the test for concurrency. For streets,
available and planned capacity may be used in conducting the test for
concurrency. The adopted level of service standards outlined in the
comprehensive plan shall be the basis for determining whether adequate capacity
will be available.
   D.   Concurrency Determination: The test for concurrency is passed when the
capacity of public facilities and services is equal to or greater than the
capacity required to maintain the level of service standards established by the
city. Approval of permit applications shall constitute certificates of
concurrency. (Ord. 887, 9-8-2010)
15-8-5: CHECK FOR ADEQUACY:
(Rep. by Ord. 887, 9-8-2010)
15-8-6: APPROVAL OR DENIAL OF PERMITS:

level of service standard for a public facility or service may be approved as
long as all other provisions of this code are met.
   B.   Denials: Permits which would result in a reduction of an adopted level
of service standard for a public facility or service are subject to denial.
(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003)
15-8-7: CONCURRENCY TEST REQUEST WITHOUT APPLICATION:
A test for concurrency may be requested without an accompanying permit
application. Any available capacity found at the time of the test cannot be
reserved and no certificate of capacity will be issued. (Ord. 778, 10-30-2003,

15-14-2-2: SEPA POLICIES:
The city designates the following general policies as the basis for the city's
exercise of authority pursuant to this chapter:
   A.   The city shall use all practicable means, consistent with other
essential considerations of state policy, to improve and coordinate plans,
functions, programs and resources.
   B.   The city recognizes that each person has a fundamental and inalienable
right to a healthful environment, and that each person has a responsibility to
contribute to the preservation and enhancement of the environment.
   C.   The city incorporates by reference all policies in the cited city
codes, ordinances, resolutions and plans, and all amendments to them in effect
prior to the date of a technically complete application of any building permit
or preliminary plat, or prior to issuance of a DNS or DEIS for any other
action. These documents include, but are not limited to, the following: Orting
comprehensive plan and incorporated elements, development code, critical area
regulations, shoreline master program, uniform building code, uniform fire
code, uniform plumbing code, uniform mechanical code, uniform code for
abatement of dangerous buildings, floodplain management code, six (6) year

      1.   If the applicable regulations require studies that adequately
analyze all of the project's specific probable adverse environmental impacts,
additional studies under this chapter will not be necessary on those impacts;
      2.   If the applicable regulations require measures that adequately
address such environmental impacts, additional measures would likewise not be
required under this chapter; and
      3.   If the applicable regulations do not adequately analyze or address a
proposal's specific probable adverse environmental impacts, this chapter
provides the authority and procedures for additional review. (Ord. 778, 10-30-
2003, eff. 11-11-2003)
15-14-2-3: ADDITIONAL DEFINITIONS:

(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord. 2024-1126, 4-10-2024)
15-14-2-4: DESIGNATION OF RESPONSIBLE OFFICIAL:
   A.   For those proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the
responsible official shall be the administrator or his/her authorized designee.
   B.   For all proposals for which the city is the lead agency, the
responsible official shall make the threshold determination, supervise scoping
and preparation of any required environmental impact statement (EIS), and
perform any other functions assigned to the lead agency or responsible official
by those sections of the SEPA rules that were adopted by reference in section
15-14-2-1.
   C.   The city shall retain all documents required by the SEPA rules (chapter
197-11 WAC) and make them available in accordance with chapter 42.56 Revised
Code of Washington.
(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord. 2024-1126, 4-10-2024)
15-14-2-5: LEAD AGENCY DETERMINATION AND RESPONSIBILITIES:
   A.   The city shall be the lead agency for any nonexempt action under WAC
197-11-050, 197-11-253, and 197-11-922 through 197-11-940, unless the lead
agency has been previously determined or the city is aware that another agency
is in the process of determining the lead agency.
   B.   When the city is the lead agency for a proposal, the administrator
shall determine the responsible official designee who shall supervise
compliance with the threshold determination requirements, and if an
environmental impact statement (EIS) is necessary, shall supervise preparation
of the EIS.
   C.   When the city is not the lead agency for a proposal, all departments of
the city shall use and consider, as appropriate, either the determination of
nonsignificance (DNS) or the final EIS of the lead agency in making decisions
on the proposal. No city department shall prepare or require preparation of a
DNS or EIS in addition to that prepared by the lead agency, unless required
under WAC 197-11-600. In some cases, the city may conduct supplemental
environmental review under WAC 197-11-600.
   D.   If the city receives a lead agency determination made by another agency
that appears inconsistent with the criteria of WAC 197-11-253 or 197-11-922
through 197-11-940, it may object to the determination. Any objection must be
made to the agency originally making the determination and resolved within
fifteen (15) days of receipt of the determination, or the city must petition
the department of ecology for a lead agency determination under WAC 197-11-946
within the fifteen (15) day time period.
   E.   When the city is lead agency for a model toxic control act (MTCA)
remedial action, the department of ecology shall be provided an opportunity
under WAC 197-11-253(5) to review the environmental documents prior to public
notice being provided. If the SEPA and MTCA documents are issued together with
one public comment period under WAC 197-11-253(6), the city shall decide
jointly with ecology who receives the comment letters and how copies of the
comment letters will be distributed to the other agency.
(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord. 2024-1126, 4-10-2024)
15-14-2-6: ADDITIONAL TIMING CONSIDERATIONS:
   A.   For nonexempt proposals, the DNS or final EIS for the proposal shall
accompany the city's staff recommendation to the appropriate advisory body, if
any.
   B.   If the city's only action on a proposal is a decision on a building
permit or other license that requires detailed project plans and
specifications, the applicant may request in writing that the city conduct
environmental review prior to submission of the detailed plans and
specifications. Sufficient information shall be required from the applicant to
enable the responsible official to adequately fulfill his responsibility under
SEPA and this chapter consistent with the provisions of WAC 197-11-100 and 197-
11-335, which sections are adopted by reference in this chapter. (Ord. 778, 10-

(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003)
15-14-3-2: FLEXIBLE THRESHOLDS FOR CATEGORICAL EXEMPTIONS:
   A.   The city establishes the following exempt levels for minor new
construction under WAC 197-11-800(1)(c) based on local conditions:
      1.   For residential dwelling units in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(i): Up to

parking spaces, cumulative.
      5.   For landfills and excavations in WAC 197-11-800(1)(b)(v): Up to five
hundred (500) cumulative cubic yards.
   B.   Whenever the city establishes new exempt levels under this section, it
shall send them to the department of ecology, headquarters office, Olympia, WA
98504, under WAC 197-11-800(1)(c).
(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord. 2024-1126, 4-10-2024)
15-14-3-3: EMERGENCIES:
   Actions which must be undertaken immediately, or within a time frame too
short to allow full compliance with this chapter, to avoid an immediate threat
to public health and safety, to prevent an immediate danger to public or
private property, or to prevent an imminent threat of serious environmental
degradation, shall be exempt from the procedural requirements of this chapter
(WAC 197-11-800). The responsible official shall determine on a case by case
basis emergency actions which satisfy the general requirements of this section
15-14-3.
(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord. 2024-1126, 4-10-2024)
15-14-3-4: USE OF EXEMPTIONS:
   A.   Each department within the city that receives an application for a
license, or, in the case of governmental proposals, the department initiating
the proposal, shall determine whether the license and/or the proposal is
exempt. The department's determination that a proposal is exempt shall be final
and not subject to administrative review. If a proposal is exempt, none of the
procedural requirements of this chapter apply to the proposal. The City shall
not require completion of an environmental checklist for an exempt proposal. In
addition, the city is not required to document that a proposal is categorically
exempt. The city may note on an application that a proposal is categorically
exempt or place such a determination in the agency's files.
   B.   In determining whether or not a proposal is exempt, the responsible
official shall make certain the proposal is properly defined and shall identify
the governmental licenses required (WAC 197-11-060). If a proposal includes
exempt and nonexempt actions, the city shall determine the lead agency even if
the license application that triggers the city's consideration is exempt.
   C.   If a proposal includes both exempt and nonexempt actions the city may
authorize exempt actions prior to compliance with the procedural requirements
of this chapter, except that:
      1.   The city shall not give authorization for:
         a.   Any nonexempt action;
         b.   Any action that would have an adverse environmental impact; or
         c.   Any action that would limit the choice of alternatives;
      2.   The city may withhold approval of an exempt action that would lead
to modification of the physical environment, when such modification would serve
no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved; and
      3.   The city may withhold approval of exempt actions that would lead to
substantial financial expenditures by a private applicant when the expenditures
would serve no purpose if nonexempt action(s) were not approved.
(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord. 2024-1126, 4-10-2024)
15-14-3-5: ENVIRONMENTAL CHECKLIST:
   A.   A completed environmental checklist in the form provided in WAC 197-11-
960, shall be filed at the same time as an application for a permit, license
certificate, or other approval not specifically exempted in this chapter;
except, a checklist is not needed if the city and applicant agree an EIS is
required, SEPA compliance has been completed, or SEPA compliance has been
initiated by another agency. The city shall use the environmental checklist to
determine the lead agency and, if the city is the lead agency, for determining
the responsible official and for making the threshold determination.
   B.   For private proposals, the city will require the applicant to complete
the environmental checklist, providing assistance as necessary. For city
proposals, the department initiating the proposal shall complete the
environmental checklist for that proposal.
   C.   The city may require that it, and not the private applicant, will
complete all or part of the environmental checklist for a private proposal, at
the applicant's costs under the current fee schedule, if either of the
following occurs:
      1.   The city has technical information on a question or questions that
is unavailable to the private applicant; or
      2.   The applicant has provided inaccurate information on previous
proposals or on proposals currently under consideration.
   D.   For projects submitted as planned actions under WAC 197-11-164, the
city shall use its existing environmental checklist form or may modify the
environmental checklist form as provided in WAC 197-11-315. The modified
environmental checklist form may be prepared and adopted along with or as part
of a planned action ordinance; or developed after the ordinance is adopted. In
either case, a proposed modified environmental checklist form must be sent to
the department of ecology to allow at least a thirty (30) day review prior to
use.
   E.   During the review of the environmental checklist, the City may make
such changes or additions to the environmental checklist as are necessary to
make it an accurate statement. Alternatively, the City may return the checklist
to the applicant for revisions and/or additional information.
(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord. 2024-1126, 4-10-2024)
15-14-3-6: MITIGATED DNS:
   A.   As provided in this section and in WAC 197-11-350, the responsible
official may issue a DNS based on conditions attached to the proposal by the
responsible official or on changes to, or clarifications of, the proposal made
by the applicant.
   B.   An applicant may request in writing early notice of whether a DS is
likely under WAC 197-11-350. The request must:
      1.   Follow submission of a permit application and environmental
checklist for a nonexempt proposal for which the department is lead agency; and
      2.   Precede the city's actual threshold determination for the proposal.
   C.   The responsible official should respond to the request for early notice
within fifteen (15) calendar days unless otherwise agreed to. The response
shall:
      1.   Be written; and
      2.   State whether the city currently considers issuance of a DS likely
and, if so, indicate the general or specific area(s) of concern that is/are
leading the city to consider a DS; and
      3.   State that the applicant may change or clarify the proposal to
mitigate the indicated impacts, revising the environmental checklist and/or
permit application as necessary to reflect the changes or clarifications.
   D.   As much as possible, the city should assist the applicant with
identification of impacts to the extent necessary to formulate mitigation
measures.
   E.   When an applicant submits a changed or clarified proposal, along with a
revised or amended environmental checklist, the city shall base its threshold
determination on the changed or clarified proposal and should make the
determination within fifteen (15) days of receiving the changed or clarified
proposal:
      1.   If the city indicated specific mitigation measures in its response
to the request for early notice, and the applicant changed or clarified the
proposal to include those specific mitigation measures, the city shall issue
and circulate a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2);
      2.   If the city indicated areas of concern, but did not indicate
specific mitigation measures that would allow it to issue a DNS, the city shall
make the threshold determination, issuing a DNS or DS as appropriate;
      3.   The applicant's proposed mitigation measures (clarifications,
changes or conditions) must be in writing and must be specific. For example,
proposals to "control noise" or "prevent storm water runoff" are inadequate,
whereas proposals to "muffle machinery to X decibel" or "construct 200-foot
stormwater retention pond at Y location" are adequate; and
      4.   Mitigation measures which justify issuance of a mitigated DNS may be
incorporated in the DNS by reference to agency staff reports, studies or other
documents.
   F.   Any mitigated DNS issued under WAC 197-11-340(2) shall require a
fourteen (14) day comment period and public notice, or WAC 197-11-355, which
may require no additional comment period beyond the comment period on the
notice of application.
   G.   Mitigation measures incorporated in the mitigated DNS shall be deemed
conditions of approval of the permit decision and may be enforced in the same
manner as any term or condition of the permit, or enforced in any manner
specifically prescribed by the city.
   H.   If the City's tentative decision on the permit or approval does not
include mitigation measures that were incorporated in a mitigated DNS for the
proposal, the City should evaluate the threshold determination to assure
consistency with WAC 197-11-340(3)(a) (withdrawal of DNS).
   I.   The city's written response under subsection C of this section shall
not be construed as a determination of significance. In addition, preliminary
discussion of clarifications of changes to a proposal, as opposed to a written
request for early notice, shall not bind the city to consider the
clarifications or changes in its threshold determination.
(Ord. 778, 10-30-2003, eff. 11-11-2003; amd. Ord. 2024-1126, 4-10-2024)
15-14-3-7: OPTIONAL DNS PROCESS:
   A.   If the responsible official has a reasonable basis for determining that
significant adverse environmental impacts are unlikely, or that mitigation
measures have been identified that will reduce impacts to a nonsignificant
level, the responsible official may elect to use the single integrated comment
period set forth in this section. If this process is used, a second comment
period will typically not be required when the DNS is issued.
   B.   If the optional process set forth in this section is used, the
responsible official shall:
      1.   State on the first page of the notice of application that it expects
to issue a DNS for the proposal, and that:
         a.   The optional DNS process is being used;
         b.   This may be the only opportunity to comment on the environmental
impacts of the proposal;
         c.   The proposal may include mitigation measures under applicable
codes, and the project review process may incorporate or require mitigation
measures regardless of whether an EIS is prepared; and
         d.   A copy of the subsequent threshold determination for the specific
proposal may be obtained upon request (in addition, the city may maintain a
general mailing list for threshold determination distribution);
      2.   List in the notice of application the conditions being considered to
mitigate environmental impacts, if a mitigated DNS is expected;
      3.   Comply with the requirements for a notice of application and public
notice in Orting Municipal Code chapter 15-7; and
      4.   Send the notice of application and environmental checklist to:
         a.   Agencies with jurisdiction, the Department of Ecology, affected
tribes, and each local agency or political subdivision whose public services
would be changed as a result of implementation of the proposal; and
         b.   Anyone requesting a copy of the environmental checklist for the
specific proposal (in addition, the city may maintain a general mailing list
for checklist distribution).
   C.   If the responsible official indicates on the notice of application that
a DNS is likely, an agency with jurisdiction may assume lead agency status
during the comment period on the notice of application in accordance with WAC
197-11-948.
   D.   The responsible official shall consider timely comments on the notice
of application and either:
      1.   Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with no comment period using the
procedures in subsection E of this section;
      2.   Issue a DNS or mitigated DNS with a comment period using the
procedures in subsection E of this section, if the responsible official
determines a comment period is necessary;
      3.   Issue a DS; or
      4.   Require additional information or studies prior to making a
threshold determination.
   E.   If a DNS or mitigated DNS is issued under subsection (D)(1) or (D)(2)
of this section, the responsible official shall send a copy of the DNS or
mitigated DNS to the Department of Ecology, agencies with jurisdiction, those
who commented, and anyone requesting a copy. A copy of the environmental
checklist need not be recirculated.

official shall also notify the applicant of the city's procedure for EIS
preparation, including approval of the DEIS and FEIS prior to distribution.
   C.   The city may require an applicant to provide information the city does
not possess, including specific investigations. However, the applicant is not

15-14-5-3: PUBLIC NOTICE:
   A.   Whenever possible, the city shall integrate the public notice required
under this section with existing notice procedures for the city's nonexempt
permit(s) or approval(s) required for the proposal.
   B.   Whenever the city issues a DNS under WAC 197-11-340(2) or a DS under
WAC 197-11-360, the city shall give public notice as follows:
      1.   If an environmental document is issued concurrently with the notice
of application, the public notice requirements for the notice of application in
Revised Code of Washington 36.70B.110(4) will suffice to meet the SEPA public
notice requirements in WAC 197-11-510(1).
      2.   If no public notice is otherwise required for the permit or
approval, the city shall give notice of the DNS or DS by:
         a.   Posting the property, and posting in the city hall; and
         b.   Publishing notice in the city's newspaper of record.
      3.   Whenever the city issues a DS under WAC 197-11-360(3), the city
shall state the scoping procedure for the proposal in the DS as required in WAC
197-11-408 and in the public notice.
      4.   Any notice must be sent to the Department of Ecology for inclusion
on the department's SEPA register website.
      5.   If public notice is required for a nonexempt license, the notice
shall state whether a DS or DNS has been issued and when comments are due.
   C.   If a DNS is issued using the optional DNS process, the public notice
requirements for a notice of application in Revised Code of Washington
36.70B.110(4) as supplemented by the requirements in WAC 197-11-355 will

of any decision by a nonelected official conditioning or denying a proposal
under authority of SEPA, are formally eliminated. The administrative appeal
procedures provided by this section
15-14-7 shall be construed consistently with Revised Code of Washington
43.21.075, chapter 36.70B, and WAC 197-11-680.

appeal on the underlying governmental action in a single simultaneous hearing
before the hearing examiner or body. The hearing or appeal shall be one at
which the hearing examiner or body will consider either the agency's decision
or a recommendation on the proposed underlying governmental action. If no
hearing or appeal on the underlying governmental action is otherwise provided,
then no SEPA appeal is allowed under this section, except as allowed under
subsection E of this section.

      2.   The responsible official shall arrange to conduct the SEPA appeal in
conjunction with a hearing or appeal on the underlying permit or approval,
where required to consolidate the SEPA appeal with a hearing on the underlying
governmental action. Where consolidation is not required, the responsible
official shall schedule the hearing to be conducted within ninety (90) days of
the date of filing the notice of appeal, and payment of fee.
   G.   SEPA Procedural Appeals: SEPA procedural appeals shall be initiated and

in conjunction with the appeal of the underlying permit or approval, where such
appeal is allowed. Provided that, if no administrative appeal of the underlying
permit or approval is otherwise provided for, and consolidation is not required

decided in an open record hearing by the hearings examiner. The decision of the
hearing examiner on the SEPA procedural appeal shall be final and not subject
to further administrative appeal.

recommendation on the underlying proposal. The decision of the hearing examiner
or planning commission on the SEPA procedural appeal shall be final and not
subject to further administrative appeal.

hearing, in which case the SEPA appeal hearing shall be a closed record
hearing. The substantive SEPA appeal shall be heard in conjunction with any
procedural SEPA appeal. The decision of the hearing examiner on the SEPA
substantive appeal shall be final and not be subject to further administrative
appeal.
      2.   For all proposals subject to final administrative action, approval,
or recommendation, by a nonelected administrative official, for which an
administrative appeal or further approval hearing is otherwise provided or
required, any agency or aggrieved person may file a substantive SEPA appeal

conditioning, or denying the proposal on the basis of substantive SEPA
authority. Provided that, if the proposal is a project permit, a substantive
SEPA appeal shall be filed within ten (10) days after issuance of the notice of
decision. Any substantive SEPA appeal shall be conducted in the same manner and
with the same process as otherwise provided for the appeal or approval hearing
of the underlying administrative action.

15-14-9-3: FEES:
For the purpose of reimbursing the city for necessary costs and expenses
relating to its compliance with the SEPA rules and this chapter, the following
schedule of fees is established (in addition to the fees in the city's master
fee schedule):
   A.   Threshold Determination: For every environmental checklist the city
will review when it is lead agency, the city shall collect a fee as required by
the city fee schedule from the proponent of the proposal prior to undertaking
the threshold determination. In addition, for a threshold determination which
requires information in addition to that contained in or accompanying the
environmental checklist, the city shall collect a fee from the proponent in an
amount equal to the actual costs and expenses incurred by the city in
conducting any studies or investigations necessary to provide such information.
The time periods provided by this chapter for making a threshold determination
shall not begin to run until payment of the fees required by this subsection.
   B.   Environmental Impact Statement:
      1.   For all projects requiring an EIS for which the city is the lead
agency and for which the responsible official determines that the EIS shall be
prepared by the employees of the city, or that the city will contract directly
with a consultant or consultants for the preparation of an EIS, the city shall
collect from the proponent a fee in an amount equal to the actual costs and
expenses incurred by the city in preparing the EIS. Such fee shall also apply
when the city determines that the applicant may prepare the EIS, and the
responsible official determines that substantial revisions or reassessing of
impacts must be performed by employees of the city or city consultants to
ensure compliance with the provisions of the SEPA guidelines and this chapter.
      2.   If the responsible official determines that an EIS is required, and
that the EIS shall be prepared by employees of the city or by a consultant or
consultants retained by the city, or that the applicant-prepared EIS shall be
substantially rewritten by employees of the city, the applicant shall be
advised by the responsible official of the estimated costs and expenses of
preparing or rewriting the EIS prior to actual preparation or rewriting, and
the applicant shall post a bond or otherwise insure payment of such costs and
expenses. A consultant or consultants may be recommended by the applicant. The
final decision to hire a consultant or consultants shall be made by the city
council.
      3.   All fees owed to the city under this section shall be paid in full
by the applicant prior to final action by the city on the project. Any fee owed
to the city under this subsection B shall be paid by the applicant prior to the
initiation of actual preparation of an EIS (if required) or actual rewriting of
an applicant-prepared EIS by the city or its consultant(s). For all EISs
involving multiple applicants, the cost of preparation shall be divided among
the applicants according to the nature, amount, and type of work to be
performed. The city shall ask the EIS consultant to estimate the costs related
to the portion of the EIS associated with each application. The city shall make
the final decision on the costs to be billed to each applicant, regardless of
whether the EIS is prepared by a consultant or the city. If an applicant
disputes the amount of the fee, the fee may be paid under protest and without
prejudice to the applicant's right to file a claim and bring an action to
recover the fee.
      4.   If a proposal is modified so that an EIS is no longer required, the
responsible official shall refund any fees collected under this subsection B
which remain after incurred costs are paid.
   C.   Cost Of Notice: The city may collect from the applicant the cost of
meeting the public notice requirements of this chapter relating to the
applicant's proposal.
   D.   Performance Fee: The city shall not collect a fee for performing its
duties as a consulted agency.
   E.   Copies: The city may charge any person for copies of any document
prepared under this chapter, and for mailing the document, in a manner provided
by chapter 42.17 Revised Code of Washington.
