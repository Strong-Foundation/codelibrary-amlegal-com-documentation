EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification.  Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number.  For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06.  The code and article numbers appear left of the
decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the article number being all digits left of the decimal.  The
section number appears right of the decimal.  As another example, 113.10
indicates the code number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article
within code 1), and the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99.  Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections.  For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

laws in force at the time such proceedings take place, unless otherwise
specially provided; and that if any penalty or punishment be mitigated by the
new law, such new law may, with the consent of the party affected thereby, be
applied to any judgment pronounced after it has taken effect. (WVaC 2-2-8)
 
   (c)    The repeal by any provision of the Codified Ordinances of an
ordinance validating previous acts, contracts or transactions shall not affect
the validity of such acts, contracts or transactions, but the same shall remain
as valid as if there had been no such repeal, but no further.  (WVaC 2-2-11)
 
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   When reference is made to any section or group of sections of the Codified
Ordinances, such reference shall extend to and include any amendment of or
supplement to the section or group of sections so referred to or any section or
sections hereafter enacted in lieu thereof; and unless otherwise provided,
whenever a reference to a section or group of sections is made in any amendment
or supplement to any section of the Codified Ordinances hereafter enacted, such
reference shall be deemed to refer to the section or sections as the same shall
then stand or as thereafter amended. 
   Whenever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a section
or an inclusive group of sections, such reference shall be construed to mean a
violation of any provision of the section or sections included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

shall be sufficient if it be done by his agent or deputy, unless it be such as
cannot lawfully be done by deputation.  (WVaC 2-2-5)
 
101.07  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   If the provisions of different codes, articles or sections of the Codified
Ordinances conflict with or contravene each other, the provisions bearing the
latest passage date shall prevail. If the conflicting provisions bear the same
passage date, the conflict shall be construed so as to be consistent with the
meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
 
101.08  SEPARABILITY.
   Each section of the Codified Ordinances and every part of each section is an
independent section and part of a section, and the holding of any section or a
part thereof to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any cause does not
affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section or part thereof.
 
101.09  EXTRATERRITORIAL EXERCISE OF POWERS AND AUTHORITY.
   Wherever the powers and authority granted in the City ordinances cannot be
reasonably and efficiently exercised by confining the exercise thereof within
the corporate limits of the Municipality, the powers and authority of the
Municipality shall extend beyond the corporate limits to the extent necessary
to the reasonably efficient exercise of such powers and authority within the
corporate limits. Such powers and authority, unless provided in the West
Virginia Code or elsewhere in law, shall not, however, extend more than one
mile beyond the corporate limits, and such powers and authority shall not
extend into the corporate limits of another Municipality without the consent of
the governing body thereof.
(Passed 12-8-76. )

Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the failure to do any
act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is otherwise
provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be fined not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00).  Each day any such violation continues shall
constitute a separate offense.  (Ord. 1990-5.  Passed 5-1-90.)

   (b)   “Hearing” means any meeting in the course of an investigatory

oath, conducted by a hearing board for the purpose of taking or inducing
testimony or receiving evidence.
   (c)   “Hearing board” means a board appointed to hold a hearing on a
complaint against an accused officer.  The hearing board shall consist of three
members to be appointed pursuant to this subdivision.
      (1)   For noncivil service police departments, the hearing board shall be
a standing hearing board.  The department chief shall appoint the first member,
the local fraternal order of police shall appoint the second member, and the
local chamber of commerce or local businessmen’s association shall appoint the
third member.  If there is no local fraternal order of police, the state
fraternal order of police shall appoint the second member.  If there is no
local chamber of commerce or local businessmen’s association, the first and
second members shall appoint the third member by agreement.  Of the three
original appointments in each police department, the first member shall serve
for six years from the date of his or her appointment; the second members shall
serve four years from the date of his or her appointment; and the third member 
shall serve for two years from the date of his or her appointment.  After the

body who in the first instance appointed the member who is no longer a member. 
When the hearing board is appointed, the three members shall elect one of their
member to act as president of the board, who shall serve as president for one
year.  In the event that a member has had a part in the investigation or
interrogation of an accused officer or is related by consanguinity or affinity
to an accused officer, that member shall be recused from participation in the
accused officer’s hearing.  In such an instance, the officer or body who in the
first instance appointed the recused member shall appoint another person for
the sole purpose of the accused officer’s hearing.  No member shall hold any
other office (other than the office of notary public) under the United States,
this state, or any municipality, county or other political subdivision thereof;
nor shall any member serve on any political committee or take any active part
in the management of any political campaign.
      (2)   Any member of a hearing board appointed under paragraph (a) of this
subdivision may be removed as provided in this paragraph.
   The Mayor of the Municipality may, at any time, remove any hearing board
member for good cause, which shall be stated in writing and made a part of the
records of the hearing board.  However, within ten days of removing any member,
the Mayor shall file in the circuit clerk’s office of the county in which the
municipality is located a petition setting forth in full the reason for the
removal and seeking the circuit court’s confirmation of the Mayor’s removal of
the member.  The Mayor shall file a copy of the petition with the removed
member at the same time it is filed with the circuit clerk.  The petition shall
have precedence on the circuit court’s docket and shall be heard as soon as
practicable on the request of the removed member.  All rights vested in a
circuit court by this subsection may be exercised by the judge thereof in
vacation. In the event that no term of the circuit court is being held at the
time the petition is filed, and the judge thereof cannot be reached in the
county in which the petition was filed, the petition shall be heard at the next
succeeding circuit court term, whether regular or special, and the removed
member shall remain removed until a hearing is held on the petition.  The court
or the judge thereof in vacation shall hear and decide the issues presented by
the petition.  The party affected adversely by the court’s or judge’s decision
shall have the right to petition the supreme court of appeals for a review of
the decision as in other civil cases.  If the Mayor fails to file the petition
with the circuit clerk’s office within ten days as provided above, the removed
member shall immediately resume his or her position as a hearing board member.
   Any resident of the municipality shall have the right at any time to seek
the removal of any hearing board member.  To do so, the resident shall file a
petition in the circuit clerk’s office of the county where the municipality is
located.  The resident shall also serve a copy of the petition on the member
sought to be removed.  The petition shall be matured for hearing and heard by
the circuit court or the judge thereof in vacation in the same manner as civil
proceedings in the circuit courts of this state are heard.  Any party adversely
affected by the circuit court’s or judge’s decision shall have the right to
petition to supreme court of appeals for a review of the decision as in other
civil cases.

of the West Virginia Code.

department employed by the city or municipality, but shall not include the
highest ranking officer of the police or any noncivil service officer who has
not completed the probationary period established by the department by which he
or she is employed.
   (f)   “Punitive action” means any action which may lead to dismissal,
demotion, suspension, reduction in salary, written reprimand or transfer for

which may result in punitive action.  (Ord. 2002-2.  Passed 3-5-02.)

at a time when the police officer is on duty, or during his normal working
hours, unless the seriousness of the investigation requires otherwise.  If such
interrogation does occur during off-duty time of the police officer being
interrogated at any place other than his residence, such officer shall be
compensated for such off-duty time in accordance with regular department
procedure.  If the interrogation of the police officer occurs during his
regular duty hours, such officer shall not be released from employment for any
work missed due to interrogation.
   (b)   Any police officer under investigation shall be informed of the nature
of the investigation prior to any interrogation.  Such officer shall also be
informed of the name, rank and command of the officer in charge of the
interrogation, the interrogating officers, and all other persons to be present
during the interrogation.  No more than three interrogators at one time shall
question the officer under investigation.
   (c)   No police officer under interrogation shall be subjected to offensive
language or threatened with punitive action.  No promise of reward shall be
made as an inducement to answering questions.
   (d)   The complete interrogation of any police officer shall be recorded,
either written, taped or transcribed.  Upon request of the law-enforcement
officer under investigation or his counsel and upon advance payment of the
reasonable cost thereof a copy of the record shall be made available to him not
less than ten days prior to any hearing.
   (e)   Upon the filing of a formal written statement of charges or whenever
an interrogation focuses on matters which are likely to result in punitive
action against any police officer, then that officer shall have the right to be
represented by counsel who may be present at all times during such
interrogation.
Nothing herein shall prohibit the immediate temporary suspension, pending an
investigation, from duty of any police officer or fireman who reports for duty
under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances which would prevent the
officer from performing his duties as defined in this chapter, or under the
influence of an apparent mental or emotional disorder.
      (Ord. 2002-2.  Passed 3-5-02.)
140.03  HEARING.
   (a)   Before taking any punitive action against an accused officer, the
police officer shall give notice to the accused officer that he or she is
entitled to a hearing on the issues by a hearing board or the applicable civil
service commission. The notice shall state the time and place of the hearing
and the issues involved and shall be delivered to the accused officer no later
than ten days prior to the hearing.
   (b)   When a non-civil service accused officer faces any recommended
punitive action, the applicable hearing board shall conduct hearing pursuant to
the provisions of this section.
   (c)   The following requirements shall govern the operation conduct of a

decision or action it takes as a result of the hearing.  The written order

assignment or other personnel action to disclose any item of his property,
income, assets, source of income, debts or personal or domestic expenditures

successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn.  But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk.  Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway
in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait.  No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05  FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal).  When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal).  When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of  vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising.  This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07  ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL  DEVICES.

for an offense as described in subsection (b) of this section and the
subsection creating the offense requires a period of incarceration, period of
license revocation, or fine that is greater than what is required for a
conviction under this subsection, the greater period of incarceration, period
of revocation, or fine shall be imposed: provided, however, that this section
does not apply to a second conviction that is subject to a period of license
revocation under subsection (h) of this section.
   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions
under this section:
      (1)   Any conviction under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), (d),

other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state of an

10-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and
      (3)   Any period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b for violation of subsection (c) of this section, which

arrest in the current proceeding.
   (l)   A person may be charged in a warrant, indictment, or information for a
second or subsequent offense, as described in subsection (h) or (j) of this
section, if the person has been previously arrested for, or charged with, a
violation of this section which is alleged to have occurred within the
applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense.  In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses.  No
person may be convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this section
unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:
provided, that the court may apply the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11A-
1 et seq. to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for
a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b
to persons adjudicated thereunder.  An order for home detention by the court
pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B-1 et seq. may be used
as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation
of this section, electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten
days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not
leave home for those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.
   (o)   A person whose license to operate a motor vehicle has been revoked or
suspended by the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles pursuant to
this section must complete a comprehensive safety and treatment program as set
forth in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3 before his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle can be reinstated and his or her driving privileges restored.
   (p)   For any offense for which an alternative revocation period is
permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the
order to the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles.

333.011 PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM.
   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,
without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, shall
defer further proceedings and impose probation, when:
         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a.  Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard.  If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges.  This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program.  A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney.  If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant.  If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
 333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq.  Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial.  No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)    In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision

commercial motor vehicles;

motor vehicle revoked for any offense under a municipal ordinance of this state
or any other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state
which has the same elements as an offense described in this article; or
      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard.  If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

any residential street, or in any parking area, or upon the ways of any
institution of higher education, whether public or private or upon the property
of the Board of Education, or upon any property within the Municipal park and
public recreation system, in willful or wanton disregard for the safety of
persons or property.
 
   (b)   The provisions of subsection (a) hereof shall not apply to those areas
which have been temporarily closed for racing sport events or which may be set

of either his blood, breath or urine for the purposes of determining the
alcoholic content of his blood.  A preliminary breath analysis may be
administered in accordance with the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5-
5 whenever a police officer has reasonable cause to believe a person to have
been driving a motor vehicle upon the public streets and highways while under
the influence of alcohol, controlled substance or drugs as prohibited by
Section
333.01.  A secondary test of blood, breath or urine shall be incidental to a
lawful arrest and shall be administered at the direction of the arresting law
enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person to have
been driving a motor vehicle upon the public streets or highways while under
the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs as prohibited by

525.01  CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section.  A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit.  The court may cause
a citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that
they appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the
issuance of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered
for the penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the
principal and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. 
The money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to
the treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the
offender was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

custody or control of any minor child, shall willfully abandon or neglect the
minor child.
   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

   (a)   “Antique firearm” means:
      (1)   Any firearm, including, but not limited to, a firearm with a match
lock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system which was
manufactured on or before 1898;
      (2)   Any replica of any firearm described in subsection (a)(1) hereof if
such replica is not designed or redesigned to use rimfire or conventional
centerfire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United
States and which is not readily available in the ordinary channels of
commercial trade; and
      (3)   Any muzzle-loading rifle, muzzle-loading shotgun, or muzzle-loading
pistol, which is designed to use black powder, or black powder substitute, and
which cannot use fixed ammunition.  For purposes of this subdivision, the term
“antique firearm” shall not include any weapon which includes a firearm frame
or receiver, any firearm which is converted into a muzzle-loading weapon, or
any muzzle-loading weapon which can be readily converted to fire fixed
ammunition by replacing the barrel, bolt, breechblock, or any combination
thereof.
   (b)   "Blackjack" means a short bludgeon consisting, at the striking end, of
an encased piece of lead or some other heavy substance and, at the handle end,

object is struck.  "Blackjack" includes, but is not limited to, a billy, billy
club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (c)   “Concealed” means hidden from ordinary observation so as to prevent
disclosure or recognition.  A deadly weapon is concealed when it is carried on
or about the person in such a manner that another person in the ordinary course
of events would not be placed on notice that the deadly weapon was being
carried.  For purposes of concealed handgun licensees, a licensee is considered
to be carrying on or about his or her person while in or on a motor vehicle if
the firearm is located in a storage area in or on the motor vehicle.
   (d)   “Controlled substance” has the same meaning as is ascribed to that
term in West Virginia Code 60A-1-101(e).
   (e)   “Deadly weapon” means an instrument which is designed to be used to

The term “deadly weapon” includes, but is not limited to, the instruments

limited to, any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and
one-half inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any
other instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds.  A
pocket knife with a blade three and one-half inches or less in length, a
hunting or fishing knife carried for hunting, fishing, sports or other
recreational uses, or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement
shall not be included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless the
knife is knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury
or death.
   (j)   “Metallic or false knuckles” means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck.  The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or

Service Area so as to prevent branches from coming in contact with Grantee's
wires, cables, or other equipment. Grantee shall be permitted to charge Persons
who own, or are responsible for, such trees or natural growth for the cost of
such trimming, provided that similar charges are assessed by and paid to the
utilities of Franchising Authority for tree trimming. Grantee shall reasonably
compensate Franchising Authority or property owner for any damages caused by
such trimming, or shall, in its sole discretion and at its own cost and
expense, reasonably replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any
construction of the System undertaken by Grantee. Such replacement shall
satisfy any and all obligations Grantee may have to Franchising Authority or
property owner pursuant to the terms of this Section.
   (f)   Safety Requirements. Construction, installation, and maintenance of
the Cable System shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All
such work shall be performed in substantial accordance with applicable FCC or
other federal, state, and local regulations. The Cable System shall not
unreasonably endanger or interfere with the safety of Persons or property in
the Service Area.
   (g)   Aerial and Underground Construction. In those areas of the Service
Area where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective
public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are
underground, Grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities underground; provided that such
facilities are actually capable of receiving Grantee's cable and other
equipment without technical degradation of the Cable System's signal quality.
In those areas of the Service Area where the transmission or distribution
facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are both aerial and underground, Grantee
shall have the sole discretion to construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities, or any part thereof, aerially or
underground. Nothing contained in this subsection shall require Grantee to
construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances
such as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters,
directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals, or other related
equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
subsection, in the event that all of the transmission or distribution
facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications and electric services are placed underground after the effective
date of this Ordinance, Grantee shall only be required to construct, operate,
and maintain all of its transmission and distribution facilities underground if
it is given reasonable notice and access to the public utilities' facilities at
the time that such are placed underground.
   (h)   Required Extensions of Service. The Cable System, as constructed as of
the date of the passage and final adoption of this Ordinance, substantially
complies with the material provisions hereof. Grantee is hereby authorized to
extend the Cable System as necessary, as desirable, or as required pursuant to
the terms hereof within the Service Area. Whenever Grantee shall receive a
request for service from at least thirty (30) residential dwellings within one
(1) mile of its trunk or distribution cable, it shall extend its Cable System
to such dwellings at no cost to the subscriber for system extension, other than
the usual connection fees for all Subscribers; provided that such extension is
technically feasible, and if it will not adversely affect the operation,
financial condition, or market development of the Cable System, or as provided
for under subsection (i) hereof.
   (i)   Subscriber Charges for Extensions of Service. No Subscriber shall be
refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such as a
Subscriber's request to locate a cable drop underground, existence of more than
one hundred fifty (150) feet of distance from distribution cable to connection
of service to Subscribers, or a density as described in subsection (h) hereof,
Cable Service may be made available on the basis of a capital contribution in
aid of construction, including cost of material, labor, and easements.
Potential Subscribers shall bear the costs of the construction and other costs
on a pro rata basis. Grantee may require payment in advance of the capital
contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential subscribers.
   (j)   Service to Public Schools. Grantee shall provide without charge one
(1) outlet of Basic Cable to municipal buildings and public elementary, junior,
middle and high schools that are passed by its Cable System. The outlets of
Basic Cable shall not be used to distribute or sell Cable Service in or
throughout such buildings; nor shall such outlets be located in common or
public areas open to the public. Users of such outlets shall hold Grantee
harmless from any and all liability or claims arising out of their use of such
outlets, including, but not limited to, those arising from copyright liability.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this subsection, Grantee
shall not be required to provide an outlet to such buildings where the drop
line from the feeder cable to such buildings or premises exceeds one hundred
fifty (150) cable feet, unless it is technically feasible and it will not
adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market development of
the Cable System to do so, or unless the appropriate governmental entity agrees
to pay the incremental cost of such drop line in excess of 150 cable feet. In
the event that additional outlets of Basic Cable are provided to such
buildings, the building owner shall pay the usual installation fees associated
therewith, including, but not limited to, labor and materials. Upon request of
Grantee, the building owner may also be required to pay the service fees
associated with the provision of Basic Cable and the additional outlets
relating thereto.  (Ord. 2011-5.  Passed 6-21-11.)
733.04  REGULATION BY FRANCHISING AUTHORITY.
   (a)   Franchise Fee.
      (1)   Grantee shall pay to Franchising Authority a franchise fee equal to
three percent (3%) of Gross Revenues from the provision of Cable Services
within the Franchise Area received by Grantee on a quarterly basis; provided,
however, that Grantee may credit against any such payments:
         A.   Any tax, fee, or assessment of any kind imposed by Franchising
Authority or other governmental entity on a cable operator, or Subscriber, or
both, solely because of their status as such;
         B.   Any tax, fee or assessment of general applicability which is
unduly discriminatory against cable operators or Subscribers (including any
such tax, fee, or assessment imposed, both on utilities and cable operators and
their services), and
         C.   Any other special tax, assessment, or fee such as a business,
occupation, and entertainment tax. For the purpose of this section, the three
month period applicable under the Franchise for the computation of the
franchise fee shall be a calendar quarter, unless otherwise agreed to in
writing by Franchising Authority and Grantee. The franchise fee payment shall
be due and payable thirty (30) days after the close of the preceding calendar
quarter. Each payment shall be accompanied by a letter from a representative of
Grantee showing the basis for the computation.
      (2)   Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation for
recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be three (3) years from
the date on which payment by Grantee is due. Unless within three (3) years from
and after such payment due date Franchising Authority initiates a lawsuit for
recovery of franchise fees in a court of competent jurisdiction, recovery shall
be barred and Franchising Authority shall be stopped from asserting any claims
whatsoever against Grantee relating to alleged franchise fee deficiencies.
   (b)   Rates and Charges.   Franchising Authority may not regulate the rates
for the provision of Cable Service or other service, including, but not limited
to, ancillary charges relating thereto, except as expressly provided herein and
except as may be authorized pursuant to federal and state law. From time to
time, and at any time, Grantee has the right to modify its rates and charges,
at its discretion and without consent of Franchising Authority, including, but
not limited to, the implementation of additional charges and rates; provided,
however, that Grantee shall give notice to Franchising Authority of any such
modifications or additional charges thirty (30) days prior to the effective
date thereof.
   (c)   Conditions of Sale.   Except to the extent expressly required by
federal or state law, if a renewal or extension of the Franchise is denied or
the Franchise is lawfully terminated, and Franchising Authority either lawfully
acquires ownership of the Cable System or by its actions lawfully effects a
transfer of ownership of the Cable System to another party, any such
acquisition or transfer shall be at a fair market value, determined on the
basis of the Cable System valued as a going concern.
   Grantee and Franchising Authority agree that in the case of a lawful
revocation of the Franchise, at Grantee's request, which shall be made in its
sole discretion, Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate
a transfer of its Cable System to a qualified third party. Franchising
Authority further agrees that during such a period of time, it shall authorize
Grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior Franchise;
however, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater
than six (6) months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end
of that time, Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or
assignee of its Cable System which is reasonably acceptable to Franchising
Authority, Grantee and Franchising Authority may avail themselves of any rights
they may have pursuant to federal or state law; it being further agreed that
Grantee's continued operation of its Cable System during the six (6) month
period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights
of either Franchising Authority or Grantee. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary set forth in this subsection, neither Franchising Authority nor
Grantee shall be required to violate federal or state law.
   (d)   Transfer of Franchise.   All of the rights and privileges and all of
the obligations, duties and liabilities created by this Franchise shall pass to
and be binding upon the successors of the Franchising Authority and the
successors and assigns of Grantee; and the same shall not be assigned or
transferred without the written approval of the City Council, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that this section shall
not prevent the assignment or hypothecation of the Franchise by Grantee as
security for debt without such approval; and provided further that transfers or
assignments of this Franchise between any parent and subsidiary corporation or
between entities of which at least fifty percent (50%) of the beneficial
ownership is held by the same person, persons, or entities which are controlled
or managed by the same person, persons, or entities, shall be permitted without
the prior approval of the Franchising Authority("intracompany transfers").
Grantee shall notify Franchising Authority in writing within 30 days of the
closing of such intracompany transfer.  (Ord. 2011-5.  Passed 6-21-11.)
733.05  COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING.
   (a)   Books and Records. Grantee agrees that Franchising Authority may
review such of Grantee's books and records, during normal business hours and on
a nondisruptive basis, as are reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with
the terms hereof. Such records include, but are not limited to, any public
records required to be kept by Grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of
the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Grantee
shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be
proprietary or confidential in nature. Franchising Authority agrees to treat
any information disclosed to it by Grantee as confidential, and to disclose it
only to employees, representatives, and agents of Franchising Authority that
have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof.
(Ord. 2011-5.  Passed 6-21-11.)
733.06  INSURANCE, INDEMNIFICATION, AND BONDS OR OTHER SURETY.
   (a)   Insurance Requirements.
      (1)   The Grantee shall maintain throughout the term of the Franchise
insurance in amounts at least as follows:
 
Workers’ Compensation                  Statutory Limits
Commercial General Liability             Combined Single Liability (C.S.L.)
                                         2,000,000 General Aggregate
Auto Liability including coverage on all $1,000,000 per occurrence C.S.L.
owned, non-owned hired autos              
Umbrella Liability                       $1,000,000 per occurrence C.S.L.
$1,000,000 per occurrence
 
      (2)   The Grantor shall be added as an additional insured to the above
Commercial General Liability, Auto Liability and Umbrella Liability insurance
coverage.
      (3)   The Grantee shall furnish the Grantor with current certificates of
insurance evidencing such coverage upon request.
   (b)   Indemnification. Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless,
and defend Franchising Authority, its officers, boards and employees, from and
against any liability for damages and for any liability or claims resulting
from property damage or bodily injury (including accidental death) which arise
out of Grantee's construction, operation or maintenance of its Cable System,
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.
   (c)   Bonds and other Surety.   Except as expressly provided herein, Grantee
shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a
condition of being awarded the Franchise or continuing its existence.
Franchising Authority acknowledges that the legal, financial, and technical
qualifications of Grantee are sufficient to afford compliance with the terms of
the Franchise and the enforcement thereof. Grantee and Franchising Authority
recognize that the costs associated with bonds and other surety may ultimately
be borne by the Subscribers in the form of increased rates for Cable Service or
other service. In order to minimize such costs, Franchising Authority agrees to
require bonds and other surety only in such amounts and during such times as
there is a reasonably demonstrated need therefor. Franchising Authority agrees
that in no event, however, shall it require a bond or other related surety in
an aggregate amount greater than ten thousand dollars ($10,000), conditioned
upon the substantial performance of the material terms, covenants, and
conditions of the Franchise. Initially, no bond or other surety shall be
required. In the event that one is required in the future, Franchising
Authority agrees to give Grantee at least sixty (60) days prior written notice
thereof stating the exact reason for the requirement. Such reason must
demonstrate a change in Grantee's legal, financial, or technical qualifications
which would materially prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms
of the Franchise or afford compliance therewith.
(Ord. 2011-5.  Passed 6-21-11.)
733.07  ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE.
   (a)   Notice of Violation.   In the event that Franchising Authority
believes that Grantee has not complied with the terms of the Franchise, it
shall notify Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged default.
   (b)   Grantee's Right to Cure or Respond.  Grantee shall have sixty (60)
days from receipt of the notice described in subsection (a) hereof:
      (1)   To respond to Franchising Authority contesting the assertion of
default;
      (2)   To cure such default; or
      (3)   In the event that, by the nature of the default, such default
cannot be cured within the sixty (60) day period, to initiate reasonable steps
to remedy such default and to notify Franchising Authority of the steps being
taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
   (c)   Public Hearing.  In the event that Grantee fails to respond to the
notice described in subsection (a) hereof pursuant to the procedures set forth
in subsection (b) hereof, or in the event that the alleged default is not
remedied within one hundred twenty (120) days after Grantee is notified of the
alleged default pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, Franchising Authority shall
schedule a public meeting to investigate the default. Such public meeting shall
be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of Franchising Authority which
is scheduled at a time which is no fewer than five (5) business days therefrom.
Franchising Authority shall notify Grantee of the time and place of such
meeting and provide Grantee with an opportunity to be heard.
   (d)   Enforcement.  Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the
event Franchising Authority determines, after such meeting, that Grantee is in
default of any provision of the Franchise, Franchising Authority may:
      (1)   Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided under the
Franchise, if any, including, without limitation, any bonds or other surety;
provided, however, that the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and in
such amount as Franchising Authority reasonably determines is necessary to
remedy the default;
      (2)   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other
equitable relief;
      (3)   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
Franchise, declare the Franchise Agreement to be revoked; or
      (4)   Seek specific performance of any provision which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages.
   Grantee shall not be relieved of any of its obligations to comply promptly
with any provision of the Franchise by reason of any failure of Franchising
Authority to enforce prompt compliance.
   (e)   Acts of God.  Grantee shall not be held in default of the provisions
of the Franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating thereto, where
such alleged default is caused by strikes, acts of God, power outages, or other
events reasonably beyond its ability to control.  (Ord. 2011-5.  Passed 6-21-
11.)
733.08  UNAUTHORIZED RECEPTION.
   (a)   Misdemeanor.  In addition to those criminal and civil remedies
provided by state and federal law, it shall be a misdemeanor for any Person to
create or make, use of any unauthorized connection, whether physically,
electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any part of the
Cable System without the express consent of Grantee. Further, without the
express consent of Grantee, it shall be a misdemeanor for any Person to tamper
with, remove, or injure any property, equipment, or part of the Cable System or
any means of receiving Cable Service or other service. Subject to applicable
federal and state law, Franchising Authority shall incorporate into its
criminal code, if not presently a part thereof, criminal misdemeanor law which
shall enforce the intent of this subsection (a) hereof.
(Ord. 2011-5.  Passed 6-21-11.)
733.09  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Preemption.  If the FCC or any other federal or state body or agency
shall now or hereafter exercise any paramount jurisdiction over the subject
matter of the Franchise, then to the extent such jurisdiction shall preempt and
supersede or preclude the exercise of the like jurisdiction by Franchising
Authority, the jurisdiction of Franchising Authority shall cease and no longer
exist.
   (b)   Employment Requirements.  Grantee shall afford equal opportunity in
employment to all qualified persons. No person shall be discriminated against
in employment because of race, color, religion, national origin or sex. Grantee
shall maintain and carry out a continuing program of specific practices
designed to assure equal opportunity in every aspect of its employment policies
and practices.
   (c)   Actions of Franchising Authority.  In any action by Franchising
Authority or representative thereof mandated or permitted under the terms
hereof, such party shall act in a reasonable, expeditious and timely manner.
Furthermore, in any instance where approval or consent is required under the
terms hereof, such approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   (d)   Notice.  Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every
notice or response to be served upon Franchising Authority or Grantee shall be
in writing, and shall be deemed to have been duly given to the required party
five (5) business days after having been posted in a properly sealed and
correctly addressed envelope by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid,
at a Post Office or branch thereof regularly maintained by the U.S. Postal
Service.

of competent jurisdiction or by any state or federal regulatory authority
having jurisdiction thereof, such determination shall have no effect on the
validity of any other Section, sentence, paragraph, term or provision hereof,
all of which shall remain in full force and effect for the term of the
Franchise, or any renewal or renewals thereof.  (Ord. 2011-5.  Passed 6-21-11.)

hereby levied on every person engaging in or prosecuting, within the City, any
such businesses, activities, trades or employment.
(1972 Code §11-1-1)

   Payment in full of the proper fee as specified in this article, the issuance

conditions precedent to the transaction of any business, activity, trade or
employment for which a license is required by this article.
(1972 Code §11-1-2)
753.03  FEE FOR LICENSE TO DO BUSINESS.
   In every case in which a license or permit to do business in the City is
granted, whether or not a license tax is imposed, the person applying for such
license or permit shall pay a fee of one dollar ($1.00) which fee shall be in
addition to the license tax, if any, imposed.  This fee is for the issuing or
granting of a permit or license and shall not be collected when a tax only is
imposed and no license or permit is issued or required.
(Ord. 2015-03.  Passed 6-30-15.)
753.04  EFFECT OF CITY LICENSE.
   Nothing in this article, and no payment or issuance of any certificate of

otherwise may be in violation of any ordinance or law, or to exempt any person
from any penalty prescribed for such violation. (1972 Code §11-1-4)
753.05  APPLICATION; ISSUANCE OF LICENSES.
   All the licenses provided for in this article shall be issued by the City

employment at some specified building or other definite place, unless expressly
provided otherwise. Exercising any of the privileges granted by any such
license elsewhere than at such specified building or other definite place shall

annual fee designated by this article as the number of months remaining until
the following June 30, including the month during which such license has been
issued. No license for any purpose or for any length of time shall be issued

the assignee and shall not be exercised by any person other than the assignee,
unless and until again assigned under the terms of Section
753.11.
(1972 Code §11-1-9)
753.10  EXEMPTED ENTERTAINMENTS.
   The provisions of this article shall not apply to, and no license fee shall
be assessed against or collected from any educational, literary, dramatic,
musical or benevolent society or to socials or other functions given by

   (f)   Requirements.
      (1)   Water Purveyor.
         A.   On new installations, the Water Purveyor will provide on-site
evaluations and/or inspections of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer, if any, that will be required and will perform inspection
and testing. In any case, a minimum of a dual check valve will be required in
any new construction.
         B.   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the
Water Purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or
premises and inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed
necessary, the method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the
correction to be made. Ordinarily, ninety (90) days will be allowed. However,
this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved
and the history of the device(s) in questions.
         C.   The Water Purveyor will not allow any cross-connection to remain
unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer which will be
regularly tested to insure satisfactory operation.
         D.   The Water Purveyor shall inform the Owner by letter, of any
failure to comply, by the time of the first re-inspection. The Purveyor will
allow an additional fifteen (15) days for the correction. In the event the
Owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second
re-inspection, the Water Purveyor will inform the Owner by letter, that the
water service to the Owner's premises will be terminated within a period not to
exceed five (5) days. In the event that the Owner informs the Water Purveyor of
extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time
extension may be granted by the Water Purveyor, but in no case will exceed an
additional thirty (30) days.
         E.   If the Water Purveyor determines at any time that a serious
threat to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated
immediately.
         F.   The Purveyor will begin initial premise inspections to determine
the nature of existing or potential hazards, following the approval of this
program by the WVBPH. Initial focus will be on high hazard industries and
commercial premises.
      (2)   Owner.
         A.   The Owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection
of all cross-connections on his premises.
         B.   The Owner, after having been informed by a letter from the Water
Purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested,
any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
         C.   The Owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer
which is revealed by periodic testing.
         D.   The Owner shall inform the Purveyor of any proposed or modified
cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the Owner is
aware, but have not been found by the Water Purveyor.
         E.   The Owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow
preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass.
Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply
additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
         F.   The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved
by the Water Purveyor.
         G.   The Owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
Water Purveyor or the WVBPH.
         H.   Any Owner having a private well or other private water source
must have the approval of the Water Purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Water Purveyor's system. Permission to cross-
connect may be denied. The Owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even
if it is not cross-connected to the Water Purveyor's system.
         I.   In the event the Owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Water Purveyor's side of the backflow
preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed.
         J.   The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that the
device fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspections for non-compliance
with Water Purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
   (g)   Degree of Hazard.  The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the
public water system from cross-connections. All threats will be classified by
degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention devices or double check valve assemblies.
   (h)   Existing In-Use Backflow Prevention Devices.  Any existing backflow
preventer shall be allowed by the Water Purveyor to continue in service unless
the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present
backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the pubic health.
Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential
installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow
preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced
pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow
device is present.
   (i)   Periodic Testing.
      (1)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
      (2)   Periodic testing shall be performed by the Water Purveyor's
certified tester or his delegated representative. This testing will be done at
the owner's expense.
      (3)   The testing shall be conducted during the Water Purveyor's regular
business hours. Exceptions to this, when at the request of the owner, may
require additional charges to cover the increased costs to the Water Purveyor.
      (4)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replace. Then repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair
the device will be retested at owner's expense to insure correct operation.
High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the
backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty (30) days after the test
date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair
tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installations of two (2) devices is an
effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service during
testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires
such continuity. 
      (5)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in A. above, in cases where there is a history of test failures and
the Water Purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional
testing is warranted. Cost of the additional test will be born by the owner.
   (j)   Records.  The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections.
      (2)   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections.
      (3)   Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the WVBPH.
   Upon request, the Water Purveyor will submit records of inspection, surveys,
tests or corrective actions to the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health.

the sidewalk so curbed, together with the number of feet each lot so abuts, and
thereupon may by resolution require each of the owners of such lots or parts of
lots to pave the sidewalks abutting upon his lot or part of lot, upon the grade
which has been established according to law, and in conformity with and
according to the following specifications, except as may be otherwise provided
by Council by resolution:
   (a)    Sampling and Testing Materials.  Before delivery upon the job, and at
such other times as the engineer deems necessary, the contractor shall furnish
any required samples of the materials hereinafter mentioned. Materials shall
pass the requirements set forth in this section.
   (b)    Cement.  The cement shall meet the requirements of the current
standard specifications for Portland cement of the American Society for Testing
Materials. A sack containing ninety-four pounds of cement shall be considered
one cubic foot.
   (c)    Fine Aggregate.  The fine aggregate shall consist of clean, hard,
durable, uncoated particles of sand or stone, free from all organic material.
One hundred percent (100%) of such aggregate shall pass a one-quarter inch
screen and ninety-five percent (95%) shall be retained on a 100 mesh screen.
Not more than twenty-five percent (25%) shall pass a fifty mesh screen. It
shall be well graded from coarse to fine, and shall not contain more than five
percent (5%) by weight of clay or loam, none of which shall be in lumps. When
the fine aggregate is mixed with Portland cement in the proportion of one part
cement to three parts fine aggregate by weight, according to the standard
method of making briquets, the resulting mortar at the age of seven and twenty-
eight days shall have a tensile strength of at least equal to that developed in
the same time by mortar of the same proportions and consistency made of the
same cement and standard Ottawa sand.
   (d)    Coarse Aggregate.  Coarse aggregate may be broken stone, gravel or
blast furnace slag. The broken stone or gravel shall be clean, hard, durable,
uncoated rock. It shall contain no vegetable or other deleterious matter and
shall be free from soft, thin, elongated or laminated pieces.
      (1)    Slag shall be of a quality which has been successfully used in
local concrete work. It shall be air cooled, non-glassy and shall have been
exposed to the weather at least one year.
      (2)    One hundred percent (100%) of the coarse aggregate shall pass a
one and one-half inch screen and at least ninety-five percent (95%) shall be
retained on a one-fourth inch screen, with all intermediate sizes retained.
   (e)    Water.  Water shall be clean and free from alkali, oils or acids.
   (f)    Joint Filler.  Joint filler shall be premolded strips of asphalt or
pitch, and fiber or mineral aggregate passing an eighty mesh screen, one-half
inch thick, as wide as the thickness of the concrete slab and at least two feet
long. It shall have such a consistency that it will not run in summer or chip
out in winter.
   (g)    Forms.  Forms shall be of lumber two inches thick, or steel of equal
strength, except on curves, where flexible stakes or braces with top edges at
true line and grade given by the engineer. Ends of adjoining forms shall be
flush. Where sidewalks fill the space between the curb and building lines,
forms shall be set to give the walk a slope toward the curb of one-fourth inch
per foot of width. If there is an intervening space between the back of the
curb and the walk, the edge of the walk shall be set on elevation sufficient to
give a slope or pitch of one-half inch per foot.
   (h)    Division Plates.  Where division plates are used they shall be of
one-eighth inch steel, as wide as the depth of the slab and as long as the
width of the walk. Forms and division plates shall be thoroughly cleaned and
oiled each time before they are used. 
   (i)    Subgrade.  That portion of the ground surface directly beneath the
slab shall be called the subgrade.
      (1)    All soft and spongy material in the subgrade shall be removed and
replaced with suitable material. Fills shall be compacted in layers not
exceeding six inches in thickness. Spots previously compacted by traffic shall
be loosened to a depth of six inches. The whole subgrade shall be thoroughly
and uniformly compacted so a firm surface having as nearly as possible a
uniform bearing power.
      (2)    A template, resting upon the side forms and having its lower edge
at the exact elevation of the subgrade, shall be drawn along the forms before
any concrete is laid. Any high places in the subgrade shall be removed so that
the template will pass over without being raised off the side forms or being
tipped at an angle to the sidewalk surface. The subgrade shall be damp, but not
muddy, when concrete is placed upon it.
   (j)    Drains.  Where in the opinion of the engineer it is considered
necessary to save the walk from damage by frost action, four-inch drain tile
shall be laid on the lines given by the engineer, and four-inch Vit tile for
downspouts.
   (k)    Subbase.  When drains are impracticable and the soil is poorly
drained, colloidal clay or adobe, a five-inch subbase shall be constructed of
cinders, gravel or other porous material approved by the engineer. The subbase
shall be thoroughly tamped until the surface is firm and shall be drained into
the street gutter.
   (l)    Thickness and Proportions.  The sidewalks shall consist of one five-
inch course of concrete in the proportion of one part of Portland cement, two
parts of fine aggregate and four parts of coarse aggregate. All material shall
be accurately measured in a manner approved by the engineer.
   (m)    Mixing.
      (1)    The ingredients of the concrete shall be thoroughly mixed until
each particle of fine aggregate is coated with cement and each particle of
coarse aggregate is coated with mortar. Where a mechanical mixer is used it
shall be of an approved batch type. Each batch shall be mixed at least one
minute from the time all materials including water are in the drum until the
beginning of the discharge.
      (2)    The consistency of the mixed concrete shall be such that no
separation of the ingredients takes place and some tamping is necessary to
bring the mortar to the surface.
   (n)    Placing and Finishing.
      (1)    The freshly mixed concrete shall be placed immediately on the
prepared subgrade. It shall then be struck off and tamped with a straightedge,
and having a slope of one-quarter inch per foot resting upon the side forms and
advanced with a crosswise sawing motion.
      (2)    The placing of concrete shall not be suspended for forty-five
minutes or longer except at end of slab. No concrete shall be placed on a
frozen subgrade when the temperature is, or is liable to be within twenty-four
hours, below thirty-five degrees Fahrenheit, except when the written permission
of the engineer has been obtained.
   (o)    Jointing.
      (1)    The walk shall be cut into separate slabs. No plain concrete slab
shall be longer than six feet on any one side. Where division plates have been
used they shall be removed when the concrete has hardened sufficiently to avoid
breaking the edges or corners of the slab. Where division plates have not been
used the partially set concrete shall be cut through to the subgrade. Care
should be taken to make the cut at right angles to the surface of the sidewalk.
      (2)    The surface edges of each slab shall be rounded to a radius of
about one- fourth inch. Markings shall be exactly at cuts between slabs.
   (p)    Expansion Joints.  Expansion joints shall extend from the surface to
the subgrade, be truly at right angles to the sidewalk surface and made by
putting the specified  joint filler in place before the concrete. They shall be
placed as follows: 
      (1)    At or near all places where the sidewalk line intersected a curb
line or other sidewalk, a half-inch expansion joint shall be made at right
angles to the center line of the walk.
      (2)    When the sidewalk fills the space between the curb and the
building line a one-half inch expansion joint shall be placed between the curb
and the sidewalk and between the sidewalk and the building. A one-half inch
expansion joint shall be made across the walk at approximately fifty feet
intervals.
   (q)    Curing.
      (1)    As soon as the concrete has set sufficiently, it shall be
sprinkled and kept moist until covered. As soon as it can be done without
damage to the walk, it shall be covered with two inches of earth or sand which
shall be kept wet for seven days. The walk shall then be cleaned and opened to
traffic.
      (2)    The contractor shall protect the concrete from damage by rain,
pedestrians and animals with suitable covers and barricades and by red lights
at night.
         (Passed 4-2-63.)
909.03  RELAYING OR REPAIRING EXISTING SIDEWALKS.
   (a)   “Owner” means:
      (1)   In the case of land, any person who is recorded on the tax records
as the owner of land, or
      (2)   In the case of property other than land, any person who is in
lawful possession thereof.
   (b)   “Occupant” means:
      (1)   A person who is in physical possession of property, or
      (2)   A person who has responsibility for, and control over, the
condition of a property, the activities conducted on that property, and the
persons allowed to enter that property.
   (c)   “Person” includes any individual, corporation, society, association,
partnership or firm, and the successor or the heir, executor, administrators,
or other legal representatives of a person.
   (d)   “Sidewalk” means that part of a highway especially adapted to the use
of or ordinarily used by pedestrians and includes that part of the highway
between the curb line (or the edge of the roadway where there is no curb line)
and the adjacent property line, whether or not paved or improved.
   (e)   Every occupant, owner or person of every house, shop, building, lot,
parcel of land or other property that adjoins or is abutting to or on a
sidewalk in the City of St. Marys shall be charged with the responsibility to
keep such sidewalk in good state of repair and free from defects and debris. 
Failure to maintain will result in the City of St. Marys undertaking such
repair or remedy and charging back to the property owner.  On any claim
presented for bodily injury or property damage on the sidewalk, the adjoining
or abutting property owner shall be held liable in tort for such damages to
another.  Alternatively, should the City of St. Marys be called upon to make
such payment to a third party, the City will look to the adjoining/abutting
landowner for contribution and indemnity.

      (8)   Critical Facility.  Any facility in which, even a slight chance of
flooding is too great a threat. Typical critical facilities include hospitals,
fire stations, police stations, storage of critical records, and similar
facilities. These should be given special consideration when formulating
regulatory alternatives and floodplain management plans. A critical facility
should not be located in a special flood hazard area if at all possible. If a
critical facility must be located in a special flood hazard area it should be
provided a higher level of protection so that it can continue to function and
provide services during a flood.
      (9)   Development.  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or

flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for unknown factors that may contribute uncertainty to flood heights
of any given flood and floodway condition, such as wave action, blockage at
stream crossings, and increased runoff  from urbanization of the watershed.
Freeboard also tends to lower the cost of flood insurance.

water should not damage structures and any subsurface waters related to the
base flood should not damage existing or proposed structures.
      (34)   Special Flood Hazard Area.  The land in the floodplain subject to
a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30,
and A99. This term shall also include areas shown on other flood hazard maps
that are specifically listed or otherwise described in this Ordinance.
      (35)   Start of Construction.  The date the permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date.  The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.  Although
a permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure.  For an alteration, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
      (36)   State Coordinating Office.  The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management
      (37)   Stream .  As defined in WV State Code 7-1-3U, any watercourse,

liquid storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured
home.
      (39)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.  Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.  See "Substantial Improvement."
      (40)   Substantial Improvement.  Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the Start of Construction of the improvement. 
   This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed.  The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all
Ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific Ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when
the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of
the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (41)   Top of Bank.  The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the water’s edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (42)   Violation.  The failure of any structure or development to be
fully compliant with all the requirements of this Ordinance. Any structure or
other development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate or other evidence of  compliance required by this Ordinance is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
(Ord. 2014-01.  Passed 2-18-14.)
1709.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Saint Marys which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood,
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for City of Saint Marys by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) dated 5/05/2014 or the most recent revision thereof 
including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by City of Saint Marys by use of historic
or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized "Local Flood
Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the level of
technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas.  The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway  shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area. 
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The Delineation of the Identified Special Flood Hazard Area May Be
Revised by City of Saint Marys where natural or man-made changes have occurred
and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes.  However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      (2)   City of Saint Marys's base flood elevations may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon
as practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, City of Saint Marys shall notify the NFIP Administrator of
the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   City of Saint Marys may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard
Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such
as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study
methodologies. 
   (d)   Boundary Disputes.  Should a dispute concerning the location of
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to City of Saint Marys. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail.  Elevation data certified by a Licensed
Professional Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator. 
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this Ordinance if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the
applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either:
         A.   The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study, or
         B.   The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by City of
Saint Marys in approximate floodplains.
   The proposed development shall then be required to conform to all
appropriate flood damage reduction provisions of this Ordinance.
         (Ord. 2014-01.  Passed 2-18-14.)
1709.04  UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway.  Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
City of Saint Marys during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The
resultant engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic
terms.  In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted
in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (1)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued. 
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of City of
Saint Marys, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent
land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood hazard area
as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of
the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe.  Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE without Floodway.  Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.  This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).
      (1)   Within any Approximated Floodplain
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding. 
         B.   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine;
            1.    The amount being invested and,
            2.    The specific flood risk at the site.
      The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the applicant to
determine the elevation above which the development will be reasonably safe
from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other
techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall
only be undertaken by a Registered Professional Engineer who shall certify that
the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The
resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided
that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      See appendix 4.4 for Sample "Approximated floodplain (Zone A) techniques"
   (e)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, to City of Saint Marys,  The Floodplain Administrator, the
State Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property
owners of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of
the stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition prior to issuing the
local permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval..
      See appendix 4.5 for Sample "Stream Alteration process and contact sheet"
      (2)   The developer shall also assure City of Saint Marys in writing that
the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream  will be maintained.  The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment.  If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage.  These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide City of Saint Marys a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1709.99.
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
         (Ord. 2014-01.  Passed 2-18-14.)
1709.05  CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   General.  Permits are required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified Floodplain, Floodway or other special

      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed development is
to occur.
      (3)   Names, addresses, and valid WV license numbers of all contractors
working at the building site, or affidavits stating that work is being
performed by individuals exempt from contractor licensing as set forth in Title
28, Series 2, Section 3.9 (b) of the West Virginia Code of State Regulations or
the most recent revision thereof.
      (4)   A description of Site location sufficient to locate the project
including tax map and parcel number and most recent deed book and page number.
      (5)   A standard site plan showing size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow, the
lowest adjacent grade to the proposed foundation and/or toe of fill, the Base
Flood Elevation and the location of the floodway boundary when applicable.
      (6)   An acknowledgement that the applicant agrees to pay any and all
fees associated with the permitting process as set forth in Section
1709.07(j).
      (7)   An acknowledgement that the applicant agrees to allow authorized

contracts or addendums. Failure to present contract or addendums for review
shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is
of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including materials and
labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information.  All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this Ordinance.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, etc.  When required by the Floodplain
Administrator, a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall prepare
these plans.
         D.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional
Surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate shall be prepared
by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications.
The elevation certificate shall confirm that the structure in question,
together with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit
conditions.
         G.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever City of Saint Marys determines that the area below the first floor
could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas
below base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more).  This agreement shall
state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this Ordinance.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement.  It shall be the responsibility of

      (2)   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing   
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this Ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
         C.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the
plans in subsection (c)(2)A. hereof, stating that the finished structure,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic, 
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths,  velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base  Flood.
      (3)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage, (Appurtenant Structures
only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirms that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for  meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following  minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1709.99.
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.  Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks.
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
      (2)   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lies partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites.  All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated
floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres, whichever
is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a
floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. 
      (5)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
approximated floodplain area (Zone "A") boundary depicted on the map,
development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary.  In
these cases the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at
intervals of two  (2) or five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly
delineate the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard
boundary area as scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer
or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord. 2014-01.  Passed 2-18-14.)

are applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
         C.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached
garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the
structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance
premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance
with this Ordinance.  The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of this agreement.  It shall be the responsibility of the applicant
to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature. 
A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1709.99.
      (4)   Recreational vehicle placement.
         A.   Recreational vehicles to be placed within any special flood
hazard area shall either: 
            1.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. or,
            3.   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home
Placement requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in
this Ordinance.
      (5)   Fill.  City of Saint Marys officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Therefore:
         A.   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
         B.   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
         C.   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
         D.   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1709.04.  All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed
the following standards:
            1.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. City of Saint Marys may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties.  When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by City of Saint Marys. During permit review City of Saint
Marys shall consider the following issues that have the potential to cause
adverse impact to adjacent properties:
               a.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
               b.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
               c.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing
structures.
               d.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
               e.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
            2.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
            3.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid
ponding).
            4.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance
to provide acceptable access.  For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection.  For nonresidential
structures,  fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended
use.  At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond
the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of
the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
            5.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only.  Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
            6.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use.  Particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
            7.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two
(2) horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are
submitted to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
            8.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
               a.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or
less will be protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds,
or similar vegetative undergrowth.
               b.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet
per second will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock
slope protection.
            9.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area
shall obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when
directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be
issued. After fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a
Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of
compliance can be issued.
            10.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of Structures and other development.
         A.   All structures and other development shall be constructed or
placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water
and shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and
height of floodwater.
            1.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
            2.   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall
be placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.  A Flood Protection Setback equal to
twice the width of the watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank
to the top of the opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be
maintained from the top of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion,
natural vegetation shall be maintained in this area.  Where natural vegetation
does not exist along the watercourse and conditions for replanting are
suitable, high priority shall be given to planting vegetation in the setback
area to stabilize banks, enhance flood protection and benefit aquatic
resources.
         A.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area.  The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of    flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be
stored below Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or 
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection. 
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage.
         A.   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
         B.   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
      (12)   Backflow Preventers.  Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area.  (Ord. 2014-01.  Passed 2-18-14.)

this time period shall be cause for revocation of the permit and the governing
body, or authorized employee or agent to:
            1.   Seek an injunction in the Circuit Court of City of Saint Marys
to restrain the violator from continuing the violation, including but not
limited to requests for the removal of structures or land uses from the
property involved; and
            2.   Seek a misdemeanor conviction in Magistrate Court or Circuit
Court.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this local law. Occupying or
using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1709.99.
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the
inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance issued by
the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular development
being inspected conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1709.99.
      (3)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the development conforms to the requirements of this local law. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1709.99.
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this Ordinance or local administrative procedures,
and any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood
proofing certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as
a condition of permit approval.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   A Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by City of Saint Marys.
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this Ordinance shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to City of Saint Marys based upon a set schedule approved by City of
Saint Marys using the estimated value of the proposed construction as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for Reimbursing
City of Saint Marys for any additional costs for services necessary for review
and/or inspection of proposed development.  Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs.  Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this Ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse City of Saint Marys for the additional
cost of processing permits for work already underway.  To more fully recover
this cost the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by
the same person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this Ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.
         (Ord. 2014-01.  Passed 2-18-14.)
1709.08 APPEALS.
   (a)   Appeals.  Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provision of this Ordinance, it is
the right of that person to appeal to the Commission of City of Saint Marys
which shall be known as the Appeals Board. Such appeal shall be filed with the
Council of City of Saint Marys, in writing, within thirty (30) days after
notification of the decision.  Upon receipt of such appeal, the Appeals Board
shall set a time and place not less than (ten (10) nor more than (sixty (60)
days for the purpose of hearing the appeal.  Notice of the time and place of
the hearing shall be given to all parties at which time they may appear and be

   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria.
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or
the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this Ordinance
shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause,
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the appeal would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
            3.   A determination that the granting of an appeal will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.  Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a City of Saint Marys official that:
            1.   The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a
structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance,
            2.   Such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases
risk to life and property. 
   Such notifications shall be maintained with a record of all decisions as
required in subsection (b)(2)D. hereof; and
         E.   The Appeals Board shall maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and  report such decisions issued
in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.

   There is hereby established a Building Safety Commission (the "Commission")
which shall be the designated enforcement agency authorized pursuant to the
provisions of West Virginia Code 8-12-16(c).  The Building Safety Commission
shall consist of the Mayor, the Building and Safety Inspector as designated by
Section
1705.05, and one member at large to be selected and to serve at the will and
pleasure of the Mayor.  The Fire Chief and Health Officer of the City
designated in accordance with Section
1105.01 of the Codified Ordinances shall serve as ex-officio members of the
Commission.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 6-19-18.)
1725.02  POWERS.
   The Building Safety Commission, acting by majority vote, shall have the
power and authority to require the repair, alteration, improvement, vacating,
closing, removal or demolition, or any combination thereof, of any structures,
dwelling or other buildings that are unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or
detrimental to the public safety or welfare.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 6-19-18.)
1725.03 RIGHT OF ENTRY.
   The Building Safety Commission shall have the right and authority through
its members or duly authorized agents, to enter upon any premises and to enter
any dwelling or building for the purpose of making an inspection and
examination deemed necessary by it in order for such Commission to determine
whether such dwelling or building is unfit for human habitation, unsafe,
unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or welfare. For the
purposes of this Ordinance, the Building and Safety Inspector of the City of
Saint Marys, or such other person designated in accordance with Section
1705.05, or such other person specifically designated by the Commission as its
representative, shall be deemed to be the "Code Enforcement Agency Official" as
defined by West Virginia Code 8-12-16(a)(2).
   (a)    When a Code Enforcement Agency Official enters the premises of the
property for investigating or inspecting any structure, dwelling or building,
the investigation shall be performed to minimize the inconvenience to the owner
or persons in possession and shall be consistent with the following:
      (1)    Except in exigent circumstances and as permitted by law, the
Commission or Code Enforcement Agency Official shall provide reasonable advance
notice to the owner and request permission from the owner to enter the
property.
      (2)    If the owner cannot be located after reasonable inquiry by the
Code Enforcement Agency or the Commission as required by this section, or if
the owner refuses entry, the Commission may obtain an administrative search
warrant from either the Municipal Court of the City of Saint Marys or the
Magistrate Court of Pleasants County, West Virginia. Before obtaining an
administrative search warrant, a Code Enforcement Agency Official is required
to make a sworn statement and prima facie case showing that the Commission was
unable to gain access to the structure, dwelling or building after reasonable
and good faith efforts, and that there is a legitimate and substantial safety
concern involving the structure, dwelling or building that supports the
requested entry.
      (3)    If granted by the Court, and if the owner can be located, the
Commission shall provide the owner a copy of the administrative search warrant
five days before entering the property. If applicable, the Commission shall
also provide the same notice to any tenant or other person in possession of the
structure, dwelling or building.
      (4)    Entry is for the sole purpose of inspection of the structure,
dwelling or building for unsafe or unsanitary conditions and not for the
purpose of criminal prosecution or gathering evidence for use in any criminal
charge or proceeding unrelated to the unsafe or unsanitary condition of the
structure, dwelling or building.
         (Ord. 2019-04.  Passed 4-16-19.)
1725.04  NOTICE TO REPAIR, CLOSE OR DEMOLISH.
   If, after proper investigation and such hearings as the Commission deems
necessary, the Commission determines that a structure, dwelling or other
building is unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental to the public safety
or welfare, and/or there is a violation of the State Building Code, the
Commission may cause a Final Notice to be issued to the owner to repair,
improve, vacate, close, remove or demolish, or any combination thereof, the
structure, dwelling or building.  The content, service and posting of any such
Notice shall be as follows:
   (a)   The Notice shall be in writing and contain the date of the last
inspection, the name of the inspector, a reasonable description of the unsafe,
unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental condition(s), the corrective measures
required, the allotted time to correct the substandard condition(s) and the
allotted time the owner has to request a hearing before the Building
Enforcement Agency, which such request shall be made within ten days after the
date of service of the Notice or such other specific date as set forth in such
Notice.  Such hearing, at which the owner or owners shall have the right to be
heard in full and to introduce such relevant evidence and testimony as they
desire, shall be held at the next regularly scheduling meeting of the Building
Safety Commission, or at an earlier special meeting, or thereafter upon any
date by agreement of the owner and the Commission.  After such hearing, the
Building Safety Commission shall issue a decision affirming, rescinding,
altering, extending or modifying the Final Notice, which decision shall be made
in writing within ten days after the hearing is concluded.
   (b)   The Notice shall specify the allotted time the owner has to apply to
the Circuit Court of Pleasants County, West Virginia, for a temporary
injunction or other similar relief restraining action by the Commission.
   (c)   The Notice shall be served upon the owner by conspicuously posting and
attached a copy of the Notice to the subject property, and by serving the
Notice on the owner in the same manner as provided by Rule 4 of the West
Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure.
   (d)   If the Commission cannot effect personal service on the owner, a Code
Enforcement Agency Official shall subscribe a written Affidavit, to be
maintained for a minimum of two years, that demonstrates that the structure,
dwelling, or building falls within one of the categories set forth in Section
1725.09 and sets forth the basis in reasonable detail, including documentation
of same, and memorializes the Code Enforcement Agency Official's efforts to
contact or get permission for entry and corrective action from the owner; and
the Commission shall publish notice of its intent to enter the property for the
purpose of demolition or correction, along with the address of the property,
the name of the owner(s) and the date of the proposed action, as a Class II
legal advertisement consistent with the requirements of West Virginia Code
Chapter 59, Article 3, the first of which publication shall be made at least
thirty days before the date of the proposed action by the Commission, and the
last publication being no later than twenty days before the date of the
proposed action by the Commission.  (Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 6-19-18.)
1725.05  RECORDATION OF NOTICE.
   In the event of the failure of any owner of any dwelling or other building
to comply with the terms and requirements of any Notice, the Building Safety
Commission may cause a Notice of such violation and non-compliance to be
recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the County Commission of Pleasants
County, West Virginia, indexed in the name of said owner(s), so as to place any
prospective owner on notice of any unsafe, unsanitary or unfit condition
prevailing in any dwelling or building, whether used for human habitation or
not, which would cause such dwelling or building to be unsafe, unsanitary,
dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or welfare.  (Ord. 2018-03. 
Passed 6-19-18.)
1725.06  REMEDIES OF THE BUILDING SAFETY COMMISSION.
   If the owner or owners fail to respond to the Notice issued in accordance
with the provisions hereof, and the Notice has not been rescinded, extended or
set aside, the Building Safety Commission may cause all necessary repairs,
alterations or improvements to be made, or if the public welfare requires, may
cause the dwelling, structure or other building to be closed, removed or
demolished.  The Commission shall keep an accurate account of all costs against
the real property upon which such dwelling, structure or other building is
situate, including the cost for repairs, improvements, alterations, vacating,
closing, removal or demolition, and attendant attorney fees and court costs or
any combination thereof.  The amount of any assessment setting forth the total
of such costs shall bear interest at the statutory rate.  If the assessment is
not paid, the Commission, after any sale of any or all salvage materials is
credited to the assessment, may place a lien against the real property upon
which all such costs were incurred.  The Notice of Lien shall be a certified
statement thereof, showing the nature of the work, the date and amount thereof,
a description of the property affected and the names of the owner or owners
thereof, and which said lien shall be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of
the County Commission of Pleasants County, West Virginia.  Any such liens shall
remain a lien upon the real property upon which the subject dwelling, building
or other structure is situate for a period of ten years from the recording
thereof and for succeeding ten year periods from the date of an Affidavit of
Non-Payment and Extension as executed by the Mayor.  (Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 6-
19-18.)
1725.07  PROCEEDINGS IN CIRCUIT COURT AUTHORIZED.
   In addition to the remedies set forth in this Article, the City of St. Marys
may also institute a civil action in the Circuit Court of Pleasants County,
West Virginia, against the owner and/or other responsible party to obtain a
Court Order to take corrective action up to and including demolition of any
dwelling, structure or building that is unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or
detrimental to the public safety or welfare; and to recover all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by the Commission and/or the City with respect to
the property and for reasonable attorney fees and court costs incurred in the
prosecution of the action.  No fewer than ten days before instituting a civil
action as provided in this Section, the City shall send Notice to the owner or
owners by certified mail, return receipt requested, advising the owner or
owners of the City's intention to institute such action.  The Notice shall be
sent to the most recent address of the owner or owners of record in the Office
of the Assessor of the County where the subject property is located and to any
other address for the owner or owners as may exist on record with the City. 
If, for any reason, such certified mail is returned without evidence of proper
receipt, the City shall resend the Notice(s) by first class mail, postage
prepaid, and shall also post Notice on the front door or other conspicuous
location on the subject property.
(Ord. 2018-03.  Passed 6-19-18.)
1725.08  PROCEDURE FOR MISDEMEANOR ACTIONS IN MUNICIPAL COURT.
   It shall be unlawful for any owner or owners of any structure, dwelling or
building determined by the Building Safety Commission to be unsafe, unsanitary,
dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or welfare, and/or in violation
of the State Building Code, to fail to comply with any Order of the Commission
to repair, vacate, remove or demolish any such structure, dwelling or building,
or any other Order of the Commission from which no appeal or other remedy has
been invoked.  A Complaint setting forth a violation of this Article shall be
initiated upon a sworn or affirmed Statement before the Municipal Judge.  If
the Municipal Judge finds probable cause, the sworn Statement becomes the
Complaint that initiates the Misdemeanor proceeding.  This Complaint along with
a Summons shall set forth the date, time and place of appearance before the
Municipal Judge, shall be served in accordance with the law of the State of
West Virginia, concerning the service of process in civil actions, except that
personal service of a Summons and Complaint may be made by a Code Enforcement
Agency Official.  If service is made by certified mail under Rule 4 of the West
Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure and delivery of the Summons and Complaint is
refused, the Code Enforcement Agency Official, promptly upon receipt of the
Notice of the refusal, shall mail to the person or entity being Noticed, by
first class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the Summons and Complaint.  If the

   There is hereby established a vacant structure registration program and also
an uninhabitable structure registration program for the City of Saint Marys.
(Ord. 2018-02.  Passed 6-19-18.)
1727.02  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City has determined that uninspected and unmonitored vacant
structures (1) present a fire hazard; (2) are often utilized by vagrants and
transients (including drug abusers and traffickers) as dangerous and unsafe
temporary shelters; (3) detract from private and/or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding structures; and (3) require additional
regulation and services to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
public.
   (b)   Owners of vacant structures shall register such vacant structures with
the City, make payment of a fee as set forth herein, and otherwise conform to
the requirements of this vacant structure code.  Owners of vacant structures
that are also determined to be uninhabitable structures in violation of the
Building Code and unsafe for occupancy shall be fined a separate and additional
fees.
   (c)   It is the intent of this Article that, through a registration,
inspection, and monitoring process, and other improved public safety efforts,
vacant structures will be kept weather tight and secure from trespassers, will
provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in times of emergency,
will not impede private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain
surrounding properties, and will not otherwise present a public hazard.
   (d)   It is the City's further intent for the provisions of this Article to
streamline and consolidate the existing procedure (that is, complaint,
research, notification, inspection, orders, fines, liens, appeals and lien
enforcement) by placing the responsibility to register and maintain a vacant
structure on the owner of such structure before a condition of the structure
falls into disrepair or otherwise necessarily warrants a complaint.
