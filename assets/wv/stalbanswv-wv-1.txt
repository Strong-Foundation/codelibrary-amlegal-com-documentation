EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adaption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self- identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section
number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal, with
the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and the
article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number appears
right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is
1, the article number if 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and the
section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

Ordinance. In the following table the disposition of all source material in the

9, as amended at the date of the adoption of this Charter; provided, however,
that subsequent amendments to the said designated portions of the Code and to

Council of the City by ordinance duly adopted.
   (2)    In addition to the other methods prescribed in the said Revised Code
of West Virginia, 1931, as amended, any street or alley in the City, or portion

majority of the property owners, owning frontage abutting on both sides of any
such street or alley, between any two cross streets, or between a cross street
and an alley; provided, that the said majority of the property owners also own
at least forty percent of the frontage of the lots abutting upon the said
street or portion thereof to be improved. The work shall be done and the

   (3)    No cost of repaving or resewering any street or alley or
reconstruction of a sidewalk thereon, in the City, shall be charged and
assessed to abutting property owners, whether the original work be done before

sides of such street or alley, between any two cross streets, or between a
cross street and an alley,

lien for public improvements, levied pursuant to the terms hereof, more than
thirteen years from the date of the adoption of the final ordinance, levying
such assessment, unless such assessment shall be payable over a period of more
than thirteen years, in which event, no such suit or action shall be brought
more than one year after the due date of the last installment of such
assessment. After such period has expired, no suit in equity or action at law
or other proceeding shall be instituted in the name of the City or by any
holder or owner of the certificates evidencing any such lien, to collect the
same.
   (5)    Where a sewer assessment has been levied against any property, not on
the certificate plan, and such assessment has not been paid in full, no
building permit shall be issued for any improvement to such property until such
assessment shall be paid in full, although such assessment may otherwise be
barred by a statute of limitations or by a limitation on actions contained in
this Charter.
   (6)    The lien of all assessments for the paving or repaving of streets,
alleys and sidewalks, and the laying or relaying of sewers and all other
improvements within the City, shall, from and after the date of the assessment
thereof by the Council, constitute a continuing tax lien against the abutting
property assessed with such improvements, superior to all other liens except
taxes due to the State of West Virginia and its political subdivisions.
   (7)    Any assessment for public improvements, whether evidenced by
certificates or not, shall be payable to the Clerk. The said Clerk shall
collect the amount due, together with accrued interest to the date of payment,
and shall issue, sign, acknowledge and deliver an apt and proper release of the
lien of such assessment. Where certificates have been issued for such
improvements, the said Clerk shall retain such sums as may be paid to him in
satisfaction of such liens until demand is made upon by him by the owners and
holders of the said certificates for such sums, whereupon the said Clerk shall
pay such sums to such certificate owners and holders, upon delivery of the said
certificates to the said Clerk for cancellation and delivery to the respective
property owners. The said Clerk may release any lien for public improvements
upon presentation of satisfactory evidence of payment.
SECTION 44. SEVERABILITY.

any part or section of this Charter is declared null, void, invalid or
unconstitutional, by any court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall
not affect any remaining portion of this Charter; such remaining portion shall
be in full force and effect as if the part or section so declared null, void,
invalid or unconstitutional had never been a part of this Charter.

109.01 GRANTEE DEFINED.
   "Grantee" as used in this article includes the City and any commission,
department or corporation which has been established by or is a part of the
municipal government of the City. (1967 Code §2-68.)
109.02 PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS.
   Grantees may use their own procurement regulations which reflect applicable
State and local law, rules and regulations provided that procurements made with
federal grant funds adhere to the standards set forth as follows:
   (a)    The grantee shall maintain a code or standards of conduct which shall
govern the performance of its officers, employees, or agents in contracting
with and expending federal grant funds. The grantee's officers, employees or
agents, shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities, favors, or anything of
monetary value from contractors or potential contractors. To the extent
permissible by State or local law, rules or regulations, such standards shall
provide for penalties, sanctions or other disciplinary actions to be applied
for violations of such standards by either the grantee officers, employees or
agents, or by contractors or their agents.
   (b)    All procurement transactions regardless of whether negotiated or
advertised and without regard to dollar value shall be conducted in a manner so
as to provide maximum open and free competition. The grantee shall be alert to
organizational conflicts of interest or noncompetitive practices among
contractors which may restrict or eliminate competition or otherwise restrain
trade.
   (c)    The grantee hereby establishes, as a minimum, the following
procedural requirements:
      (1)    Proposed procurement actions shall be reviewed by grantee
officials to avoid purchasing unnecessary or duplicative items. Where
appropriate, an analysis shall be made of lease and purchase alternatives to
determine which would be the most economical, practical procurement.
      (2)   Invitations for bids or requests for proposals shall be based upon
a clear and accurate description of the technical requirements for the
material, product or service to be procured. Such description shall not, in
competitive procurements, contain features which unduly restrict competition.
Brand name or equal description may be used as a means to define the
performance or other salient requirements of procurement, and when so used the
specific features of the named brand which must be met by offerors should be
clearly specified.
      (3)    Positive efforts shall be made by the grantees to utilize small
business and minority-owned business sources of supplies and services. Such
efforts should allow these sources the maximum feasible opportunity to compete
for contracts to be performed utilizing federal grant funds.
      (4)   The type of procuring instruments used, fixed price contracts, cost
reimbursable contracts, purchase orders, incentive contracts, shall be
appropriate for the particular procurement and for promoting the best interest
of the grant program involved. The cost-plus-a-percentage-of cost method of
contracting shall not be used.
      (5)    Formal advertising, with adequate purchase description, sealed
bids, and public openings shall be the required method of procurement unless
negotiation pursuant to paragraph (6) below is necessary to accomplish sound
procurement. However, procurement of ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less
need not be so advertised unless otherwise required by State or local law or
regulations. Where such advertised bids are obtained the awards shall be made
to the responsible bidder whose bid is responsive to the invitation and is most

of parts with existing equipment, for experimental, developmental or research
work, for supplies purchased for authorized resale and for technical or
specialized supplies requiring substantial initial investment for manufacture;
         H.    Otherwise authorized by law, rules or regulations.
Notwithstanding the existence of circumstances justifying negotiation,
competition shall be obtained to the maximum extent practicable.
      (7)    Contracts shall be made only with responsible contractors who
possess the potential ability to perform successfully under the terms and
conditions of a proposed procurement. Consideration shall be given to such
matters as contractor integrity, record of past performance, financial and
technical resources, or accessibility to other necessary resources.

ten thousand dollars ($10,000) shall provide at least the following pertinent
information: justification for the use of negotiation in lieu of advertising,

or mechanic shall be required to work in surroundings or under working
conditions which are unsanitary, hazardous or dangerous to his health and

115.01 COUNCIL'S FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   Council hereby finds that the purposes of the West Virginia
Governmental Ethics Act have reasonable, necessary and appropriate application
to matters involving all elected and appointed Municipal officials and
employees, whether full-or part-time, who derive a salary, payment of wages or
other direct remuneration from the Municipality, and does now hereby affirm,
ratify and adopt such State defined purposes as being the same purposes of this
Municipal governmental ethics article, without specifically republishing such
State purposes herein.
   (b)   Council further hereby finds that for the purpose of assisting in the
administration of the provisions of this article, that various statutory
sections of the aforesaid State Act shall be hereby expressly adopted and
incorporated as provisions of this article except as otherwise expressly
provided herein, and which such State statutory sections specifically hereby
adopted and incorporated herein are as follows: West Virginia Code 6B-1-1 to to
6B-1-5; 6B-2-5; and the applicable provisions of West Virginia Code 6B-3-1.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the affirmation and adoption of the purposes of the
State Act and further the specific adoption of the selected, statutory sections
which were immediately hereinbefore set forth in subsection (b) hereof, Council
specifically finds that certain statutory provisions of the aforesaid State Act
are either inapplicable to the administration of this Municipal Article or
would otherwise be unduly burdensome for the City to require and administer,
and specifically, Council finds that the purposes of the State Act and of this
article can be effectively executed at the Municipal level without the specific
adoption and incorporation of the statutory provisions of West Virginia Code
6B-2-6 and 6B-2-7 respecting financial disclosure, and which statutory
provisions Council hereby expressly opts not to include as provisions of this
article.
   (d)   Council further hereby finds in carrying out the purposes of this
article and in administering the provisions hereof, that it is reasonable and
necessary to establish a Municipal Ethics Commission and to provide for the
manner of appointment of the members thereof, terms of office, general powers
and duties, the issuance of advisory opinions and a method of investigating and
deciding complaints filed against the City's public officials and employees who
are subject to the provisions hereof.
(Ord. 89-13. Passed 9-5-89.)
115.02 MUNICIPAL ETHICS COMMISSION ESTABLISHED.

five members who shall be appointed by the Mayor with the advice and consent of
Council. Within thirty days of the effective date of this section, the Mayor
shall make the initial appointments to the Commission. No person may be
appointed to the Commission or continue to serve as a member of the Commission
who then holds an elected or appointed office under the government of, or who
is otherwise employed in any other manner by, the United States, the State, the
County, the City or any political subdivision of any of the foregoing, or who
is a candidate for any such office.
   (b)   All members of the Commission shall be residents of the City. At least
one member of the Commission shall have previously served as an elected or
appointed official of either the County or the City, however, if there are no
residents of the City who previously served as elected or appointed officials
of the County or City, willing to accept such appointment to the Commission,
then the Mayor, with the advice and consent of Council, may appoint in lieu
thereof, one member who shall reside within the City and further who shall have
previously served as an elected or appointed official of the State or any
political subdivision thereof, including but not limited to any City or county
in the State.
   (c)   Of the initial appointments made to the Commission, two shall be for a
term ending one year following the date of initial appointment and three shall
be for a term ending two years following the date of appointment. Thereafter,
all terms of office shall be for two years, each year ending on the same day of
the same month of the year as did the term which it succeeds. Each member shall
hold office from the date of his or her appointment until the end of the term
for which he or she was appointed or until his or her successor duly qualifies
for office. In the event that any vacancy occurs as a result of the death,
resignation or removal in the membership of this Commission, it shall be filled
by appointment for the unexpired portion of the term in the same manner as
original appointments. No member shall serve more than three consecutive full
or partial terms, and no member may be reappointed to the Commission until at
least two years have elapsed after the completion of a third successive term.
   (d)   The Commission shall meet within thirty days following the initial
appointments to the Commission with the specific time and place of such first
meeting to be determined by the Mayor, who shall also designate a member to

otherwise offer, secretarial and clerical assistance to the Commission.

forth herein.

115.03 ADVISORY OPINIONS OF COMMISSION REGARDING VIOLATIONS.
   Any person subject to the provisions of this article may make application in
writing to the Municipal Ethics Commission for an advisory opinion on whether
an action or proposed action violates the provisions of this article, and would
thereby expose the person to any sanctions of law. The Commission shall convene
a meeting within thirty days from the receipt of any such request and shall in
any event issue an advisory opinion on the matter raised in the request within
sixty days from the receipt of the request. All advisory opinions shall be in
writing and one copy thereof shall be delivered by the chairman of the
Commission to the City Clerk/Treasurer, who shall thereupon present the
advisory opinion to Council at the next regularly scheduled meeting of Council
and such advisory opinion shall be attached to the minutes of the meeting;
provided, that before any advisory opinion is made public, any material which
may identify the person who is the subject of the opinion, shall to the fullest
extent possible, be deleted and the identity of the person shall not be
revealed. A person subject to the provisions of this article may rely upon the
advisory opinion of the Commission, and any person acting or relying in good
faith on any such advisory opinion shall then be immune from the sanctions of
law, including any sanction set forth by State law, and shall have an absolute
defense to any criminal prosecution for actions taken in good faith reliance
upon such advisory opinion.
(Ord. 89-13. Passed 9-5-89.)
115.04 COMPLAINTS; INVESTIGATION BY COMMISSION.
   (a)   In addition to the issuance of advisory opinions and upon the filing
by any person with the Commission of a complaint which is duly verified by oath
or affirmation, the Commission shall investigate the substance of any
allegation made in any complaint and determine whether there is probable cause
to believe that a violation of this article has occurred. The Commission shall
respond within thirty days from the receipt of any complaint by advising the
complainant and the respondent in writing that an investigation will be
conducted by the Commission and the Commission shall complete its investigation
and render a formal, written recommendation to Council, copies of which shall
be transmitted to both the complainant and the respondent, within sixty days

deleted and the identity of the person shall not be revealed.
(Ord. 89-13. Passed 9-5-89.)

   Any amendment to any of the aforesaid statutory provisions of the State
which are expressly herein adopted and incorporated as provisions of this
article, upon enactment by the State legislature, pursuant to the State
prescribed effective date thereof, shall be deemed to be an amendment to this
article, unless the City expressly opts not to adopt any such amendment by
ordinance duly adopted by Council evidencing the nonadoption of such
amendments.
(Ord. 89-13. Passed 9-5-89.)
115.99 PENALTY.
   In addition to being subject to the penalties of the State Act as are
contained and set forth pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 6B-3-

evidence and record in the case, the Commission shall, by a preponderance of
the evidence, find that a respondent has engaged in or is engaging in any
unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in this article, the Commission
shall issue and cause to be served on such respondent an order to cease and
desist from such unlawful discriminatory practice and to take affirmative
action, including but not limited to, hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of
employees, with or without back pay; admission or restoration to membership in
any respondent labor organization; or the admission to full and equal enjoyment
of the services, goods, facilities, or accommodations offered by any respondent

financial assistance to any complainant otherwise qualified for the housing
accommodation or real property denied in violation of this article, as in the
judgment of the Commission will effectuate the purposes of this article. Such
order shall include a requirement for report of the manner of compliance. Such
order shall be accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law as
specified in West Virginia Code 29A-5-3.

summons in civil actions; no hearing shall be held on such petition within
twenty days of the date of service thereof on the respondent.

deems just and proper, and shall make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony
and proceedings set forth in such transcript an order enforcing, modifying and
enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part the order of the

(Ord. 78-25. Passed 7-24-78.)
159.13 EXEMPTION OF EMPLOYMENT RECORDS.
   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this article, it shall not be an
unlawful discriminatory practice for the Department of Employment Security to
ascertain and record the age, sex, religion, race, color, blindness, national
origin or ancestry of any individual for the purpose of making such reports as
may from time to time be required by agencies of the Federal Government or be
necessary to show compliance with any rule or regulation issued by any such
agency. Such records may be made and kept in the manner required by the Federal
Government; provided, that such recording of the age, sex, religion, blindness,
race, color, national origin, or ancestry of any individual shall not be used
to discriminate, within the meaning of this article, directly or indirectly,
against any such individual as prohibited by all other sections of this
article. (Ord. 78-25. Passed 7-21-78.)
159.14 POSTING OF REGULATIONS.

159.15 INJUNCTIONS IN CERTAIN HOUSING COMPLAINTS.
   When it appears that a housing unit described in a complaint may be sold,
rented or otherwise disposed of before a determination of the case has been
made by the Human Rights Commission or during judicial review of any final
order of the Commission, the County Circuit Court in which such housing is
located may, upon the joint petition of the Commission and the complainant, or
if there is more than one complainant, all such complainants, issue a
prohibitive injunction restraining the sale, rental or other disposition of
such housing unit or units except in compliance with the order of the Court. No
such injunction shall be issued by the Court until the complainants shall have
posted bond, with good security therefor, in such penalty as the Court or judge
awarding it may direct. The Court may include in any such injunction granted
such other conditions as it deems proper and just. Such injunction, if granted,
shall be of no more than thirty days duration. If at the end of such thirty day
period, the Commission notifies the Court that additional time is needed for
the disposal or determination of the complaint or case or the conclusion of
such judicial review, the Court, for good cause shown, may extend the period of
the injunction for such additional time as the Court deems proper. No such
extension shall be granted except upon the continuation or reposting of the
bond required for the original injunction, and any such extension of the
injunction may be granted upon such additional terms and conditions as to the
Court may seem proper and just.
(Ord. 78-25. Passed 7-24-78.)
159.16 EXEMPTION OF PRIVATE CLUBS.
   Nothing in this article shall prohibit a private club, not in fact open to
the public, which as an incident to its primary purpose or purposes provides
lodgings which it owns or operates for other than a commercial purpose, from
limiting the rental or occupancy of such lodging to its members or guests of
members or from giving preference to its members or guests of members;
provided, that this exemption shall not apply to any private club not in fact
open to the public which owns or operates residential subdivisions providing
lodgings for rental, occupancy or sale, or which provides real estate for sale
for the construction of single or multi-unit dwellings.
(Ord. 78-25. Passed 7-24-78.)

   Whoever willfully resists, prevents, impedes or interferes with the Human
Rights Commission, its members, agents or agencies in the performance of duties
pursuant to this article, or willfully violates a final order of the
Commission, shall be punished by a fine of not more than one hundred dollars
($100.00) or by imprisonment not to exceed thirty days or by both fine and
imprisonment, in the discretion of the Police Court; however, seeking judicial
review of an order shall not be deemed to be such willful conduct.

within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the
current proceeding; and,
      (3)    Any period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to this

sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for a first offense under
this section: provided further, that the court may impose a term of conditional
probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, or comparable City ordinance
to persons adjudicated thereunder. An order for home detention by the court
pursuant to the provisions of article eleven-b [ 17C-11B-1 et seq.] of the West
Virginia Code may be used as an alternative sentence to any period of
incarceration required by this section for a first or subsequent offense:
provided, however, that for any period of home incarceration ordered for a
person convicted of second offense under this section, electronic monitoring
shall be required for no fewer than five days of the total period of home
confinement ordered and the offender may not leave home for those five days
notwithstanding the provisions of section five [62-11B-5], article eleven-b,

period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or

PROCEDURE ON CHARGE OF VIOLATION OF CONDITIONS.
   (a)    Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section (St. Albans City
Code
303.04a), whenever any person who has not previously been convicted of any
offense under this article or under any statute of the United States or of any
state relating to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled
substance or any other drug:
      (1)    Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)    Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under subsection (d) of Section
303.04 of the St. Albans City Code,
   the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the
accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding any provisions of
this code to the contrary, place him or her on probation, which conditions
shall include, that he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol
Test and Lock Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a.
Participation therein shall be for a period of at least one hundred and sixty
five days after he or she has served the fifteen days of license suspension
imposed pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5A-2.
   (b)    A defendant's election to participate in deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-2.
   (c)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (d) of this section, the court may issue such process as is
necessary to bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)
(1) hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test
and Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable
time after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)    When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)    Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant's right to a speedy trial under any
applicable Federal or State constitutional provisions, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   
   (d)    When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within 30 days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant's attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the 30-day period, the court shall thereafter dismiss
the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with regard to
the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in subsection
(c) of this section.
   (e)    Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of this article,
discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of
guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities
imposed by law upon conviction of a crime except for those provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5A-l et seq. Except as provided in subsection (k)(1) and (m),
of West Virginia Code 17C-5-2 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the
dismissal and discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law
to the status he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to
whom a dismissal and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to
be guilty of perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by
reason of his or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or
trial in response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than

Electric Bicycles
385.01   Definition.
385.02   Regulations.
   385.01 DEFINITION.
   (a)   For the purpose of this section, the term “electric bicycle” means a
two or three wheeled vehicle with fully operable pedals and an electric motor
of fewer than 750 watts. There is a “three-class system” to differentiate
between the models and top-assisted speeds of electric bicycles.
      (1)   “Class 1" electric bicycles have a motor that provides assistance
only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the
e-bike reaches 20 mph.
      (2)   “Class 2" electric bicycles have a motor that may be used
exclusively to propel the bicycle, and that is not capable of providing
assistance when the e-bike reaches 20 mph.
      (3)   “Class 3" electric bicycles have a motor that provides assistance
only when the rider is pedaling, and that ceases to provide assistance when the
e-bike reaches 28 mph.
   (b)   “Throttle” refers to a device that controls the flow of power to the
electric motor on an electric bicycle for the purpose of propelling the
electric bicycle.
(WVaC 17C-1-70)
   385.02 REGULATIONS.
   (a)   The operator of an electric bicycle has all of the rights and
privileges and is subject to all of the duties applicable to the driver of a
vehicle subject to this chapter, except as otherwise provided by this section
and except as to those provisions of this chapter which by their nature can
have no application.
   (b)   A person owning or operating an electric bicycle is not subject to the
provisions of West Virginia Code 17A-1-1 et seq., 17B-1-1 et seq., or 17D-1-
1 et seq., relating to registration, title, driver’s license, and financial
responsibility requirements.
   (c)   A person may not tamper with or modify an electric bicycle so as to
change the motor-powered speed capability or motor engagement between pedal-
assist and throttle-assist types of engagement. If a motor on an electric
bicycle is modified so that a limit established in Section
385.01 is exceeded, that vehicle is no longer an electric bicycle. The
provisions of this subsection are not applicable to a modified electric bicycle
operated solely and exclusively on a person’s own property.
   (d)   An electric bicycle must comply with the equipment and manufacturing
requirements for bicycles adopted by the United States Consumer Product Safety
Commission (16 C.F.R. Part 1512).
   (e)   The motor on an electric bicycle must disengage or cease to propel the
electric bicycle when the operator stops pedaling, or when the operator applies
the brakes and stops pedaling.
   (f)   A Class 3 electric bicycle must be equipped with a speedometer that
displays the speed the electric bicycle is traveling in miles per hour.
   (g)   Class 2 electric bicycles are permitted to use a throttle to propel
the bicycle.
   (h)   Electric bicycles operated on public roadways, public bicycle paths,
public multiuse paths, and other public rights-of-way where bicycles are
permitted to travel are subject to the following restrictions:
      (1)   Class 1, and Class 2 electric bicycles being used on roads and
trails where traditional, non-electronic bicycle use is allowed will be given
the same rights and privileges of a traditional, non-electric bicycle and will
be subject to all of the duties of a traditional, non-electric bicycle. This
rule intends to facilitate increased access to public lands that may otherwise
be inaccessible to those with disabilities, health issues, or age-related
limitations.
      (2)   A Class 3 electric bicycle may not be operated on a bicycle path,
multiuse trail, or single-use trail unless it is within a highway or roadway:
provided, that the provisions of this subdivision are not applicable to a
bicycle path, multiuse trail, or single-use trail if the municipality, local
authority, or governing body of a state agency that has jurisdiction over the
bicycle path, multiuse trail, or single-use trail expressly permits that
operation.
      (3)   Electric bicycles will not be given special access beyond what
traditional or non-electric bicycles are allowed. For example, electric
bicycles will not be allowed on roads or trails or in areas where traditional,
non-electric bicycle travel is prohibited.
      (4)   This subsection may not be construed to limit the authority of the
owner of a private way or the owner of private property to restrict or allow
the operation of electric bicycles on the way or property.
   (i)   Age restrictions related to the operation of electric bicycles are as
follows:
      (1)   A person under sixteen years of age may not operate a Class 3
electric bicycle;
      (2)   A person under fifteen years of age who is an operator or passenger
on an electric bicycle shall wear a properly fitted and fastened bicycle
helmet, pursuant to the Child Bicycle Safety Act, West Virginia Code 17C-11A-
1 et seq.
   (j)   A person under the influence of alcohol or controlled substances shall
not operate a Class 1,Class 2 or Class 3 electric bicycle.

(Ord. 2016-06. Passed 2-16-16.)

violation, and shall order that the violation be corrected. Notice of the
violation shall be served in accordance with the law of the State of West
Virginia concerning the service of process in civil actions, except that a
method of service effectuated by a mailing by the clerk of a court (e.g.,

class mailing is not returned as undeliverable by the U.S. Postal Service,
service of the notice of violation(s) will be conclusively presumed to have
been effectuated. Proof of service shall be made at the time of service by a
written declaration, under oath, executed by the enforcement official effecting
service and shall declare the time, date and manner by which service was made.
   (b)   Any notice of violation(s) under this section shall be in writing and

      (4)   The nature of the violation;
      (5)   A statement of the action required to be taken in order to correct
the violation;
      (6)   The time period allowed for the violation to be corrected prior to
the issuance of a citation. When determining the time period allowed for
correction, the enforcement official shall take into consideration the threat
posed by the violation to the health, safety and welfare of the public and the
nature of the work required to correct the violation, provided that no such
time period for correction shall be less than five days;
      (7)   The maximum fines that may be assessed if the violation is not
corrected; and
      (8)   The name, address and telephone number of the enforcement official
issuing the notice of violation.
         (Ord. 2016-06. Passed 2-16-16.)
406.04 ISSUANCE OF CITATIONS.
   (a)   If the violation has not been corrected within the period established

      (5)   The place and time the violation occurred;
      (6)   The date the notice of violation was given;
      (7)   The amount of the fine imposed for the violation;
      (8)   The name, address, and telephone number of the enforcement official
issuing the citation; and
      (9)   The name, address and telephone number of the office of the city
clerk, where fines are to be paid, and of the municipal court, where citations
may be appealed.
   (b)   A citation shall be in accordance with the law of the State of West
Virginia concerning the service of process in civil actions, except that a
method of service effectuated by a mailing by the clerk of a court (e.g.,
service pursuant to West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)(1)(D)) shall be
deemed to be effectuated by a mailing by an enforcement official. If service is
made by certified mail pursuant to West Virginia Rule of Civil Procedure 4(d)
(1)(D) and delivery of the citation is refused, the enforcement official,
promptly upon the receipt of the notice of such refusal, shall mail to the
person or entity being noticed, by first class mail, postage prepaid, (1) a
copy of the citation, (2) a notice that despite such refusal, the citation is
valid, and (3) notice that the City will proceed to enforce the citation; so
long as such first class mailing is not returned as undeliverable by the U.S.
Postal Service, service of the citation will be conclusively presumed to have
been effectuated. Proof of service shall be made at the time of service by a
written declaration, under oath, executed by the enforcement official effecting
service and shall declare the time, date and manner by which service was made.

thereafter.
   (b)   Nonpayment of Fines. All fines imposed by citations under this section
shall be due within ten days of service of the citation except as otherwise set
forth herein. The failure to pay when due any fine imposed under this section
shall constitute a failure to appear or otherwise respond under WV Code 8-10-2b
(c) and may result in notification to the DMV.
   (c)   Repeat Violations. If a person has been previously served with a
notice of violation for a violation contained in subsection
406.01 (c), whether or not the violation is timely corrected or a citation is
issued, he shall not be entitled to receive an additional notice(s) of
violation for the same category of violation if the same category of violation
is repeated within a six-month period of the issuance of either a notice of
violation or a citation, the enforcement official may proceed in accordance
with subsection
406.04  without further notice to the violator.
(Ord. 2016-06. Passed 2-16-16.)
406.06 APPEAL.
   (a)   Any person who is issued a citation shall pay the fine indicated for
the violation, as set forth in subsection
406.05 (a), in full to the office of the City Clerk within ten days of service
of the citation. Any person alleging he or she was improperly issued such
citation may, within ten days of service of such citation, file a petition for
appeal of the citation, along with the required bond, with the municipal court
clerk in accordance with the following:
      (1)   In order to properly and timely appeal his or her citation, within
ten days of service of the citation, the recipient of the citation shall pay
the required amount of the applicable fine in full to the municipal court
clerk, which amount will be held by the municipal court as bond pending hearing
and resolution of the case by the municipal court and the municipal court clerk
shall issue a receipt to the recipient of the citation showing the amount of
the bond paid. In addition to the bond, the recipient of the citation shall
file with the municipal court clerk a petition for appeal of the citation. If
any petition for appeal filed in accordance with this section is not timely
filed or is not accompanied with the required bond, the recipient of the
citation shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to appeal the
citation, and such petition shall be summarily denied as untimely filed;
provided, however, that nothing set forth hereinabove shall prevent the
municipal court judge from finding, upon a proper application and showing, that
the recipient of the citation suffers from financial hardship, and, as a
result, waiving the requirement that the bond be posted.
      (2)   Any petition for appeal filed with the municipal court clerk must
be in writing, on the form to be provided by the municipal court clerk, and
must be signed by the recipient of the citation affirming that the contents of
the petition are true and accurate to the best of the recipient of the
citation's knowledge at that time. Such petition for appeal shall state the
facts and reasons in support of the petition. Upon filing any such petition for
appeal with the municipal court clerk, the recipient of the citation shall
serve a copy of the petition and receipt showing proof of bond, or application
for waiver thereof, upon the city attorney.
   (b)   Upon filing of a petition for appeal with the municipal court clerk,
the clerk or his or her designee shall place the case on the municipal court
docket, set the case for hearing within 30 days from the date of the filing of
the petition for appeal, provide a notice of hearing to the recipient of the
citation, and forward a copy of the petition to the enforcement official who
issued the citation. Upon receipt of the petition, the enforcement official
shall cause a copy of the citation at issue to be forwarded to the municipal
court clerk who shall file it as the original complaint alleging the violation
indicated therein.
   (c)   The municipal court shall treat the citation itself as the original
complaint before the court. At the close of all of the evidence presented at
the hearing on the petition for appeal, should the municipal judge find against
the recipient of the citation, the bond posted by the recipient of the citation
shall be applied as payment for the fine imposed for the violation. In the
event the municipal court judge finds that the recipient of the citation
suffers from financial hardship, the municipal court judge may permit
alternative sentencing pursuant to section 38-126 of the Municipal Code. Should
the court find in favor of the recipient of the citation, the bond, if
applicable, shall be refunded to the recipient of the citation by the municipal
court clerk, and the citation shall be dismissed.

has become a legally demarcated area established by a municipal ordinance as
set forth in W.Va. Code §8-12-26 for the consumption of liquor, wine,

provisions of Article
521 of this Municipal Code, a person may possess and consume an approved open
container of liquor, wine, nonintoxicating beer, or nonintoxicating craft beer
sold from an approved permit holder, as further detailed in this article,
outdoors within a private outdoor designated area. A business operating within
a private outdoor designated area may choose whether or not to permit people to
enter its business with an approved open container of liquor, wine,
nonintoxicating beer, or nonintoxicating craft beer sold from an approved
permit holder. A private outdoor designated area may be authorized to
simultaneously host multiple qualified licenses and permit holders as defined
in West Virginia Code, at the discretion and with the approval of the City
Building/Zoning Officer.
   (b)   Any Class A, Class B, or Class S2 license holder under West Virginia
Code that
operates in a private outdoor designated area may apply to the City Building/
Zoning Officer for the approval to participate in the sale of alcoholic
beverages within a private outdoor designated area. The City Building/Zoning
Officer shall review the application to ensure it is complete and meets the
following requirements:
      (1)   The applicant is located in an established private outdoor
designated area, pursuant to this Ordinance, with a front door in compliance
with all building and fire codes for the safe ingress and egress of members,
patrons, and guests to and from the private outdoor designated area.

Control Administration ("WVABCA") for a Class S4 special permit, as detailed in
W.Va. Code § 60-7-8g, to participate in a private outdoor designated area, as
further detailed in this section, in the West Virginia Code, and in any
applicable rules of the WVABCA. Upon approval by the WVABCA, the Class S4
special permit holder shall notify the City. Any business that receives the
approval of the City and a Class S4 special permit from the WVABCA may
participate in a private outdoor designated area.
   (d)   Participation in a private outdoor designated area does not provide a
business with any authority to operate outdoor dining on the public right-of-
way. Any business interested in participating in outdoor dining shall follow
the requirements of the City to obtain such special permit. A business with an
approved outdoor dining area that is within a private outdoor designated area
may operate its outdoor dining area simultaneously with its participation in a
private outdoor designated area.
   (e)   All beverages served from valid Class S4 special permit holders for
consumption in a private outdoor designated area shall be served in a non-glass
container not greater than eighteen (18) fluid ounces, which has been approved

shall erect conspicuous signage identifying the private outdoor designated
area. The signs shall be located at every reasonable point where a pedestrian
may exit the private outdoor designated area by way of a public sidewalk. The
signs shall clearly state "No alcohol beyond this point." and provide clear
notice that a person is leaving the private outdoor designated area.

possessing an open container of liquor, wine, nonintoxicating beer, or
nonintoxicating craft beer that contains liquid.

nonintoxicating beer, or nonintoxicating craft beer that contains liquid while
being in, on, or operating a motor vehicle within a private outdoor designated
area.

consistent with all State Statutes and Municipal Ordinances. The St. Albans
Police Department shall be responsible for ensuring compliance and may issue
citations within the private outdoor designated areas as necessary. The St.
Albans Police Department shall provide a copy of any citation issued within a
private outdoor designated area to the WVABCA.
   (j)   In addition to any public restrooms in a private outdoor designated
area, participating Class S4 special permit holders shall make available
adequate restroom facilities, whether permanent or portable, to serve their
members and guests during all hours of operation of the private outdoor
designated area.
   (k)   All businesses operating within a private outdoor designated area
shall comply with all requirements of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department
and all State Statutes and Municipal Ordinances.
   (l)   All participating businesses within a private outdoor designated area
shall make waste receptacles available during the operating hours of the
private outdoor designated area in a number sufficient to contain the waste
generated within the area and which are emptied regularly by each participating
business as needed to ensure availability. These waste receptacles are in
addition to the City of St. Albans public waste receptacles in the area.
   (m)   The City may revoke the letter of approval of any Class S4 special
permit holder for violation of any law, rule or regulation, or when doing so is
in the interest of public safety, by sending a revocation letter to both the
permit holder and the WVABCA.
   (n)   The City is authorized to establish the days and hours when the PODA
may be utilized and create additional policies and procedures as necessary for
the efficient operation of the private outdoor designated areas, including, but
not limited to, signage language approval, container approval, identification
of participating businesses and non-participating businesses, review of
security plans proposed to the WVABCA, the interaction and interplay between a
fair or festival and the private outdoor designated areas, and the duties and
responsibilities of all participating businesses with respect to clean up and
other sanitation matters.
   (o)   This PODA shall be located as shown on the attached Addendum; however,
the City may amend this Ordinance to add other PODA locations.
   (p)   The City has the authority to suspend the operation of a private
outdoor designated area immediately for any reason, including when in the
interest of public safety, by providing notice to all Class S4 special permit
holders within the private outdoor designated area, City council, any business
association participating in the marketing or advertising of the private
outdoor designated area, and the WVABCA.

merchandise, his agent or employee, liable to the person detained. (W. Va. Code
61-3A-4)
   (d)   Evidence.
      (1)   Evidence of stated price or ownership or merchandise may include,
but is not limited to:
         A.   The actual merchandise alleged to have been shoplifted; or
         B.   The unaltered content of the price tag or marking from such
merchandise; or
         C.   Properly identified photographs of such merchandise.
      (2)   Any merchant may testify at a trial as to the stated price or
ownership of merchandise, as well as to other matters pertaining to the case.
         (W.Va. Code 61-3A-2)
   (e)   Civil Liability.
      (1)   General rule. Any person who commits any of the acts described in
this section shall be civilly liable:
         A.   To restore the merchandise to the mercantile establishment; and
         B.   If such merchandise is not recoverable or is damaged, for actual
damages, including the value of the merchandise involved in the shoplifting;
and
         C.   For other actual damages arising from the incident, not including
the loss of time or loss of wages incurred by the mercantile establishment or
any merchant in connection with the apprehension and processing of the suspect;
and
         D.   In all cases, for a penalty to be paid to the mercantile
establishment in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00) or double the value of

      (2)    Costs and attorneys' fees. A merchant who is a prevailing party
under this section is entitled to costs.
      (3)    Effect of conviction. A conviction for the offense of theft by

authorized by this section. However, a merchant who has recovered the penalty
prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)    Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not
limit the right of such establishment to demand, orally or in writing, that a
person who is liable for damages or a penalty under this section remit such
damages or penalty prior to the commencement of any legal action. (W. Va Code
61-3A-5)
   (f)   Penalty. A person convicted of shoplifting shall be punished as
follows:
      (1)   First offense conviction. Upon a first shoplifting conviction:
         A.   When the value of the merchandise is less than or equal to five
hundred dollars ($500.00) the person is guilty of a misdemeanor and, shall be
fined not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
         B.   When the value of the merchandise exceeds five hundred dollars
($500.00), the person is guilty of a misdemeanor and, shall be fined not less
than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
and such fine shall not be suspended; or the person shall be confined in jail
not more than thirty days, or both.
      (2)   Second offense conviction. Upon a second shoplifting conviction:
         A.   When the value of the merchandise is less than or equal to five
hundred dollars ($500.00) the person is guilty of a misdemeanor and, shall be
fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00) and such fine shall not be suspended; or the person shall be
confined in jail not more than thirty days, or both.
         B.   When the value of the merchandise exceeds five hundred dollars
($500.00), the person is guilty of a misdemeanor and, shall be fined not less
than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and shall be confined in jail not more than
thirty days.
      (3)    Mandatory penalty. In addition to the fines and imprisonment
imposed by this section, in all cases of conviction for the offense of
shoplifting, the court shall order the defendant to pay a penalty to the
mercantile establishment involved in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00), or
double the value of the merchandise involved, whichever is higher. The
mercantile establishment shall be entitled to collect such mandatory penalty as
in the case of a civil judgment. This penalty shall be in addition to the
mercantile establishment's rights to recover the stolen merchandise.
      (4)    Prior convictions. In determining the number of prior shoplifting
convictions for purposes of imposing punishment under this section, the court
shall disregard all such convictions occurring more than seven years prior to
the shoplifting offense in question.

      (2)    Written approval by Police Chief. Written approval by the Chief of
Police, which written approval shall be issued upon a reasonable showing to the
Chief of Police that the operation of the firing range shall be properly
supervised and shall not constitute a danger to life and property.
      (3)    Building permit; variance. A building permit indicating that the
firing range is to be constructed as a permitted accessory use to a commercial
establishment selling weapons in a C-1 General Commercial District or a

projectile or the escape of noise.
      (5)    Approval of storage. Written approval by the Chief of the Fire
Department or his designated representative, which written approval shall be
issued upon a reasonable showing that the storage of powder and other
explosives and the loading of projectiles shall not constitute a fire hazard or
a danger to life and property.

rules adopted by Council which are attached to original Ordinance 80-6, and
made a part hereof by reference. If such holder of a permit shall consistently,
willfully and wantonly omit, fail or refuse to operate in conformity with the
rules his permit may be revoked and cancelled by Council. No permit may be
revoked or cancelled until the holder of the permit has been notified in
writing by the City Clerk at the direction of Council of the specific rules
alleged to have been violated, the dates of the alleged violations and the
time, place and date when Council will conduct a hearing to consider revoking
or cancelling the permit. At such time the holder of the permit and his legal
counsel, if he desires, shall be given an opportunity to present such evidence
as the holder of the permit may desire in support of his being allowed to
retain his permit and to examine under oath those persons who would offer
evidence as to the alleged violations. No permit shall be so revoked or
cancelled unless it is shown that the violations of the rules have been
substantial and that continued operation of the firing range would constitute a
danger to life and property. After a hearing, a permit may be revoked or
cancelled by a simple majority of Council and the Mayor may vote in the event
of a tie vote. Any person, firm or corporation whose permit has been so revoked
or cancelled by the Council may appeal the revocation or cancellation to the
Circuit Court of the County.
(Ord. 80-6. Passed 2-4-80.)
713.05 TRANSFER OF BUSINESS.
   A new permit shall be obtained for a firing range if the person, firm or
corporation obtaining the permit ceases to do business and the ownership of or
operation of the range is transferred to another person, firm or corporation.
(Ord. 80-6. Passed 2-4-80.)
713.06 INSPECTION.
   Once a permit has been issued in accordance with the provisions of this
article, the firing range for which the permit has been issued shall be an
authorized target range as provided in Section
545.03 of the General Offenses Code. Once a permit has been issued in
accordance with the provision of this article, the Fire Chief, or his
designated representative, shall inspect the firing range at least four times
each calendar year to determine if there are any fire hazards which would
constitute a danger to property or person.

granting or denying the application for a permit. In this report the City Clerk

of the provisions of this article, or that any promoter, agent or solicitor of
a permit holder has misrepresented the purpose of the solicitation, the City
Clerk shall immediately suspend the permit and give the permit holder written
notice by certified mail of a hearing to be held within two days of such
suspension to determine whether or not the permit should be revoked. This
notice shall contain a statement of the facts upon which the City Clerk has
acted in suspending the permit. At the hearing, the permit holder, and any
other interested person, shall have the right to present evidence as to the
facts upon which the City Clerk based the suspension of the permit, and any
other facts which may aid the City Clerk in determining whether the provisions
of this article have been violated and whether the purpose of the solicitation
has been misrepresented. If after such hearing, the City Clerk finds that such
provisions have been violated or the purpose of the solicitation has been
misrepresented, the City Clerk shall within two days after the hearing file in
the City Clerk’s office for public inspection and serve upon the permit holder,

permit holder a written statement canceling the suspension of the permit and

services; and notwithstanding provisions of private contracts for separate
deposit of gross receipts in separate member's accounts or for members of such
group or combination to take in kind any proportionate part of such natural
resources.
   Lessees, sublessees or other denominated lessees are considered to be
producers of all of the oil or natural gas produced, regardless of any payment,
in kind, to lessors, sublessors or other denominated lessors of a part of such
natural resources as rents or royalties.

products for sale, profit or commercial use, and shall be required to make
returns on account of the production of the business showing the gross

the City Clerk shall prescribe.

make sale of the same within this City shall not pay the tax imposed under this

   The taxes levied under this article shall be due and payable in quarterly
installments on or before the expiration of one month from the end of the
quarter in which they accrue. The taxpayer shall, within one month from the
expiration of each quarter, make out an estimate of the tax for which he is
liable for such quarter, sign the same, and mail the same together with a
remittance of the amount of tax due to the office of the City Clerk. Such
remittances shall be made by bank draft, certified check, money order,
certificate of deposit or in lawful money of the United States. The City Clerk
shall pay the money into the City Treasury to be kept and accounted for as

compute the amount of such tax due by the application of rates against values
or gross income as set forth in Sections
757.03 to
757.12, inclusive. The taxpayer may deduct one-fourth of the total exemption
allowed for that year.
   When the total tax for which any person is liable under this article does
not exceed the sum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) in any tax year, the
taxpayer may pay the same quarterly, as aforesaid, or, with the consent in
writing of the City Clerk, at the end of the month next following the close of

deems it necessary to insure payment of the tax, may require the return and

757.16 RETURN AND REMITTANCE; TAX YEAR.
   On or before the expiration of one month after the end of the tax year, each
person liable for the payment of a tax under this article shall make a return
for the entire tax year showing the gross proceeds of sales or gross income of
business, trade or calling, and compute the amount of tax chargeable against
him in accordance with the provisions of this article. After deducting the
amount of quarterly payments, as provided in Section
757.15, if any, his report, with a remittance covering the remainder of the tax
due, shall be transmitted to the office of the City Clerk. Such remittance
shall be made by bank draft, certified check, money order, certificate of
deposit or in lawful money of the United States. The City Clerk shall pay the
moneys into the City Treasury to be kept and accounted for as provided by law.
   The return shall be signed and verified under oath by the taxpayer, if made
by an individual, or by the president, vice president, secretary or treasurer
if made on behalf of a corporation. If made on behalf of a partnership, joint
venture, association, trust or any other group or combination acting as a unit,
any individual delegated by such firm, group or unit shall sign the return on
behalf of the taxpayer.
   The assessment of taxes made and the returns required under this article
shall be for the calendar year ending December 31. If the taxpayer, in
exercising a privilege taxable under this article, keeps his books reflecting
the same on a basis other than the calendar year, he may, with the written
consent of the City Clerk, make his annual returns and pay taxes for the fiscal
year covering his accounting period as shown by the methods of keeping his
books.
(Ord. 77-30. Passed 12-19-77.)
757.17 EXTENSION OF TIME; PAYMENT PLANS.
   The City Clerk, for good cause shown, may grant a reasonable extension of
time for payment of tax or any installment, or for filing the annual return or
quarterly estimate required by this article, on such terms and conditions that
he may require. No such extension shall exceed six months.
   The City Clerk may extend the time for payment of an amount determined as a
deficiency for a period not to exceed twelve months from the date designated
for the payment of such deficiency. An extension of this type may be granted
only where it is clearly established to the satisfaction of the City Clerk that
the payment of a deficiency upon the designated payment date would result in
undue hardship.
   If any extension of time is granted for the payment of any tax or
deficiency, the City Clerk may require the taxpayer to furnish a bond or other
security in an amount not exceeding twice the amount of the tax or deficiency
for which the extension of time for payment is granted on such terms and
conditions as the City Clerk may require.

required by this article, or makes his return but fails to remit in whole or in
part the proper amount of tax due, there shall be added to the amount of tax
unpaid, from the date such tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount
of five percent (5%) of the tax for the first month, or fraction thereof, of
delinquency and one percent (1%) of the tax for each succeeding month, or
fraction thereof, of delinquency; provided, however, that if such failure is
due to reasonable cause, the City Clerk may waive these penalties in whole or
in part. In addition, the City Clerk may waive these penalties for all
taxpayers for any tax paid in which a national or state emergency exists. This
waiver must be approved by the City Council.
   If the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to evade this article and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be added an
additional penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the unpaid
tax, exclusive of the aforesaid penalties.
   All penalties and interest so added shall be collected at the same time and
in the same manner as the tax imposed by this article. (Ord. 2020-09. Passed 6-
15-20.)
757.20 ERRONEOUS COMPUTATION; COLLECTION OF BALANCE DUE.
   When a mathematical error appears on the face of the return, including an
overstatement of the credit for the amount paid as a quarterly installment, the
City Clerk shall correct such error and notify the taxpayer in writing of the
deficiency in the tax. The taxpayer shall have fifteen days after receipt of
such notice within which to pay such deficiency. If the taxpayer fails to make
payment within such fifteen day period, the City Clerk shall make an assessment
of such deficiency in accordance with Section
757.25 or Section
757.26 and shall give the taxpayer written notice thereof as provided in
Section

the tax so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately refunded to the
taxpayer upon the requisition of the City Clerk and shall be paid out of any
funds available for that purpose. The taxpayer may, at his election, apply any
overpayment credit to taxes subsequently accruing under this article.
   If a taxpayer files a mathematically correct return which reflects a balance
due of the tax chargeable under this article, and if full payment thereof has
not been made, the City Clerk shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of tax, penalties and interest due. The taxpayer shall have fifteen days
after receipt of such notice within which to make such payment.
   If the taxpayer fails to make payment within such fifteen day period, the
City Clerk shall proceed to collect the amount due as provided in this article.

period of limitations upon assessment of a deficiency reflecting such final
determination in the tax imposed by this article shall not expire until ninety
days after the City Clerk is advised of a determination by the taxpayer.

the owner or tenant of property used for commercial or industrial purposes, and

      (1967 Code Sec. 11-58)
777.02 IMPOSITION AND AMOUNT.
   In addition to all other taxes imposed and levied by this City an excise tax
upon the privilege of purchasing, using or consuming within the corporate
limits of this City of any public utility service and tangible personal
property sold by any seller of public utility service, as hereinafter defined,
is hereby imposed and levied upon each and every purchaser thereof. After first
excluding any State or federal tax imposed against the purchasers thereof, such
tax hereby imposed and levied shall be in the amount of two percent (2%) of the
charge by the seller to the purchaser for the service rendered or tangible
personal property sold to each such purchaser. Such tax shall be collected by
the seller and paid by the purchaser upon the amount charged by the seller to
the purchaser for the utility service rendered or tangible personal property
sold as shown by each periodic statement furnished purchaser by seller, at the
time such charge shall become due and payable under the agreement between the
seller and purchaser. In the event the amount of the charge for any single
public utility service exceeds the sum of twenty thousand dollars ($20,000) in
any given calendar month, to any single purchaser, no tax hereunder shall be
imposed for the purchase, use or consumption of such service or tangible
personal property in excess of such amount of twenty thousand dollars
($20,000). In the event more than one public utility shall furnish the

the amount of the charges in any calendar month for such public utility
service.
(1967 Code §11-59)
777.03 COLLECTION.
   It shall be the duty of every seller in acting as the tax collecting medium
or agency for this City to collect from each purchaser for the use of this City
the tax hereby imposed and levied at the time of collecting the purchase price
charged for its public utility service, and the amount of tax actually
collected during each calendar month shall be reported by each seller to this
City and each seller shall remit the amount of tax shown by such report to have
been collected to this City on or before the last day of the calendar month
following the month in which collected, together with the name and address of
any purchaser who has failed or refused to pay the tax so imposed and levied.
The tax imposed and levied by this article shall apply to periodic statements
rendered after July 1, 1971, for public utility service rendered on and
subsequent to that date. As to any periodic statement covering public utility
service rendered both before and after such date, only that portion of the
charge for public utility service rendered on and following such date shall be

the official of this City charged with the responsibility of collecting taxes
due this City.
(1967 Code §11-60)
777.04 RECORDS; INSPECTION.
   Each and every seller shall keep and maintain complete records showing all
purchases of public utility service within the corporate limits of this City,

authorized agents of this City shall have the right, power and authority to
make, at the expense of this City, such transcripts thereof during such times
as they may desire.

   (e)    Nonrecurring or one-time charges incidental to the furnishing of
public utility service. (1967 Code §11-62)
777.06 NONLIABILITY OF UTILITY; CITY CLERK TO ENFORCE ARTICLE.
   There shall be no liability upon the seller for erroneously collecting the
tax hereby imposed and levied or for erroneously failing to bill for such tax
as a result of a good faith mistake on the part of the seller. When any
purchaser contends that such tax is not owed by such purchaser on the ground
that the public utility service was not purchased, used or consumed within the
corporate limits of this City, the seller shall refer the question to the City
Clerk who is hereby charged with the responsibility of collecting the taxes due
the City hereunder and such seller shall thereafter collect or refrain from
collecting such tax from such purchaser for such public utility service as
instructed in writing to do so by such official. Any and all claims for refunds
of any such tax shall be presented to this City and not to the seller.
   The City Clerk shall have the authority to promulgate and enforce reasonable
rules and regulations necessary for the administration and enforcement of this
article.
(1967 Code §11-63)
777.07 ENFORCEMENT OF ARTICLE.
   Any amount of tax due and unpaid under this article shall be a debt due this

manner now or hereafter provided by law for compelling the payment of taxes due
cities.

service purchased, used or consumed during different periodic statement periods
shall constitute a separate and distinct offense.

780.08 TOTAL AMOUNT COLLECTED TO BE REMITTED.
   A profit may not accrue to any person as a result of the collection of the

taxes collected by a hotel operator may be in excess of the amount for which a
consumer would be liable by the application of the levy imposed under this
article for the occupancy of a hotel room or rooms, the total amount of all
taxes collected by any hotel operator shall be remitted to the taxing authority
as provided in this Article. (Ord. 2006-12. Passed 8-21-06.)

sales and of charges, together with a record of the tax collected thereon, and

preserved for a period of not less than three years, unless the taxing

shall require that they be kept for a longer period.

Activities covered by this section include, but are not necessarily limited to,
planting, fertilizing, spraying, protecting, pruning, removing, cutting above
ground, cutting below ground or otherwise disturbing a public tree. Any other
provision of this article notwithstanding, any public utility company,
including a cable television company, may apply for and receive a blanket
permit which covers the entire activity of a scheduled right-of-way maintenance
operation.
   (a)   Application for a public tree work permit shall be made in the form
prescribed by the City by:
      (1)   The public utility company or its authorized agent, if the work is
to be done by a public utility company pursuant to its regular operations; and
      (2)   The abutting property owner, or such owner's agent, if the work is
to be performed within the street on behalf of the abutting property owner.
      (3)   Any agency of the City doing work involving urban trees shall
cooperate with the Arborist as prescribed by this article.
      Application for permits shall be made at the Building Official's office
not less than forty-eight hours in advance of the time the work is to be done,
provided that in case of a blanket permit, such application shall be made not
later than fifteen days prior to the anticipated commencement of that work.
      The Building Official shall cause the permit to be issued, if in the
judgement of the Arborist, the proposed work is desirable and the proposed
method and workmanship thereof are of a satisfactory nature. Any permit granted
shall contain a definite date of expiration and the work shall be completed in
the time allowed on the permit, and in the manner as therein described.
Provided, that such expiration date and time limit for completion may be
extended if the work is not completed therein due to weather conditions or
other unforseen or uncontrollable circumstances. Any permit may be revoked if
its terms are violated. The City may charge a fee to cover the cost of printing
and processing the permits referred to in this section; provided, that such fee
may not exceed twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per permit. There shall be no fee
charged for the planting of trees. A fee of three dollars ($3.00) may be
charged for pruning. Notice of completion shall be given within five days to
the Building Official for inspection by the Arborist.
   (b)   Application Data.
      (1)   Planting. The application required herein shall state the number of
trees to be planted; the location, grade, species, cultivar or variety of each
tree, the method of planting and such other information as is reasonably
necessary for a fair determination of whether a permit should be issued.
      (2)   Improper planting. Whenever any tree is planted or transplanted in
conflict with the provisions of this section, the City shall remove or cause
removal of the same, and the exact cost thereof may be assessed to and paid by
the person responsible for the improper planting of such tree.
      (3)   Maintenance. The application required herein shall state the number
and kinds of trees to be sprayed, fertilized, pruned or otherwise protected
(except in the case of an application for a blanket permit); the kind of
treatment to be administered; the composition of the spray material to be
applied; and such other information as shall be reasonably necessary for a fair
determination of whether a permit should be issued. All pruning shall be done
to comply with the Urban Tree Specifications.
         (Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
   (c)   Removal, Replanting and Replacement.
      (1)   Whenever it is necessary to remove a tree or trees in connection
with the paving of a sidewalk, or the paving or widening of the portion of a
street or highway used for vehicular traffic, whenever possible, the City shall
replant such trees or replace them. Provided that when conditions prevent
planting between the curb and the sidewalk, any equivalent number of trees of
the same size and species as provided for in the Urban Tree Specifications and
Standards of Practice may be planted in an attractive manner on the adjoining
property with the consent of the adjoining property owner. If it is impractical
to replant in the same area, the Arborist shall designate an appropriate
location for planting the replacement tree.
      (2)   Except as provided in a permit, no person or property owner shall
remove a tree from the City right of way for the purpose of construction, or
for any other reason, without replacing the removed tree or trees in accordance
with the adopted Urban Tree Specification. Such replacement shall meet the
standards of size, species and placement as provided for in a permit issued by
the City. The person or property owner shall bear the cost of removal and
replacement of all trees so removed and replaced.
         (Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
915.07 PLANTING AND PRUNING OF TREES OBSTRUCTING VIEWS.
   No tree shall be planted, or an existing tree maintained at or near an
intersection that does not permit a clear view down the side street or alley
for a distance of 100 feet from the intersection measured along the curb. Any
person or persons owning or occupying real property abutting on any street upon
whose property there may be trees shall prune those trees in such a manner that
they will not obstruct or shade the street lights, obstruct the passage of
pedestrians on sidewalks, obstruct vision of traffic signs or obstruct the view
of any street or alley intersection. The minimum clearance of any overhanging
portion thereof shall be eight feet over sidewalks and fourteen feet over all
streets. This section shall not be construed to require private property owners
to prune, remove or otherwise maintain trees located on City-owned property or
easements.
   (a)   Notice to Prune. Should any person or persons owning real property
bordering on any street fail to prune trees as provided above, the City shall
order such persons within thirty days after receipt of written notice to prune
such trees.
   (b)   Order Required. The order required herein shall be served by mailing a
copy of the order to the last known address of the property owner by certified
mail.
   (c)   Failure to Comply. When a person to whom a lawful order, as provided
above, is directed fails to comply with the terms thereof within the specified
time, the City shall prune such trees, and the exact cost thereof shall be
assessed to, and paid by the abutting property owner to whom such order was
issued, provided that nothing herein contained is construed to require any
person to cut, prune, remove or maintain any such trees or shrubs located on
City-owned land or easements.
      (Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
915.08 ORDERS.
   Any tree or shrub located on private or public property which obstructs a
street or sidewalk, or which suffers from a communicable disease or insect
infestation, as determined by the City, which threatens the public welfare or
the health of public trees, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance.
   When such a public nuisance exists as to a tree or shrub located on private
property, the City may cause a notice to be mailed by certified mail to the
owner of the property on which the tree or shrub is located specifying what
corrective work is necessary and directing the owner to perform such corrective
work to eliminate the nuisance.
   Should any ordered correction not be made within fifteen days of the date
such notice is received, the City shall cause such tree to be pruned, treated
or removed as necessary to eliminate the public nuisance. All expenses involved
in such work shall be recorded by the City and collected from the owner of the
property on which the tree or shrub is located. Payments for noncompliance with
such orders shall be made to the City Clerk-Treasurer.
   The City may revoke for cause any permit previously approved and no refund
of the permit shall be made.
(Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
915.09 ABUSE OR MUTILATION OF PUBLIC TREES.
   Unless specifically authorized by the City, no person shall damage, cut,
carve, transplant or remove any public tree; attach any rope, wire, nails,
advertising posters or other contrivance to any tree, allow any gaseous liquid
or solid substance which is harmful to such trees to come in contact with them;
or set fire or permit any fire to burn when such fire or heat hereof will
injure any portion of such tree.
(Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
915.10 APPEALS.
   (a)   Any person affected by an order, grant or denial of a permit, or other
decision of the City when such decision is based upon the provisions of this
article, may appeal such order, grant, denial or revocation of a permit or
other decision to Council.
   (b)   Such appeal shall be filed in writing at the Building Official's
office with Council within fifteen days of notification of the ruling.
   (c)   Unless continued at the request of the applicant, any appeal shall be
heard and decided by Council. Action by the City shall be stayed until the
decision is rendered and the applicant notified.
   (d)   Council may, in conformity with the provisions of this article,
reverse, affirm or modify wholly or partly the order, grant, denial or
revocation of any permit, or other decision of the Arborist. The decision of
Council shall be final. All appeals shall be taken in writing and shall state
clearly the factual basis for such appeal.
   (e)   The right of appeal shall be clearly stated on all permits.
(Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
915.11 INTERFERENCE WITH ARBORIST.
   No person shall hinder, prevent, delay or interfere with the City in
carrying out the execution or enforcement of this article; provided, however,
that nothing herein shall be construed as an attempt to prohibit the pursuit of
any remedy, legal or equitable, in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
protection of property rights by the owner of any property within the
Municipality.
(Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
915.12 PLACING MATERIALS ON PUBLIC PROPERTY.
   No person shall deposit, place, store or maintain upon any public property

may impede the free passage of water, air and fertilizer to the roots of any
tree growing therein, except by written permit of the City.
(Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
915.13 EMERGENCIES.
   No permit shall be required to remove any tree or part thereof which by
reason of damage by fire, windstorm, icestorm or other calamity poses a threat
to the public health and safety or which obstructs any public way.
   In the event of windstorm, fire, flood or other calamity, the Mayor may
declare a state of emergency and exempt operations necessary to remove threats
to public safety from the permit requirements imposed by this article.
Provided, that such a declaration is not necessary in the case of public
utility company operations in the case of a threat to the public health and
safety.
   The City may determine that a public tree is hazardous and order that it be
treated or removed immediately to protect the public health or safety. A tree
obstructing any public way shall be removed or treated immediately.
(Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
915.14 COMPENSATORY PAYMENTS.
   No person shall remove any public tree without either first securing a
permit as provided by this article or without replacing such tree with a tree
of equivalent dollar value in the vicinity of the removed tree. The value of
trees shall be determined by the Arborist in accordance with published
guidelines of the International Society of Arboriculture (Valuation of
Landscape Trees, Shrubs and Other Plants). If no suitable location exists in
the vicinity of the tree removed, or if the replacement tree is of lesser
value, the person causing the tree to be removed shall make a compensatory
payment to the City equal to the difference in value between the tree removed
and any replacement tree. Any public tree that is determined by the City to be
damaged, but not sufficiently to justify its removal, shall be considered to be
devalued. The amount of devaluation shall be paid to the City by the person
causing the damage.
(Ord. 89-17. Passed 12-18-89.)
915.15 DISPOSAL OF WOOD PRODUCTS.
   Unless otherwise specified in a permit, the Arborist may sell without
competitive bidding, wood and other forest products generated during urban
forestry operations on public property. Proceeds from such sales shall be paid

   Any person, firm or corporation who violates or fails to comply with any of
the provisions of this article shall be fined a sum of up to five hundred
dollars ($500.00) and imprisoned for up to a maximum of thirty days.

925.02 CONNECTING STORM SEWER OR DRAIN TO SANITARY SEWER; PENALTIES.
   No person shall connect or permit to be connected a storm sewer or storm
drain to a sanitary sewer, or otherwise allow or permit storm water to enter a
sanitary sewer, or continue to have a storm sewer or storm drain connected to a
sanitary sewer, or continue to allow or permit storm water to enter a sanitary
sewer.
   The provisions of this section shall also apply outside the City where
sanitary sewers are connected to the sanitary sewer system of the City of St.
Albans and/or the Municipal Utility Commission.
   Whenever the Municipal Utility Commission has discovered that a customer’s
roof drain, downspout, storm sewer or other similar or like facilities
conducting surface water have been connected to the Municipal Utility
Commission’s sewer system, and such customer has failed to take appropriate
action within thirty days of receipt of a demand by the Municipal Utility
Commission in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Public Service
Commission of the State to eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be
imposed upon the customer calculated on the basis of the following formula:
   S =    A x R x .0006233 x C
   S =    The surcharge in dollars
   A =   The area under roof and/or the area of any other water collected
surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet.
   R =    The measured monthly rainfall in inches.
   .0006233 =    A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of
surface to thousands of gallons of water.
   C =    The MUC’s approved rate per thousand gallons of sewage treated.
   The Municipal Utility Commission shall not impose the surcharge unless and
until the customer has been notified by certified mail, return receipt
requested, or by hand delivery that it has been established by smoke testing,
dye testing, or on-site inspection that rain or surface water is being
introduced into the sanitary sewer system at the customer’s location, and the
customer has not acted within thirty days from the receipt of such notice to
divert the water from the sanitary sewer.
   Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month said condition
continues to exist. Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the situation
shall give rise to the possible termination of water service in accordance with
the rules and regulations of the Public Service Commission.
   The above rates and charges shall be applicable for any owner, tenant, or
occupant of each and every lot or parcel of land or building situate within or
without the corporate limits of the City and having any connection to the
sanitary sewer system of the City.
(Ord. 97-09. Passed 5-5-97.)

   No person shall connect a sanitary sewer to a storm sewer; and no person
shall allow sanitary sewerage to enter any storm sewer in the City.

such water closet, vault, privy or septic tank to properly connect such water
closet, vault, privy or septic tank with the City sewer system; provided, that
such sewer system, or any part thereof is located within 200 feet of such
premises, and no person shall, upon receiving such order, fail to comply with
same within ten days after the receipt thereof and every day on which a
violation of this order exists as to any premises shall constitute a separate
and distinct offense and violation of this Code.
   Any person maintaining any water closet, privy or septic tank upon any lot
or parcel of real estate within the City, located within 200 feet of the City
sewer system, or any part thereof, who fails to connect such water closet,

along a street, alley, easement or way, sometimes referred to in this article
as “main”, to which a connecting sewer may be connected.
“Principal improvement” means a structure, the use of which is not customarily
incidental to another principal building on the same parcel of land.
“Sanitary service connecting sewer” means a sanitary sewer six inches or less
in diameter branching off a main sewer and running in a public street, alley,
easement or way to within approximately two feet of the line of the property to
be served or other agreed line, sometimes referred to in this article as
“connecting sewer”.
   (1967 Code §22-12)
929.02 APPLICATION.
   Any person desiring the construction of a sanitary service connecting sewer
and connection of the same to a main sewer shall apply for the same to the City
Municipal Utilities Commission, in writing, upon an application form provided
by the Commission.
(1967 Code §22-13)
929.03 PROCEDURE UPON RECEIPT OF APPLICATION.
   Upon receipt of an application as provided for by Section
929.02, the Municipal Utilities Commission shall thereupon ascertain whether or
not a main sewer is located in the street, alley, easement or way to which the
property to be served abuts, to which such connecting sewer may be constructed
and connection made thereto and shall so advise such applicant. In the event
such connecting sewer may be constructed in the public streets, alleys,
easements or ways of the City and may be connected to a main sewer, such
applicant shall pay in advance a service connection charge as provided by this
article. In the event the cost of constructing the main sewer to which the
connecting sewer is to be connected was not paid by such applicant or his
predecessor in title as defined in this article, such applicant shall also pay
the fee as provided by this article in lieu of assessment for construction of a
main sewer. Upon payment of the service connection charge, and the fee in lieu
of assessment, where applicable, the Commission by and through its employees or
agents, or by and through a duly authorized independent contractor, shall cause
such connecting sewer to be so constructed over, along and through such public
streets, alleys, easements or ways from such main to within approximately two
feet of the line of such applicant or other agreed point.
(1967 Code §22-14)
 
929.04 SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGE AND FEE IN LIEU OF ASSESSMENT.
   The service connection charge referred to in Section
929.03 shall be as provided by ordinance of Council.
(1967 Code §22-15)
929.05 PAYMENT NOT TO RELIEVE OWNER FROM MONTHLY SEWER SERVICE CHARGE.
   Payment of the fees and charges provided for by this article shall not be
construed as relieving any owner, tenant, occupant or lessee of premises served

any public street, alley, way or easement in which a main sewer is located. A
connecting sewer of an additional principal improvement located on such
abutting parcel of land shall not be connected either directly or indirectly to
a connecting sewer; nor shall a service sewer of an additional principal
improvement located on such abutting parcel of land be connected to another
service sewer located on private property resulting in the discharge of sewage
from such additional principal improvement, either directly or indirectly into
a connecting or main sewer. The owner or occupant of such additional principal
improvement desiring the construction of a connecting sewer and connection of
the same to a main sewer shall apply to the Municipal Utilities Commission as
provided by this article. The service connection charge and fee in lieu of
assessment where applicable shall be paid as provided by this article for each
principal improvement so served, irrespective of whether or not the abutting
parcel upon which the parcel whose owner or predecessor in title paid such
charge and fee in lieu of assessment for the construction of a connecting sewer
and connection of the same to a main sewer in order to serve the principal
improvement. Connecting a service sewer to an existing service sewer located on
private property and connecting a connecting sewer to another connecting sewer
or main sewer shall be deemed violations of this article.
(1967 Code §22-18)

determined and declared to be essential for the protection and preservation of
the public health, comfort, safety, economy and general welfare of the
inhabitants of the City and of the area served thereby. The owner, tenant or
occupant of premises which abut on a street, easement or other public way
containing a sewer service, or which, in the judgement of the M.U.C. of the
City of St. Albans, is located within such a distance thereof that sewer
service is reasonably available thereto and upon which premises a building or
other inhabitable structure has been or shall be erected for residential,
commercial, or industrial use, or where persons are employed or congregate or
are intended to be employed or congregate, shall be required to connect the
building or structure to the sewer system or to such part of the sewer system
as may from time to time be extended or become reasonably available, and shall
thereafter pay all the charges, rates or fees as herein, or may hereafter be,
provided for. All such connections shall be in accordance with the rules and
regulations which shall be adopted from time to time by the M.U.C. of the City
of St. Albans or by the City Council and such rules and regulations may provide
for reasonable charges, fees or deposits required for making such connections.

building, etc., is erected, to connect such property to the sewer; and
providing that each day's failure to make such connection after ten (10) days
notice shall be prosecuted as provided for by state law as to required
connections to public sanitary sewers, see WV Code, § 8-18-22.
   (c)   Application for Sewer Service Required. It shall be unlawful for any
person, including public bodies as well as natural persons, to make an initial
cut-in or connection with the City sewer system and use that system without
first making written application for such connection and service to the M.U.C.
and paying all costs, charges, fees and deposits incident thereto. Such
application shall be made on forms prescribed and furnished by the M.U.C. and
shall constitute an agreement by the applicant with the City to abide by all
provisions of this chapter and such applicable rules and regulations of the
City Council or M.U.C. in regard to the use of the sewer system. Such
application for service by firms, partnerships, associations and corporations
shall be submitted only by their duly authorized agent, and the official title
of such agent shall be signed to the application.
   The application shall grant or cause to be granted to the City, without
cost, all rights, easements, permits, and privileges which are necessary for
the rendering of sewer service. Duly authorized agents of the City or the

person, whether property owner, drainlayer or otherwise, to connect with or tap
a City sewer, either directly or indirectly, without first having a permit from
the M.U.C. and having paid the assessment provided for in the Tariff or the
tapping or maintenance charge fixed by law. In all cases, the tapping and
maintenance charges for tapping a City sewer shall be as specified from time to
time by the City Council in an appropriate schedule, which shall be maintained
on file in the office of the City Clerk and the M.U.C. office; and until such a
schedule is prescribed by the City Council pursuant to the foregoing provisions
of this section, the tapping and maintenance charges for City sewers shall be
those in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this Code.
(Ord. 2000-05. Passed 2-22-00.)
933.03 CONNECTION TO PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (a)   Tapping or Opening Sewer Without Permit. No person shall cut, break,
pierce or tap any public sewer or appurtenances thereof, or introduce any tube,

connection of the building sewer shall be born by the owner(s). The owner(s)
shall indemnify the City and M.U.C. from any loss or damage that may directly
or indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
      (2)   A separate and independent building sewer shall be provided for
every building; except where one building stands at the rear of another on an
interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the
rear building through an adjoining alley, courtyard, driveway, or walkway, the
front building sewer may be extended to the rear building and the whole
considered as one building sewer, but the City and M.U.C. do not and will not
assume obligation or responsibility for damage caused by or resulting from any
such single connection aforementioned.
      (3)   Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings
only when they are found, on examination and test by the Manager, to meet all
requirements of this chapter.
      (4)   The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building
sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing,
testing, and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of
the Building and Plumbing Code or other applicable rules and regulations of the
City. In the absence of Code provisions or in amplification thereof, the
materials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the
American Society for Testing of Materials (ASTM) and the Water Pollution
Control Association (WPCF) Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply.
   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an
elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building
drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage
carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and
discharged to the building sewer.
      (5)   No person(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, footer
drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a
building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or
indirectly to a public sanitary sewer.
      (6)   The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall
conform to the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Code or other
applicable rules and regulations of the City or the procedures set forth in
appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9.
All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by
proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must
be approved by the Manager before installation.
   (7)   The applicant for the building sewer permit shell notify the Manager
when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public
sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the
Manager or his representative.
      (8)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the City.
   (d)   Approval of Connections by M.U.C. Inspector. No sewer service shall be
connected until the plumbing and connections incident thereto shall have been
inspected and approved by an Inspector of the M.U.C.
   No sewer service line shall be connected to the M.U.C. sewer system if that
service line will contain flows other than sanitary wastewater. Roof drains,
yard and area drains, footer drains, or any line other than that which serves a
sanitary plumbing system is prohibited from connection to the M.U.C. system.
   (e)   Unauthorized Connections Prohibited. No person shall connect to or
turn on any sewer service, or cut-in, interconnect, tap or make any alteration
to any main or distribution or collection pipe of the City's sewer system or
permit any connection or tapping to be made to the sewer system on their
premises or the premises occupied by them, or knowingly use the sewer service
from connections in violation of any of the provisions of this article or any
rules or regulations adopted by City Council or the M.U.C. with respect
thereto.
   Roof downspouts, yard and area drains, footer drains, or any lines carrying
flow other than exclusively sanitary wastewater are prohibited from connection
to the sanitary sewer system.
   
   (f)   Establishment of Schedule of Rates and Charges; Use of Water Meters.
For the payment of the proper and reasonable expense of operation, repair,
replacements, improvements, additions, betterments, extensions and maintenance
of the sewer system and for the payment of the sums required to pay the
principal and interest of all sewer revenue bonds as they become due, the City
Council shall enact and may from time to time amend a schedule of just and
equitable rates or charges for the use of and service rendered by the Municipal
Utility Commission and the sewer works of the City of St. Albans, which
schedule of rates or charges shall be based upon the metered amount of water
supplied the premises; metered or measured wasteflow streams from the premises;
or flat rate charges for unmetered service and each schedule shall be
maintained on file in the M.U.C. office and by the City Clerk while it is in
effect.
   Until such time as the City Council adopts a schedule of rates or charges
pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section, the rates and charges in
effect immediately prior to the effective date of this Code shall continue in
full force and effect.
   (g)   Established Rates Applicable to Premises Subsequently Served. The
rates or charges so established for any class of users or property served shall
be extended to cover any additional premises hereafter served which fall within
the same class, without the necessity of any hearing or notice.
   (h)   City Subject to Established Rates or Charges. The City shall be
subject to the established charges and rates, or to charges and rates
established in harmony therewith, for service rendered the City and shall pay
such rates or charges when due from corporate funds, which shall be deemed to
be a part of the revenues of the sewage system and works and be applied as
provided for the application of such revenues.
   (i)   Authority Vested in M.U.C. for Billing and Collection. All rates or
charges provided for by this article shall be billed and collected monthly by
the M.U.C. or by persons or agencies authorized by the M.U.C. All bills shall
be considered due and payable on or before the 20th day following the date
rendered.
   (j)   Lien for Enforcement of Collection of Billed Rates or Charges. All
such rates or charges, if not paid when due, shall be a lien upon the premises
served by such system or works, and if such rates or charges are not paid
within thirty (30) days after due, the amount thereof and a reasonable attorney
fee may be recovered by the M.U.C. in a civil action in the name of the City.
In connection with such action, such lien may be foreclosed against such lot,
parcel of land or building, in accordance with the laws relating thereto.
   (k)   Industrial Use of Sewers. Where the character of sewage from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes
a burden upon the sewer system in addition to the burden imposed by the average
sewage entering the sewer system, such additional charge shall be made therefor
as the M.U.C. shall deem to be fair, and equitable to meet the additional cost
of collection, treatment and disposal of such sewage; and the M.U.C. may, if it
deems advisable so to do, compel the owner, tenant or occupant of such
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises to treat such sewage in
such manner as shall be specified by the M.U.C. before discharging into the
sewer system.
   (l)   Duration of Liability for Sewer Service. Liability for service shall
begin as to all users on the date of connection to the sewer system; and such
liability shall continue thereafter unless such premises are disconnected from
the sewer system with the approval of the M.U.C. After such liability begins,
no allowance shall be made for vacant houses or structures unless request in
writing to have the sewer system shut-off is received by the M.U.C. Board, nor
will any allowance be made for any shut-off period which is less than thirty
(30) days.
   (m)   User's Responsibility to Keep Sewer Clean. The owner, tenant or
occupant of the property shall be continuously responsible for maintaining and
keeping the sewer pipe leading to and between the plumbing system of their
premises to the City's connecting sewer clean and free from obstruction, and
shall not cause, suffer or permit any article or thing, liquid as well as
solid, to be introduced into the pipe which causes a stoppage thereof. In the
event of any such obstruction or stoppage the M. U.C. shall have the right to
cut off the water connection, which shall not be reconnected until such sewer
pipe is cleaned and maintained properly; and in the further event of the
failure of such user to remedy such obstruction or stoppage, the M.U.C. Manager
or designated representative shall have the right to enter upon said premises
and make necessary repairs, the cost and expenses of which shall be included as
part of the charges against said premises.
   (n)   Leaks. No allowance or adjustment of any sewer bill shall be made for
water leaks of any nature occurring on the user's side of the meter if the
water so leaked enters the sewer.
   (o)   City Not Liable for Damage. Neither the City nor the M.U.C. shall be
liable for any damage resulting from bursting of any sewer main, service pipe
or valve, or from discontinuing the operation of its sewer collection,
treatment and disposal facilities, for repairs, extensions or connections, or
from the accidental failure of the sewage collection, treatment and disposal
facilities from any cause whatsoever. In cases of emergency, the M.U.C. shall
have the right to restrict the use of its sewage collection, treatment and
disposal facilities in any reasonable manner for the protection of the City and
its sewer system.
   (p)   Tampering with Sewer Appurtenances. No person, except City emergency
personnel, shall turn, lift, remove, raise or tamper with any cover or any
manhole, basin, inlet or other appurtenance of any public storm sewer without a
written permit from the Council's designated official, or of any combined sewer
or sanitary sewer without a written permit from the M.U.C.
   (q)   Entering Sewer. No person, other than one employed by the City in
Public Works or M.U.C. while on duty, shall enter any public storm sewer or
appurtenance thereof without a written permit from the Council's designated
official, or shall enter any public combined sewer or sanitary sewer without a
written permit from the M.U.C.
   (r)   Injury to Sewer. No person shall break or damage any public sewer or
appurtenance or part thereof.

discharged any unpolluted waters such as stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff,
subsurface drainage, or cooling water to any sewer, except stormwater runoff
from limited areas, which stormwater may be polluted at times, may be
discharged to the sanitary sewer by permission of the Manager and the necessary
permit obtained.
   (b)   Stormwater. Stormwater other than that exempted under subsection (a)
hereof, and all other unpolluted drainage shall be discharged to such sewers as
are specifically designated as combined sewers, storm sewers or to a natural
outlet approved by the M.U.C. Manager and other regulatory agencies. Unpolluted
industrial cooling water or process waters may be discharged on approval of the
Manager to combined sewer or natural outlet.
   (c)   Flammable, Explosive or Hazardous Substance and Foreign Matter. No
person(s) shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following
described waters or wastes to any public sewers:
      (1)   Any gasoline, benzene, naptha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid, or gas.
      (2)   Any waters containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids, or gases
in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes,
which injure or interfere with any waste treatment process, constitute a hazard
to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, or create any hazard in the
receiving waters of the wastewater treatment plant.
      (3)   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower or higher than that normally
encountered in the system, or having any other corrosive property capable of
causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment/operation and personnel of
the wastewater works without a permit to do so.
      (4)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the
proper operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not limited to, yard
waste (grass, leaves, sticks, etc.) ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw,
shavings, metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage,
whole blood, paunch manure, hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes,
cups, milk containers, etc., either whole or ground by garbage grinders.
   (d)   Toxic Substances. The following described substances, materials,
waters, or waste shall be limited in discharges to municipal systems to
concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater
treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property,
or constitute a nuisance. The Manager may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the regulations below if in his opinion such more
severe limitations are necessary to meet the above objectives. In forming his
opinion as to the acceptability, the Manager will give consideration to such
factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in
the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment
process employed, capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of
treatability of the waste in the wastewater treatment plant, and other
pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or
characteristics of waste or wastewater discharged to the sanitary sewer which
shall not be violated without approval of the Manager are as follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150° Fahrenheit (65°
Celsius).
      (2)   Wastewater containing more than 25 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, or product of mineral oil origin.
      (3)   Wastewater from industrial plants containing floatable oils, fat,
or grease.
      (4)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded (see Section
933.01(n)). Garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes,
hotels, institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments, or
similar places where garbage originates from the preparation of food in
kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the premises or when served by
caterers.
      (5)   Any waters or wastes containing iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and
similar objectionable or toxic substances to such degree that any such material
received in the composite wastewater at the wastewater treatment works exceeds
the limits established by the Manager for such materials.
      (6)   Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding
limits which may be established by the Manager.
      (7)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration as may exceed limits established by the Manager in compliance
with applicable state or federal regulations.
      (8)   Quantities of flow, concentrations, or both which constitute a
"slug" as defined herein.
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (10)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
   (e)   Conditional Service. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are
proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) hereof,
and which in the judgement of the Manager may have a deleterious effect upon
the wastewater facilities, structures, processes, equipment, or receiving
waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public
nuisance, the Manager may:
      (1)   Reject the wastes;
      (2)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
      (4)   Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating the
wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of
subsection (j) hereof.
   When considering the above alternatives, the Manager shall give
consideration to the economic impact of each alternative on the discharger. If
the Manager permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design
and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Manager.
   (f)   Grease, Oil and Sand Separators. Grease, oil and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Manager, they are necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive
amounts, as specified in subsection (d)(3) hereof, or any flammable wastes,
sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall
be of a type and capacity approved by the Manager, and shall be located as to
be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the
maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the
proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and
shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to
review by the Manager. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not
performed by owner(s)' personnel must be performed by currently licensed waste
disposal firms.
   (g)   Pretreatment. Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided or required for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained
continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner(s) at his
expense.
   (h)   Metering and Sampling Devices. When required by the Manager, the owner
of any property serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable structure together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and
measurement of wastes. Such structure, when required, shall be accessibly and
safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by
the Manager. The structure shall be installed by the owner at his expense and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (i)   Design Data on Connection. The Manager may require a user of sewer
services to provide information needed to determine compliance with this
chapter. These requirements may include:
      (1)   Wastewaters discharge peak rate and volume over a specified time
period.
      (2)   Chemical analyses of wastewaters.
      (3)   Information on raw materials, processes, and products affecting
wastewater volume and quality.
      (4)   Quantity and disposition of specific liquid, sludge, oil, solvent,
or other materials important to sewer use control.
      (5)   A plot plan of sewers of the user's property showing sewer and
pretreatment facility location.
      (6)   Details of wastewater pretreatment facilities.
      (7)   Details of systems to prevent and control the losses of materials
through spills to the municipal sewer.
   (j)   Measurements, Tests, and Analyses. All measurements, tests, and
analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made
in this chapter shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of
"Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater" published by the
American Public Health Association. Sampling methods, location, times,
durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis subject
to approval by the Manager.
   (k)   Disclaimer. No statement contained in this article shall be construed
as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the City for treatment.

eligibility or qualifications of the applicant for such reduced charge and/or
credit.
   If, upon application to the City Clerk, the credit is disallowed, the
person, or domestic establishment, may request a hearing before the Municipal
Judge of the City, whose decision shall govern the parties, subject to the
right of said person, or domestic establishment, to appeal the decision of the

         E.   Describe the circumstances for requesting a waiver;
         F.   Proposed alternative to meet compliance with Stormwater Ordinance
related to environmental impact of construction.
      (3)   If a comprehensive Watershed Management Plan has not been
developed, then a waiver may be granted to specific projects on a case-by-case
basis that do not increase the post-development peak discharge over that of the
predevelopment peak discharge for undisturbed land. The Director, with approval
of the Board, may not waive the minimum for storm water management of water
quality protection as described in subsection (i) of this section.
      (4)   Any requirement beyond those described in subsection (i) of this
section may be waived by the Director, if the Director finds that meeting the
minimum on-site stormwater management requirements is not feasible due to the
unique natural or existing physical characteristics of a site or that the
property owner would suffer an undue hardship if required to meet the full
requirements of these regulations. To be eligible for a waiver, the Applicant
must also demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director and the Board that
the waiver will not result in any of the following impacts to downstream
waterways:
         A.   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
         B.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         C.   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion; or,
         D.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life and/or
property.
      (5)   Where compliance with the full requirements for on-site stormwater
management is waived, the Applicant shall satisfy stormwater management
requirements by accomplishing a mitigation measure approved by the Director.
Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Alternative means for onsite management of stormwater discharges
that have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been
approved by the Director.
         B.   The creation of appropriately designed and constructed stormwater
management facility or drainage improvements on other properties, public or
private that currently lack stormwater management facilities. This alternative
facility must provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater
than that which would be afforded by the waived on-site practices and there
must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long-term operation and
maintenance ofthe off-site practice. The Director shall, to the maximum extent
practical, ensure that the benefits arising from the off-site practice shall be
realized in the same basin/watershed as the waived management practice.
         C.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the City or
the grant of an easement to the City, to be dedicated to preservation,
reforestation, and/or the creation of green space, wetlands, or permanent
buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat.
         D.   Any mitigation measure shall provide a level of environmental
protection and/or improvement that is, in the sole discretion of the Director,
approximately equal to or greater than that which would have been provided by
the waived practice.
      (6)   Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. Where the Director
waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, and the
applicant does not complete an approved mitigation project, the applicant shall
be required to pay a fee in lieu of stormwater management practices, in an
amount as determined by the Director. This amount shall be approximately equal
to the cost of stormwater management and based on the cubic feet of storage
required to stormwater management of the development in question. All of the
monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate stormwater capital
improvements program project, and shall be made by the applicant prior to the
issuance of any stormwater permit for the development. (Ord. 2011-11. Passed

body to accomplish a coordinated and compatible development of land and
improvements within its territorial jurisdiction, in accordance with present
and future needs and resources.
   (b)    A comprehensive plan is a process through which citizen participation
and thorough analysis are used to develop a set of strategies that establish as
clearly and practically as possible the best and most appropriate future
development of the area under the jurisdiction of the Planning Commission. A
comprehensive plan aids the Planning Commission in designing and recommending
to the governing body ordinances that result in preserving and enhancing the
unique quality of life and culture in that community and in adapting to future
changes of use of an economic, physical, or social nature. A comprehensive plan
guides the Planning Commission in the performance of its duties to help achieve
sound planning.
   (c)    A comprehensive plan must promote the health, safety, morals, order,
convenience, prosperity and general welfare of the inhabitants, as well as
efficiency and economy in the process of development.
   (d)    The purpose of a comprehensive plan is to:
      (1)    Set goals and objectives for land development, uses and
suitability for a governing body, so a governing body can make an informed
decision;
      (2)    Ensure that the elements in the comprehensive plan are consistent;
      (3)    Coordinate all governing bodies, units of government and other
planning commissions to ensure that all comprehensive plans and future
development are compatible;
      (4)    Create conditions favorable to health, safety, mobility,
transportation, prosperity, civic activities, recreational, educational,
cultural opportunities and historic resources;
      (5)    Reduce the wastes of physical, financial, natural or human
resources which result from haphazard development, congestion or scattering of
population;
      (6)    Reduce the destruction or demolition of historic sites and other
resources by reusing land and buildings and revitalizing areas;
      (7)    Promote a sense of community, character and identity;
      (8)    Promote the efficient utilization of natural resources, rural
land, agricultural land and scenic areas;
      (9)    Focus development in existing developed areas and fill in vacant
or underused land near existing developed areas to create well designed and
coordinated communities; and
      (10)    Promote cost-effective development of community facilities and
services.
   (e)    A comprehensive plan may provide for innovative land use management
techniques, including:

a Zoning Permit within sixty (60) days of the applicant's filing of a complete

agencies, and/or that requested revisions to the permit application have not
been made. A Zoning Permit shall become void one (1) year after its issue

the discretion of the Chairman of the Board.
      (2)    Requests for postponement filed less than (10) days prior to the
date of a scheduled hearing, shall, in addition to the other requirements set
forth in subsection (a) above, including the sum of money sufficient to pay the
cost of advertising the postponement and the rescheduled hearing, be supported

Adjustment.
 
   (j)    Disapproval of Application. If an application or Appeal is denied by

(Ord. 2023-02. Passed 4-17-23.)
   1317.03 SPECIAL EXCEPTION USES AND VARIANCES.
   (a)    Special Exception Uses. Special Exception Uses are Uses that are
conditionally permitted in a particular Zoning District. A Special Exception
Use may be commenced and carried on only after review by the Zoning Board of
Adjustment and its issuance of a Special Use Permit. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall consider a request for a Special Use Permit if the requested
Use is expressly designated as a Special Exception Use in this Ordinance or
interpreted and classified as such by the Zoning Administrator, for the Zoning
District in which the subject property is located. The Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall issue a Special Use Permit (granting the special exception) if
the required findings are made or deny issuance of a permit if all required
findings cannot be made. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach reasonable
conditions to the issuance of a Special Use Permit to ensure the Special
Exception Use's compatibility with other Uses permitted in the Zoning District.
If any conditions required or imposed as part of a Special Use Permit are not
maintained or carried out or cease to exist, the Board shall revoke the Special
Use Permit and the Use shall thereafter be in violation of this Ordinance.
   (b)    If the Board cannot make all of the required findings, no Special Use
Permit shall be issued. If circumstances change sufficiently that the necessary
findings might be met in the future, the Board may rehear a similar
application.
   (c)    A Special Use Permit shall be valid for two (2) years in the event
that the use is not acted upon, or a Subdivision and/or Land Development Plan
has not received approval.
   (d)    Special Use Permit Procedures.
      (1)    A written application for a Special Use Permit shall be submitted
to the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Zoning Administrator, which application
shall specify the Special Exception Use sought and include all materials
required for a Zoning Permit. The administrative staff shall review the
application and file a written report to the Zoning Board of Adjustment before
the hearing.
       (2)    The Board shall set and hold a public hearing. In order to issue
a Special Use Permit, the Board must make the following written findings
regarding the Special Exception Use sought:
         A.   The Use will not materially endanger the public health or safety
or constitute a public nuisance if located where proposed and developed
according to the plans and information submitted and approved;
         B.   The Use will not substantially diminish the value of Adjacent
Property unless the Use is a public necessity; and
         C.   The location and character of the Use, if developed according to
the plans and information approved, will be in harmony with proximate land
Uses, and consistent with the purposes of the Zoning District.
         D.   If the Board makes the above required findings, a Special Use
Permit shall be issued to permit the requested Use, subject however, to any
condition stipulated by this Ordinance or determined by the Board to be
necessary to ensure that the Use remains compatible with other Uses permitted
in the Zoning District and with Adjacent Properties. No Special Use Permit may
grant Variances from the requirements of this Ordinance. A Special Use Permit
serves as the Zoning Permit for the subject Use and property.
   (e)    Conditions. The Zoning Board of Adjustment, in issuing Special Use
Permits, may attach conditions considered necessary to protect the public
welfare and the purposes listed above, including conditions which are more
restrictive than those established for other Uses in the same Zoning District.
These conditions shall be enforceable by the Zoning Administrator and failure
to comply with such conditions shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance.
   (f)    Sketch Plan Approval. Any Sketch Plan presented in support of an
application for a Special Use Permit shall become an official part of the
record for said matter. Issuance of a Special Use Permit will bind the Use in
accordance with that reflected in the submitted Sketch Plan. Therefore, should
a change in the Sketch Plan be required as part of the approval of the Use, the
applicant shall revise the Sketch Plan prior to the issuance of the Special Use
Permit. Any subsequent change to the Special Use aspects having an effect on
the originally approved Sketch Plan shall require the obtainment of another
Zoning Permit or Special Use Permit, as the case may be.
   (g)    Variance and Exception Procedures.
      (1)    A written application for a Variance to the Zoning Ordinance shall
be submitted to the Zoning Board of Adjustment and Zoning Administrator, which
application shall specify the standard or requirement from which a Variance is
sought. The administrative staff shall review the application and file a
written report with the Board before the hearing.
      (2)    The Board shall set and hold a public hearing.
      (3)    The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall grant the Variance sought if
it finds that the Variance:
         A.   Will not adversely affect the public health, safety or welfare,
or the rights of Adjacent Property Owners or residents;
         B.   Arises from special conditions or attributes which pertain to the
property for which a Variance is sought and which were not created by the
Person seeking the Variance;
         C.   Would eliminate an Unnecessary Hardship and permit a reasonable
Use of the land; and
         D.   Will allow the intent of the Zoning Ordinance to be observed and
substantial justice done.
      (4)    If the Board grants a Variance, its actions will be accompanied by
its reasons for making the required findings and by its certification that the
Variance is the minimum Variance which will make possible the reasonable Use of
land, Buildings, or Structures.
         (Ord. 2023-02. Passed 4-17-23.)
   1317.04 TEMPORARY PERMITS AND INTERPRETATION OF ZONING MAP.
   (a)   The Board may allow the substitution of one (1) nonconforming use for
another non- conforming use which existed at the time of enactment of this
ordinance, provided that no structural alterations are allowed except those
required by law or ordinance and; provided that in any "R" District no change
shall be permitted to any use prohibited by a "C-1" District and that in any
"C" District no change shall be permitted to any use prohibited in a "I-1"
District.
   (b)   The Board may allow the temporary use of a building or premises in any
District for a purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations
prescribed by this Ordinance, provided that such use be of a true temporary
nature and does not involve the erection of substantial buildings. Such permit
shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit for not more
than a twelve (12) month period, subject to such conditions as will safeguard
the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare.
   (c)   The temporary use of a building or premises in undeveloped sections
for a purpose that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by this
Ordinance, provided that such structure or use is of a true temporary nature,
is promotive of or incidental to the development of such undeveloped sections
and does not involve the erection of substantial buildings.
   (d)   The Board may interpret the zoning map for involving disputes as to
the true boundary of a Zoning District and the true designation(s) of any
Zoning District.
 
   (e)   The Board may exercise all other powers and duties as may be granted
by this Ordinance. (Ord. 2023-02. Passed 4-17-23.)

      (1)    Whenever a petition requesting an amendment, supplement or change
of the rules and regulations prescribed for an area, is presented to the
Council, duly signed, by the owners of fifty percent (50%) or more of the real
property area to which the petition relates, it shall be the duty of the
Council to vote upon said petition within ninety days after the filing of the
same by the petitioner.
      (2)    Whenever a petition requesting an amendment, supplement or change
of the rules and regulations, in whole, or in part, is presented to the Council
by the Commission, duly signed by its Chairman, it shall be the duty of the
Council to vote upon said petition with such time period as it may deem fit and
proper.
      (3)    If, however, a protest against a proposed amendment, supplement or
change be presented to the Council duly signed by the owners of twenty percent
(20%) or more of the area included in such proposed amendment, supplement or
change, or by the owners of twenty percent (20%) or more of the area
immediately adjacent extending 100 feet therefrom, or by the owners of twenty
percent (20%) or more of the area directly opposite thereto, extending 100 feet
from the street frontage of such opposite area, such amendment, supplement or
change shall require approval by a three-fourths vote of the Council.
 
   (b)   A petition to amend, change, or supplement, the rules and regulations
of this Ordinance or any zoning district as designated on the Zoning Map, shall
be filed with the City Clerk and shall be transmitted by him to the Council.
Such petition shall include among other things, a legal description of the area
proposed to be rezoned, an accurate map or survey showing the location of all
buildings, and other structures, in such area, the topography, present and
proposed use of such area, the present and proposed zoning classification of
such area, the name and address of owner or owners of such area, and a list of
all owners on which notice is to be served in connection with the hearing on
the proposed zoning, sworn to by the petitioner, except a petition of the
Commission need not be sworn to.
      (1)   Any such petition, except by the Commission, shall be accompanied
by a filing fee of twenty five dollars ($25.00).
      (2)    The Council shall refer any such petition to the Commission.
      (3)    In the case of a proposed amendment, supplement or change to the
Zoning Map, the Commission shall consider whether the area described in the
original petition should be enlarged in order to reflect the interest of the
community and to correspond with the comprehensive plan for city development.
The Commission may order such enlargement and direct that the notice of public
hearing be based upon such enlargement.
   (c)   At least fifteen (15) days' notice of the time, place and object of
such public hearing shall be given by the City Clerk on behalf of the
Commission in accordance with Chapter 8A of the West Virginia Code, as amended.
Said notice shall describe the area proposed to be affected by a legal

adjacent extending 100 feet therefrom, and all owners of the area directly
opposite thereto, extending 100 feet from the street frontage of such opposite
area, shall be notified by mail.
   
   (d)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing on such proposed amendment,
supplement or change and its recommendation with respect thereto shall be
transmitted to the Council before final action by the Council on said
amendment, supplement or change. Provided, however, that if the recommendation
of the Commission has not been returned to the Council within ninety (90) days
from the receipt by the Commission, it shall forfeit the right further to
suspend action of the Council with respect to such amendment, supplement or

Zoning Map, which involves a reclassification into "C-1", "C-2", "H-1", or "I-
1" District, the Commission may require the petitioner to submit a development
plan showing the extent, location and character of proposed structures and
uses.
      (1)    The Commission may recommend, and the Council may require that
such plan be modified to meet objections raised at the public hearing or
subsequent thereto and may qualify their approval of the Zoning Map amendment,
supplement or change, in any such case by attaching a special permit. Any such
action shall be distinguished in the Council proceedings with the words
"Special Development Plan" and a serial number.
        (2)    Within a period of one year from the approval of the Zoning Map
amendment, supplement or change, conditioned on the same special development
plan, no building permit or Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued for any
such property except in accordance with the development plan as approved, in
which case, the permit shall contain all conditions and limitations placed
thereon by the Council, or in accordance with the zoning classification
applicable before the action.
      (3)   Unless a building permit for such special development is issued
within six (6) months from the Council's approval, said approval shall be void
and the zoning classification shall be as it was when said petition was filed.

   1329.01 PURPOSE; ESTABLISHED.
   The purpose of overlay zoning districts is to allow the City to establish
special land use regulations, standards, or procedures in areas with unique
land use, site planning, and building design issues. Overlay zoning districts
are also an appropriate mechanism to implement long-term goals and land use
requirements of the City for a specific property, location, or to coordinate
land use and design requirements unique to a large tract of land. Overlay
zoning districts are intended to be applied only where special circumstances
justify the modification of base zoning district regulations to achieve
specific land use and design objectives.
   (a)    Districts. In addition to the conventional zoning districts
established by this Ordinance, the following overlay districts are established:
      (1)    Downtown Overlay District (DO)
      (2)    Railway Depot Overlay (RD)
   (b)    Establishment and Designation. Overlay zoning districts are
established through rezoning, and only in conjunction with base zoning
districts. Letters, numbers, or a combination thereof, shall be combined with
other applicable district designations to the property or properties on which
an overlay district is established. Except as modified by the overlay zoning
district, the provisions of the applicable base zoning district shall apply to
all development within the boundary of the designated area. If regulations
conflict, the applicable overlay zoning district regulations shall prevail.
      (1)    Whenever an overlay district is established, any subsequent
application to change the base zoning district shall not be construed to be an
application to eliminate the overlay district for the property covered by the
application.

   1333.19  PARKING, LOADING AND INTERNAL CIRCULATION.
   (a)    Purpose.  It is the intent of the parking, loading and internal
circulation regulations to provide for adequate off-street parking spaces to
serve residential, commercial, institutional, and other land uses, and thus
help to prevent congestion of City streets. Proper design of and access to
parking facilities shall be required in order to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare. Furthermore, it is the intent of these regulations to
promote the functional efficiency of all land uses by requiring off-street
parking and loading facilities consistent with modern standards.
   (b)    General Provisions.
      (1)    New Development.  The parking, loading and internal circulation
standards of this article shall apply to any new building constructed and to
any new use or change in land use established in accordance with the standards
of this article.
      (2)    Expansions and Alterations.  The parking, loading and internal
circulation standards of this section shall apply when an existing structure or
use is expanded or enlarged. Additional off-street parking and loading spaces
shall be required to serve the entire building or use. However, when the
increased intensity of a commercial or industrial building requires two (2) or
less new spaces, no additional parking spaces shall be required. For a building
containing both residential and commercial uses, the portion of the building in
each respective type of use shall be considered as if it were a separate
building for the purpose of applying this exemption.
   (c)    Change of Occupancy or Change in Land Use.
      (1)    Off-street parking facilities shall be provided for any change of
occupancy or change in land use or manner of operation that would, based on
Appendix A, Table 5-1-B1, Minimum Parking Space Requirements, result in a
requirement for more parking or loading spaces than the existing or more recent
use. However, when the increased intensity of a commercial building requires
two (2) or less new spaces, no additional parking spaces shall be required. For
a building containing both residential and commercial or industrial uses, the
portion of the building in each respective type of use shall be considered as
if it were a separate building for the purpose of applying this exemption.
      (2)    Off-street parking shall be paved in accordance with the
provisions of Section
1333.19 whenever a change of land use is requested.
      (3)    If a variance from the parking requirements of this Ordinance, or
a previous version of this Ordinance, is granted, the variance may continue
only under the following conditions:
         A.   If the change in land use results in a less intensive use than
the previous use for which the variance was granted and requires fewer parking
spaces, the lesser number of parking spaces shall be permitted.
         B.   If the new use requires more parking of three (3) or more
additional spaces, a new variance request shall be submitted to the Board of
Zoning Appeals.
   (d)    Obligation of Property Owner.
      (1)    The provision and maintenance of required off-street parking
facilities are continuing obligations of the property owner or tenant. Required
parking spaces shall be improved as required and made available for use before
final inspection is completed.
   (e)    Location of Parking Spaces.
      (1)    In all zoning districts, required off-street parking shall be
located on the premises intended to be served, unless a conditional use permit

   (a)    Rules for Computing Parking Space Requirements. The following rules
shall apply when computing the number of spaces required pursuant to
Appendix A, Table 5-1-B1, Land-Use Parking Table Requirements.
      (1)    Fractions. When calculation of the number of required off-street
parking spaces results in a fractional number, a fraction of less than one-half
(½) shall be disregarded and a fraction of one-half (½) or more shall be
rounded to the next highest whole number.
      (2)    Multiple Uses or Activities.  When two (2) or more uses,
activities, or separate establishments are located within the same development,
off-street parking shall be provided for each use or separate establishment
according to
Appendix A, Table 5-1-B1, unless a shared parking plan is approved. In the
event that one or more uses within a multi-use development are of a size that
would otherwise exempt them from compliance with off-street parking
requirements, only one such exemption shall be permitted to be taken for the
entire development.
      (3)    Bench Seating. When seating consists of benches, pews or other
similar seating facilities, each twenty (20) linear inches of seating space
shall be counted as one (1) seat.
      (4)    Employees and Occupants.  For the purpose of computing parking
requirements based on the number of employees, residents or occupants,
calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any
single shift or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is applicable.
   (b)    Joint and Shared Use Parking.
      (1)    The joint use of a parking lot for two (2) or more buildings or
uses which are abutting or directly across the public way from each other, may
be permitted, except for single-family residential and duplexes, provided that;
the total number of spaces is not less than the sum required for various
building or uses if computed separately unless the hours of operation are
computed separately.
      (2)    Each use of the shared spaces shall function as if having been
provided separately.
      (3)    A written agreement shall be prepared by and between property
owners specifying the conditions for sharing and maintaining said spaces(s),
and such agreement shall be filed with the Zoning Officer.
      (4)    The City may allow a reduction of total parking requirement up to
twenty-five percent (25%):
         A.   If the applicant can satisfactorily demonstrate the parking
spaces will be shared with another adjacent land use and the lack of overlap of
hours of operation of the land uses justify such a reduction, and
         B.   The applicant provides the City with a written agreement as
described in (b)(3) above, which includes the justification for the reduction.
      (5)    Shared parking facilities shall provide signs on the premises
indicating the availability of the facility for the patrons of the
participating uses.
      (6)    Modifications to the structures in which the uses are located or
changes in tenant occupancy shall require review for compliance with this
Section.
   (c)    Restricted Accessory Parking Lot Standards.
      (1)    Parking spaces in restricted accessory parking lots when approved
as either a permitted or conditional use shall count toward fulfilling on-site
parking requirements for the use to which the parking lot is accessory.
      (2)    Restricted accessory parking lots in commercial districts located
directly abutting or directly across a minor street or public way shall be
treated as a permitted use.

water onto adjacent lots properties, or public streets or ways.
      (2)    Landscaping and Screening.  Off-street loading areas shall be
screened from view.
   (b)    Lighting.
      (1)    Lighting shall be arranged and designed so that no source of light
is directed toward any lots used or zoned for residential use. Lighting shall
be designed to shield public streets and all other adjacent lands from
distracting glare, or hazardous interference of any kind. Vehicular use areas
shall not be lighted at any time other than the hours of operation of the use
that the loading is intended to serve, except for necessary security lighting.
   (c)    Loading Area Access.
      (1)    Loading areas shall be located and designed to ensure that

         (Ord. 2023-02. Passed 4-17-23.)
   1333.26 NONCONFORMING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Nonconforming Use Limitations. It is recognized that there may exist
within the districts established by this Ordinance and subsequent amendments,
lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this
Ordinance was passed or amended which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of this Ordinance or future amendments. Such uses
are declared by this Ordinance to be incompatible with permitted uses in the
districts involved. It is further the intent of this Ordinance that
nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded, or extended, nor be used
as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same
district. Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the
plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual
construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this ordinance and upon which actual building construction has
been diligently conducted.
   (b)    Nonconforming Lots. In any zoning district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
this Ordinance or any subsequent amendment. This provision shall apply even
though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that
are generally applicable in the district; provided that yard dimensions and
other requirements not involving area or width, or both, of the lot shall
conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
   (c)    Where such a nonconforming lot does not meet the minimum area or
width requirements, or both, the following setback requirements shall apply:
      (1)    The minimum front setback shall conform to the clearly prevailing
setback pattern of developed lots within the same block fronting the same
street. When an unimproved lot is situated between two (2) lots with existing
principal buildings that each have front yard setbacks less than the setback
required in that district, then the front yard setback may be reduced to a
depth equal to the average of the two (2) adjacent lots, provided that in no
case shall a front yard be reduced by more than fifty percent (50%) of the
required front yard for that district.
      (2)    No side setback shall be less than five (5) feet in any event,
unless provided for in this Ordinance.
   (d)    Nonconforming Structure Used for a Permitted Use. A lawfully existing
structure, which contains a permitted use but does not comply with the other
requirements of this Ordinance for the zoning district in which it is located,
may be continued but shall be subject to the regulations below. In such cases,
however, the failure to meet landscaping or screening requirements shall not be
considered nonconforming.
   (e)    Enlargement, Repair, Alteration. A nonconforming structure may be
enlarged, maintained, repaired, or structurally altered, provided no such
enlargement, maintenance, repair, or structural alteration shall create any
additional nonconformity or increase the degree of the existing nonconformity
of such structure.
   (f)    Reconstruction.  In the event a nonconforming structure is destroyed
by any means to an extent of up to sixty percent (60%) of its replacement
costs, exclusive of the foundation, the structure may be reconstructed on the
same foundation, provided the reconstruction is begun within twelve (12) months
of the date it was destroyed.
   (g)    Relocation. Should a nonconforming structure be moved for any
distance for any reason, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved.
   (h)    Nonconforming Use of a Structure or Land. A nonconforming use of a
structure or land may be continued so long as otherwise lawful but shall be
subject to the regulations below.
      (1)    Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a
nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner, unless the
structure and the use shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which they are located.
      (2)    Ordinary Repair and Maintenance. Ordinary maintenance and repairs,
or repair or replacement of non-bearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing,
shall be permitted, provided these actions shall not be deemed to authorize any
violation of the other parts of this section. Nothing in this ordinance shall
be deemed to prevent the strengthening of a structure, or the restoration of a
structure to a safe condition except for a damaged or destroyed structure
subject to provisions of subsection (g) of this section, in accordance with the
order of the Building Inspector.
   (i)    Structural Alteration. No structural alteration shall be made unless
the entire structure and the use shall thereafter conform to the regulations
for the district in which they are located. However, nothing in this Ordinance
shall be construed to prevent owners of nonconforming residential structures
the right to perform structural alterations which do not increase the number of
dwelling units within the nonconforming residential structure or enlarge its
exterior dimension.
   (j)    Moving. Should a nonconforming use of land or structure be moved, in
whole or in part, for any reason for any distance, it shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district in which it is located after being moved.
   (k)    Change.  A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any use other
than the same use or a use permitted in the district in which the land is
located. When a nonconforming use has been changed to a permitted use, it shall
not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.
   (l)    Discontinuance. A nonconforming use which is hereafter discontinued
for any reason and remains such for a continuous period of one (1) year, shall
not thereafter be re-established. Such location shall thereafter be occupied by
a use which conforms to the regulations for the district in which it is
located.
   (m)    Nonconforming Accessory Use.  A nonconforming accessory use shall not
continue to remain after the principal use to which it is accessory has been
destroyed, relocated, or abandoned. (Ord. 2023-02. Passed 4-17-23.)
   1333.27 HEIGHT, BULK, AREA AND DENSITY PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Except as provided in this Ordinance, no building or structure shall
be erected, enlarged, altered, changed, or otherwise modified, on a lot unless
such building, structure or modification conforms to the height, bulk, area,
and density regulations of the zone in which it is located. The conditions,
standards, requirements, and notes set forth in each district and otherwise
prescribed by this ordinance are established as the basic height, bulk, area
and density regulations for the City.
   (b)    General Exceptions to Height, Bulk, Area, and Density Regulations.
      (1)    Height Exceptions.  In all districts, spires, church steeples,
chimneys, cooling towers, elevator bulkheads, fire towers, scenery lofts,
transmission lines or towers and distribution poles and lines, and essential
mechanical appurtenances may be erected to any height not prohibited by other
laws or ordinances. Standard antenna and similar appurtenances may not exceed
the maximum building height by more than twenty-five (25) feet.
      (2)    Orientation.  All residential structures shall be required to have
a front door facing the street unless the applicant proves to the satisfaction
of the Zoning Officer that the prevailing condition of the developed lots
fronting the same street would warrant a different orientation.
   (c)    Front Setback Exception.
      (1)    In traditional neighborhoods, all construction shall conform to
the clearly prevailing front setback pattern of developed properties fronting
the same side of the street between the street intersections, even when the
prevailing front setbacks differ from the zoning district requirement. This is
accomplished by averaging the front setback of those developed properties.
Outliers, as determined by the Zoning Officer, shall be excluded from the
calculation. Where there is no clearly prevailing front setback pattern, new
construction shall be subject to the front setback required in the zoning
district.
      (2)    In non-traditional neighborhoods, all construction shall be
subject to the front setback required in the zoning district, however when a
property is situated between two (2) lots with existing front setbacks that
differ from those required in the zoning district, then the front setback may
be adjusted to a depth equal to the average of the front setbacks of the two
(2) adjacent lots.

not be permitted on public property.
   (e)    Yard, Building Setbacks, and Open Space Exceptions.
      (1)    No yard, open space or lot area required for a building or
structure shall, during its life, be occupied by or counted as open space for
any other building or structure.
      (2)    For adjoining lots under single ownership, setback requirements
may be determined from the perimeter of the adjoining lots, ignoring interior
lot lines, provided that only one (1) main structure and its accessory
structures shall be allowed within the perimeter of such adjoining lots and,
the following notation is first placed on the recorded deed to each such
adjoining lot: "For planning and zoning purposes, the lot described herein
shall be considered as part and parcel of the adjacent lot(s) owned by [insert
owner's name] pursuant to a deed (or deeds) recorded at Deed Record [#s] page
[#s], in the Office of the Clerk of the County Commission of Kanawha County.
The real estate described herein shall not be considered to be a separate
parcel of real estate for land use, development, conveyance or transfer of
ownership, without having first obtained the expressed approval of the St.
Albans City Planning Commission. This restriction shall be a covenant running
with the land."
   (f)    Side and Rear Setback Exceptions.
      (1)    One-half (½) of an alley abutting a side or rear yard may be
included in the required setback. The required side yard may be reduced where
the applicant proves to the satisfaction of the Zoning Officer that the
provision of a smaller side yard setback will conform to the prevailing side
yard pattern of the developed lots fronting the same street. In no event shall
the required side yard be reduced to less than three (3) feet.
      (2)    In all residential districts, rear additions may be constructed
onto the principal residence even when the existing footprint of the principal
residence extends into the side setbacks. The rear addition may be constructed
as a permitted use, provided that the footprint of the proposed addition will
not further extend into the side setbacks.
      (3)    Corner lots shall have no rear lot lines and therefore shall be
subject only to front and side setback requirements.
   (g)    Through Lot Exception. Where an applicant proves to the satisfaction
of the Zoning Officer that a through lot is developed in such a way that it is
consistent with the clearly prevailing yard pattern of a neighborhood, the
perceived rear yard shall be treated as a rear yard under the provisions of
this Ordinance.
   
   (h)    Safety and Vision.
      (1)    Streets. On any corner lot, a wall, fence, sign, structure,
display of merchandise or any plant growth which obstructs sight lines at
elevations between two and one-half (2 -1/2) feet and eight (8) feet above the
crown of the adjacent roadway shall not be placed or maintained within a clear
vision triangle of the area of the lot twenty (20) feet along the property line
from the street right-of-way at intersections, or forty (40) feet from the edge
of paving.
      (2)    Curb Cuts, Alleys and Driveways.  On any corner lot, a wall,
fence, sign, structure, display of merchandise or any plant growth which
obstructs sight lines at elevations between two and one-half (2 -1/2) feet and
eight (8) feet above the crown of the adjacent roadway shall not be placed or
maintained within a clear vision triangle of the area of the lot fifteen (15)
feet along the property line from the street right-of-way at intersections, or
from the edge of paving.
   (i)    Special Requirements. The following special requirements are
established to clarify certain conditions pertaining to the use of lots and
access points:
      (1)    Structures on a Lot. In a residential district, only one (1)
principal building and its accessory structures may be located on a lot unless
development is approved as a planned unit development, or/as a group housing
development.
      (2)    Lot of Record.  Any lot recorded or in single ownership at the
time of adoption of these regulations shall be permitted to exist in its
present dimension.
   (j)    Permanent Outdoor Display of Goods. For nonresidential uses in
nonresidential zones, a permanent outdoor display of goods shall conform to the
required building setback. No display shall be permitted in any public right-
of-way, nor shall any display be permitted within a clear vision triangle.
   (k)    Temporary Outdoor Display of Goods. Temporary outdoor display of
merchandise may encroach ten (10) feet on the required building setback. No
display shall be permitted in any public right-of-way, nor shall any display be
permitted within a clear vision triangle, or within parking spaces necessary to
meet the parking requirement.

or as waiving any right of the municipality under any section or provision
existing at the time of adoption of these Regulations, or as vacating or

recorded subdivision plat, if such change affects any street layout shown on
such map, or area reserved therein for public use or if its affects any map or

more lots containing more than one acre of land and there are indications that
such lots will eventually be resubdivided into small building sites, the
Commission may require that such parcel of land allow for the future opening of
streets and the ultimate extension of adjacent streets. Easements providing for
the future opening and extension of such streets may be made a requirement of
the plat.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   (c)   Resubdivision of Land.  
      (1)   When a parcel of land consisting of one or more contiguous lots is
to have its internal boundaries changed, by changing the direction of lot
division, by changing the number of lots, or other similar, change, it shall be
considered administrative by definition and no public hearing shall be
required, provided it meets all of the following criteria:
         A.   It does not involve the construction or improvement of roads;
other than private access drives.
         B.   Sufficient utilities exist to service the proposed subdivision.
         C.   It meets the development criteria of these and other regulations
in effect for the area.
      (2)   If the above conditions are met, the owner or the owner’s agent

      (3)   If it appears to the Zoning Officer that the resulting lots meet
all of the requirements of law and the Subdivision Regulations are such that
the City would be compelled to grant the application after public hearing, the
Zoning Officer will tentatively approve the subdivision and submit it for
approval by City Council at its next meeting. Upon approval by City Council,
the Zoning Officer will have the appropriate City officials sign the plat of
the subdivision. The Zoning Officer will report all such subdivisions to the
Planning and Zoning Commission at its next meeting.
         (Ord. 94-01. Passed 1-24-94.)
   1341.13 VACATION OF PLATS.
   (a)   Any plat or any part of any plat may be vacated by the owner of the
premises, at any time before the sale of any lots therein, by a written
instrument, to which a copy of such plat shall be attached, declaring the same
to be vacated.
   (b)   Such an instrument shall be approved by the Commission in like manner
as plats of subdivision. The City Council may reject any such instrument which
abridges or destroys any public rights in any of its public uses, improvements,
streets, or alleys.

recorded or filed in like manner as plats of subdivisions; and being duly

recording of the plat so vacated, and to divest all public rights in the
streets, alleys, and public grounds, and all dedications laid out or described
in such plat.

practical difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations
and/or the purpose of these Subdivision Regulations may be served to a greater
extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve variances to these
Subdivision Regulations sot that substantial justice may be done and the public
interest secured, provided that such variance shall not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of these Regulations; and further provided
the Commission shall not approve variances unless it shall make written
findings based upon the evidence presented to it that all of the following
conditions are met:
      (1)   The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property.
      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are
unique to the property for which the variance is sought and are not applicable
generally to other property.
      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape or
topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience,
if the strict letter of these regulations are carried out.
      (4)   The variance will comply fully with the existing Zoning Ordinance,
and no parcel of land shall be created, either by inclusion within or exclusion
from a proposed subdivision, which cannot be properly utilized for a permitted
use under the existing Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Conditions. In approving variances, the Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements of these Subdivision Regulations.
   (c)   Procedures. A petition for any such variance shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time when the preliminary plat is filed for
the consideration of the Commission. The petition shall state fully the grounds
for the application and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.

      (8)   Public Improvements. The Commission may require that all public
improvements be installed and dedicated prior to the signing of the subdivision
plat by the Chairman of the Commission. If the Commission shall not require
that all public improvements be installed and dedicated prior to the signing of

(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1342.04 SIGNING AND RECORDING OF SUBDIVISION PLAT.
   (a)   Signing of Plat.
      (1)   When an escrow deposit or bond is required the Chairman of the
Commission and the Zoning Officer shall endorse approval on the plat after the
escrow deposit or bond has been approved by the City Council, and all the
conditions of the resolution pertaining to the plat have been satisfied.
      (2)   When installation of improvements is required the Chairman of the
Commission shall endorse approval on the plat after all conditions of the
resolution have been satisfied and all improvements satisfactorily completed.
There shall be written evidence that the required public facilities have been
installed in a manner satisfactory to the City as shown by a certificate signed
by the Zoning Officer and City Attorney that the necessary dedication of public
lands and improvements has been offered.
   (b)   Recording of Plat.
      (1)   The Chairman and Zoning Officer will sign the subdivision plat.
      (2)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to file the plat
with the County Clerk’s office within thirty (30) days of the date of
signature. Simultaneously with the filing of the plat, the Zoning Officer shall
record the agreement of dedication, together with such legal documents as shall
be required to be recorded by the local government attorney.
   (c)   Sectionalizing Major Subdivision Plats. Prior to granting final
approval of a major subdivision plat, the Commission may permit the plat to be
divided into two or more sections and may impose such conditions upon the
filing of the sections as it may deem necessary to assure the orderly
development of the plat. The Commission may require the performance bond will
require actual completion of improvements and be in such amount as is
commensurate with the section or sections of the plat to be filed and may defer
the remaining required escrow deposit or performance bond principal amount
until the remaining section of the plat are offered for filing. The developer
may also file in irrevocable offers to dedicate streets and public improvements
in the sections offered to be filed and defer filing offers of dedication for
the remaining sections until such section, subject to any conditions imposed by
the Commission, shall be granted concurrently with final approval of the plat.
In the event of approval or sectionalizing, the entire approved subdivision
plat including all sections shall be filed within ninety (90) days after date
of final approval with the City Clerk’s office and such sections as have been
authorized by the Commission shall be filed with the County Clerk. Such
sections must contain at least ten percent (10%) of the total number of lots
contained in the approval plat. The approval of all remaining sections not
filed with the County Clerk shall automatically expire unless such sections
have been approved for filing by the Commission, all fees paid, all instruments
and offers of dedication submitted and performance bonds approved and actually
filed with the County Clerk within a period of time set by Commission.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1342.05 ASSURANCE FOR COMPLETION AND MAINTENANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Improvements and Escrow Deposits or Performance Bond.
      (1)   Completion of Improvements. Before the plat is signed by the
Chairman of the Commission, all applicants shall be required to complete, in
accordance with the Commission’s decision and to the satisfaction of the Zoning
Officer all the street, sanitary, and other improvements including lot
improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in these
Subdivision Regulations, specified in the final Subdivision Regulations,
specified in the final subdivision plat, and as approved by the Commission, and
to dedicate same to the City, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on
the property and public improvements thus dedicated.
      (2)   Whenever, by reason of the season of the year, any lot improvements
required by the Subdivision Regulations cannot be performed, no such lot shall
be sold; however, the Zoning Officer may, nevertheless, issue a certificate of
occupancy provided there is no danger to health, safety, or general welfare
upon accepting a cash escrow deposit in an amount to be determined by the City
Engineer for the cost of said improvements. The performance bond covering such
lot improvement shall remain in full force and effect.
   (b)   Procedures on Escrow Fund. All required lot improvements for which
escrow monies have been accepted by the Zoning Officer at the time of issuance
of a certificate of occupancy shall be installed by the developer. In the event
that the improvements have not been properly installed, at the end of the
required time period the Zoning Office shall give two (2) weeks’ written notice
to the developer requiring him to install same, and in the event that the same
are not installed properly in the discretion of the Zoning Officer, the Zoning
Officer may request the governing body to authorize the City to proceed to
contract out the work for the installation of the necessary improvements in a
sum not to exceed the amount of the escrow deposit. At the time of the issuance
of the certificate of all occupancy for which escrow monies are being deposited
with the Zoning Officer, the applicant shall obtain and file with the Zoning
Officer prior to obtaining the certificate of occupancy a notarized statement
from the purchaser or purchasers of the premises authorizing the Zoning Officer
to install the improvements at the end of a nine month period in the event that
the same have not been duly installed by the developer.
      (1)   Performance Bond.
         A.   The Planning Commission in its discretion may waive the
requirements that the applicant complete and dedicate all public improvements
prior to the signing of the subdivision plat, and that, as an alternative, the
applicant post a bond at the time of application for final subdivision approval
in an amount estimated by the Commission as sufficient to secure to the City
the satisfactory construction, installation, and dedication of the incompleted
portion of required improvements. The performance bond shall also secure all
lot improvements on the individual lots of the subdivision as required in these
regulations.
         B.   Such performance bond shall comply with all statutory
requirements and shall be satisfactory to the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency, and manner of execution as set forth in these regulations. The
period within which required improvements must be completed shall be
incorporated in the bond and shall not in any event exceed two (2) years from
date of final approval. Such bond shall be approved by the City as to the
amount and surety and conditions satisfactory to the governing body. The
Commission may, upon proof of difficulty, recommend to the governing body
extension of the completion date set forth in such bond for a maximum period of
one (1) additional year. The City may at any time during the period of such
bond accept a substitution of principal or sureties on the bond upon
recommendation of the Commission.
      (2)   Temporary Improvement. The applicant shall build and pay for all
cost of temporary improvements required by the Commission and shall maintain
same for the period specified by the Commission. Prior to construction of any
temporary facility or improvement, the developer shall file with the City a
separate suitable escrow deposit or bond for temporary facilities, which escrow
deposit or bond shall insure that the temporary facilities will be properly
constructed, maintained, and removed.
      (3)   Costs of Improvements. All required improvements shall be made by
the applicant, at his expense without reimbursement by the City or any
improvement district therein.
      (4)   Governmental Units. Governmental units to which these bonds and
contract provisions apply may file in lieu of said contract or bond a certified
resolution or ordinance from officers or agencies authorized to act in their
behalf, agreeing to comply with the provisions of this Article.
      (5)   Failure to Complete Improvement. For subdivisions for which no
escrow deposit or performance bond has been posted, if the improvements are not
completed within the period specified by the Commission in the resolution
approving the plat, the approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those
cases where an escrow deposit or performance bond has been posted and required
improvements have not been installed within the terms of such performance bond,
the City may thereupon declare the escrow deposit or bond to be in default and
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the escrow deposit or bond is declared to be
in default.
      (6)   Acceptance of Dedication Officers. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements, and parks shall be by ordinance
of the City. The approval by the Commission of a subdivision plat shall not be
deemed to constitute or imply the acceptance by the City of any street,
easement, or park shown on said plat. The Commission may require said plat to
be endorsed with appropriate notes to this effect.
   (c)   Inspection of Improvements. 
      (1)   General Procedure and Fees. The Commission shall provide for
inspection of required improvements during construction and insure their
satisfactory completion. If the Zoning Officer finds upon inspection that any
of the required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the
City’s construction standards and specifications, the applicant shall be
responsible for completing the improvements. Wherever the cost of improvements
is covered by an escrow deposit or performance bond, the applicant and the
bonding company shall be severally and jointly liable for completing the
improvements according to specifications.
      (2)   Release or Reduction of Performance Bond.
         A.   Certificate of Satisfactory Completion. The City will not accept
dedication of required improvements, nor release not reduce a performance bond,
until the Cit Engineer or Zoning Officer has submitted a certificate stating
that all required improvements have been satisfactorily completed and until the
applicant’s engineer or surveyor has certified to the City Engineer or Zoning
Officer, through submission of detailed “as-built” survey plat or the
subdivision indicating location, dimensions, materials, and other information
required by the Commission or City Engineer, that the layout of the line and
grade of all public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for
the subdivision been furnished to and approved by the City Attorney indicating
that the improvements shall have been completed, are ready for dedication to
the City and are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. Upon
such approval and recommendation, the governing body shall thereafter accept
the improvements for dedication in accordance with the established procedure.
         B.   Reduction of Escrow Deposit or Performance Bond. An escrow
deposit or performance bond shall be reduced upon actual dedication of public
improvements and then only to the ratio that the public improvement dedicated
bears to the total public improvements for the plat. In no event shall be the
escrow deposit or performance bond so reduced below twenty-five percent (25%)
of the principal amount.
         C.   Maintenance of Improvements.
            1.   The applicant shall be required to maintain all improvements
on the individual subdivided lots and provide for snow removal on streets and
sidewalks, if required, until acceptance of said improvements by the City. If
there are any certificate of occupancy on a street not dedicated to the City,
the City may on twelve (12) hours’ notice plow the street or effect emergency
repairs and charge same to applicant.
            2.   The applicant shall be required to file a maintenance bond
with the City, prior to dedication, in an amount considered adequate by the
Zoning Officer and in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney, in order to
assure the satisfactory condition of the required improvements, including all
lot improvements on the individual subdivided lots, for a period of one (1)
year after the date of their acceptance by the City and dedication of same to
the local government.
         D.   Deferral or Waiver of Required Improvements.
            1.   The Planning Commission may defer or waive at the time of
final approval, subject to appropriate conditions, the provision of any or all
such improvements as, in its judgment, are not requisite in the interests of
the public health, safety, and general welfare, or which are inappropriate
because of inadequacy or lack of connecting facilities.
            2.   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the Commission to defer the
construction of any improvements required herein because of incompatible
grades, future planning, inadequate or lack of connecting facilities, or for
other reasons, the applicant shall pay his share of the costs of the future
improvements to the City prior to signing of the final subdivision plat, or the
applicant may post a bond insuring completion of said improvements upon demand
of the local government.
         E.   Issuance of Building Permits and Certificates of Occupancy.
            1.   Where an escrow deposit or performance bond has been required
for a subdivision, no certificate of occupancy for any building in the
subdivision shall be issued prior to the completion of the improvements and
dedication of same to the local government, as required in the Commission’s
final approval of the subdivision plat.
            2.   The extent of street improvement shall be adequate for
vehicular access by the prospective occupancy and by police and fire equipment,
prior to the issuance of an occupancy permit. The developer shall at the time
of the dedication submit monies in escrow to the City in a sum determined by
the City Engineer for the necessary final improvement of the street.
            3.   No building permit shall be issued for the final ten percent
(10%) of lots in a subdivision, or in ten percent (10%) be less than two (2),
for the final two (2) lots of a subdivision, until all public improvements
required by the Commission for the plat have been fully completed and dedicated
to the City.

as to be within sight of each other, the sight lines being contained wholly
within the street limits.
   (b)   The external boundaries of a subdivision shall be monumented in the
field by monuments of stone or concrete, not less than thirty (30) inches in
length, not less than four (4) inches square or five (5) inches in diameter,
and marked on top with a cross, brass plug, iron road, or other durable

      (Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.04 CHARACTER OF THE LAND.
   Land which the Commission finds to be unsuitable for subdivision or
redevelopment due to flooding, improper drainage, steep slopes, rock
formations, adverse earth formations or topography, utility easement, or other
features which will reasonably be harmful to the safety, health, and general
welfare of the present or future inhabitants of the subdivision and/or its
surrounding areas, shall not be subdivided or developed unless adequate methods
are formulated by the developer and approved by the Commission, upon
recommendation of the City Engineer, to solve the problems created by the
unsuitable land conditions. Such land shall be set aside for uses as shall not
involve such a danger.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.05 SUBDIVISION NAME.
   The proposed name of the subdivision shall not duplicate, or too closely
approximate phonetically, the name of any other subdivision in the area covered
by these regulations.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.06 LOTS.
   (a)   Lot Arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography or other conditions, in
securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with the Zoning
Ordinance and Health Regulations and in providing driveway access to buildings
on such lots from an approved street.
   (b)   Lot Dimensions. Lot dimensions shall comply with the minimum standards
of the Zoning Ordinance. Where lots are more than double the minimum required
area for the zoning district, the Commission may require that such lots be
arranged so as to allow further subdivision and the opening of future streets
where they would be necessary to serve such potential lots, all in compliance
with the Zoning Ordinance and these regulations. In general, side lot lines
shall be at right angles to street lines (or radial to curving street lines)
unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for erection of
buildings, observing the minimum front-yard setback from both streets.
   Depth and width of properties reserved or land out for business, commercial,
or industrial purposes shall be adequate to provide for the off-street parking
and loading facilities required for the type of use and development
contemplated, as established in the Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Double Frontage Lots and Access to Lots.  
      (1)   Double frontage lots. Double frontage and reversed frontage lots
shall be avoided except where necessary to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arterials or to overcome specific disadvantages of
topography and orientation.
      (2)   Access from major and secondary arterials. Lots shall not, in
general, derive access exclusively from a major or secondary streets. Where
driveway access from a major or secondary street may be necessary for several
adjoining lots, the Commission may require that such lots be served by a
combined access drive in order to limit possible traffic hazard on such street.
Where possible, driveways should be designed and arranged so as to avoid
requiring vehicles to back into traffic on major or secondary arterials.
         (Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.07 SOIL PRESERVATION, GRADING AND SEEDING.
   (a)   Soil Preservation and Final Grading. Developer shall take necessary
means to prevent soil erosion as required by the City Building Inspector.
   (b)   Lot Drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage
shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from
each lot to adjacent lots.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.08 DEBRIS AND WASTE.
   No cut trees, timber, debris, junk, rubbish, or other waste materials of any
kind shall be buried in any land, or left or deposited on any lot or street at
the time of the issuance of a certificate of occupancy, and removal of same
shall be required prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy on a
subdivision. Nor shall any be left or deposited in any area of the subdivision
at the time of expiration of the performance bond or dedication of public
improvements, whichever is sooner. (Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.09 FENCING.
   Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish and install
fences wherever the Commission determines that a hazardous condition may exist.
The fences shall be constructed according to standards established by the City
Engineer and shall be noted as to height and material on the final plat. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until sand fence improvements have
been duly installed.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.10 WATERBODIES AND WATERCOURSES.
   If a tract being subdivided contains a water body, or portion thereof, lot
lines shall be so drawn as to distribute the entire ownership of the water body
among the fees to adjacent lots. The Commission may approve an alternative plan
whereby the ownership of the responsibility for safe maintenance of the water
body is so placed that it will not become a City responsibility. NO more than
twenty-five percent (25%) of the minimum area of a lot required under the
Zoning Ordinance may be satisfied by land which is under water.
   Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the street by
which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a culvert or
other structure, of design approved by the City Engineer.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.11 STREETS AND ROADS.
   (a)   General Requirements.  
      (1)   Frontage on improved roads. No subdivision shall be approved unless
the area to be subdivided shall have frontage or access from an existing street
or:
         A.   An existing state, highway; or
         B.   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Commission and
recorded in the County Clerk’s office. Such street or highway must be suitably
improved as required by the highway rules, regulations, specifications, or
orders, or be secured by a performance bond required under these Subdivision
Regulations, with the width and right-of-way required by these Subdivision
Regulations.
      (2)   Topography and arrangement.  
         A.   All streets shall be properly integrated with the existing and
proposed system of thoroughfares and dedicated right-of-way as established by
the Comprehensive Plan.
         B.   All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and
shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
         C.   Minor and local streets shall be laid out to conform as much as
possible to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit
efficient drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of
street necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
         D.   The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not
necessarily be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or
U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where such use will result in a more
desirable layout.
         E.   Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Commission such extension is not
necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the subdivision
with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of
adjacent tracts.
         F.   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provisions of alleys, truck, loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
      (4)   Blocks.  
         A.   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for two (2) tiers
of lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall
be permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways.
         B.   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed two thousand two hundred
(2,200) feet or twelve (12) times the minimum lot width required in the zoning
district, nor be less than four hundred (400) feet in length. Wherever
practicable, blocks along major arterials and collector streets shall be not
less than one thousand (1,000) feet in length.
         C.   In long blocks the Commission may require the reservation of an
easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage facilities, or
pedestrian traffic. Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than ten (10) feet
wide, may be required by the Commission through the center of blocks more than
eight hundred (800) feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or
access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other
community facilities. Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of such
length and width as may be determined suitable by the Commission for
prospective use.
      (5)   Access to Primary Arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Commission my require
that access to such streets be limited by one of the following means:
         A.   The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the primary arterials
and front onto a parallel local streets; no access shall be provided from the
primary arterial, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the
rear property line of such lots.
         B.   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops entered
from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street, with the
rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the major arterial.
         C.   A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary
arterial by a planning or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable
points).
      (6)   Road names. the sketch plat as submitted shall not indicate any
names upon proposed streets. The Commission shall approve the name of all roads
at the time of preliminary approval. The local postmaster shall be consulted by
the Commission prior to rendering its request to the Commission. Names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other road names in the
City so as not to cause confusion. A road which is or is planned as a
continuation of an existing road shall bear the same name.
      (7)   Reserve strips. The creation of reserve strips shall not be
permitted adjacent to a proposed street in such a manner as to deny access from
adjacent property to such street.
      (8)   Construction of roads and dead-end roads.
         A.   Construction of Roads. The arrangement of streets shall provide,
for the continuation of principal streets between adjacent properties when such
continuation is necessary for convenient movement of traffic, effective fire
protection, or efficient provision of utilities, and where such continuation is
in accordance with the Comprehensive Plan. If the adjacent property is
undeveloped and the street must be a dead-end street temporarily, the right-of-
way shall be extended to the property line. A temporary T- or L-shaped
turnabout shall be provided on all temporary dead-end streets, with the
notation on the subdivision plat that land outside the normal street right-of-
way shall revert to abuttors whenever the street is continued. The Commission
may limit the length of temporary dead-end streets in accordance with the
design standards of these regulations.
   (b)   Design Standards.  
      (1)   General. In order to provide for roads of suitable location, width,
and improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory
access to police, firefighting, snow removal, sanitation and road-maintenance
equipment, and to coordinate roads so as to compose a convenient system and
avoid undue hardships to adjoining properties, the design standards for roads
in Table 1 are hereby required. Road classification shall be determined by the
Commission.
      (2)   Excess Right-of-Way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. Such slopes
shall not be in excess of three to one.
      (3)   Intersections.  
         A.   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of two (2) new streets at an
angle of less than seventy-five (75) degrees shall not be acceptable. An
oblique street should be curved approaching an intersection and should be
approximately at right angles for at least one hundred (100) feet therefrom.
Not more than two (2) streets shall intersect at any one point unless
specifically approved by the Commission.
         B.   Proposed new intersections along one side of an existing street
shall, wherever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of such street. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has
separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where
streets intersect major streets, their alignment shall be continuous.
            Intersections of major streets shall be at least eight hundred
(800) feet apart.
         C.   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of two (2) local street
shall be at least twenty (20) feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection
involving a collector street shall be at least twenty-five (25) feet. Alley
intersections and abrupt changes in alignment within a block shall have the
corners cut off in accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe
vehicular movement.
         D.   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade wherever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a two percent (2%) rate
at a distance of sixty (50) feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line
of the intersecting street.
         E.   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developer shall cut such ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to
the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
         F.   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be three percent (3%) or less.
         G.   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as
determined by the Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the
applicant without reimbursement from the City. The sharing expense for the
construction of bridges not of primary benefit to the applicant as determined
by the Commission will be fixed by special agreement between the City and the
applicant. Said cost shall be charged to the applicant pro rata as the
percentage of his land developed and so serviced.
   (c)   Road Dedications and Reservations.
      (1)   New Perimeter Streets. Street systems in new subdivisions shall be
laid out so as to eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an
existing half-street is adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the
street shall be improved and dedicated by the subdivider. The Commission may
authorize a new perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates
the entire required street right-of-way width within his own subdivision
boundaries.
      (2)   Widening and Realignment of Existing Roads. Where a subdivision
borders an existing narrow road or when the Comprehensive Plan, or zoning
setback regulations indicate plans for realignment or widening a road that
would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant shall
be required to improve and dedicate at his expense such areas for widening or
realignment of such roads. Such frontage roads and streets shall be improved
and dedicated by the applicant at his own expense to the full width as required
by these subdivision regulations. Land reserved for any road purposes may not
be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the Zoning Ordinance
whether the land is to be dedicated to the municipality fee simply or an
easement is granted to the City.

   1343.12 DRAINAGE AND STORM SEWERS.
   (a)   General Requirements. The Commission shall not recommend for approval
any plat of subdivision which does not make adequate provision for storm or
flood water runoff channels or basins. the storm water drainage system shall be
separate and independent of any sanitary sewer system. Storm sewers, where
required, shall be designed by the Rational Method, or other methods as
approved by the Commission, and a copy of design computations shall be
submitted along with plans. Inlets shall be provided so that surface water is
not carried across or around any intersection, nor for a distance of more than
600 feet in the gutter. When calculations indicate that curb capacities are
exceeded at a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that
point, and basis shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water
drainage patterns shall be shown for each and every lot and block.
   (b)   Nature of Storm Water Facilities.  
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Commission to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist either
previously to, or as a result of the subdivision. Such drainage facilities
shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in perpetual
unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed in
accordance with the construction standards and specifications.
      (2)   Accessibility to Public Storm Sewers.  
         A.   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the specifications of the City Engineer or Building Official.
However, in subdivisions containing lots less than 15,000 square feet in area
and in business and industrial districts, underground storm sewer systems shall
be constructed throughout the subdivisions and be conducted to an approved out-
fall. inspection of facilities shall be conducted by the City Engineer.
         B.   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the City Engineer and the Commission, the
developer shall make arrangements for future storm water disposal by a public
utility system at the time the plat receives final approval. Provisions for
such connection shall be incorporated by inclusion in the performance bond
required for the subdivision plat.
      (3)   Accommodation of Upstream Drainage Areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
runoff from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The City Engineer shall approve the necessary size of the facility
based on the provisions of the Building Official/Zoning Officer and
specification assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
permitted by the Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   Effect on Downstream Drainage Areas. The City Engineer and/or
Building Official shall also study the effect of each subdivision on existing
downstream drainage facilities outside the area of the subdivision, City
drainage studies, together with such other studies as shall be appropriate,
shall serve as a guide to needed improvements. Where it is anticipated that the
additional runoff incident to the development of the subdivision will overload
an existing downstream drainage facility, the Commission may withhold approval
of the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of said
potential condition in such sum as the Commission shall determine. No
subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an
adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
      (5)   Areas of Poor Drainage. Whenever a plat is submitted for an area
which is subject to flooding, the Commission may approve such subdivision
provided that the applicant fills the affected area of said subdivision to an
elevation sufficient to place the elevation of streets and lots at a minimum of
twelve (12) inches above the elevation of the maximum probable flood, as
determined by the City Engineer. the plat of such subdivision shall provide for
an overflow zone along the bank of any stream or watercourse, in a width which
shall be sufficient in times of high water to contain or move the water, and no
fill shall be placed in the overflow zone nor shall any structure be erected or
placed therein. The boundaries of the overflow zone shall be subject to
approval by the City Engineer. Acres of extremely poor drainage should be
discouraged.
      (6)   Flood Plain Areas. The applicant shall comply with all requirements
of Article 1779 Flood Damage Prevention.
   (c)   Dedication of Drainage Easements.  
      (1)   General Requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by the
watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm
water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines
of such watercourse, and of such width and construction or both as will be
adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage
be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for
maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   Drainage Easements.
         A.   Where a topography or other condition are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least fifteen (15) feet in width for such
drainage facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines
and with satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the
plat. Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural
watercourse or to other drainage facilities.
         B.   When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be secured and
indicated on the plat.
         C.   The applicant shall dedicate either in fee or by drainage or
conservation easement of land on both sides of existing watercourses, to a
distance to be determined by the Commission.
         D.   Low-lying land along watercourse subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, whether or not included in areas for
dedication, shall be preserved and retained in their natural state as
drainageways. Such land or lands subject to periodic flooding shall not be
computed in determining the number of loss to be utilized for average density
procedure nor for computing the area requirement of any lot.

   1343.13 SIDEWALKS.
   (a)   Required Improvements.  
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated nonpavement right-
of-way of all roads as shown in Table 3.
      (2)   Concrete curbs are required for all roads where sidewalks are
required by these regulations or where required in the discretion of the
Commission.
      (3)   Sidewalks shall be improved as required in Article
1342 of these regulations. A median strip of grassied or landscaped areas at
least two (2) feet wide shall separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs.
   (b)   Pedestrian Accesses. The Commission may require, in order to
facilitate pedestrian access from the roads to schools, parks, playgrounds, or
other nearby roads, perpetual unobstructed easements at least ten (10) feet in
width. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.

   1343.14 UTILITIES.
   (a)   Location. All utility facilities, including but not limited to gas,
electric power, telephone, and CATV cables, shall be located underground
throughout the subdivision. Wherever existing utility facilities are located
aboveground, except where existing on public roads and rights-of-way, they
shall be removed and placed underground. All utility facilities existing and
proposed throughout the subdivision shall be shown on the preliminary plat.
Underground service connections to the street property line of each platted lot
shall be installed at the subdivider’s expense. At the discretion of the
Commission, the requirement for service connections to each lot may be waived
in the case of adjoining lots to be retained in single ownership and intended
to be developed for the same primary use.
   (b)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements centered on front lot lines shall be provided for
utilities (private and municipal), such easements shall be at least twelve (12)
feet wide.
      (2)   Where topographical or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities within the front lot lines, perpetual
unobstructed easements at least twelve (12) feet in width shall be provided
along side lot lines with satisfactory access to the road or rear lot lines.
Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
         (Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.15 PUBLIC USES.
   (a)   Parks and Recreation Areas.
   (b)   Other Public Uses.
      (1)   Referral to public body. The Commission shall refer to preliminary
plat to the public body concerned with acquisition for its consideration and
report. The Commission may propose alternate areas for such acquisition and
shall allow the public body or agency thirty (30) days for replay. The agency’s
recommendation, if affirmative, shall include a map showing the boundaries and
area of the parcel to be acquired and an estimate of the time required to
complete the acquisition.
         (Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.16 PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES AND AMENITIES.
   (a)   General. Existing features which would add value to residential
development or to the local government as a whole, as herein defined,
watercourses and falls, historic spots, and similar irreplaceable assets, shall
be preserved in the design of the subdivision.
(Ord. 89-11. Passed 8-21-89.)
   1343.17 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)   General. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is zoned for
commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivision with respect
to such land shall make such provision as the Commission may require.
   A nonresidential subdivision shall also be subject to all the requirements
of site plan approval set forth in the Zoning Ordinance. Site plan approval and
nonresidential subdivision plat approval may proceed simultaneously at the
discretion of the Commission. A nonresidential subdivision shall be subject to
all the requirements of these regulations, as well as such additional standards
required by the Commission, and shall conform to the proposed land use and
standards established in the Comprehensive Plan, and Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, th
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that the
street, parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed:
      (1)   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and
dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
      (2)   Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to
street, curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction.
      (4)   Special requirements may be imposed by the City with respect to the
installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and storm water
drainage.
      (5)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels backing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
      (6)   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.

1505.01 ADOPTION.
   For the purpose of prescribing regulations governing conditions hazardous to
life and property from fire or explosion, the West Virginia State Fire Code is
adopted, pursuant to West Virginia Code 29-3-5 or any subsequently adopted Fire
Code authorized by West Virginia Code 29-3-5, except such portions as are
deleted, modified or amended by this article. (Ord. 2019-05. Passed 4-15-19.)
 
1505.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)    Wherever the word "Municipality" is used in the City Fire Prevention
Code, it shall mean the City.
 
   (b)    Wherever the term "Corporation counsel" is used in the Fire
Prevention Code, it shall mean the City Attorney.
 
   (c)    Whenever "fire" is used in the Fire Prevention Code, it includes
flammable gas, toxic gas, corrosive liquids and decomposing chemicals.
(Ord. 2009-22. Passed 12-7-09.)
1505.03 BUREAU OF FIRE PREVENTION.
   (a)    The Fire Prevention Code shall be enforced by the Bureau of Fire
Prevention in the Fire Department of the City which is hereby established and
which shall be operated under the supervision of the Chief of the Fire
Department.
   (b)    The Chief of the Fire Department may designate such members of the
Fire Department as Fire Marshals in the Bureau of Fire Prevention.
   (c)    Fire Marshals assigned to the Bureau of Fire Prevention shall be
responsible for administration and enforcement of the Fire Prevention Code. The
prevention and extinguishing of fires and dangerous conditions related to fire
within the City of St. Albans will be promoted by granting limited powers of
arrests to Fire Marshals and Deputy Fire Marshals that meet all required
training as set forth by St. Albans Police Department and the WV State Fire
Marshals Office. Fire Marshals and Deputy Fire Marshals pursuant to this
ordinance are similar to those exercised by the State Fire Marshals Office
pursuant to WV Code 29-3-12.
   (d)    Fire Marshals and Deputy Fire Marshals on behalf of the Fire Chief
are hereby empowered to make arrests anywhere within the City of St. Albans of
any person charged with the violations of WV Code 61-3-1 thru 7 Arson Crimes,
Malicious Burning, Failure to Comply with Orders or Obstructing a Fire Marshal;
and when a witness to the perpetrations of these offenses, to make arrests
without warrant; or to make a limited detention of any person suspected of the
commission of these offenses for investigatory purposes.
   (e)    Fire Marshals and Deputy Fire Marshals are hereby empowered to make
complaints in writing before the Municipal Judge or other appropriate judicial
officer in order to obtain a warrant for such an arrest and procure a warrant
for the offender of the violations of Malicious Burning, Failure to Comply with
Orders, or Obstructing a Fire Marshal. Fire Marshals and Deputy Fire Marshals
may execute any summons or warrant issued by the Municipal Judge or other
appropriate judicial officer for the offenses of Malicious Burning, Failure to
comply with or Obstructing a Fire Marshal, upon the offender within the City of
St. Albans. Any return by a Fire Marshal or Deputy Fire Marshal showing the
manner of executing the warrant or summons has the same force and effect as if
made by a police officer.
   (f)    The Fire Chief, who is responsible for the enforcement of the Fire
Prevention Code, may revoke or rescind, at anytime any Fire Marshals
enforcement powers when, in the opinion of the Fire Chief, these powers have
been abused or improperly enforced.
(Ord. 2020-10. Passed 8-3-20.)
1505.04 ISSUANCE OF CITATIONS FOR FIRE AND SAFETY VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Issuance of Citations for Fire and Life Safety Violations. The Fire
Chief or any member of the Municipal Fire Department deputized by the State
Fire Marshal pursuant to West Virginia Code 29-3-12(j)) or member approved by
the Municipal Fire Chief, and who is properly qualified, may issue citations
for fire and life safety violations of the State Fire Code and as provided for
by the rules promulgated by the State Fire Commission in accordance with West
Virginia Code 29A-3-1 et seq., which State Fire Code, rules and regulations are
hereby adopted and approved as the Fire Code of the City, which occur or exist
within the municipal limits of the City, returnable to the Municipal Court of
the City; provided, that a summary report of all citations issued pursuant to
this section by persons deputized under West Virginia Code 29-3-12(j)) shall be
forwarded semiannually to the State Fire Marshal in such form and containing
such information as he may by regulation require, including the violation for
which the citation was issued, the date of issuance, the name of the person
issuing the citation and the person to whom the citation was issued. The State
Fire Marshal may at any time revoke the authorization of a person deputized
pursuant to West Virginia Code 29-3-12(j) to issue citations, if in the opinion
of the State Fire Marshal, the exercise of such authority by such person is
inappropriate. No person deputized pursuant to West Virginia Code 29-3-12(j)
may be authorized to issue citations unless that person has satisfactorily
completed a law enforcement officer training course designed specifically for
fire marshals. The course shall be approved by the law enforcement training
subcommittee of the Governor's Committee on Criminal Justice and Highway Safety
and the State Fire Commission. In addition, no person deputized pursuant to
West Virginia Code 29-3-12(j) may be authorized to issue a citation until
evidence of liability coverage of such person has been provided, and that
evidence of liability coverage has been filed with the State Fire Marshal.
   (b)    Violations for Which Citations May be Issued. Violations for which
citations may be issued include, but are not limited to:
      (1)    Overcrowding places of public assembly;
      (2)    Locked or blocked exits in public areas;
      (3)    Failure to abate a fire hazard;
      (4)    Blocking of fire lanes or Fire Department connections and;
      (5)    Tampering with, or rendering inoperable except during necessary
maintenance or repairs, on-premise firefighter equipment, fire detection
equipment and fire alarm systems.
      (6)    False Alarm of a Fire. No person shall make, turn in or telephone,
or by use of any means or methods of communication aid or abet in the making or
turning in of, any alarm of fire which he knows to be false at the time of the
making.
   (c)    Penalties for Violations.
      (1)    Any person who violates Section
1505.04 (b) of the City Code "Blocking of fire lanes," shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for a first offense violation, provided that the fine shall be fifty
dollars ($50.00) if not paid within ten (10) days of the citation, complaint or
warrant being issued, fined one hundred dollars ($100.00) for a second offense
violation which occurs within one year, and fined two hundred dollars ($200.00)
and/or imprisoned not more than thirty (30) days, or both fined and imprisoned
for a third offense violation.
      (2)    Any person who violates the State Fire Code, and/or rules and
regulations of the State Fire Commission which are adopted by this section to
be the Fire Code, rules and regulations of the City, other than blocking fire
lanes, shall be subject to the penalty provision of Section
1505.99 of the City Code.
      (3)    Each and every day during which any illegal erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, maintenance or use in violation of
said Fire Code, rules and regulations continues after knowledge or official
notice that same is illegal, shall be deemed a separate offense.
         (Ord. 2009-22. Passed 12-7-09.)
1505.05 ACCESS BOX(ES).
   The AHJ shall have the authority to require an access box(es) to be
installed in an accessible location where access to or within a structure or
area is difficult because of security. The access box(es) shall be an approved
type listed in accordance with UL 1037.
   WHEREAS, many properties are equipped with automatic alarm systems and/or
sprinkler/standpipe systems, and these automatic systems may cause the Fire
Department to be summoned at a time when the building or business is not

dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or welfare in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article.
   (b)    In order to make a determination regarding the classification of a
structure as unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous, or detrimental to the public safety
or welfare pursuant to this Article, and to determine and enforce the
appropriate remedy for any such structure, code officials shall be entitled to

1712.04 INSPECTION.
   For purposes of inspections performed pursuant to this Article, the
following rules shall apply:
   (a)    When a code officer lawfully enters the premises of the property or

that minimizes the inconvenience to the owner or person(s) in possession.
   (b)    Except in exigent circumstances and as may be permitted by law, the
code enforcement agency shall provide reasonable notice of the inspection to
the owner and request permission from the owner to enter the structure,
dwelling, or building.
   (c)    If the owner cannot be located after reasonable inquiry by the code
enforcement agency, or if the owner refuses entry, the code enforcement agency
may obtain an administrative search warrant from either the municipal court or
the Kanawha County Magistrate Court. Before issuance of an administrative
search warrant, a code enforcement agency officer shall be required to make a
sworn statement and prima facia case showing that the code enforcement agency
was unable to gain access to the structure, dwelling, or building after
reasonable and good faith efforts, and that there is a legitimate and

the owner can be located by a code officer, the code enforcement agency shall
provide the owner a copy of the administrative search warrant five days before
entering the structure, dwelling, or building. If there is a tenant or other
person in possession of the structure who is not the owner, and if such person
(s) can be located, the code enforcement agency shall also provide such person
(s) a copy of the administrative search warrant five days before entering the
structure, dwelling, or building.
   (e)    Any entry pursuant to this section shall be made for the sole purpose
of inspection of the structure, dwelling, or building for unsafe or unsanitary
conditions and not for the purpose of gathering evidence for use in any
criminal charge or proceeding unrelated to the unsafe or unsanitary condition
of the structure, dwelling, or building.
      (Ord. 2018-13. Passed 8- 6-18.)

the structure, dwelling, or building.
   (c)    Prior to undertaking the corrective action, the City will complete
the following procedural requirements:

action by the enforcement agency.
      (2)    The notice shall be served on the owner or landowner by
conspicuously posting and attaching a copy of the notice to the subject

the owner, a code enforcement agency officer shall subscribe a written
affidavit, to be maintained by the code enforcement agency for a minimum of two
years, that demonstrates the structure, dwelling or building falls within one

enter the property or structure, dwelling, or building for the purpose of
demolition or correction, along with the address of the property, the name of
the owner(s) and the date of the proposed action, as a Class II legal

date of the proposed action by the enforcement agency, and the last being no
later than twenty days before the date of the proposed action by the
enforcement agency.

noticed, by first class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the summons and
complaint. If the first-class mailing is not returned as undeliverable by the

been effectuated upon service of the summons and complaint consistent with this
subsection, the violation may be prosecuted consistent with state and local
law.

1760.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby established a vacant structure registration program and also
an uninhabitable structure registration program for the City of St. Albans.
(Ord. 2020-13. Passed 12-7-20.)
1760.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)    The City has determined that uninspected and unmonitored
vacant structures.
      (1)    Present a fire hazard;
      (2)    Are often utilized by vagrants and transients, (including drug
abusers and traffickers) as dangerous and unsafe temporary shelters;
      (3)    Detract from private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or
maintain surrounding structures; and
      (4)    Require additional regulation and services to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the public.
   (b)    Owners of vacant structures shall register such vacant structures
with the City, make payment of a fee as set forth herein, and otherwise conform
to the requirements of this vacant structure code. Owners of vacant structures
that are also determined to be uninhabitable structures in violation of the
Building and Housing Code and unsafe for occupancy shall be fined a separate
and additional fee.
   (c)    It is the intent of this article that, through a registration,
inspection, and monitoring process, and other improved public safety efforts,
vacant structures will be kept weather tight and secure from trespassers, will
provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in times of emergency,
will not impede private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain
surrounding properties, and will not otherwise present a public hazard.
   (d)    It is the City's further intent for the provisions of this article to
streamline and consolidate the existing procedure (that is, complaint,
research, notification, inspection, orders, fines, liens, appeals and lien
enforcement) by placing the responsibility to register and maintain a vacant
structure on the owner of such structure before a condition of the structure
falls into disrepair or otherwise necessarily warrants a complaint.

half the fee shall be deemed to have accrued upon the erection of an
advertising sign or advertising structure or the display of an advertisement

for each month during any portion of which any violation of this article is
committed, continued or permitted. The existence of any advertising copy on any
outdoor advertising structure or outdoor advertising sign or advertisement
inside incorporated areas shall constitute prime facie evidence that such
outdoor advertising structure or outdoor advertising sign or advertisement was
constructed, erected, operated, used, maintained or displayed with the consent
and approval and under the authority of the person whose goods or services are
advertised thereon. (1967 Code §15-9)

reasonable application.
      (1)   "Adjacent Property".  Adjacent Property includes any surface tract,
regardless of whether such surface tract is entirely within the City of St.

to the property that is the subject of the application for Floodplain Permit.
Adjacent property also includes all other property that may be affected by
flooding.
      (2)   "Adversely Affect Adjacent Properties".   To adversely affect a
property the increase in the elevation of the 100-year base flood elevation
must be more than 1 foot at any point. Stated conversely, if the effect is that
the 100-year flood base flood elevation rises 1 foot or less the property is
not "affected". This standard does not apply to the Floodway. If prior permit
(s) has/have been approved in the same area of the Floodplain, the above
definition would include the cumulative impact to the base flood elevation.
      (3)   Appurtenant Structure. A structure on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental and used for
storage only to the use of the principal structure. This does not include a gas
or liquid storage tank.
      (4)   Base Flood. Means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
      (5)   Base Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of the base
flood in relation to the datum specified on the County's Flood Insurance Rate
Map. For the purposes of this article, the one hundred (100) year flood or 1%
or greater chance of flooding in any given year. (see 100 year flood also).
      (6)   Basement. Any area of the building having its floor sub grade
(below ground level) on all sides.
      (7)   Certificate of Compliance.    A certification that the entire
development, including the elevation of fill or the lowest floor of a structure
is in compliance with all the provisions of this article.
      (8)   Compensatory storage. An artificially excavated, hydraulically
equivalent volume of storage within the special flood hazard area used to
balance the loss of natural flood storage when artificial fill or structures
are placed within the special flood hazard area.
      (9)   Contractor - W.Va. Code §21-11-3(c).  A person who in any capacity
for compensation, other than as an employee of another, undertakes, offers to
undertake, purports to have the capacity to undertake, or submits a bid to

demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, structure or excavation
associated with a project, development or improvement, or to do any part
thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structures or works in
connection therewith, where the cost of undertaking is two thousand five
hundred dollars or more. Contractor includes a construction manager who

also does not include employees of such corporation, partnership or sole
proprietorship.
      (10)   Critical Facility.  
         A.   Any facility in which even a slight chance of flooding is too
great a threat.
         B.   Typical critical facilities include hospitals, fire stations,
police stations, storage of critical records, and similar facilities. These
should be given special consideration when formulating regulatory alternatives
and floodplain management plans. A critical facility should not be located in a

to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30,
and A99. The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are
specifically listed or otherwise described in this article.
      (40)   Start of Construction. (The definition for start of construction
is to be used only when calculating the starting time for expiration of a
Floodplain Permit.)
The date the Floodplain Permit was issued, including Floodplain Permit for
substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the Floodplain Permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
Floodplain Permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual
start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
      (41)   State Coordinating Office. The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management.
      (42)   Stream. As defined in West Virginia Code §7-1-3u, any watercourse,

storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (44)   Subdivision.     Development that includes a creation of
individual land parcels for future sale. It does not include development where
rights-of-way or easements are obtained and recorded.
      (45)   Subject Property. "Subject property" includes the surface tract(s)
upon which the proposed development is planned and for which the Floodplain
Permit Application is submitted.
      (46)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-
related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10
year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the fair market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement".
      (47)   Substantial Improvement.  Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the fair market value of the structure
before the start of construction of the improvement. Substantial Improvement
also has a cumulative approach within the City of St. Albans which means the 50
percent threshold on improvements to a structure is combined and calculated
over a five year period.
This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation(s) of State or Local Health, Sanitary or Safety Code
Specifications which have been identified by the Local Code Enforcement
Official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
Any structure that has been determined to be a violation, the entire structure
must be brought into compliance before any additions or other alterations be
permitted to the structure.
Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would constitute a
substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all Ordinance
requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure. Documentation that a specific Ordinance requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur when the
first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the
building commences whether or not the alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (48)   Top of Bank.  The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of the bank. In the field a professional
familiar with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of the bank. When a
professional is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the
top of the first significant slope landward of the water's edge when it is
followed by at least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (49)   Variance.  A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
      (50)   Violation. The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this article. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation
until such time as the documentation is provided. No future improvements or
developments can be made to structures found to be in violation unless the
development is to bring the structure into compliance with the current
ordinance.
         (Ord. 2016-09. Passed 7-18-16.)
1779.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
City of St. Albans which are subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and
described in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of St.
Albans by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated 06-05-2012 or
the most recent revision thereof including all digital data developed as part
of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas which have been identified as flood hazard areas by
the City of St. Albans by use of historic or other technical data and shown on
an officially recognized "FIRM". These areas shall be designated as appropriate
with the level of technical data described below and shall be managed
accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The AE Area Without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (3)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided
      (4)   The AO and AH floodplain those areas identified as Zones AO and AH
on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by 1-percent-
annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and three
feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the City of St. Albans where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.   
      (2)   A City's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting
from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practical but,
not later than six months from the date such information becomes available, the
City shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific
data.
      (3)   The City of St. Albans may identify and regulate new flood hazard
or ponding areas. These areas shall be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map"
using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high water marks and/or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the structure location appears to be inside the SFHA on the FEMA
FIRM's and If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the Base Flood Elevation
specified in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS), the structure shall not be
required to conform to the flood prevention design and construction standards
or flood-related development codes in Article VI. Topographic data certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain
Administrator. The applicant shall apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
from FEMA and the determination given to the floodplain administrator within 90
days of issuance of the permit having the Special Flood Hazard Area designation
removed from the parcel or structure prior to certificate of occupancy/
compliance.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation specified on the Flood Insurance Study (FIS),
the site shall be considered to be within the Floodplain Area and the proposed
structure shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this
article.
   
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the County Commission
sitting as the "Floodplain Appeals Board". The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant/applicant.
(Ord. 2016-09. Passed 7-18-16.)
1779.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway. Within any Floodway Area (F1), no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property due to
their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the Floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (2)   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable Federal and State Law, Ordinances and
Regulations.
      (4)   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the City of
St. Albans floodplain coordinator, be determined to be the channel of the
stream and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the
special flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site
to the upland limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   AE Zone Without Floodway Area. Within any AE Zone Without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (c)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A). Within any Approximated Floodplain
Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
and adjacent properties including but not limited to existing buildings will be
reasonably safe from flooding using hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other
techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall
only be prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that
the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable Federal and State Laws, Ordinances and Regulations.
      (4)   Within any apportioned Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of St. Albans' Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent  property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. In addition prior to issuing the local permit the
Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from
those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of St. Albans floodplain
coordinator in writing that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or
relocated portion of the stream will be maintained. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate that the altered or
relocated portion of stream will provide equal or greater conveyance than the
original stream segment. If hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required,
they shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer, who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses and computations shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the use of certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of
bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream
crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may
include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings
to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in
flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1779.04 (d).
      (6)   When any watercourse alteration has occurred, the applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.
         (Ord. 2016-09. Passed 7-18-16.)
1779.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   General.  A Permit is required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified Floodplain, Floodway or other special

Assessor "Building or Real Property Improvement Notice".
      (7)   Approved by County Health Department for Well, Septic and other
permits to assure facilities are designed and located in compliance with the
flood damage reduction requirements of this article.
   (b)   Basic Format. The basic format of the permit shall include the
following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant.
      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed development is
to occur.
      (3)   Applicant shall provide names, addresses, and valid West Virginia
license numbers of all contractors working at the building site, or affidavits
stating that work is being performed by individuals exempt from contractor
licensing as set forth in Title 28, Series 2, section 3.9(b) of the West
Virginia Code of State Regulations or the most recent revision thereof, if
known at the time the Permit Application is submitted. If not known, applicant
shall provide the information within 14 days of execution of a contract with
its contractor(s) prior to beginning construction.
      (4)   A description of site location sufficient to locate the proposed
development including tax map and parcel numbers and most recent deed book and
page number.
      (5)   A standard site plan showing size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow, the
lowest adjacent grade to the proposed foundation and/or toe of fill, the Base
Flood Elevation and the location of the Floodway boundary when applicable.
      (6)   An acknowledgement that the applicant agrees to pay any and all
fees associated with the permitting process as set forth in Article VII
Sections
1779.07 (c) and (i).
      (7)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to allow The Floodplain
Administrator and authorized representatives of floodplain management programs
access to the development to inspect for compliance.
      (8)   The contract required by West Virginia Code of State Regulations,
Title 28, Series 4, and all addendums to the contract(s) shall be presented to
the Floodplain Administrator for review within fourteen (14) business days of
contract signing. The Floodplain Administrator shall keep copies of all
contracts or addendums and shall file "redacted" copies of the contracts and
addendums with the Clerk of the County Court in the Applicant's Permit
Application File. The Floodplain Administrator shall consult with the applicant
to redact proprietary and confidential information from the contracts and
addendums that are not otherwise public information. Failure to present
contract(s) or addendums for review shall void the permit. If a licensed
contractor is not involved, or the work is of an aggregate construction cost
value of less than ten thousand dollars including material and labor, a brief
written description of proposed work and the estimated value will suffice.   
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the methods of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, etc. When required by the Floodplain
Administrator, a registered professional engineer or architect shall prepare
the plans.
         D.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification. The
elevation certificate must confirm the structure in question together with
attendant utilities are elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
         G.   A Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that the area below the first
floor could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed
areas below base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement
shall state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of the
existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the purchaser through
notarized signature, a copy of all new Non-Conversion Agreements shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non-
Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator
shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1779.04 (d).
      (2)   All structures shall be flood proofed to two feet above the Base

      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include Base Flood Elevation data and shall
delineate the Floodway.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the Base Flood
Elevation.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
State and Local Water Resource Department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts
   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the Approximated
Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed
Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan
for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two (2) or five
(5) feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed
and the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled from the FEMA
map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.

entry and exit of floodwaters.
            2.   In addition, a Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement at
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of the Non-
Conversion Agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the
Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth
in Section
1779.08 (d).
      (4)   Recreational Vehicle Placement.  Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnected utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   Fill.  City of St. Albans officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the Floodplain Area serves in storage and transportation of water
during floods. Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is
discouraged and should be minimized.
Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area shall be
restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill shall
only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
currently accepted technical standards that the proposed fill will not result
in any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall consider
the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to the
subject property and adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and
adjacent properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst
topography, stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   A Fill Site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with pre-construction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
article and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in subsection 5 below. For non-residential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
         E.   At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25)
percent of the perimeter of a non-residential structure.
         F.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         G.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         H.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         I.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         J.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
can be issued. The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving said request and executing Form 1, "Overview &
Concurrence Form" or other form as may be required by FEMA.
         K.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of Structures and other development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         B.   In so far as practicable, structures and other development shall
be placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas wells and
well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100 feet from any
perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or wetland. [See
W.Va. Code §22-6A-12(b)]. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be
maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection at the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator the Flood
Protection Setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback Area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
      (9)   Storage
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with other State environmental agency(ies)
requirements.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within zones AH
and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
      (12)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area Floodplain Area.

with all applicable Federal, State and County laws, Regulations and Ordinances.
         B.   If the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not
comply with the Floodplain Permit Application, this Ordinance or that there has
been a false statement(s) or misrepresentation(s) by any applicant in the
permitting process, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a "Stop Work Order
Notice", revoke the permit and request a temporary injunction in the Circuit
Court of Kanawha County. The Floodplain Administrator shall notify any
appropriate agency or authority if the Floodplain Administrator finds a
violation of any non-Floodplain Law, Regulation or Ordinance.

      (1)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to occupy, or
to permit the use of occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this article. Occupying or
using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1779.08 (d).
      (2)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect
and approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until

construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing certificate,
or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a condition of the
Floodplain Permit approval process.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by City of St. Albans.
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this article shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to the City of St. Albans based upon a set schedule approved by the
City of St. Albans Council using the estimated value of the proposed
construction as determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing
City of St. Albans for any additional costs for services necessary for review
and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a permit is
required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to obtaining a
permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional fee is
intended to partially reimburse City of St. Albans for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.

requirement, or the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of
the Floodplain Appeals Board.
   (c)   Variances. If compliance with any of the requirements of this article
would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or
landowner, the City of St. Albans may, upon request, grant relief from the
strict application of the requirements. Considerations for the issuance of
Variances to this article shall adhere to the following criteria:
      (1)   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances.
      (2)   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the Special
Flood Hazard Area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,
shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance.

issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood
Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and (ii)
such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in this article; and
      (5)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all
decisions including justification for the decisions, and (ii) report such
decisions issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management

requirements or provisions of this article or direction or Order of the
Floodplain Administrator, or any other authorized employee of, shall be
unlawful and shall be referred to the Prosecuting Attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. All violations shall be a
misdemeanor. A violator shall, upon conviction, pay a fine to the City of St.
Albans Municipal Court of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or more than
five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. Each day during which
any violation of this article continues shall constitute a separate offense. In
addition to the above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved
including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of this article. The
imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or non-compliance with,
this article shall not excuse the violation or non-compliance with the article
or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or
remedy such violations or non-compliance within a reasonable time. Any
structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated in non-
compliance with this article may be declared by the City of St. Albans Council
to be a public nuisance and abated as such subject to other applicable laws and
exhaustion of appellate rights.
