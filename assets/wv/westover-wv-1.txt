EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the City Code into component codes,
chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the City Code.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the City Code. It indicates whether a given ordinance was
consolidated with another into one section or split into two or more sections.
Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably related to
material contained within a given article.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

of the person, or of the corporate officer, agent or employee contracting with
the City, shall render voidable by action of the City Council, any transaction

allowed for special meetings, nor for any committee meetings of the Council;
provided, however, that councilmembers shall receive their actual and necessary
expenses incurred in the performance of their duties. The Mayor shall not

by the City in any other capacity.
(Amended 2-6-12.)
   (b)   Conflicts of Interest, Penalties. No member of Council shall vote upon
or participate in the furtherance of any matter in which that councilmember
has, either directly or indirectly, a substantial financial or other

the City, any sale of land to or from the City, any lease to or from the City,
annulment of any street, or any special privilege or right which may inure to
the benefit of such councilmember directly or indirectly, except as such
privilege may benefit him or her generally as a citizen of the community.
   Any councilmember who willfully conceals such interest or willfully violates
the requirements of this section shall be guilty of malfeasance in office and
shall forfeit his or her office. Violation of this section with the knowledge
express or implied of the person, or of the corporate officer, agent or

Council, any transaction prohibited by the preceding paragraph. Removal of any
councilmember for violation of the provisions of this section shall be
accomplished in the manner provided by law for the removal of elected municipal
officers.
   (c)   Appointments and Removals. Except as otherwise provided for in this
Charter, neither the Council nor any of its members shall in any manner dictate
the appointment or removal of any City administrative officers or employees
whom the Mayor or any of his or her subordinates are empowered to appoint, but
the Council may express its views and freely discuss with the Mayor anything
pertaining to appointment and removal of such officers and employees.

who are subject to the direction and supervision of the Mayor solely through
the Mayor, and neither the Council nor its members shall give orders to any
such officer or employee, either publicly or privately.
   It is the intention of this subsection (d) that the Council shall act in all
matters as a body, and it is contrary to the spirit of this section for any of
its members to seek individually to influence the official acts of the Mayor,
or any other officer, or employee, or for the Council or any of its members to
direct or request the appointment of any person to, or his or her removal from,
office; or to interfere in any way with the performance by such officers or
employees of their duties, provided that the provisions of this subsection (d)
shall not apply to alter the provisions of Section

the Clerk.
   (e)   Council shall not appoint or otherwise establish permanent or standing
committees for the conduct of Council business.
SECTION 3.05. VACANCIES; FORFEITURES OF OFFICE; FILLING OF VACANCIES.
   (a)   Vacancies. The office of councilmember shall become vacant upon his or
her death, resignation, removal from office in any manner authorized by law or

exist whenever a qualified person has not been elected to a position of
councilmember under the provisions of this Charter.
   (b)   Forfeiture of Office. A councilmember shall forfeit his or her office
if he or she:
      (1)   Becomes physically or mentally incapable to perform the duties of

be filled by a majority vote of the remaining councilmembers, who within thirty
(30) days after the occurrence of the vacancy, shall appoint a qualified person
to fill the vacancy. Said appointee shall serve until the next regular City
election. At the next regular election the voters shall elect a person as
provided in Article
VII of this Charter to serve the unexpired term, if any. If Council fails to
fill any such vacancy within thirty days following the occurrence of the
vacancy, the election authorities shall call a special election to fill the
vacancy, to be held not sooner than 90 days and not later than 120 days
following the occurrence of the vacancy and to be otherwise governed by the
provisions of Article
VII. Notwithstanding the requirement in Section
3.11 that a quorum of the Council consists of four members, if at any time the
membership of the Council is reduced to less than four, the remaining members
may by majority action appoint additional members to raise the membership to
four.
SECTION 3.06. JUDGE OF QUALIFICATIONS.
   The Council shall be the judge of the election and qualifications of its
members and of the grounds for forfeiture of their office and for that purpose
shall have power to subpoena witnesses, administer oaths and require the
production of evidence. A member charged with conduct constituting grounds for
forfeiture of his or her office shall be entitled to a public hearing on
demand, and notice of such hearing shall be published in one or more newspapers
of general circulation in the City at least one week in advance of the hearing.
Decisions made by the Council under this section shall be subject to review by
the courts.
SECTION 3.07. CITY CLERK.
   Council shall appoint a City Clerk who shall serve at the will and pleasure
of Council. The Clerk shall be supervised by Council through the Mayor. Except
as otherwise provided in this Charter the Clerk shall have the power, and it
shall be his or her duty to:
   (1)   Give notice of and attend all meetings of the Council, keep the
journal of its proceedings, authenticate by his or her signature and record in
full in a book kept for the purpose all ordinances and resolutions of the
Council, prepare and keep up to date an index of all such ordinances and
resolutions, and keep all such records available for public inspection.
   (2)   Make and certify copies of any ordinance, resolution or order of the
Council whenever required to do so, and affix the corporate seal of the City to
any paper required to be sealed and to any certified copy of any paper, order
or preceding which he or she may make.
   (3)   Perform the duties of the City Treasurer. As such the Clerk shall keep
complete and accurate fiscal accounts and records as required by law or this
Charter and in the manner prescribed by the State Tax Commissioner and other
State officers having authority to prescribe therefor, and in accordance with
directives from the Common Council; and he or she shall render such reports as
may be required of him or her by law, this Charter or other ordinance,
resolution or order of Common Council.
   (4)   Prepare and cause to be served all notices required to be given to any
person, firm or corporation, and after the proper service and return of any
notice, to file and preserve the same. The Clerk shall issue all City licenses
and permits, except as may be provided otherwise.
   (5)   Except as may be otherwise provided in this Charter or by State law,
the Clerk, acting in capacity as City Treasurer, shall collect taxes, fines,
special assessments and other money due the City and shall receive from all
City officers and employees money paid to them for the City, and all City money
so collected or received by him or her shall be deposited promptly in the
depositories designated for such purpose by the Common Council. The Mayor and
such member of the committee on finance as the Council shall from time to time
designate shall sign all checks, drafts and warrants against the City treasury
or any depository of the City.
   (6)   Have custody of and keep available for inspection the permanent
records of the City and file and properly index all records of such City
officers and departments as the Mayor may direct.
   (7)   Perform such other duties as may be required of him or her by this
Charter, by general law, or by City ordinance or order of the Mayor not
inconsistent with this Charter or with general law.
   (8)   The City Clerk shall be permitted to delegate the ministerial
functions of his or her position but shall retain full responsibility for the
proper performance of his or her duties as set forth herein.
   It is the intention of this section that the Council shall have supervisory
power over the Clerk, but that such power be exercised through the Mayor. As
previously provided in this Charter, the Council is intended to act as one
body, and it is contrary to the spirit of this Charter for any of its members
to individually influence or direct the performance of the Clerk's duties.
SECTION 3.08. INVESTIGATIONS.
   The Council may make, or cause to be made, inquiries or investigations into
the affairs of the City and the conduct of any City department, office, agency,
board, authority or commission and for this purpose invite or subpoena
witnesses, administer oaths, take testimony and require the production of
evidence. A written report of the findings of fact shall be made to the Council
within a reasonable time of the conclusion of any inquiry or investigation
conducted under this section, which report shall be made a public record. There
may be deleted from such report any matter permitted by State Code to be
discussed in a closed or executive session provided that no such finding of
fact deleted from the report shall be the exclusive basis of any punitive or
disciplinary action, nor shall it be the basis for the denial of due process.
Any person who fails or refuses to obey a lawful order issued in the exercise
of these powers by the Council shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and punishable
by a fine of not less than $50.00 or more than $500.00.
   Inquiries or investigations under this section shall be conducted only at
meetings called especially for the purpose of conducting an inquiry or
investigation.
SECTION 3.09. IMPEACHMENT AND REMOVAL; PROCEDURE.
   The Council shall remove the Mayor or any member of Council from office for
acts of misfeasance, nonfeasance or malfeasance in accordance with the
following procedures:
   (1)   The Council shall adopt by affirmative vote of a majority of all its
members a resolution of impeachment which must state the reasons for removal

hearing, or at any time after the public hearing if he or she has requested a
public hearing.
      The accused shall continue to receive his or her salary until the
effective date of a final resolution of removal. The action of the Council in
suspending or removing the accused shall not be subject to review by any court
or agency.

shall be permitted to present witnesses and to each examine witnesses called by
the other. Additionally the accused shall be permitted to present such relevant

accounts and may provide for such more frequent audits as it deems necessary.
Such audits shall be made by a certified public accountant or firm of such
accountants who have no personal interest, direct or indirect, in the fiscal
affairs of the City government or any of its officers. The Council may, without
requiring competitive bids, designate such accountant or firm annually or for a
period not exceeding three years, provided that the designation for any
particular fiscal year shall be no later than 30 days after the beginning of
the fiscal year. If the State makes such an audit, the Council may accept it as
satisfying the requirements of this section.
SECTION 3.11. PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Meetings. The Council shall meet regularly at least twice in every
month at such times and places as the Council may prescribe by rule. Special
meetings may be held on the call of the Mayor or four or more members and,
whenever practicable, upon no less than 24 hours' notice to each member. All
meetings shall be public; however, the Council may recess for the purpose of
discussing in a closed or executive session limited to its own membership any
matter which is permitted by the State Code to be discussed in a closed or
executive session, provided that the general subject matter for consideration
is expressed in the motion calling for such a session and that final action
thereon shall not be taken by the Council unless the matter has been placed on
the agenda. No action shall be taken on any matter by Council except by vote
thereof in open meeting.

   (a)   Form. Every proposed ordinance shall be introduced in writing and in
the form required for final adoption. No ordinance shall contain more than one
subject which shall be clearly expressed in its title. The enacting clause
shall be "The City of Westover hereby ordains...". Any ordinance which repeals
or amends an existing ordinance or part of the City Code shall set out in full
the ordinance, sections or subsections to be repealed or amended, and shall
indicate matter to be omitted by enclosing it in brackets or by strikeout type
and shall indicate new matter by underscoring or by italics.
   (b)   Procedure. Any and all ordinances shall be adopted, in accordance with
the following requirements, except where different or additional requirements
are specified by law, in which event such other different or additional
requirements shall be applied.
   The Council may by ordinance specify other additional requirements for the
enactment of ordinances or may prescribe a procedure for the enactment of
ordinances in greater detail than prescribed by this Charter, but the Council
shall not, except in an emergency as specified in Section
3.14 or except as otherwise provided by law, lessen or reduce the requirements
of this Charter.
      (1)   An ordinance may be introduced by any member at any regular or
special meeting of the Council. Upon introduction of any ordinance, the City
Clerk shall read fully and distinctly the purposed ordinance in its entirety,
shall distribute a copy to each Council member, and shall file a reasonable
number of copies in the office of the City Clerk. Codes of technical
regulations need not be read aloud.
      (2)   A proposed ordinance shall be read by title at a second or
succeeding meeting of Council with at least two weeks intervening between each
meeting, unless a member demands that the ordinance be read in full at the
second or succeeding meeting. If such demand is made, the ordinance shall be
read in full as demanded, provided however that codes of technical regulations
need not be read aloud.
      (3)   A proposed ordinance which raises revenues for the Municipality or
imposes fees or costs shall be read by title at a third or succeeding meeting
of Council with at least two weeks intervening between each meeting, unless a
member demands that the ordinance be read in full at the third or succeeding
meeting. If such demand is made, the ordinance shall be read in full as
demanded.
      (4)   At least five days before the meeting at which a proposed
ordinance, the principal object of which is the raising of revenue for the
Municipality, is to be adopted, the Council shall cause notice of the proposed
adoption of said proposed ordinance to be published as a Class I-0 legal
advertisement in compliance with the provisions of Article Three (Section 59-3-
1 et seq.) Chapter Fifty-Nine of the West Virginia Code, and the publication
area for such publication shall be the Municipality. The notice shall state the
subject matter and general title or titles of such proposed ordinance, the
date, time, and place of the proposed final adoption, and the place or places
within the Municipality where such proposed ordinance may be inspected by the
public. A reasonable number of copies of the proposed ordinance shall be kept
at such place or places and be made available for public inspection. Said
notice shall also advise that interested parties may appear at the meeting and
be heard with respect to the proposed ordinance.
      (5)   The affirmative vote of four members of the Council shall be
required for the adoption of an ordinance.
      (6)   A proposed ordinance shall not be materially amended at the same
meeting at which finally adopted.
   (c)   The Council may adopt, by ordinance, building codes, housing codes, or
any other code of technical regulations dealing with general public health,
safety or welfare, or a combination of the same, or a comprehensive code of
ordinances. Before any such ordinance shall be adopted, the code shall either
be printed or typewritten and shall be made available to the Council at a
regular meeting, and copies of such code shall be made available for public
inspection. The ordinance adopting such code shall not set out said code in
full, but shall merely identify the same. The vote on adoption of said
ordinance shall be the same as on any other ordinance. After adoption of the
ordinance, such code or codes shall be certified by the Mayor and shall be
filed as a permanent record in the office of the Clerk, who shall not be
required to transcribe and record the same in the ordinance book as other
ordinances are transcribed and recorded. It shall not be necessary that any
such ordinance, either as proposed or after adoption, be published in any
newspaper, and it shall not be necessary that the code itself be so published,
but before final adoption of such proposed ordinance notice of the proposed
adoption of such ordinance and code shall be given by publication and public
hearing as herein provided for in Section
3.13(b)(4), which notice shall also state where, within the Municipality, the
code or codes will be available for public inspection.
   A copy of each adopted code of technical regulations as well as of the
adopting ordinance shall be authenticated and recorded by the City Clerk
pursuant to subsection
3.14(a). A copy of any adopted code of technical regulations shall be made
available by the City Clerk for inspection by the public.
   (d)   The City shall not, except in an emergency as specified in Section
3.14 or except as otherwise provided by law, have the power and authority to
lessen or reduce the requirements of this section.
SECTION 3.14. EMERGENCY ORDINANCES.
   To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or the public
peace, the Council may adopt one or more emergency ordinances, but such
ordinances may not levy taxes, grant, renew or extend a franchise, regulate the
rate charged by any public utility for its services or authorize the borrowing
of money except as provided in subsection
5.09(b). An emergency ordinance shall be introduced in the form and manner
prescribed for ordinances generally, except that it shall be plainly designated
as an emergency ordinance and shall contain, after the enacting clause, a
declaration stating that an emergency exists and describing it in clear and
specific terms. An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment
or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote
of at least five members shall be required for adoption. After its adoption the
ordinance shall be published and printed as prescribed for other adopted
ordinances. It shall become effective upon adoption or at such later time as it
may specify. Every emergency ordinance except one made pursuant to subsection
5.09(b) shall automatically stand repealed as of the 61st day following the
date on which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the
ordinance in the manner specified in this section if the emergency still
exists. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing

with appropriations duly made and unless the Mayor or his or her designee first
certifies that there is a sufficient unencumbered balance in such allotment or
appropriation and that sufficient funds therefrom are or will be available to

ordinance so reconsidered, to approve or reject it at a regular City election,
or at an election called specifically for that purpose, provided that such
power shall not extend to the budget or capital program or any emergency
ordinance or ordinance relating to appropriation of money or levy of taxes,
imposition of costs, fees or fines, or salaries of City officers or employees.
SECTION 8.03. INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM COMMENCEMENT OF PROCEEDINGS;
PETITIONERS' COMMITTEE; AFFIDAVIT.
   Any five qualified voters may commence initiative or referendum proceedings
by filing with the City Clerk an affidavit stating they will constitute the

filing it in proper form, stating their names and addresses and specifying the
address to which all notices to the committee are to be sent, and setting out
in full the proposed initiative ordinance or citing the ordinance sought to be
reconsidered.
   Promptly after the affidavit of the petitioners' committee is filed the
Clerk shall issue the appropriate blanks to the petitioners' committee.
SECTION 8.04. PETITIONS.
   (a)   Number of Signatures. Initiative and referendum petitions must be
signed by qualified voters of the City equal in number to at least ten percent
of the total number of qualified voters registered to vote at the last regular
City election.
   (b)   Form and Content. All papers of a petition shall be uniform in size
and style and shall be assembled as one instrument for filing. Each signature
shall be executed in ink or indelible pencil and shall be followed by the
address of the person signing. Petitions shall contain or have attached thereto
throughout their circulation the full text of the ordinance proposed or sought
to be reconsidered.
   (c)   Affidavit of Circulator. Each paper of a petition shall have attached
to it when filed an affidavit executed by the circulator thereof stating that
he or she personally circulated the paper, the number of signatures thereon,
that all the signatures were affixed in his or her presence, that he or she
believes them to be the genuine signatures of the persons whose names they
purport to be and that each signer had an opportunity before signing to read
the full text of the ordinance proposed or sought to be reconsidered.
   (d)   Time for Filing Referendum Petitions. Referendum petitions must be
filed within 30 days after adoption by the Council of the ordinance sought to

SECTION 8.05. PROCEDURE AFTER FILING.
   (a)   Certificate of Clerk; Amendment. Within twenty days after the petition
is filed, the City Clerk shall complete a certificate as to its sufficiency,
specifying, if it is insufficient, the particulars wherein it is defective and
shall promptly send a copy of the certificate to the petitioners' committee by
registered mail. A petition certified insufficient for lack of the required
number of valid signatures may be amended once if the petitioners' committee
files a notice of intention to amend it with the Clerk within two days after
receiving the copy of his certificate and files a supplementary petition upon
additional papers within ten days after receiving the copy of such certificate.
Such supplementary petition shall comply with the requirements of subsections
(b) and (c) of Section 8.04, and within five days after it is filed the Clerk
shall complete a certificate as to the sufficiency of the petition as amended
and promptly send a copy of such certificate to the petitioners' committee by
registered mail as in the case of an original petition. If a petition or
amended petition is certified sufficient, or if a petition or amended petition
is certified insufficient and the petitioners' committee does not elect to
amend or request Council review under subsection (b) of this section within the
time required, the Clerk shall promptly present his or her certificate to the
Council and the certificate shall then be a final determination as to the
sufficiency of the petition.
   (b)   Council Review. If a petition has been certified insufficient and the
petitioners' committee does not file notice of intention to amend it or if an
amended petition has been certified insufficient, the committee may, within two
days after receiving the copy of such certificate, file a request that it be
reviewed by the Council. The Council shall review the certificate at its next
meeting following the filing of such request and approve or disapprove it, and
the Council's determination shall then be a final determination as to the
sufficiency of the petition.
   (c)   Court Review; New Petition. A final determination as to the
sufficiency of a petition shall be subject to court review. A final
determination of insufficiency, even if sustained upon court review, shall not
prejudice the filing of a new petition for the same purpose.
SECTION 8.06. REFERENDUM PETITIONS; SUSPENSION OF EFFECT OF ORDINANCE.
   When a referendum petition is filed with the City Clerk, the ordinance
sought to be reconsidered shall be suspended from taking effect. Such
suspension shall terminate when:
   (1)   There is final determination of insufficiency of the petition, or
   (2)   The petitioners' committee withdraws the petition, or
   (3)   The Council repeals the ordinance, or
   (4)   Thirty days have elapsed after a vote of the City on the ordinance, or

finally determined sufficient, the Council shall promptly consider the proposed
initiative ordinance in the manner provided in Article
III or reconsider the referred ordinance by voting its repeal. If the Council
fails to adopt a proposed initiative ordinance without any change in substance
within 60 days or fails to repeal the referred ordinance within 30 days after
the date the petition was finally determined sufficient, it shall submit the
proposed or referred ordinance to the voters of the City.
   (b)   Submission to Voters. The vote of the City on a proposed or referred
ordinance shall be held not less than 30 days and not later than one year from
the date of the final Council vote thereon. If no regular City election is to
be held within the period prescribed in this subsection, the Council shall
provide for a special election; otherwise, the vote shall be held at the same
time as such regular election, except that Council may in its discretion
provide for a special election at an earlier date within the prescribed period.
Copies of the proposed or referred ordinance shall be made available at the
polls.
   (c)   Withdrawal of Petitions. An initiative or referendum petition may be
withdrawn at any time prior to the fifteenth day preceding the day scheduled
for a vote of the City by filing with the City Clerk a request for withdrawal
signed by at least four members of the petitioners' committee. Upon the filing
of such request the petition shall have no further force or effect and all
proceedings thereon shall be terminated.
SECTION 8.08. POWER OF RECALL.
   The qualified electors shall have the power to recall the Mayor or any
member of Council whether elected by popular vote or selected to fill a
vacancy, and may exercise such power by filing with the City Clerk a petition
signed by qualified electors of the City equal in number to at least twenty
percent of the registered voters at the last general municipal election. The
petition shall be signed and verified in the manner required for an initiative
petition, shall contain a demand for the removal of the elected official or
officials, and shall state with reasonable specificity those acts or conduct
constituting official misconduct, malfeasance in office, incompetence, neglect
of duty or gross immorality for which the removal is sought.
SECTION 8.09. ELECTION UNDER RECALL PETITION.

referendum petitions, certify to Council the sufficiency of the recall
petition. Thereafter Council shall cause a special election to be held in not
less than forty-five days nor more than ninety days from the date of such
certification. The published notice of such special election shall contain the
reasons for demanding the recall in not more than two hundred words and a
justification by the official sought to be recalled within the same limits;
provided, however, that if the petition seeks to recall more than one official
each official may provide a justification of not more than one hundred words.

of those voting on the question have favored recall, the office of the
individual so recalled shall be vacant. Provisions of this Charter with respect
to general municipal elections shall determine election procedure insofar as
applicable.
SECTION 8.10. FILLING VACANCY CAUSED BY RECALL.

resigns after a recall petition certified by the City Clerk to be sufficient is
presented to Council, the vacancy shall be filled in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.05 of this Charter.
SECTION 8.11. LIMITATIONS ON RECALL.
   No recall petition shall be filed against an officer within six months after

term. No officer shall be subjected to more than one recall election during a
term of office.
SECTION 8.12. RESULTS OF ELECTION.
   (a)   Initiative. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a
proposed initiative ordinance vote in its favor, it shall be considered adopted
upon certification of the election results and shall be treated in all respects
in the same manner as ordinances of the same kind adopted by the Council. If
conflicting ordinances are approved at the same election, the one receiving the
greatest number of affirmative votes shall prevail to the extent of such
conflict.
   (b)   Referendum. If a majority of the qualified electors voting on a
referred ordinance vote against it, it shall be considered repealed upon
certification of the election results.

adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is

   (a)   Definitions. "Commodities" means supplies, materials, equipment,
contractual services and any other article or thing used by or furnished to the
City or any of its departments or agencies, including printing and other
similar services.
   (b)   Powers and Duties of Mayor. The Mayor, acting by and with the advice
and consent of Council, except as hereinafter provided, shall direct and
supervise the purchasing for the City, and he shall have the power and duty to
purchase or contract, in the name of the City, for the commodities required for
the operation of the City.
(Passed 6-24-78.)
   (c)   Competitive Bids. The purchase of and contract for commodities shall
be based whenever possible on competitive bids; and the Mayor shall solicit
sealed bids for the purchase of commodities and services that are estimated to
exceed four thousand dollars ($4,000.00), such sealed bids to be solicited
either by advertising therefore or by sending requests by mail, fax or e-mail
to responsible suppliers and contractors. In the case of bids solicited by
advertising, the advertisement for such bids shall set forth the services or
commodities desired and the date and time for the submission of bids. All
sealed bids shall be opened at a regular or special Council meeting and Council
may on proper motion, either at such meeting or a subsequent meeting, reject
all bids or award such purchase contract. Any written contract entered into by
the City for the purchase of commodities or services shall be approved by
Council and then executed for and on behalf of the City by the Mayor and the
City Clerk.
(Ord. 363. Passed 11-21-11.)
   (d)   The Mayor may make a purchase of materials, supplies or services on
the open market without prior approval of Council when such purchase or service
does not exceed the sum of four thousand dollars ($4,000.00). Where any
purchase does exceed the sum of four thousand dollars ($4,000.00), the Mayor
must present such purchase to Council for approval.
(Ord. 362. Passed 12-5-11.)
   (e)   Awards to Bidders. All purchases of commodities and contractural
services shall be awarded to the lowest responsible bidder taking into
consideration the articles to be supplied, their conformity with the
specifications and the use for which the article is intended, and their
suitability to the requirements of the Municipal government and the delivery or
performance terms. Any or all bids may be rejected. If all bids received on a
pending request for commodities or services will have the same unit price or
total amount, Council shall have authority to reject all bids and to direct the
Mayor to purchase the required commodities or services on the open market if
the price paid does not exceed the bid prices. Each bid, with the name of the
bidder, shall be entered on the minutes of Council meeting and the successful
bidder, if an award is made, shall be so designated. If all bids are refused,
this likewise shall be set forth in the minutes of the meeting.
   (f)   Emergency Purchases on Open Market. The Mayor is hereby authorized to
purchase on the open market commodities or services for immediate delivery to
meet bona fide emergencies arising from unforeseen causes or acts of God. A
report of any such purchase or contract, together with a record of the
competitive bids upon which it was based, if any, shall be submitted by the
Mayor to Council at the next regular or special meeting thereof, together with
a full accounting of the circumstances of the emergency. Such report by the
Mayor shall be entered on the minutes.

other provisions of this section, the Mayor may, upon the recommendation of
Council, purchase from the government of the United States or the State
commodities, equipment or services by tendering aids therefor.
   (h)   Disposition of Surplus Commodities. With the consent of Council, the
Mayor shall have the duty and power to make disposition of commodities now
owned or in the future acquired by the City when any such commodities are or
shall become obsolete, unusable or unused, or in need of replacement. The Mayor
shall dispose of such commodities in the manner he deems most advantageous to
the City:
      (1)   By trading in such commodities as a part payment of the purchase of
new commodities;
      (2)   By sale thereof to the highest bidder at public auction; or
      (3)   By sealed bids after first having advertised the time, terms and
place of such sale once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of
general circulation in the municipal area:
   The Mayor shall have the authority to sell to the highest bidder or to any
one or more of the highest bidders if there be more than one, or if in his
opinion the best interest of the City will be served to reject all bids. The
proceeds of such sale or sales shall be deposited in the City treasury to the
credit of the fund or funds out of which the purchase of the particular
commodity was made, on a pro rata basis.
   (i)   Financial Interest. Neither the Mayor, the City Clerk nor any member
of Council shall have any beneficial personal interest, directly or indirectly
in the purchase of any commodities now in any firm, corporation or partnership
furnishing them. No member of Council, the Mayor or City Clerk shall accept or
receive from any person, firm or corporation to who a contract may be awarded,
by a rebate, gift or otherwise, any money or other thing of value whatsoever
nor any promise, obligation or contract for future reward. This subsection
shall not preclude the award to a bidder when such bidder is the lowest
responsible bidder in the opinion of Council, and a member of the Council or
the City Clerk is in fact a bona fide employee of such bidder. Any person who
violates this subsection shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction
shall be fined not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00).
(Passed 6-24-68.)

131.02 PROCEDURE FOR SELLING PROPERTIES.
   (a)   Real estate now owned or hereafter acquired by the City, not being
used for Municipal purposes, and which it may, from time to time, desire to
sell, shall only be sold in the following manner:
   Upon receipt of a written offer by the Mayor or City Clerk of a bid for any
property owned by the City which the City desires to sell, the Mayor, before
selling the same, shall first advertise by giving notice to the general public
in a newspaper of general circulation in the City, once a week for two weeks,

property in question has been received and that any person desiring to submit a
bid for such property shall have the opportunity to do so by submitting an
offer in writing to the City Clerk within fifteen days from the date of the
first publication. At the first regular Council meeting following the end of
the fifteen day period, all bids submitted on such property will be read in
open Council, at which time the highest bid for such property may be accepted
or rejected at the discretion of Council by a vote of the majority thereof, or
in the discretion of Council such bids so submitted may be continued to a
regular Council meeting not more than thirty days from the date of the meeting
at which such bids are submitted and during such period additional bids may be
submitted to the City Clerk and shall be presented to Council on the date to
which such matter has been continued, at which time Council may in its
discretion accept the highest bid for any such property or reject the same by a
vote of the majority of the Council present and voting.
   (b)   Upon acceptance of any bid in the manner set forth in subsection (a)
hereof, the Mayor will be authorized to execute a special warranty deed for
such property on behalf of the City.

   (a)   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official
traffic control device applicable thereto placed in accordance with the
provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person. Whenever a particular section
does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.
   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the traffic-control instructions of any

street or highway construction maintenance work, for the purpose of regulating,
warning or guiding traffic, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an
authorized emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
(WVaC 17C-3-4a)
313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)

railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
other part thereof.

   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this

subsection creating the offense requires a period of incarceration, period of
license revocation, or fine that is greater than what is required for a
conviction under this subsection, the greater period of incarceration, period
of revocation, or fine shall be imposed: provided, however, that this section
does not apply to a second conviction that is subject to a period of license
revocation under subsection (h) of this section.
   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions
under this section:

10-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and

second or subsequent offense, as described in subsection (h) or (j) of this
section, if the person has been previously arrested for, or charged with, a
violation of this section which is alleged to have occurred within the
applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No
person may be convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this section
unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:
provided, that the court may apply the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11A-
1 et seq. to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for
a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b
to persons adjudicated thereunder. An order for home detention by the court
pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B-1 et seq. may be used
as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation
of this section, electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten
days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not
leave home for those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.

suspended by the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles pursuant to
this section must complete a comprehensive safety and treatment program as set
forth in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3 before his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle can be reinstated and his or her driving privileges restored.
   (p)   For any offense for which an alternative revocation period is
permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the

CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM;
PROCEDURE ON CHARGE OF VIOLATION OF CONDITIONS.
   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,
without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, shall
defer further proceedings and impose probation, when:
         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:

commercial motor vehicles;

motor vehicle revoked for any offense under a municipal ordinance of this state

      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

time permitted: Provided, that this privilege does not mean that the vehicle
may park in any zone where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited or which
creates parking zones for special types of vehicles or which prohibits parking
during heavy traffic periods during specified rush hours or where parking would
clearly present a traffic hazard. To the extent any provision of any ordinance
of any political subdivision of this State is contrary to the provisions of
this section, the provisions of this section take precedence and apply.
   The parking privileges provided for in this subsection apply only during
those times when the vehicle is being used for the loading or unloading of a
person with a mobility impairment. Any person who knowingly exercises, or
attempts to exercise, these privileges at a time when the vehicle is not being

guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon first conviction thereof, in addition to any
other penalty he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined two hundred dollars

registration plate or removable windshield placard may not stop, stand or park
a motor vehicle in an area designated, zoned or marked for accessible parking
with signs or instructions displaying the international symbol of access,
either by itself or with explanatory text. The signs may be mounted on a post
or a wall in front of the accessible parking space and instructions may appear
on the ground or pavement, but use of both methods is preferred. Accessible
parking spaces for vans having an eight-foot adjacent access aisle should be
designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.
   Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (h)   All signs that designate areas as “accessible parking” or that display
the international symbol of access shall also include the words “Up to $500
fine”.
   (i)   No person may stop, stand or park a motor vehicle in an area
designated or marked off as an access aisle adjacent to a van-accessible
parking space or regular accessible parking space. Any person, including a
driver of a vehicle displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special
registration plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).

may issue citations for violations of this section and shall reference the
number on the vehicle’s license plate, since the driver normally will not be
present.
   (k)   Law-enforcement agencies may establish a program to use trained
volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or
otherwise shall go into the local authorities’ General Revenue Fund. Otherwise,
any moneys collected as fines shall be collected for and remitted to the state.

373.10 ELECTRIC BICYCLES.
   (a)   The operator of an electric bicycle has all of the rights and
privileges and is subject to all of the duties applicable to the driver of a
vehicle subject to this chapter, except as otherwise provided by this section
and except as to those provisions of this chapter which by their nature can
have no application.
   (b)   A person owning or operating an electric bicycle is not subject to the
provisions of West Virginia Code 17A-1-1 et seq., 17B-1-1 et seq., or 17D-1-

responsibility requirements.
   (c)   A person may not tamper with or modify an electric bicycle so as to
change the motor-powered speed capability or motor engagement between pedal-
assist and throttle-assist types of engagement. If a motor on an electric
bicycle is modified so that a limit established in Section
301.083 is exceeded, that vehicle is no longer an electric bicycle. The
provisions of this subsection are not applicable to a modified electric bicycle
operated solely and exclusively on a person’s own property.
   (d)   An electric bicycle must comply with the equipment and manufacturing
requirements for bicycles adopted by the United States Consumer Product Safety
Commission (16 C.F.R. Part 1512).

electric bicycle when the operator stops pedaling, or when the operator applies
the brakes and stops pedaling.
   (f)   A Class 3 electric bicycle must be equipped with a speedometer that
displays the speed the electric bicycle is traveling in miles per hour.
   (g)   Class 2 electric bicycles are permitted to use a throttle to propel

      (1)   Class 1, and Class 2 electric bicycles being used on roads and
trails where traditional, non-electronic bicycle use is allowed will be given
the same rights and privileges of a traditional, non-electric bicycle and will
be subject to all of the duties of a traditional, non-electric bicycle. This
rule intends to facilitate increased access to public lands that may otherwise
be inaccessible to those with disabilities, health issues, or age-related
limitations.
      (2)   A Class 3 electric bicycle may not be operated on a bicycle path,
multiuse trail, or single-use trail unless it is within a highway or roadway:
provided, that the provisions of this subdivision are not applicable to a
bicycle path, multiuse trail, or single-use trail if the municipality, local
authority, or governing body of a state agency that has jurisdiction over the
bicycle path, multiuse trail, or single-use trail expressly permits that
operation.
      (3)   Electric bicycles will not be given special access beyond what
traditional or non-electric bicycles are allowed. For example, electric
bicycles will not be allowed on roads or trails or in areas where traditional,
non-electric bicycle travel is prohibited.

the City Code section for which a penalty is imposed, the penalty imposed by
the City may be up to that penalty imposed by the State. (Ord. 310. Passed 7-
16-07.)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: See Section
303.99 for general Traffic Code penalty.)
   (a)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
303.99, any parent or legal guardian violating any requirement set forth in
Section
373.09(b) shall be fined ten dollars ($10.00) or be required to perform two
hours in community service related to a child injury prevention program which

community service. Notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code 8-11-1,
no court costs may be assessed to any person violating the requirements of
Section
373.09(b).

373.09(b), the court may waive the fine upon receipt of satisfactory proof that
the person has a helmet or within a reasonable time from the date of the
violation, purchased or otherwise obtained, a protective bicycle helmet.
   (c)   It is an absolute defense to a charge for a violation of Section
373.09 that a parent or legal guardian is unable to pay for the protective
bicycle helmet. Inability to pay may be demonstrated by the filing of a
financial affidavit in accordance with the provisions of West Virginia Code 59-
2-1(c). Any person who demonstrates inability to pay shall be referred to the
Governor’s highway safety program for assistance in obtaining the appropriate
helmet or helmets.

525.01 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
 
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
 
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
 
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
 
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
 
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
 
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
 
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

   No person shall cruelly ill treat, abuse or inflict unnecessary cruel
punishment upon, any infant or minor child, and no person, having the care,
custody or control of any minor child, shall willfully abandon or neglect the
minor child.
   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession.

are not limited to, the State, any municipal corporation, county commission and
board of education, or other political subdivision of this State or any person
or organization of any kind or character. The action may be brought in
magistrate or another court of competent jurisdiction. Recovery hereunder shall
be limited to the actual damages, based upon direct out-of-pocket loss, taxable
court costs, and interest from date of judgment. The right of action and remedy
granted herein shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any rights of
action and remedies therefor against a parent or parents for the tortious acts
of his or their children heretofore existing under the provisions of any law,
statutory or otherwise, or now so existing independently of the provisions of

526.01 DECLARATION POLICY.
   The City finds that unregulated parking of motor vehicles and other personal
property in grassy or otherwise unimproved areas of front and side yards, as
well as the use of unimproved driveways within front and side yards, causes
ruts, ditches, and mud holes that are unsightly and detract from the values of
other properties within any such neighborhood, and that the placement and
movement of motor vehicles and other personal property within grassy or
otherwise unimproved areas of front and side yards, creates potential danger to
the health, safety, and welfare of the general public. As a result, the City
finds it necessary to regulate the same through the adoption of this article.
(Ord. 346. Passed 4-19-10.)
526.02 DEFINITIONS.

the meaning respectively assigned to them by this section:

trailers meant for the hauling of items thereon, boats or other watercraft,
motor homes, campers, and vacation trailers. For the purposes of this article,
the term “boats or other watercraft” shall not include watercraft which do not
require a trailer to transport them.
   (c)   “Unimproved area” shall mean an area which has not been constructed
for the parking of motor vehicles and other personal property to standards
adopted by the City.
   (d)   “Improved area” shall mean an area which has been constructed for the

may be required to be replaced.
      (2)   Dirt, grass or other natural features are generally not considered
to be “improved areas”.
   
   (b)   Property owners are responsible for providing improved areas for the
required number of required parking spaces as set in Article 1308.
   (c)   Should there be any question as to whether any front or side yard
parking area or driveway meets the requirements of this article, it shall be
the duty of the City Building Inspector to examine the same and render an
opinion.
   (d)   Should any property owner allow an improved area to deteriorate to a
point where in the judgment of the City Building Inspector the area no longer
meets the intent and purpose of an improved area as described in this article,
the City Building Inspector shall inform the property owner in writing of said
deterioration and therein describe what needs to be done in order to correct
the situation.
   (e)   Any property owner who disagrees with the City Building Inspector’s
decision regarding their realty, within 10 days of receiving the City Building
Inspector’s written decision, may appeal the decision to the Mayor. The Mayor’s
decision in the matter shall be final.
(Ord. 443. Passed 10-2-17.)
526.06 TEMPORARY USE.
   The City recognizes that there may be isolated instances in which a property
owner might need to temporarily utilize unimproved areas of his/her front and
side yard or back yard for purposes otherwise prohibited by this article. For
that reason the provisions of this article shall not apply to the temporary
(less than 2 hours) parking a motor vehicle or utility trailer within the yard
for purposes of loading and unloading materials or equipment; nor shall it
apply to temporary parking of motor vehicles or utility trailers used in
conjunction with permitted construction or repair activities on the premises.
(Ord. 497. Passed 1-4-21.)
526.07 SPECIAL USE.
   Should a property owner or occupant of a structure desire to utilize a front
or side yard in a manner prohibited by this article, that individual shall be
allowed to file a written request for permission to do so with the Mayor.
Should the Mayor determine, based upon the particular facts applicable to the
request in question, that the request should be granted, the Mayor shall notify
the applicant in writing that his or her request has been approved. The Mayor’s
letter of approval shall set forth the specific date and time period for which
the exception to the parking requirements of this article will be allowed, and
additional conditions that may be deemed necessary.
(Ord. 346. Passed 4-19-10.)
526.08 OTHER CITY CODE SECTIONS.
   It is not the intent of this article to either eliminate or reduce any
additional requirements imposed by either the City’s Zoning Ordinance or
Building Code.
(Ord. 346. Passed 4-19-10.)
526.99 PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be
punished in accordance with Section
501.99(a) of the City Code. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a
separate offense and shall be punishable as such.
   (b)   As an additional remedy, nothing shall prohibit the City from seeking
judicial relief in the form of a restraining order or injunctive relief from a
court of competent jurisdiction in those cases in which a property owner
refuses to comply with the requirements of this article or a decision by either
the City Building Inspector or Mayor regarding the same.

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting. Such reasonable

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment

club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (c)   “Concealed” means hidden from ordinary observation so as to prevent

shall not be included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless the
knife is knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury
or death.
   (j)   “Metallic or false knuckles” means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or

   There is hereby levied and shall be collected by the City annual privilege
taxes against persons on account of business and other activities in the
amounts to be determined by the application of rates against the values or
gross income as set forth in this article.
   (a)   If any person liable for any tax under Sections
757.20 or
757.21 shall ship or transport his products or any part thereof out of the City
without making sale of such products, the value of the products in the
condition or form in which they exist immediately before transportation out of
the City shall be the basis for the assessment of the tax imposed in such
sections; provided, that no person shall be liable for any tax under the
provisions of this section for merchandise delivered from the place of
manufacture in this City to a warehouse or distributing point in another
municipality within this State, provided that such warehouse must be wholly
owned and operated by the person manufacturing such merchandise or manufactured
products in this City. The City Clerk shall prescribe equitable and uniform
rules for ascertaining such value.
   (b)   In determining value, however, as regards sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relations between the buyer and the seller is such that the gross proceeds from
the sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the
sale, the City Clerk shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for
determining the value upon which such privilege tax shall be levied,
corresponding as nearly as possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of
similar products of like quality or character where no common interest exists
between the buyer or seller but the circumstances and conditions are otherwise
similar.
   (c)   Gross income included in the measure of the tax under Sections
757.20 and
757.21 shall neither be added nor deducted in computing the tax levied under
the other sections of this article.
   (d)   A person exercising any privilege taxable under Section
757.20 and
757.21 and engaging in the business of selling his natural resources or
manufactured products at retail in this City shall be required to make returns
of the gross proceeds of such retail sales and pay the tax imposed in Section

resources or manufactured products at retail in this City. But any person
exercising any privilege taxable under Sections
757.20 or
757.21 and engaging in the business of selling his natural resources or
manufactured products to manufacturers, wholesalers or jobbers, and, in the
case of limestone, sand, gravel or other mineral product, to commercial
consumers, shall not be required to pay the tax imposed in Section
757.29 for the privilege of selling such natural resource products or
manufactured products at wholesale.
   (e)   Manufacturers exercising any privilege taxable under Section
757.21 shall not be required to pay the tax imposed in Section
757.20 or
757.29 for the privilege to selling their manufactured products for delivery
outside of the City, but the gross income derived from the sale of such
manufactured products out of the City shall be included in determining the
measure of the tax imposed on such manufacturer in Section
757.21. A person exercising privileges taxable under the other sections of this
article, producing timber or other natural resource products the production of
which is taxable under Section
757.20 and using or consuming the same in his business shall be deemed to be
engaged in the business of producing natural resource products for sale, profit
or commercial use, and shall be required to make returns on account of the
production of the business showing the gross proceeds or equivalent in
accordance with uniform and equitable rules for determining the value upon
which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as possible
to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like quality or
character by other taxpayers, which rules the City Clerk shall prescribe.
      (Passed 6-30-52; 2-18-91.)
757.03 COMPUTATION AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)    The taxes levied under this article shall be payable quarterly. The
taxpayer shall within thirty days from and after the expiration of each quarter
of the tax year make a return under oath to the City Clerk showing the gross
proceeds of the sales or gross income of the business, trade, calling,
profession or other activity or the gross income therefrom, as the case may be,
for such quarter and compute the amount of the tax chargeable against the
taxpayer in accordance with the provisions of this article. Forms for making
such returns may be obtained upon request at the office of the City Clerk. The
returns required to be made under this article shall not be open to public
inspection and shall be treated as confidential, and the City Clerk or any
other officer or employee of the City shall not disclose to the public, or to
any person, directly or indirectly, any information or data contained in such
individual returns, except as such disclosures may be deemed necessary by the
City Clerk to the enforcement of the provisions of this article, in the
punishment of violation thereof or in the investigation of any supposed
violation of such, and a failure to comply with the provisions shall be a
violation of this article and subject the violator to the penalties hereinafter
provided.
   (b)    The City Clerk, if he deems it necessary to insure the payment of
tax, may require the filing of a return and payment of the tax due by any
taxpayer under this article more often than each three months and other than
quarterly, especially where the City Clerk shall be of the opinion that the

liable shall be paid within ten days after the receipt of such statement. If
the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on the basis
of the tax so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately refunded to

funds available for the purpose. The taxpayer may, at his election, apply an

return made is incorrect or is so deficient as not to form the basis of a
satisfactory assessment of the tax, the City Clerk may proceed to investigate
and determine or estimate the tax liability of the taxpayer and make an
assessment thereof. The City Clerk shall give to the taxpayer written notice of
any assessment made pursuant to this article. Unless the taxpayer to whom a
notice of assessment is directed shall, within thirty (30) days after service
thereof, either personally or by certified or registered mail, file with the
City Clerk a petition in writing, verified under oath by said taxpayer or the
taxpayer's duly authorized agent, having knowledge of the facts, setting forth
with definiteness and particularity the items of the assessment objected to,
together with the reason for such objections, the assessments shall become and
be deemed conclusive and the amount thereof shall be payable at the end of the
thirty (30) day period. In every case where a petition for reassessment as
above described is filed, the City Clerk shall notify the taxpayer at least
twenty (20) days in advance of a hearing thereon to be held in Municipal Court,
and such hearing shall be held within sixty (60) days from the filing of the

return.

permits issued by the City in the event a licensee/permittee fails to file any
City tax return or fails to pay any delinquent taxes, fees or any interest or
penalty thereon due and owing to the City. The City Clerk has the authority to
deny and prevent any and all licenses and permit privileges to those persons
who are delinquent in paying taxes, fees or any interest or penalty thereon due
and owing the City. Each license or permit that has been revoked pursuant to
this section may be reissued upon payment of all delinquent taxes, fees or any

shall be an obligation of the taxpayer and shall be a lien upon all property
used in the business or occupation upon which such tax is imposed; provided,
that no such tax lien shall be enforceable on a bona fide purchaser (including
lien creditor) for valuable consideration without notice, unless recorded in
the office of the County Clerk. A finance fee of ten dollars ($10.00) or five
percent (5%) of the tax, whichever is greater, shall be added for any default

he may apply to Council by petition, in writing, within thirty days after
notice is mailed to him by the City Clerk, for a hearing and a correction of
the amount of the tax as assessed upon him by the City Clerk. Such petition
shall set forth the reasons why such hearing should be granted and the amount
of such tax should be reduced. Council shall promptly consider such petition,
and may grant such hearing or deny the same. If denied, the petitioner shall be
forthwith notified thereof; if granted, Council shall notify the petitioner of
the time and place fixed for such hearing. After such hearing, Council may make

a copy of such order to the petitioner. Any person improperly charged with any
tax and required to pay the same may recover the amount paid, together with
interest, in any proper action or suit against the City. It shall not be

any demand to have the same refunded to maintain such suit.

shall have continued sixty days, the City Clerk may proceed by himself or agent
in the circuit court of the county to obtain an injunction restraining the

right to occupy a hotel room as herein defined.

housing unit or any facility providing fewer than three hotel rooms, nor any

for a consideration, the term "hotel" shall, if otherwise applicable, apply to
such accommodations for the purposes of this tax.
   (d)   "Hotel operator" means the person who is the proprietor of a hotel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee,

required to relay the same, after notice of the order of Council, in the same
manner as provided by Section

905.15 SIDEWALKS REQUIRED WHEN BUILDING CONSTRUCTED OR STREET PAVED.
   (a)   Findings of Council. Council finds as a fact that sidewalks within the
City are deficient as to quantity and quality, which contributes to the hazards
confronting pedestrians and in order to initiate a program of providing more
sidewalks, it is declared to be the policy of the City to require, unless
otherwise directed, the construction or replacement of sidewalks for the use of
pedestrians within the City.
   (b)   Order when Street or Alley Paved; Exception. In furtherance of the
stated policy concerning sidewalks, Council shall order the construction or
reconstruction of a sidewalk or sidewalks at the same time that it orders the
paving or repaving of any street or alley, unless Council makes a special
finding in such paving ordinance that existing sidewalk or sidewalks are
adequate or the physical characteristics of the terrain, neighborhood or
pedestrian traffic would not warrant the construction or reconstruction of
sidewalks, in which event the construction or reconstruction of sidewalks in
conjunction with the paving of the street or alley shall be waived.
   (c)   Required when Dwelling or Building Construction; Exception. In
addition to the requirements of this article, any person who obtains a permit
to construct a dwelling or building pursuant to the provisions of this article,
the plans shall include the construction or replacement of a sidewalk or
sidewalks. Should there be an existing adequate sidewalk adjacent to the
property on which construction is to take place and it is so deemed by the
Mayor, then this section shall be inapplicable. In all other cases, a sidewalk
shall be constructed or replaced unless on appeal to the Mayor such requirement
is waived by appropriate order.
(Passed 1-12-87.)
905.16 PROPERTY OWNER TO LAY DOWN CURB WITHIN SIDEWALK AREA.
   Except where a curb is an integral part of a public street, Council may
order the owner of any property abutting on any public street within the City
to construct or lay down a curb within the sidewalk area as defined in Section
905.01. Such order shall designate the width, height and material to be used in
the construction of such curb. The Mayor shall cause notice of such order to be
served upon the owner of such property, such notice to be served in the manner
provided by the laws of the State for the service of notices generally, or by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation published in the County in
the manner provided by the laws of the State for the publication of notices
generally. (Passed 1-12-87.)
905.17 WIDTH, HEIGHT AND MATERIALS OF CURB.
   All curbs shall be of such a width, height and be constructed of such
material as Council may, upon recommendation of the Mayor, established by
orders duly made; and unless otherwise ordered by Council, the curbs on the
opposite sides of any street shall be of the same width, height and of the same
material, when possible.
(Passed 1-12-87.)
905.99 PENALTY.
   Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for any violation of this
article, where there exists a State Code section which has the same elements as
the City Code section for which a penalty is imposed, the penalty imposed by
the City may be up to that penalty imposed by the State. (Ord. 310. Passed 7-
16-07.)
   (a)   In addition to the lien created by Section
905.09, any owner, lessee or occupant who violates any provision of Section
905.11 or fails to comply with any notice given thereunder, shall be fined
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for the first offense and fifty dollars ($50.00)

      (6)   Service connection charge. An appropriate fee for connection of
service shall be charged to all new customers connecting to the sewerage
system, in such amount as may be established from time to time by the Common
Council of the City of Westover by appropriate ordinances and procedures.
      (7)   Alternate measurement of sewer. Customers having water use which
results in a substantial portion of the water purchased not being discharged
into the sanitary sewer system shall be entitled at the option and sole cost of
the customer to request the Sanitary Department to purchase and install special
meters to measure the volume of waste water discharged into the sanitary sewer
system. The customer shall advance to the Sanitary Sewer Department on demand
the Department's estimated cost of purchasing and installing the meter and upon
installation of such waste discharge meter the rates of such customer shall be
based upon the volume of waste discharged into the system rather than upon the
volume of water purchased by the customer.
   (d)   Schedule II.
   Industrial Service. The charge for the treatment of industrial waste will be
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
 
               Ci+(VoVi)-(BoBi)+(SoSi)
 
   Ci   =   charge to industrial user per year.
 
   Vo   =   average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume, in
dollars per gallon.
 
   Vi   =   volume of waste water from industrial users in gallons per year.
 
   Bo   =   average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Bio-Chemical Oxygen Demand
(BOD) in dollars per pound.
 
   Bi   =   weight of BOD from industrial users in pound per year.
 
   So   =   average unit cost of treatment (including sludge treatment) chargeable
total solids in dollars per pound.
 
   Si   =   weight of total solids from industrial users in pounds per year.
 
 
   When an industrial user is to be served a preliminary study of its waste,
the cost of transport and treatment thereof will be made. Waste containing
materials, which in the judgment of the Sanitary Sewer Department, should not
be introduced into the sewer system, need not be accepted by it. The results of
this preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of the
proposed sewer service and the charge therefor based upon the formula set out
above.
   Thereafter, industrial sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and at
the conclusion of each fiscal year based on the investigation aforesaid and
audit of the Sanitary Sewer Department’s records new cost figures will be
calculated for use on the above formula. The cost of establishing the
monitoring facilities shall be paid by the industrial user. Based on these
audited figures, additional billings covering the past fiscal year will be made
for payment by each industrial user or refund given by the Sanitary Sewer
Department as the case may be. Such audited figures will then be used for the
preliminary billing for the next fiscal year at the end of which an adjustment
will be made as aforesaid. (Ord. 522. Passed 5-16-22.)
925.04 TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
   (a)    If any sewer user's account for sewer user charges or related
services shall remain delinquent for a period of ninety days, the Sanitary
Sewer Department may terminate such sewer user's service in accordance with
West Virginia law.
   (b)    The Sanitary Sewer Department may use any legal means available to
collect such delinquent accounts and in the event that any costs or attorneys
fees shall be incurred by the City in the collection of such account. The City
shall be entitled to recover such costs and reasonable attorneys fees from the
sewer user.

this section, except that no activity shall be exempt from the management of
the discharge of sediment or any other form of water pollution that may leave
any parcel or site:
      (1)    Agricultural land management activities;
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing detached single-family
dwellings of a size less than 1,000 square feet; and
      (3)    Activities that result in impervious surface are of less than
3,000 square feet, regardless of the ratio of impervious surface area to total
site area. However, a phased construction project shall be measured by the size
of all planned or contemplated phases. Each phase may be required to meet the
requirements of this article.
   (d)    All new development and redevelopment subject to the provisions of
this article shall be required to obtain a stormwater permit unless exempted
under the provisions of Section
930.14(c). The Mayor/Westover Sanitary Sewer Board shall issue a stormwater

contrary to or beyond the intent of the objectives and policies included in
this article.
   (f)    Uniform requirements shall be applied to each regulated project site.
These requirements shall be based upon the criterion that post-development
stormwater peak runoff rates of flow must not exceed the pre-development peak
runoff rates of flow. In redevelopment projects, a peak runoff rate of flow
reduction of ten percent (10%) from the preexisting peak runoff rate of flow
must be achieved. However, no reduction shall be required beyond the peak
runoff rate of flow that would occur from the parcel in its natural,
undeveloped state.
   (g)    For construction that results in impervious area of 3,000 square feet
or more and less than 25,000 square feet, and if the ratio of impervious
surface area to total site area is less than seventy-five percent (75%), a
stormwater management and comprehensive drainage plan will be required in order
to qualify for a stormwater permit. The plan shall include the following
information:

this section upon a finding of inadequate erosion and sediment control
management practices upon a site or property subject to the provisions of this
section.
   (l)    All active construction sites shall be inspected by the owner no less
than weekly and within 24 hours after a 0.25 inch rain event to ensure and
verify effective erosion and sediment control. The owner shall maintain records
of these inspections. The Mayor/Westover Sanitary Sewer Board may halt
construction on properties that do not provide satisfactory proof of compliance

submitted to the Mayor/Westover Sanitary Sewer Board in a form that he/she
prescribes.
      (2)    The Mayor/Westover Sanitary Sewer Board may not waive the minimum
requirements for stormwater management of water quality protection.
      (3)    Any requirements beyond those described in any section of this
article may be waived by the Mayor/Westover Sanitary Sewer Board, if the Mayor/
Westover Sanitary Sewer Board finds that meeting the minimum on- site
stormwater management requirements is not feasible due to the unique natural or
existing physical characteristics of a site or that the property owner would
suffer an undue hardship if required to meet the full requirements of this
regulation. To be eligible for a waiver, the applicant must also demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the Mayor/Westover Sanitary Sewer Board that the waiver
will not result in any of the following impacts to downstream waterways:
         A.    Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams and other
structures;
         B.    Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         C.   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion; or
         D.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life and/or
property.
      (4)    Where compliance with the full requirements for on-site stormwater
management is waived, the applicant shall satisfy stormwater management
requirements by accomplishing a mitigation measure approved by the Mayor/
Westover Sanitary Sewer Board. Mitigation measures may include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Alternative means for on-site management of stormwater discharges
that have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been
approved by the Mayor/Westover Sanitary Sewer Board
         B.   The creation of appropriately designed and constructed stormwater
management facility or drainage improvements on other properties, public or
private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities. This alternative
facility must provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater
than that which would be afforded by the waived on-site practices and there
must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long-term operation and
maintenance of the off-site practice. The Mayor/Westover Sanitary Sewer Board
shall, to the maximum extent practical, ensure that the benefits arising from
the off-site practice shall be realized in the same basin/watershed as the
waived management practice.
         C.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the City or
the grant of an easement to the City, to be dedicated to preservation,
reforestation and/or the creation of green space, wetlands or permanent buffer
areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat.
         D.   Any mitigation measure shall provide a level of environmental
protection of the Mayor/Westover Sanitary Sewer Board approximately equal to or
greater than which would have been provided by the waived practice.
   (o)    Fee in Lieu of Stormwater Management Practices. Where the Mayor/
Westover Sanitary Sewer Board waives all or part of the minimum stormwater
management requirements, and the applicant does not complete an approved
mitigation project, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in lieu of
stormwater management practices in an amount determined by the Mayor/Westover
Sanitary Sewer Board. This amount shall be approximately equal to the cost of
stormwater management and based on the cubic feet of storage required for
stormwater management of the development in question. All of the monetary
contributions shall be credited to an appropriate stormwater capital
improvements program project and shall be made by the applicant prior to the
issuance of any stormwater permit for the development.

1111.09 HAZARDOUS WASTES.
   (a)   Findings.
      (1)   West Virginia Code 8-12-5 gives plenary power and authority for
municipalities to control and administer waterfronts and waterways; to prohibit
the accumulation and require the disposal of garbage, refuse, waste, ashes,
trash and other similar matters; to prevent injury or annoyance to the public
or individuals from anything dangerous, offensive or unwholesome; to protect
and promote the public morals, safety, health, welfare and good order; to
provide for the elimination of hazards to public health and safety and to abate
or cause to be abated anything which in the opinion of the majority of the
governing body is a public nuisance; and
      (2)   Council finds that permanent disposal of hazardous wastes within
the City is a nuisance in that it may depreciate property values; have an
adverse impact on the City's ability to attract new business and industry and
encourage expansion of existing business and industry; create a continuing
serious anxiety and concern among City residents and visitors concerning the
existence of a permanent hazardous waste disposal site within the City, all of
which are offensive and constitute injury and annoyance to the public and
individuals; and
      (3)   Council finds that prohibition of the permanent disposal of
hazardous waste will protect and promote the public morals, safety, health,
welfare and good order in the City.
   (b)   Definitions.
      (1)   "Permanent disposal" or "permanently dispose" means the discharge,
deposit, injection, dumping, spilling, leaking or placement of any hazardous
waste into, on, above, or below any land or water which waste is to remain or
which has remained at a disposal site within the City for a continuous period
of five years and which is not intended to be removed from such site.
      (2)   "Hazardous waste" means a waste or combination of wastes, which
because of its quantity, concentration or physical, chemical or infectious
characteristics, may cause, or significantly contribute to an increase in
mortality, or an increase in serious irreversible, or incapacitating reversible
illness, or pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or
the environment when stored. Provided, however, that hazardous waste shall
include only those whose disposal would require a state or federal hazardous
waste permit.
      (3)   "Person" means any individual, trust, firm, joint stock company,
public or private or governmental corporation, partnership, association, state
or federal agency.
      (4)   "Storage" means the otherwise local containment of hazardous wastes
which wastes are not intended to be permanently disposed of at any site within
the City.
      (5)   "Waste" means any garbage, refuse, sludge, or other discarded
material including solid, liquid, semisolid or containing gaseous material
resulting from industrial or commercial mining or agricultural operations, but
does not include solid or dissolved material in domestic sewage.
   (c)   Prohibition.
      (1)   No person shall permanently dispose or attempt to permanently
dispose hazardous waste within the City. Provided, however, that storage of
hazardous wastes by duly licensed and tax paying enterprises shall not be
prohibited.
      (2)   No person shall permanently dispose or attempt to permanently
dispose of any material, including but not limited to clothing, that contains
any hazardous waste residue, into the City's sanitation system.
   (d)   Nuisance. In the event any person shall dispose or establish a site
for the permanent disposal of hazardous waste in violation of the provisions of
this article, the City Attorney is authorized, upon instructions from the
Mayor, in addition to other penalties set forth herein, to institute any
appropriate civil action or proceedings to prevent such disposal of hazardous
waste, the same being deemed a public nuisance.
   (e)   Safeguards. Any person operating any facility in the City which
produces any hazardous waste shall take adequate means to safeguard the public
from exposure to such hazardous wastes including the prevention of entry onto
the facility grounds by children. Such measure shall include fencing where
appropriate. However, a person shall not be required to provide safeguards that
are not required by Title 42, Sec. 6921 et seq., of the United States Code and
the Rules and Regulations promulgated thereunder.
   (f)   Penalties. Any person who shall violates a provision of this article
or fails to comply with any of the requirements hereof shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars. Each
day that a violation continues or has not been totally abated, shall be deemed
a separate offense.

and vermin from being drawn or attracted to that area. Any person or business
violating this ordinance may be subject to a fine of up to five hundred dollars
($500.00) and court costs. Each day any such violation continues shall
constitute a separate offense.
   (c)   Every property owner and their tenants who use dumpsters on their
premises shall be jointly responsible and liable for all duties and penalties
imposed by this statute.

1303.05 PERMITTED LAND USES.
   The table and supplemental regulations of the Permitted Land Use Table are
incorporated in this section and are adopted as the basic land use regulations
for the City. The table and supplemental regulations identify the types of land
uses that are permitted within the City and any applicable conditions and
limitations.
   To determine the zone(s) in which a particular use is allowed, find the use
in the list of uses along the left-hand side of the Permitted Land Use Table
and read across the use row to find the zone column designations.
   Legend:
      P   Use is permitted by right in a particular zone; a permit is required.
      C   Use is allowed only as a conditional use in a particular zone subject
to the limitations and conditions specified; permit is required.
   The uses listed in the Permitted Land Use Table are defined in the
Definitions Section
1302.02.
   A description of the supplemental regulations immediately follows the

1303.06 SUPPLEMENTAL REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO LAND USE TABLE.
   (A)   This use is designed to be an accessory (and not a primary use) of the
property.
   (S)   This land use is meant to be treated separately from any other land
use that might be occurring on the property.
   (1)   All storage associated with any such use or establishment shall be
indoors in the R1 and R2 Districts (if the listed use or establishment is
permitted in that district). It is a conditional use in R3/C Districts,
requiring approval (if the listed use or establishment is permitted in that
district). Outdoor storage is permitted in an Industrial District, subject to
appropriate City, State, and federal rules, regulations, ordinances, and laws
(if the listed use or establishment is permitted in that district).
   (2)   All activities associated with any such a use or establishment shall
be indoors in the R1, R2, and R3/C Districts (if the listed establishment or
use is permitted in that district). Outdoor activities are permitted in an
Industrial District, subject to appropriate City, state, and federal rules,
regulations, ordinances, and laws (if the listed establishment or use is
permitted in that district).
(Ord. 406. Passed 3-2-15.)
   (3)   All establishments that serve on-premises alcohol shall comply with
the following:
      (a)    A private club which is permitted to sell liquor, beer and wine,
and which is located in the R-3/C District, shall have as its principal purpose
of business serving meals, on its premises to its patrons and to members of the
club and their guests. For the purposes of this section, the term "meal" shall
not include the serving of packaged potato chips and similar products; packaged
crackers; packaged nuts; packaged desserts; and bar sausages and similar
products in accordance with the State of West Virginia as defined in its
Legislative Rules and Regulations pertaining to Private Club Licenses.
      (b)    In the R-3/C District, no applicant may be licensed as a private
club under a conditional use which has not been in operation for at least one
year as a restaurant before applying for a conditional use. However, if the
applicant owns a similar restaurant as the one being proposed, the Board of
Zoning Appeals may consider this as meeting this requirement.
      (c)    In the R-3/C District, a hotel, convention/conference center which
serves meals and services to private functions shall be exempt from the
requirements of this subsection when liquors are served only in an area of the
building accessible from an internal part of the building. A hotel's bar
facilities may serve to the general public after 9 p.m.
      (d)    Food and non-alcoholic beverages shall comprise a minimum of 50
percent of the total gross sales of all food and drink items each calendar
month.
      (e)    Private clubs shall provide a seating capacity for at least 50
people, at a table or counter maintained for the principal purpose of serving
meals. Seats at a bar, which is primarily serving alcoholic beverages, shall
not be counted as meeting the minimum seating capacity of the establishment.
Liquor may be served either at seats intended primarily for dining, or at any
bar area within the restaurant, with or without an accompanying meal.
      (f)    Liquor shall not be served later than 1:00 a.m., except on New
Year's Eve.
      (g)    The private club licensee shall, at the time of each sale or at
the time of payment, record the amount of revenue derived from the sale of
liquor and alcoholic beverages separately from the amount of revenue derived
from the sale of food and nonalcoholic beverages.
      (h)    During each calendar month, the club licensee shall maintain and
preserve accurate records to prove compliance to the City's Finance Director.
All records required from paragraph (g) hereof, above shall be made available
for review and audit if requested by the Director. The records for each month
shall be preserved for not less than 24 months.
      (i)    Quarterly, the private club licensee shall send to the City
Finance Director summaries showing the amount of revenue derived from liquor
and alcoholic beverages versus the amount derived from the sale of food and
non-alcoholic beverages.
      (j)   The specific locations at which private club licenses existing in
the R-3/C District on the date of this Ordinance shall become legal non-
conforming uses and subject to the requirement of this Ordinance.
      (k)    Existing non-conforming uses of private clubs in the R-3/
C District may apply to become approved conditional uses under the requirements
of this Ordinance.
   [These rules are mostly for private clubs. The note can be carried over Brew
Pub, if desired. Also, the supplemental regulations probably need to be checked
against state law, which has changed with regard to alcohol sales, to ensure
there is no conflict - for which state law would take precedence.] (Ord. 507.
Passed 10-4-21.)
   (3a)   A Full-Service Hotel or Full-Service Motel with ten (10) or more
separate guest rooms that also has an accessory restaurant within the same

Appeals.
         (1)    The following regulations apply to both classes of home
occupations:
            A.    A home occupation shall be compatible with residential uses
of the dwelling, shall not change the residential character of the dwelling,
and shall not detract from the residential character of the neighborhood.
            B.    A home occupation shall produce no detectable fumes, odors,
dust, heat, noise, vibration, glare, electro-magnetic field, electrical
interference or other effects outside the dwelling, including transmittal
through vertical or horizontal party walls.
            C.    A home occupation shall not require fixed installation of
equipment or machinery that substantially changes the residential character of
the dwelling.
            D.    A home occupation shall occupy not more than twenty-five (25)
percent of the floor area of the principal structure, and shall not require
internal or external alterations or construction features not customary to a
residential dwelling.
            E.    A home occupation shall be conducted entirely within the
principal building. No home occupation shall be conducted outdoors or in any
accessory building or garage, except that parking of a vehicle used in
conducting the business and/or simple storage of materials or goods used in
association with the business may be permitted in such buildings.
            F.   Vehicles used in association with the business cannot exceed
6,000 lbs. gross vehicle weight. Trailers used to transport equipment, goods
and materials used in association with the business cannot exceed sixteen (16)
feet in length, measured from the tongue to the farthest rear extension of the

            G.    Except as required by State law, there shall be no exterior
indication of the home occupation, no exterior signs, nor any other on-site
advertising visible from the exterior.
            H.    A home occupation shall not involve on-site employment of
persons not residing in the dwelling, except as otherwise provided in this
Ordinance.
            I.    A home occupation shall register as a business with the City

            J.    If the applicant is not the owner of the property at which
the home occupation will be conducted, the applicant must verify that written
notice of intention to conduct the home occupation has been given to the owner
of the property, and the application shall be accompanied by a copy of the
letter by which notice was provided to the owner of the property.
            K.    No sexually oriented business, as defined herein, may be
permitted as a home occupation.
            L.    Merchandise delivery and/or pick-ups to and from the premises
that are associated with the home occupation, and that utilize a commercial
delivery service or the United States Postal Service, shall not exceed two (2)
per day.
         (2)    The following regulations apply to Home Occupations, Class 2:
            A.    If any resident living within 300 feet of a Home Occupation,
Class 2 believes that it is being conducted in violation of the imposed
conditions or believes that the home occupation is detracting from the
residential character of the neighborhood, the resident can submit a petition
for revocation of the conditional use permit. If the Planning Commission is
unable to resolve the problem informally, it will be placed on the agenda of
the Board of Zoning Appeals for a public hearing. On the basis of evidence
introduced at this hearing, the Board may suspend or revoke the conditional use
permit temporarily or permanently, or impose additional restrictions on the
conduct of the business.
            B.    After a Home Occupation, Class 2 conditional use permit is
granted, if the holder of the permit wishes to make any change in the conduct
of the business that departs from the description in the application or from
any other conditions or restrictions imposed by Board of Zoning Appeals, the
holder of the permit must obtain prior permission of the Board on the basis of
a new application.
            C.    Retail sales shall not occur on the premises on a regular
basis or in substantial volume, such that customer visitation to the premises
exceeds three (3) customers per day. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall decide
if the proposed type and volume of retail activities is reasonable when
considering the conditional use permit application.
            D.   The application for a Home Occupation, Class 2 conditional use
permit must be filled out completely, or the application shall be deemed to be
incomplete and shall not be considered by the Board of Zoning Appeals.

1307.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The purpose of the planned unit development is to encourage flexibility in
the development of land in order to promote its most appropriate use; to
improve the design, character and quality of new developments; to encourage a
harmonious and appropriate mixture of uses and/or housing types; to facilitate
the adequate and economic provision of streets, utilities and city services; to
preserve critical natural environmental and scenic features of the site; to
encourage and provide a mechanism for arranging improvements and sites so as to
preserve desirable features; and to mitigate the problems which may be
presented by specific site conditions. It is anticipated that Planned Unit
Developments will offer one or more of the following advantages:
   (a)   Serve to implement the goals, objectives, and strategies of the
comprehensive plan specific to where the PUD is to be located;
   (b)   Permit the application of current best practices in the design
principles to new development within the city;
   (c)   Promote development patterns that maximize compatibility of differing
adjacent land uses to avoid the necessity of extensive buffering;
   (d)   Enhance the appearance of the city by conserving areas of special
natural beauty, steep slopes, ecological importance, flood prone areas, and
natural green spaces where appropriate, while understanding that land within
urban areas is best suited for urban densities and development patterns;
   (e)   Counteract poor urban design and mitigate congestion on streets;
   (f)   Promote design principles that allow differing types of land uses to
coexist while preserving property values and minimizing potential negative
consequences; and
   (g)   Promote and protect the environmental integrity of the site and its
surroundings by providing suitable design responses to the specific
environmental constraints of the site and surrounding area.
      (Ord. 450. Passed 9-4-18.)
1307.02 REQUIREMENTS FOR PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   A Planned Unit Development is an area under single ownership or control to
be developed in conformance with an approved development plan, consisting of

development area, (2) a text which sets forth the uses and the development
standards to be met, and (3) exhibits setting forth any aspects of the
development plan not fully described in the map and text. The map, exhibits,
and text constitute a development plan. The uses and standards expressed in the
development plan constitute the use and development regulations for the Planned
Unit Development site in lieu of the regulations for the underlying district.
   (a)   The area designated in the Planned Unit Development map must be a
tract of land at least two (2) acres in size and under single ownership or
control. Multiple ownership is permissible provided that all owners are co-
applicants for the Planned Unit Development designation. In cases of multiple
ownership, covenants and agreements shall be executed that provide for the
identification of one person or corporation responsible for representing the
application and having the authority to act as agent for all owners for all
aspects of the Planned Unit Development process. Such agreements shall
accompany the application for Planned Unit Development designation.
   (b)   The Outline Plan shall indicate the land use, development standards,
and other applicable specifications of the Zoning Ordinance, which shall govern
the Planned Unit Development. If the Outline Plan is silent on a particular
land use, development standard, or other specification of the Zoning Ordinance,
the standard of the underlying district or the applicable regulations shall
apply.
   (c)   The Planned Unit Development map shall show the location of all
improvements. The location of Planned Unit Developments shall be designated on
the Zone Map and adopted pursuant to rules and regulations governing amendments
of the Zoning Ordinance.

improvements, construction standards, design standards, and all other
engineering standards adopted and enforced by the City and any other pertinent
regulations, except where specifically varied through the provisions of this
Section of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (e)   Landscaping and Screening Requirements.
      (1)    Within a PUD, screening, buffering, landscaping and preservation
of natural wooded areas shall be integral components of the overall plan.
Existing vegetation and new plantings shall be utilized to perform the combined
functions of:
         A.   Buffering between different land uses;
         B.   Facilitating storm water management and prevention of soil
erosion; and
         C.   Providing recreational opportunities and aesthetic benefits.
Topography, natural site features, earth berms, walls and fences may also be
utilized in the plan for vegetation and screening.
           (2)    Within the 10-foot perimeter setback of the entire PUD site,
a minimum five-foot wide landscaped buffer to serve as screening shall be
required (i) where any nonresidential PUD land use abuts a resident property
adjacent to the PUD and (ii) where any multi-family structure consisting of
more than four (4) units per structure abuts single-family structures adjacent
to the PUD.
   (f)   Designation and Conveyance or Ownership of Permanent Open Space.
            (1)    Improved Open Space is defined as parks, playgrounds,
swimming pools, ball fields, plazas, landscaped green spaces, and other areas
that are created or modified by man.
             (2)    Natural Open Space is defined as areas of natural
vegetation, water bodies, or other landforms that are to be left undisturbed.
Creation of a graded and surfaced walking trail through areas of Natural Open
Space shall constitute disturbance of the area in the amount of the length of
the walking trail multiplied by its width.
         (3)    At least thirty (30) percent of the total permanent open space
in any given Planned Unit Development shall be Open Space type. This includes a
minimum of ten (10) percent designated as permanent Open Space.
         (4)    Neither type of open space shall include schools, community
centers or other similar areas in public ownership.
            (5)    No plan for a single- or multi- family residential Planned
Unit Development shall be approved unless such plan provides for permanent
landscaped or natural open space.
            (6)    Permanent open space shall be allocated to the property in
proportion to the uses assigned to the Planned Unit Development and shall be
located within reasonable proximity (within one-quarter of a mile) to those
uses. Permanent open space need not be located in proximity to the use in the
case of preservation of existing features.
            (7)    If the Outline Plan provides for the Planned Unit
Development to be constructed in stages, open space must be provided for each
stage of the Planned Unit Development in proportion to that stage.
            (8)    Permanent open space shall be conveyed in or owned by a
city-owned or public corporation or to a nonprofit corporation or entity
established for the purpose of benefiting the owners and tenants of the Planned
Unit Development.
   (g)   Uses permitted in a Planned Unit Development may be any use that is
found in the Zoning Ordinance in any district, subject to the approval of the
Planning Commission and City Council. However, the City reserves the right to
require that a PUD consist of only residential uses when circumstances warrant.
Examples of such circumstances may include, but are not limited to: significant
infrastructure constraints that could cause practical difficulties in
supporting nonresidential uses, the character and land use pattern of
surrounding neighborhoods, and possible deleterious changes in traffic
circulation patterns in the immediate area. A developer may also initiate a
request to limit his or her PUD to residential uses.
   (h)   For purposes of determining overall project size, two or more parcels
of land owned by the applicant that are wholly or partially separated by a
public street or other right-of-way may be considered contiguous and thus may
be counted in fulfilling the minimum acreage requirement, provided that the use
and development of the property is incorporated into, and is an integral part
of the project plans; and provided that there is no other property not owned by
the applicant separating the parcels in question. Where there is uncertainty in
determining a parcel's qualification to be included in the PUD, the Planning
Commission shall resolve the issue and make a determination as to the project
boundaries, after considering the advice of the Code Enforcement Officer and
the request by the applicant.
      (Ord. 450. Passed 9-4-18.)
1307.03 PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL OF PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Introduction. Applications shall be accompanied by all plans and
documents required by Section
1307.02. A three-step application process shall be used. The steps in the
process are:
            (1) Pre-application Conference;
            (2) Outline Plan Approval; and
            (3) Development Plan Approval.
   (b)   Pre-application Conference. Prior to filing a formal application for
approval of a Planned Unit Development, the applicant shall schedule a pre-
application conference with the Code Enforcement Officer. The purposes of the
pre-application conference shall be to:
            (1)    Allow the applicant to present a general concept and to
discuss characteristics of the development concept in relation to adopted city
plans and policies.
            (2)    Allow the Code Enforcement Officer to inform the applicant
of pertinent policies, standards and procedures for the Planned Unit
Development.
            (3)    The pre-application conference is intended only for the
above purposes; neither the developer nor the City is bound by any decision
made during a pre-application conference.
   (c)   Procedure for Outline Plan Approval. Based upon the pre-application
conference, the applicant shall develop and submit an Outline Plan for the
proposed Planned Unit Development.
            (1)    The Outline Plan and application for the Planned Unit
Development shall be submitted to the Code Enforcement Officer who, after
certifying the application package to be complete, shall initiate a review of
the proposed development.
            (2)    The application and the results of the review shall then be
forwarded to the Planning Commission for its consideration, public hearing and
recommendations together with the Planning Department's report and such other
documents as may be pertinent to the Planned Unit Development.
            (3)    The Planning Commission shall hold a special forum at least
seven (7) days prior to the regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting at
which the formal public hearing will be held. The City will place an
advertisement in the newspaper specifying the time and location of the forum,
at least five (5) days prior to meeting.
            (4)    Where there are environmentally sensitive features on the
site or the Development Plan is expected to be complex, or there are other
important planning implications involved, the Planning Commission may reserve
the right to review the Development Plan. And, where the Planning Commission
recommends denial of an Outline Plan and the City Council approves the plan,
the Planning Commission shall review the Development Plan.
            (5)    Upon completion of its review, the Planning Commission shall
forward the application to the City Council with (a) a favorable
recommendation, (b) an unfavorable recommendation, or (c) no recommendation.
   (d)   Effect of Approval of Outline Plan:
            (1)    When an Outline Plan for a Planned Unit Development has been
approved by the City Council, the Plan shall become effective and its location
shall be shown on the Zone Map. The Zone Map shall be amended to designate the
site as a Planned Unit Development (PUD).
           (2)    Upon such amendment of the Zone Map, the use and development
of the site shall be governed by the Planned Unit Development Outline Plan,
subject to approval of a Development Plan.
            (3)    No permit of any kind shall be issued until the Development
Plan has been approved.
            (4)    Development Plan:
         A.   Purpose of Development Plan Approval. The purpose of the
Development Plan is to designate the controls for development of the Planned
Unit Development. The Development Plan shall show the exact location of each
building and improvement to be constructed and a designation of the specific
internal use or range of uses for each building.
         B.   Time Limit for Approval of Development Plan. The Development Plan
shall be submitted to the Planning Department not more than eighteen (18)
months following City Council approval of the Outline Plan. The Outline and
Development Plans may be submitted as a single plan if all requirements of
Section
1307.02 are satisfied. The Development Plan may be submitted and approved in
stages, with each stage representing a portion of the Outline Plan, at the
discretion of the city Planning Commission. The time limit for submitting each
stage for approval may be set forth in the Outline Plan, in which case that
schedule shall control the timing of development, rather than the time period
contained in this paragraph. The Planning Commission may extend the time for
application for approval of Development Plan for good cause, consistent with
the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance.
         C.   Expiration of Time Limit. Periodically, the Code Enforcement
Officer shall report to the Planning Commission on Planned Unit Developments
with time limits that have expired. The original applicants or current
developers of the Planned Unit Development shall be notified by the Code
Enforcement Officer. The Planning Commission shall determine whether to
consider extending the time or to initiate action to amend the Zone Map so as
to rescind the Planned Unit Development designation.
         D.   Relationship of Development and Outline Plan. The Development
Plan shall conform to the Outline Plan as approved.
         E.   Procedure for Approval of a Development Plan: The applicant must
have the Development Plan approved prior to issuance of any building permit.
            (i)   Development Plan Submission. The Development Plan and
supporting data shall be filed with the planning staff.
            (ii)   Review. The Code Enforcement Officer shall review the
Development Plan to include site plan review, in accordance with the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
            (iii)   Staff Approval. It shall generally be the responsibility of
staff to review Development Plans unless the Planning Commission reviews the
Development Plans, or where no Development Plan is required.
            (iv)    Planning Commission Review. If the Planning Commission has
retained Development Plan approval authority, the Planning Commission shall
hold a public hearing in accordance with its rules and regulations for
amendments. The Commission may (1) approve, (2) approve with modifications, or
(3) deny.
         F.   Expiration of Development Plan. The Development Plan shall expire
two (2) years after approval, unless grading and/or building permits have been
obtained and are still current and valid on that date. This rule shall also
apply to each stage of a Development Plan approved in stages. The applicant may
request, in writing, an extension of time, and the approving authority may
extend the time limit where deemed appropriate. Such extension may be
considered at the time of Development Plan approval.
         G.   Effect of Approval of Development Plan. No permit of any kind
shall be issued for any purpose within a Planned Unit Development except in
accordance with the approved Development Plan, and after acceptance by the City
of all required guarantees for improvement. (Ord. 450. Passed 9-4-18.)

         (Ord. 450. Passed 9-4-18.)
1307.05 REVIEW CONSIDERATIONS.
   In their consideration of a Planned Unit Development Outline Plan, the Code
Enforcement Officer, in a report to the Planning Commission, the Planning
Commission in its recommendation to City Council, and the City Council in its
decision, shall evaluate the project in light of as many of the following
objectives as may be relevant to the specific proposal:
   (a)   The extent to which the Planned Unit Development meets the purposes of
the Zoning Ordinance, the Comprehensive Plan, and any other adopted planning
objectives of the City.
   (b)   The extent to which the proposed plan meets the requirements,
standards, and stated purpose of the Planned Unit Development regulations.
   (c)   The extent to which the proposed plan departs from the zoning and
subdivision regulations otherwise applicable to the subject property, including
but not limited to, the density, dimension, bulk, use, required improvements,
and construction and design standards and the reasons why such departures are
or are not deemed to be in the public interest.
   (d)   The proposal will not be injurious to the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
   (e)   The physical design of the Planned Unit Development and the extent to
which it makes adequate provision for public services, provides adequate
control over vehicular traffic and promotes alternative forms of
transportation, provides for and protects designated permanent open space, and
furthers the amenities of urban ambience, light and air, recreation and visual
enjoyment.
   (f)   The relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to the
adjacent properties and neighborhood, and whether the proposed plan would
substantially interfere with the use or diminish the value of adjacent
properties and neighborhoods.
   (g)   The desirability of the proposed plan to the City's development, tax
base and economic well-being. At the discretion of the Planning Commission and
City Council, special consideration in the form of increased development
flexibility may be given to projects that are intended to rehabilitate or
replace dilapidated areas, brownfields, or other areas of general visual or
economic blight. Such special consideration shall not be granted to projects
intended for construction on lands that consist of 60 percent or more
previously undeveloped lands.
   (h)   The proposal will not cause undue traffic congestion, and can be
adequately served by existing or programmed public facilities and services.
   (i)   The proposal preserves significant ecological, natural, historical,
and architectural resources to the extent possible.
   (j)   The proposal will enhance the appearance, image, function, and
economic sustainability of the community at large.
   (k)   projects which are designed to a more human scale, support multi-modal
transportation options, preserve useful open space, provide significant
amenities to residents, and incorporate architectural detailing, massing and
scale that is consistent with historical community norms shall have a
significant advantage in the review process over those that merely seek to
maximize inappropriate forms of density, circumvent customary development
standards, or promote a pattern of development that can be generally recognized
as "urban sprawl," as defined in the definition section of the zoning
ordinance. Projects that fail to achieve these objectives will likely result in
a recommendation for denial by the Code Enforcement Officer or and/or Planning
Commission.
   (l)   The proposal makes reasonable accommodations in housing, recreational
amenities, and pedestrian facilities for individuals with disabilities.
   (m)   The proposal dedicates and provides a percentage of the total number
of dwelling units to be offered at sale or rental prices deemed affordable to
individuals of low and moderate income, as defined by the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development. Generally, between 3 to 5 percent of all units
should meet this goal.
   (n)   For PUD's containing only residential uses, clustering of units should
be utilized (and may be required by the City) in order to preserve meaningful
open space and/or recreational amenities for the residents. In addition, such
projects shall be required to provide a mixture of different dwelling types and
sizes. Examples of dwelling types include townhouses, row houses, patio homes,
zero lot line houses, single-family detached housing, apartments, duplexes,
condominiums, etc.
      (Ord. 450. Passed 9-4-18.)
1307.06 CHANGES IN THE APPROVED PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   Changes Requiring Outline Plan Approval. Changes which alter the
concept or intent of the Planned Unit Development including but not limited to:
            (1)    Significant increases in density;
            (2)    Significant changes in the proportion or allocation of land
uses;
            (3)    Change in the list of approved uses;
            (4)    Changes in the locations of uses;
            (5)    Changes in functional uses of open space, where such change
constitutes an intensification of use of the open space; and/or
            (6)    Changes in the final governing agreements where such changes
conflict with the approved Outline Plan.
   (b)   Changes Requiring Development Plan Approval. These changes shall
include the following:
            (1)    Changes in lot arrangement, or addition of buildable lots
that change approved density of the development;
            (2)    Changes in site design requirements, such as location of
required landscaping, signage, building height, architectural character, cube
and/or footprint, or other such requirements of the Zoning Ordinance;
            (3)    Changes to the internal street system or off-street parking
areas;
            (4)    Changes in drainage management structures;
            (5)    Changes in access to the development site, where such change
amounts to an intensification in the traffic patterns of roadways of
classification higher than local; and/or
            (6)    All other changes not expressly addressed under subsection
(a) shall require new Development Plan approval.

1308.01 PURPOSE.
   The regulations of this article are designed to alleviate or prevent
congestion of the public streets by establishing minimum requirements for on-
site storage of motor vehicles, in accordance with the use for which the
property is occupied.
(Ord. 318. Passed 2-4-08.)
1308.02 SCOPE.
   (a)   Off-street parking and loading facilities shall be provided and
maintained in accordance with the provisions of this section for all buildings,
structures or premises used in whole or in part for purposes permitted by this
Code.
   (b)   When the intensity of use of any building, structure or premises shall
be increased through the addition of dwelling units, floor area, beds, seating
capacity, or other unit of measurement, parking and loading facilities as
required herein shall be provided for such increase in intensity of use.
   (c)   For any non-conforming use which is hereafter damaged or partially
destroyed, and which is lawfully reconstructed, re-established, or repaired,
off-street parking and loading facilities equivalent to those maintained at the
time of such damage or partial destruction shall be restored and continued in
operation; provided, however, in no case shall it be necessary to restore or
maintain parking or loading facilities in excess of those required by this Code
for equivalent new uses.
   (d)   No building permit shall be issued, no use shall be established or
changed, and no structure shall be erected, enlarged or reconstructed unless
the applicant has presented satisfactory evidence via parking lot design, that
the off-street parking and loading spaces herein are provided in the minimum
amounts and maintained in the manner specified; provided, however:
      (1)   For the enlargement of a structure or for the expansion of a use of
structure or land there shall be required only the number of additional off-
street parking and loading spaces as would be required if such enlargement or
expansion were a separate new structure or use; and
      (2)   For a change in the class or use of a structure or land, the number
of additional off-street parking and loading spaces required shall be equal to
the number required for the new use, less the number of spaces which would have
been required for the previous use if it had been established in conformance
with this section; but in no case shall the total number of spaces furnished be
required to exceed the minimum required for the new use.
   (e)   Off-street parking or loading facilities in existence at the time of
the effective date of this article shall not hereafter be reduced below, or if
already less than, shall not be further reduced below the requirements for a
similar new use under the provisions of this Code.
   (f)   Nothing in this Code shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary
establishment of off- street parking or loading facilities to serve any
existing use of land or buildings, provided that all regulations herein
governing the location, design, and operation of such facilities are adhered
to.
   (g)   Off-street parking and loading facilities provided to comply with the
provisions of this Code shall not subsequently be reduced below the
requirements of this Code.
(Ord. 318. Passed 2-4-08.)
1308.03 GENERAL PARKING REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Off-street parking and loading spaces shall be provided on the same
lot as the use served or within 300 feet of said lot on a site approved by the
Mayor or designee. It may be situated as one or more individual areas. They
shall be paved with a hard surface.
(Ord. 518. Passed 5-2-22.)
   (b)   Parking space and related accessory uses are permitted in the required
front yard for commercial establishments in the Commercial (C) District.
   (c)   Off-street parking facilities required herein shall be utilized solely
for the parking of passenger automobiles or light trucks with not more than two
axles, belonging to patrons, occupants or employees of specified uses. Said
parking facilities shall not be used for the storage, display, sale, repair,
dismantling or wrecking of any vehicle, equipment or material, unless such
facilities are enclosed in a building and otherwise permitted in the district,
and unless such display is conducted upon stalls that are otherwise considered
surplus to the requirements herein.
   (d)   Loading and unloading berths shall be provided on the lot. They shall
be paved with a hard surface. (Ord. 318. Passed 2-4-08.)
1308.04 SURFACING.
   Areas used for off-street parking, loading, circulation or vehicle display
shall be surfaced with asphalt, concrete, masonry, or other solid paving
materials with sufficient strength to support the vehicle loads imposed. All
off-street parking and other vehicle circulation areas shall be continuously
maintained and designed to preclude free flow of storm water onto adjacent
lots, properties, or public streets or ways. In addition, existing non-
conforming graveled parking lots or parking spaces must be continuously
maintained so that dirt, mud, and gravel shall not be tacked onto adjacent
lots, properties, or public streets or ways.
(Ord. 318. Passed 2-4-08.)
1308.05 DETERMINING THE NUMBER OF PARKING SPACES REQUIRED.
   (a)   In determining the minimum required number of off-street parking or
loading spaces, the following instructions shall be applicable in such
computations:
      (1)   If the unit of measurement is any fraction of the unit specified in
relation to the number of spaces to be provided, said fraction, if less than
one-half or less than 0.5 shall be disregarded, however if the fraction is
equal to or more than one-half or more than 0.5, then the fraction shall be
considered as being the next unit and shall be counted as requiring one space.
         (Ord. 423. Passed 12-19-16.)
      (2)   In sports arenas and other places of assembly in which patrons
occupy benches, or other similar seating facilities, each twenty-two (22)
inches of such seating shall be counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of
determining requirements hereunder.
      (3)   In churches where worshipers occupy benches, pews or other similar
seating facilities, each twenty-two (22) inches of such seating shall be
counted as one (1) seat for the purpose of determining requirements hereunder.
In the special case of facilities where religious services are offered without
seating, the parking requirement shall be one (1) stall for each sixty (60)
square feet of the main prayer hall or room, exclusive of stages or raised
daises.
   (b)   Joint and Shared Use.
      (1)   The joint use of a parking lot for two or more separate but
adjacent buildings or mixed uses may be permitted as a conditional use provided
that:
         A.   The total number of spaces used is not less than the sum required
for various buildings or uses if computed separately.
         B.   The lot is the same zoning district as the principal use, or in a
district that permits commercial parking lots as a principal or conditional
use.
         C.   Each use of the shared spaces shall function as if having been
provided separately. In addition, a legal agreement shall be prepared by and
between property owners specifying the conditions for sharing and maintaining
said spaces, and such agreement shall be filed with the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals, upon recommendation from the Planning
Commission may allow a reduction of total parking requirement up to 25 percent:
         A.   If the applicant can satisfactorily demonstrate the parking
spaces will be shared with another adjacent land use and the lack of overlap
between the peak parking needs of the land uses justify such a reduction; and,
         B.   The applicant provides the Board of Zoning Appeals a written
agreement as described in subsection (b)(1)C. above, to the Board of Zoning
Appeals’ satisfaction, between the land uses allowing for the shared use of
parking spaces.
         C.   Shared parking facilities shall provide signs on the premises
indicating the availability of the facility for the patrons of the
participating uses.
         D.   Modifications to the structures in which the uses are located or
changes in tenant occupancy shall require review for compliance with this
section.
   (c)   Required off-street loading and unloading spaces shall not be
construed as being part of the required off-street parking spaces.
   (d)   No part of any alley or street or other public right-of-way shall be
used to meet the minimum parking requirements of this code, unless otherwise
provided for herein.
   (e)   For purposes of determining off-street parking requirements under this
section, gross floor area shall mean the total horizontal area of the one or
several floors of the building or portion thereof devoted to a particular use,
including accessory storage areas located within selling or working space such
as counters, racks, or closets and any basement floor area devoted to retailing
activities, to the production or processing of goods or to offices; provided,
however, gross floor area shall not include that area devoted entirely and
permanently to storage purposes, parking and loading facilities, or space used
for restrooms, utilities, stairwells or elevator shafts.
   (f)   Number of employees indicates the number of employees on the largest
shift, unless otherwise indicated. (Ord. 318. Passed 2-4-08.)
   (g)   In the C and I Districts. The maximum number of spaces shall not

Parking Requirements (Table 2).
   (i)   Every company car, truck, tractor or trailer normally stored at a
business site shall be provided with an off-street parking space. Such space
shall be in addition to the parking requirements listed in the Table 2.
   (j)   For uses not specified in this section, or in such instance when the
requirement for an adequate number of spaces is unclear or not specified in
another part of this section for Conditional Uses, Shopping Center Plan, etc.,
the number of parking spaces shall be determined by the Planning Director on
the basis of similar requirements, the number of persons served or employed,
and the capability of adequately serving the visiting public. Such
determination may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (k)   In case of conflict between the provisions of this section, the higher
requirement shall govern.
   (l)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may waive the requirement for a Home
Occupation Class II to provide one (1) additional parking space for activities
if it can be shown that off-street spaces required for the dwelling unit are
sufficient for the purposes of the home occupation activity. (Ord. 318. Passed
2-4-08.)

1311.01 IMPROVEMENT LOCATION PERMIT.
   (a)   Any person who shall make application for an improvement location
permit shall, at the time of making such application, furnish the Building
Inspector with a site plan of the real estate upon which such application is
made at least five days prior to the issuance of such improvement location
permit, which five day period may be waived by the Building Inspector. Such
site plan shall be drawn to scale showing the following items:
      (1)   Legal or site description of the real estate involved;
      (2)   Location and size of all buildings and structures;
      (3)   Width and length of all entrances and exits to and from such real
estate; and
      (4)   All adjacent and adjoining roads and highways.
   (b)   Site plans so furnished shall be filed by the City Clerk as a
permanent record of the City.
   (c)   The Building Inspector may require the relocation of any proposed
building or structure or exit or entrance shown on such site plan and/or the
location of new exits or entrances not shown on such site plan before issuing
an improvement location permit when such action is necessary to carry out the
purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (d)   The Building Inspector shall issue an improvement location permit for
a conditional use only following receipts of notice from the Board that the
application therefor has been approved by the Board.
   (e)   No improvement location permit shall be issued for excavation for or
the erection, reconstruction or structural alteration of any building before
application has been made for a certificate of occupancy.
(Ord. 318. Passed 2-4-08.)
1311.02 CONDITIONAL USES.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to recognize that there may
be cases where community and Comprehensive Plan goals are met by flexible and
individual regulation of land uses within a zoning district. The establishment
of a conditional use permit procedure provides such flexibility to provide for
certain uses which shall be permitted only if adequate conditions exist or can
be imposed that will make such uses compatible with the purposes of this
Ordinance and the Comprehensive Plan. The conditional use permit procedure
shall provide for some measure of individualized judgment and the imposing of
conditions on certain uses, in order to make them compatible with uses in the
surrounding area. It is further intended that the conditional use permit,
through a site plan review process, shall provide a method whereby it can be
determined whether or not a use would cause any damage, hazard, nuisance, or
other detriment to persons or property in the vicinity.
   (b)   Standards and Requirements. Conditional uses are declared to possess
characteristics of such unique and special form that each specific land use
must be considered as an individual case. Consideration by the Board of Zoning
Appeals shall be based on adopted standards and requirements. These
considerations shall be general, applying to all conditional uses, and
specific, applying to individual types of conditional uses. The standards and
requirements stipulated in this article shall be made a condition of approval.
In addition, the Board may impose additional, reasonable conditions to fit the
particular use and site under review.
   (c)   Limits of Authorization. A conditional use permit shall be deemed to
authorize only the particular use specified in the permit.
   (d)   Application for Conditional Use Approval. The applicant shall file a
formal and complete application for a conditional use permit with the Code
Enforcement Officer. The application shall include:
      (1)   A preliminary site plan which demonstrates the overall site layout
and building locations, parking areas and circulation, access and egress
locations, setbacks and buffer areas, lighting, landscaping, signage and the
location and extent of existing development on adjacent parcels.
      (2)   A list of the property owners’ names and addresses located within
150 feet of the affected area, as of record in the office of the Monongalia
County Tax Assessor. The subject property also shall be included in the
affected area.
      (3)   Any other information deemed helpful by the applicant or necessary
by the Code Enforcement Officer to explain the nature of the proposed use and
its consistency with the standards established by this article for conditional
use permits.
      (4)   A filing fee in the amount of $300.00, the purpose of the fee shall
be to defray, in part, the expenses connected with the application.
      (5)   The Code Enforcement Officer will conduct a formal review of the
complete application. As part of the formal review process, the Code
Enforcement Officer will notify appropriate agencies and request summaries of
agency reviews.
      (6)   The City shall publish a legal advertisement describing the request
for a conditional use permit in a local newspaper of general circulation at
least fifteen (15) days prior the scheduled public hearing before the Board.
      (7)   The Board shall hold a duly scheduled public hearing to review the
complete site plan and application for the conditional use permit request.
      (8)   If the conditional use permit is granted by the Board, the
applicant receives approval and is formally notified in writing by the City.
      (9)   If the conditional use is denied by the Board, the applicant is
formally notified in writing of the denial and the right to appeal the decision
to the Circuit Court of Monongalia County within thirty (30) days.
   (e)   Standards for Approval. The Board may approve an application for a
conditional use permit, subject to such reasonable conditions and restrictions
as are directly related to and incidental to the proposed conditional use
permit, if it finds that the following general standards have been met:
      (1)   The proposed use is compatible with the goals of the Comprehensive
Plan.
      (2)   The proposed use shall be compatible with the appropriate and
orderly development of the district, taking into consideration the location and
size of the use, the nature and intensity of the operations involved in or
conducted in connection with such use, the size of the site in relation to the
use, the assembly of persons in connection with the use, and the location of
the site with respect to streets giving access to the site.
      (3)   The proposed site development shall be such that the use will not
hinder nor discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and
buildings, taking into consideration the location, nature and height of
buildings, the location, nature and height of walls and fences, and the nature
and extent of landscaping on the site.
      (4)   Neighborhood character and surrounding property values shall be
reasonably safeguarded.
      (5)   Operations in connection with the use shall not be offensive,
dangerous, destructive of property values and basic environmental
characteristics, or detrimental to the public interest of the community. They
shall not be more objectionable to nearby properties by reason of fumes, noise,
vibration, flashing of or glare from lights, and similar nuisance conditions
than the operations of any permitted use not requiring a conditional use permit
in the district.
      (6)   The character and appearance of the proposed use, buildings,
structures, and/or outdoor signs shall be in general harmony or better, with
the character and appearance of the surrounding neighborhood.
      (7)   The Board shall have the authority to impose such reasonable
conditions and restrictions as are directly related to and incidental to the
proposed conditional use permit.
   (f)   Conditional Approval.
      (1)   A conditional use approval may be denied or revoked where the
applicant fails to comply with specific conditions made a part of the approval
by the Board, or fails to comply with a reasonable request of the Board for
furnishing specific information related to the proposed use. Failure to comply
with the conditions of approval shall constitute a violation of the Zoning
Ordinance.
      (2)   If there are other valid reasons for denying a conditional use
application, the denial may be sustained even if the proposed conditional use
constitutes the highest and best use which can be made of the subject property.
The Board may not deny a permit solely for the purpose of limiting the number
of similar uses in an area.
   (g)   Expiration of Conditional Use Permit. In the case where a Conditional
Use Permit has not been used within twelve (12) months after the granting
thereof, then without further action it shall be null and void. This may be
extended to eighteen (18) months upon prior written request of the Board. The
word "used" shall mean that the approved Conditional Use Permit has been
activated as evidenced by permits, construction, or required licenses.
(Ord. 451. Passed 9-17-18.)
1311.03 CERTIFICATE OF OCCUPANCY.
   (a)   No land shall be occupied or used and no buildings hereafter erected,
reconstructed or structurally altered shall be occupied or used, in whole or in
part, for any purpose whatsoever, until a certificate of occupancy based on an
actual inspection shall have been issued by the Chairman of Occupancy
Committee, stating that the building and use comply with all of the provisions
of this Zoning Ordinance applicable to the building or premises or the use in
the district in which it is located.
   (b)   No change in use shall be made in any building or part thereof, now or
hereafter erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered, without a
certificate of occupancy having been issued by the Chairman of Occupancy
Committee, and no such permit shall be issued to make such changes unless it is
in conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   A certificate of occupancy shall be applied for coincidentally with
the application for an improvement location permit and shall be issued within
ten days after the lawful erection, reconstruction or structural change or
alteration of such building shall have been completed.
   (d)   A record of all certificates of occupancy shall be kept on file in the
office of the City Clerk and copies shall be furnished upon request to any
person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the building or land
affected. (Ord. 318. Passed 2-4-08.)
1311.04  ENFORCEMENT; COMMITTEE CONSENT.
   (a)   The Mayor is hereby designated and authorized to enforce this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (b)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section relating to the
designation of the Mayor as the enforcing authority under this section, the
Mayor, in the exercise of such authority and in the issuance of any permits or
certificates provided for herein, shall not issue or award such without the
affirmative consent of at least two members of that certain special three-
member committee to be appointed by the Mayor after the adoption of this Zoning
Ordinance and to be composed of three members of Council, such committee being

through careful design, siting, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging
techniques;
   (e)   To promote and encourage shared use/collection of towers and antenna
support structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use towers;
   (f)   To avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and
telecommunications facilities by ensuring that such structure are soundly and
carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no
longer used or determined to be structurally unsound;
   (g)   To ensure that towers and telecommunications facilities are compatible
with surrounding land uses;
   (h)   To promote the location of towers in industrial and business, rather
than residential areas. (Ord. 318. Passed 2-4-08.)

1371.01 GENERAL PURPOSE.
   The procedures and standards for the development and subdivision of real
estate and for the surveying and platting thereof, prescribed by this Chapter,
are found by Council to be necessary to promote the public safety, health, and
general welfare, to provide for suitable residential neighborhoods with
adequate streets and utilities and appropriate building sites, to save
unnecessary expenditures of public funds by reserving space for public lands
and buildings and by proper construction of streets and utilities, and to
provide proper land records for the convenience of the public and for better
identification and permanent location of real estate boundaries.
(Ord. 494. Passed 12-7-20.)
1371.02 DEFINITION OF SUBDIVISION AND RESUBDIVISION.
   (a)   Subdivision means all divisions of a tract or parcel of land divided
into two (2) or more lots, building sites, or other divisions for the purpose,
whether immediate or future, of sale, legacy, or building development, and
includes all division of land involving the opening or construction of a
building development, and includes all division of land involving the opening
or construction of a new street or change in existing streets, provided,
however, that the following shall not be included:
      (1)   The division of land into parcels greater than five (5) acres where
no street right-of-way dedication in involved.
      (2)   The public acquisition of strips of land for the widening, or
opening of streets.
      (3)   A plat amendment of land in cases where plats with final approval
had been granted and the lot sizes are increased. In such cases the subdivider
shall file with the City an amended plat.
   (b)   Subdivision will be divided into two (2) categories: Major
Subdivisions and Minor Subdivisions.
      (1)   Major Subdivision: Any subdivision not classified as a minor
subdivision, and requiring new streets or the extension of any off-tract
improvements.
      (2)   Minor Subdivision: Any subdivision of land involving the creation
of fewer than five (5) platted lots.
   (c)   Resubdivision. Whenever a developer desires to resubdivide property
lot lines on an already approved final subdivision plat, the developer shall
first obtain approval for the resubdivision by the same procedures prescribed
for the subdivision of land. Resubdivision is a type of subdivision involving
any of the following:
      (1)   Any change in any street layout or any other public improvement;
      (2)   Any change in any lot line, whether combining lot lines or creating
new lots, except where the lot sizes are increased (see plat amendment below);
      (3)   Any change in the amount of land reserved for public use or the
common use of lot owners;
      (4)   Any change in any easements shown on the approved plat.

1371.03 PLANNING COMMISSION AUTHORITY AND ACTIONS.
   (a)   Authority. The Planning Commission of Westover, West Virginia
(hereinafter “Planning Commission”) is vested with the authority to review,
approve, conditionally approve and disapprove applications for the subdivision
of land, including sketch, preliminary, and final plats. The Planning
Commission may grant variances from these regulations pursuant to the provision
below.
   (b)   Approval of Plant Required. Before any real property located within
the City or lands that abut thereon, is subdivided and offered for sale, and
before a plat for such property is recorded in the Office of the County Clerk
of Monongalia County, the subdivision plat shall be approved by the Planning
Commission, and such approval entered on the plat by the President, after first
having been submitted to the Commission in accordance with the provisions of
this Chapter.
   (c)   Amendments. For the purpose of protecting the public health, safety,
and general welfare, the Planning Commission from time to time propose
amendments to this Chapter which shall then be approved or disapproved by the
City Council at a pubic meeting following public notice.
   (d)   Hardship. Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary
hardship may result from strict compliance with this Chapter because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in questions, it may vary the
requirements so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured; provided that such variation will not have the effect of nullifying
the intent and purpose of the Comprehensive Plan or this Chapter. In granting
variances and modifications, the Planning Commission may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards or requirements so varied or modified.
   (e)   Appeal. If the subdivider disagrees with the action taken on his
proposal by the Planning Commission, he may appal such action to Council within
thirty days of the time such action was taken. The applicant shall file a
Notice of Appeal with the Council, with a copy of the Planning Commission, no
later than ten days after the date on which the Planning Commission notifies
the applicant that it has disapproved the sketch, preliminary, or final
subdivision plat. The Notice of Appeal shall set forth in clear and concise
fashion the basis for the appeal. The appeal shall be considered at the next
regularly scheduled public meeting of the Council, at which time it may affirm
or reverse the decision of the Planning Commission. The Council may reverse the
decision of the Planning Commission only by a unanimous vote of the Council
members present at the meeting. If the Council reverses the Planning
Commission, the applicant may proceed to submit a preliminary or final plat as
appropriate under the conditions for approval agreed to by the Council.
   (f)   No proposed changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions shall be
made to any final plat of a subdivision after approval has been granted by the
Planning Commission and endorsed in writing on the plat, unless said proposed
changes, erasures, modifications, or revisions are submitted to the Planning
Commission for approval.

Commission of the action at its next scheduled meeting.
   (d)   For non-exempt minor subdivisions, if the preliminary plat meets all
necessary requirements, then it shall be deemed a final plat and may be
approved by the Director of Public Works. If approved, the Director of Public
Works shall set a date, time, and place for a public hearing before the
Planning Commission, notify the applicant in writing of the public hearing, and
notifying the general public. Notice of the public hearing shall be made by the
City Clerk by Class I legal advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation
in the City at least twenty-one (21) days prior to the date set for the
hearing. Due notice of the hearing shall additionally be mailed at the same
time as the advertisement to owners of properties abutting the subject property
and/or located within 200 feet of the subject property.
   If the preliminary plat is not approved by the Director of Public Works, the
applicant shall submit the plat to the Planning Commission on appeal.
   (e)   If the subdivider/applicant has satisfactorily completed the
requirements of the preliminary plat and a bond acceptable to the City has been
posted, then the Director of Public Works may recommend to the Planning
Commission that final approval of the final plat be granted. The exhibits
required under Section
1375.04 must be filed with the Director of Public Works.
   (f)   The approving action of the Planning Commission shall be noted on the
plat and all copies. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy
sent to the City Code Enforcement Officer, and one copy retained by the
Commission.
   (g)   Recording of Final Plat. After approval of the final plat, such plat
shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk within thirty (30) days
after such approval. The Planning Commission may grant an extension of time if
there are unusual circumstances.
   (h)   Offer of Dedication. Recording of the final plat shall have the effect
of an irrevocable offer to dedicate all streets and other public ways shown
thereon to public use, unless a notation is placed on the final plat by the
subdivider stating that there is no offer of dedication, and an irrevocable
offer to dedicate or reserve as specified on the plat lands for parks, schools
or other public purpose. Recording of the plat, however, shall not impose any
duty on the City concerning the improvement or maintenance of any such
dedicated street or lands, until the proper authorities of the City have made
actual appropriation of the same by legal action. Where improvements were
constructed in territory prior to its annexation into the City and prior to the
acceptance by the City of any offer of dedication of improvements, the offer or
shall provide, at his expense, a certificate by a professional engineer as to
the compliance with the City’s and all other applicable standards of the
offered streets, public ways and infrastructure improvements.

once any twenty-four (24) month period. (Ord. 494. Passed 12-7-20.)
1375.03 MAJOR SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   A subdivider/applicant will begin the process by submitting an
application to the Director of Public Works with the appropriate details of the
proposed subdivision. It will be followed by submission of the Preliminary Plat
and then the Final Plat.
   (b)   Preliminary Plat Submission. Four copies of the complete preliminary
plat and any supplementary material shall be submitted to the Planning
Commission with written application for conditional approval at least thirty
days prior to the meeting at which it is to be considered. The following steps
in the review and approval process by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   Preliminary Plat Review, Public Hearing, and Action. The Commission
shall review the submitted preliminary plat and other material and negotiate
with the subdivider/applicant on changes deemed advisable and the kind and
extent of improvements to be made by the subdivider/applicant. During this
period, the Commission may require the applicant to obtain the approval of
relevant municipal departments and commissions. The Planning Commission shall
set a date, time, and place for a public hearing, notify the applicant in
writing of the public hearing, and notify the general public. Notice of the
public hearing shall be made by the City Clerk by Class 1 legal advertisement

subject property. Following this, the Commission shall, within forty days, act
on either the submitted or modified preliminary plat. If the Commission
approves the preliminary plat, the Commission shall express its approval as
conditional approval and state the conditions of such approval. If the
Commission disapproves the preliminary plat, the Commission shall express its
disapproval and its reasons therefore. The action of the Commission shall be
noted on the copies of the preliminary plat, referenced and attached to any
conditions determined. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one copy
shall be sent to the City Code Enforcement Officer and one copy shall be
retained by the Commission.
   (d)   Conditional approval of a preliminary plat shall not constitute
approval of the final plat. Rather it shall be deemed an expression of approval
of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a guide to the preparation
of the final plat, which will be submitted for approval of the Commission and
for recording upon the fulfillment of the requirements of this Chapter and the
conditions of the conditional approval.
   (e)   No street shall be opened, graded, improved or constructed; no water
or sewer line shall be constructed; no water or sewer service shall be
furnished by the City; nor shall the Building Inspector issue any building
permit for any proposed structure upon any land in a subdivision until
conditional approval of the subdivision has been granted by the Commission in
accordance with the provisions of this Chapter. The City Code Enforcement
Officer is authorized and directed to take necessary action to cause to be
closed any street opened in violation of this Chapter.
   (f)   Final Plat Submission. The final plat shall conform substantially to
the preliminary plat and conditional approval. If desired by the subdivider,
the final plat may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary
plat that he proposed to record and develop at the time, provided, however,
that such portion conforms to all requirements of these Subdivision
Regulations. Application for approval of the final plat shall be submitted in
writing, to the Commission at least thirty days prior to the meeting at which
it is to be considered. Four copies of the final plat and other exhibits
required for approval shall be prepared as specified in Section
1375.04 and shall be submitted to the Commission within twelve months after
conditional approval of the preliminary plat; otherwise such approval shall
become null and void. The Commission may grant a time extension.
   (g)   Final Plat Review and Action. The Commission shall review the
submitted final plat. Following this, the Commission shall act within forty
days to approve or disapprove the final plat. The final play may be approved if
the subdivider has satisfactorily completed the requirements of the preliminary
plat, all conditions of the conditional approval have been met, and a bond
acceptable to the City has been posted. The exhibits required under Section
1375.04 must be filed with the Commission prior to the Commission’s decision to
release the bond. The action to approve by the Commission shall be noted on the
final plat and all copies. One copy shall be returned to the subdivider, one
copy sent to the City Code Enforcement Officer, one copy retained by the
Commission, and the fourth shall be sent to Council for its review.
   (h)   Recording of Final Plat. After approval of the final plat by the
Planning Commission, such plat shall be recorded in the office of the County
Clerk within thirty days after such approval. The Commission may grant a time
extension if there are unusual circumstances.
   (i)   Offer of Dedication. Recording of the final plat shall have the effect
of an irrevocable offer to dedicate all streets and other public ways shown
thereon to public use, unless a notation is placed on the final plat by the
subdivider stating that there is no offer of dedication, and an irrevocable
offer to dedicate or reserve as specified on the plat lands for parks, schools
or other public purpose. Recording of the plat, however, shall not impose any
duty on the City concerning improvement or maintenance of any such dedicated
street or lands, until the proper authorities of the City have made actual
appropriation of the same by legal action. Where improvements were constructed
in territory prior to its annexation into the City and prior to the acceptance
by the City of any offer of dedication of improvements, the offer or shall
provide, at his expense, a certificate by a professional engineer as to the
compliance with the City’s and all other applicable standards of the offered
streets, public ways and infrastructure improvements.

ARTICLE 1377
Street Design Standards
1377.01   Purpose.
1377.02   General design of streets.
1377.03   Specific street design standards.
1377.01 PURPOSE.
   The subdivision shall conform to standards that will result in a well-
planned community, protect the health and safety of the residents, and provide
a desirable living environment without unnecessarily adding to the development
costs. The following improvements shall be required: streets and circulation,
off-street parking, water supply, sanitary sewers, and storm water management.
(Ord. 468. Passed 6-17-19.)
1377.02 GENERAL DESIGN OF STREETS.
   (a)   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and location of all
streets shall be considered in their relation to existing and planned streets,
to topographical conditions, to public convenience and safety, and in their
appropriate relations to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such
streets.
   (b)   Conformity to Planned Public Way. Whenever a tract of land included
within any proposed subdivision embraces any part of a planned public way,
shown on plans which have been adopted by the proper authority, such part of
the proposed public way shall be platted by the subdivider in the location and
the width indicated by the plan.
   (c)   Storm Drainage. Adequate storm drainage shall be required, as per
standards established by the City and the Morgantown Utility Board. The
standards shall control the design and construction of storm drainage
facilities so that acceptable storm water flow and minimum acceptable runoff
qualities are achieved by the subdivider.
   (d)   Classification of Streets. Street which may be classified by
definition under two or more street types shall conform to the higher
requirements. Marginal access streets shall conform to the regulations for the
purpose they serve, i.e., residential street or business street.
   (e)   Street and Subdivision Names. The proposed name of the subdivision and
the proposed street names shall not duplicate or too closely approximate the
name of any other subdivision or street in the area covered by this Chapter.
Proposed streets which are obviously in alignment with existing streets or are
an extension of an existing street shall bear the name of the existing street.
All street names shall be subject to approval by the Planning Commission.
   (f)   Subdivision Containing or Abutting Major Street or Railroad Right of
Way.  
      (1)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed major
street, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse
frontage with screen planting contained in a non-access reservation along the
rear property line, deep lots with rear service lanes, or such other treatment
as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
      (2)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way,
the Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side
of such right of way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land, as for park purposes in residential streets, or for the
business or industry in the appropriate districts; such distances shall also be
determined with due regard for the requirements of approach grades and future
grade separations.
   (g)   Half Streets. Streets within a proposed subdivision shall be designed
where possible to allow fora through connection to a future subdivision on
adjacent property or to future phases  of the same subdivision. These shall be
known s half streets and shall be designed with temporary T-turnarounds at
their ends. The turnaround shall be removed and a permanent through street
created when the adjoining property is subdivided and where a half street is
contiguous to a previously platted half street. Half streets shall be shown on
the final plat.
   (h)   Street Center Line Offsets. Street jogs with center-line offsets of
less than 125 feet shall not be allowed.
   (i)   Tangents Between Reverse Curves. A tangent at least 100 feet shall be
introduced between reverse curves on major and collector streets.
   (j)   Street Intersections.
      (1)   Three-way street intersections should be utilized, using four-way
intersections only when absolutely necessary.
      (2)   Flat grade within and fifty to one hundred feet each way from the
street intersection is preferred but over seven percent (7%) grade is not
acceptable.
      (3)   Right angle street intersections are preferred, but no intersection
shall be at an angle of less than seventy-five degrees or more than one hundred
fifteen degrees. The curb radius for residential and commercial streets shall
be twenty feet. The curb radius for a collector street intersecting a major
street shall be fifty feet.
      (4)   A clear sight triangle shall be provided at all street
intersections. Within such triangle no vision-obstructing objects shall be
permitted which exceed a height of twenty-four inches above the elevation of

building may present a fire hazard, may provide temporary occupancy by
transients (including drug users and traffickers), may detract from private
and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and
that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by the regulation
of such vacant buildings.
   (b)   Owners of uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings shall register
such vacant buildings within the City, make payment of a fee for the
registration thereof, and otherwise conform to these vacant building
regulations.
   (c)   This article ensures that, through a registration, inspection, and
monitoring process, vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from
trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in
times of emergency, will not impede private and/or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and will not present otherwise
a public hazard.
   (d)   The City shall inspect and monitor vacant buildings, shall assess the
effects of the condition of those buildings on nearby structures, and shall
promote substantial efforts to rehabilitate and develop such buildings when
appropriate.
   (e)   These provisions will streamline and consolidate the existing
procedure by placing the responsibility to register and maintain vacant
structures on the building owner before a building’s condition falls into
disrepair or otherwise becomes a hazard to public health and/or safety.

1720.07 REGISTRATION GENERALLY.
   (a)   At the time of adoption of this article, all owners of realty within
the City of Westover that contain a vacant structure, as defined above, shall
register the same with the office of the Building Inspections of the City. For
those structures that qualify as a vacant structure and after the adoption of
this article, the owner thereof shall be required to register the structure
with the City within thirty (30) days after the structure is found to meet the
definition of a vacant structure. The registration form shall require
information from the registrant deemed necessary by the Mayor, Building
Inspector, Fire Chief, City Engineer and Police Chief of the City, so as to
ensure that the purpose of this article is met. Specifically, the above named
officers shall have the authority to require the property owner to provide a
professional opinion (architect, engineer, etc.) to determine the structural
integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to ensure its structural
integrity and that will be safe for entry by fire fighters and police officers
in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do not present a
hazard to the public during the time the building remains vacant. The above
named officers shall have the authority to issue orders to the owner for
corrective action deemed necessary. The Building Inspector shall rely upon the
West Virginia State Building Code and Fire Code, as well as other applicable
laws, for guidance during any such structural review.
   (b)   Registration Statement; Local Agent. If the property owner does not
have an address within the state, the registration statement shall provide the
name, address and phone number of a person who resides within the state and who
is authorized to accept service of process on behalf of the owners and who
shall be designated as a responsible, local party or agent, both for purposes
of notification in the event of an emergency affecting the public health,
safety or welfare and for purposes of service of any and all notices or
registration statements as herein authorized and in connection herewith.
   (c)   Registration and Fees. Registration shall be required for all vacant
buildings, whether vacant and secure, vacant and open or vacant and boarded,
and shall be required whenever any building has remained vacant for forty-five
(45) consecutive days or more. In no instance shall the registration of a
vacant building and the payment of registration fees be construed to exonerate
the owner, agent or responsible party for compliance with any other building
code or housing code requirement. One registration statement may be filed to
include all vacant buildings or of the owner so registering, but each structure
constitutes a separate fee. The owner of the vacant property as the last day of
the month when the property has been registered of each calendar year shall be
annually responsible for the payment of the nonrefundable registration fee.
Said fee shall be billed by the City; and based on the duration of the vacancy
as determined by the following scale:
      (1)   Applicable inspection fee (to be determined) depending on the
duration of the inspection, for properties that are vacant for less than one
year;

than two years;
      (3)   $1,000 for properties that are vacant for at least two years but
less than three years;
      (4)   $2,000 for properties that are vacant for at least three years but
less than four years;

Mayor no later than fifteen (15) calendar days after the date of the billing
statement. On appeal, the owner shall bear the burden of providing satisfactory
objective proof of occupancy as defined in this article specifically.
   (b)   One Time Waiver of Registration Fee. A waiver of the registration fee,
or an extension of a waive for up to ninety (90) days from the date of the
current billing statement, may be granted by the Mayor or his/her designee upon
application of the fee; if the owner:
      (1)   Demonstrates with satisfactory proof to the Mayor that he/she is in
the process of demolition, rehabilitation, or other substantial repair of the
vacant building; and
      (2)   Objectively demonstrates to the Mayor a reasonable anticipated
length of time for the demolition, rehabilitation, or other substantial repair
of the vacant building;

waiver application is received by the Mayor, the Mayor shall grant or deny the
waiver, or request for extension, in writing, and dispatch the written decision

decision which the owner seeks to appeal to the City Council, the owner must
file an application in writing no later than thirty (30) calendar days from the
date of the Mayor’s decision. City Council shall either grant or deny the
Appeal. Thereafter the decision of City Council is final unless within thirty
(30) days of such decision the owner appeals for injunctive relief to the
Circuit Court of Monongalia County.

1720.09 AMENDMENT INFORMATION AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Duty to Amend Registration Statement. If the status of the

United States, the state, the City, or any of their respective agencies or
political subdivisions.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties for Failure to Register. The failure or
refusal for any reason of any owner, or agent of an owner acting on behalf of
the owner, to register a vacant building upon adoption of this section or to

punishable upon conviction thereof by a fine in the amount of not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each
failure or refusal to pay a required vacant building fee, as applicable. In

Code.
(Ord. 466. Passed 6-17-19.)
1720.11 NON-PAYMENT OF FEES/LIENS.

notice of the amount of the registration fee due, except for those owners that
have properly perfected an appeal pursuant to this ordinance, and the owner
fails to pay the amount due, said amount shall constitute a debt due and owing
to the City and the City may commence a civil action to collect such unpaid
debt.

the City. Should the City take the steps necessary to sell the subject
property, the City shall do so, subject to all liens and real and personal
property taxes that are due. Purchasers of the subject property shall be
similarly responsible for registration pursuant to this section in the same
manner as the prior owner and must begin the registration process anew if said
property remains vacant.

specifically listed or otherwise described in this article.
      (40)   Start of Construction.  
         (The definition for start of construction is to be used only when
calculating the starting time for expiration of a Floodplain Permit.)
         The date the Floodplain Permit was issued, including Floodplain Permit
for substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the Floodplain Permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
Floodplain Permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as

storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (44)   Subdivision. Development that includes a creation of individual
land parcels for future sale. It does not include development where rights-of-
way or easements are obtained and recorded.
      (45)   Subject Property. "Subject property" includes the surface tract(s)
upon which the proposed development is planned and for which the Floodplain
Permit Application is submitted.
      (46)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent of the fair market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
      (47)   Substantial Improvement. Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the fair market value of the structure
before the start of construction of the improvement.
         This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation(s) of State or Local Health, Sanitary or Safety Code
Specifications which have been identified by the Local Code Enforcement
Official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all
article requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued designation
as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific article requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
         For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur
when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of the building commences whether or not the alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (48)   Top of Bank. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of the bank. In the field a professional
familiar with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of the bank. When a
professional is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the
top of the first significant slope landward of the water's edge when it is
followed by at least fifty feet of relatively flat land.
      (49)   Variance. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
      (50)   Violation. The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this article. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation
until such time as the documentation is provided. No future improvements or
developments can be made to structures found to be in violation unless the
development is to bring the structure into compliance with the current
ordinance.
         (Ord. 460. Passed 4-1-19.)
1721.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD PLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Identification.  
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Westover which are subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and
described in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for City of Westover by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated, January 20, 2010, April
05, 2019 or the most recent revision thereof including all digital data
developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas which have been identified as flood hazard areas by
City of Westover by use of historic or other technical data and shown on an
officially recognized “FIRM or the West Virginia Flood Hazard Determination
Tool Specifically Advisory Flood Height... These areas shall be designated as
appropriate with the level of technical data described below and shall be
managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist ofthe following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Flood way Fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area Without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Flood way has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
      (5)   The AO and AH Floodplain those area identified as Zones AO and AH
on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by 1-percent-
annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and three
feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by City of Westover Commission where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   A County's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting
from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practical but,
not later than six months from the date such information becomes available, the
County shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific
data.
      (3)   City of Westover may identify and regulate new flood hazard or
ponding areas. These areas shall be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map"
using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high-water marks and/or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is at
or above the Base Flood Elevation, and the following is provided to the
Floodplain Administrator:
         A.   Elevation information and a site plan demonstrating that all
proposed development will occur above the Base Flood Elevation or,
         B.   A Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA removing the site from
the SHFA then the site shall be considered to be outside the Floodplain Area
and shall not be required to conform to the provisions of this article.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation, the site shall be considered to be within the
Floodplain Area and the proposed structure shall be required to conform to all
appropriate provisions of this article.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the County Commission
sitting as the "Floodplain Appeals Board". The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant/applicant.
(Ord. 460. Passed 4-1-19.)
1721.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Floodway. Within any Floodway Area (Fl), no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property due to
their relatively
faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be preserved to the
greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the Flood way encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (2)   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable Federal and State Law, Ordinances and
Regulations.
      (4)   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the City of
Westover Floodplain Manager, be determined to be the channel of the stream and
the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special
flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the
upland limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   AE Zone Without Floodway Area. Within any AE Zone Without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (c)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A). Within any Approximated Floodplain
Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an applicable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
and adjacent properties including but not limited to existing buildings will be
reasonably safe from flooding using hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other
techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall
only be prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that
the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable Federal and State Laws, Ordinances and Regulations.
      (4)   Within any apportioned Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, City of Westover's Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. In addition prior to issuing the local permit the
Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from
those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval
      (2)   The developer shall also assure City of Westover in writing that
the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resulting study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses and
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the use of certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of
bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream
crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may
include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings
to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in
flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the County a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1721.08(d).
      (6)   When any watercourse alteration has occurred, the applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.
         (Ord. 460. Passed 4-1-19.)
1721.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   General. A Permit is required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified Floodplain, Floodway or other special

flood damage reduction requirements of this article.
   (b)   Basic Format. The basic format of the permit shall include the
following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant.
      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed development is
to occur.
      (3)   Applicant shall provide names, addresses, and valid West Virginia
license numbers of all contractors working at the building site, or affidavits
stating that work is being performed by individuals exempt from contractor
licensing as set forth in Title 28, Series 2, section 3.9(b) of the West
Virginia Code of State Regulations or the most recent revision thereof, if
known at the time the Permit Application is submitted. If not known, applicant
shall provide the information within fourteen (14) days of execution of a
contract with its contractor(s) prior to beginning construction.
      (4)   A description of site location sufficient to locate the proposed
development including tax map and parcel numbers and most recent deed book and
page number.
      (5)   A standard site plan showing size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow, the
lowest adjacent grade to the proposed foundation and/or toe of fill, the Base
Flood Elevation and the location of the Floodway boundary when applicable.
      (6)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to pay any and all fees
associated with the permitting process as set forth in Sections
1721.07(c) and
1721.07(i).
      (7)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to allow The Floodplain
Administrator and authorized representatives of floodplain management programs

to redact proprietary and confidential information from the contracts and
addendums that are not otherwise public information. Failure to present
contract(s) or addendums for review shall void the permit. If a licensed
contractor is not involved, or the work is of an aggregate construction cost
value of less than ten thousand dollars including material and labor, a brief
written description of proposed work and the estimated value will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the methods of elevating the proposed structure

Administrator, a registered professional engineer or architect shall prepare
the plans.
         D.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification. The
elevation certificate must confirm structure in question together with
attendant utilities are elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
         G.   A Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that the area below the first
floor could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed
areas below base flood elevation that are five feet high or more). This
agreement shall state:
            1.    The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of the
existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the purchaser through
notarized signature, a copy of all new Non-Conversion Agreements shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non-
Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator
shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1721.08(d).
      (2)   All structures shall be flood proofed to two feet above the Base
Flood Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
         All applicants shall meet or exceed the minimum flood proofing
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this article. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits, certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood Proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in (1) above, stating the structure in question, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities are designed so that:
            1.    The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)    For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant
materials used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage (Apartment
Structures only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
Floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a Floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An Elevation Certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a licensed professional smveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               i.   A minimum of two openings have a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
               ii.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
               iii.    Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves
or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-Conversion Agreement
and notify prospective purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion
Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-
Conversion Agreement to any purchaser at closing through notarized signature. A
signed copy of the transferred Non-Conversion Agreement shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement
and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the
violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1721.08(d).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria. Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks.
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)    Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to Floodplain Areas, proposed lot sites, and fill
areas.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify
the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include Base Flood Elevation data and shall
delineate the Floodway.
         A.    When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the Base Flood
Elevation.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
State and Local Water Resource Department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the Approximated
Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed
Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan
for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two (2) or five
(5) feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed
and the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled from the FEMA
map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision Of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord. 460. Passed 4-1-19.)

adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections l0A and 10B as
authorized by West Virginia Code § 21-9-1 et seq. The anchoring shall be
adequate to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include but are not limited to the over-the-top and frame ties,
attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not be adequate
to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement is in
addition to applicable State and Local anchoring requirements for resisting
wind forces.
         D.   Permanently attached rigid skirts and perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block must have openings to prevent collapse and damage to supporting
piers. The openings must be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer

article.
      (3)   Appurtenant Structures.
         A.    When possible, appurtenant structures shall be located out of
the special flood hazard area.
         B.    Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
            1.   Use of the structme shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
               a.    Structures shall be no more than 300 square feet in size
and valued at less than seven thousand dollars ($7,000).
               b.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
               c.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
               d.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
               e.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               f.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all
utilities shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               g.   Opening requirements:
                  Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by

requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
                  (i)    A minimum of two openings have a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
                  (ii)    The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above grade.
                  (iii)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters.
            2.   In addition, a Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement at
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of the Non-
Conversion Agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the
Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth
Section
1721.08(d).
      (4)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnected utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   Fill. City of Westover officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the Floodplain Area serves in storage and transportation of water
during floods. Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is
discouraged and should be minimized.
         Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
         No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with currently accepted technical standards that the proposed fill will not
result in any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
         All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed
the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall consider
the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to the
subject property and adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and
adjacent properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst
topography, stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   A Fill Site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with preconstruction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
Ordinance and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in subsection 5 below. For non-residential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
         E.   At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25)
percent of the perimeter of a non-residential structure.
         F.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         G.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         H.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         I.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         J.    All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before permit can be issued. After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
can be issued. The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving said request and executing Form 1, "Overview &
Concurrence Form" or other form as may be required by FEMA.
         K.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of Structures and Other Development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         B.   In so far as practicable, structures and other development shall
be placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.  
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas wells and
well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100 feet from any
perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or wetland. [See
W.Va. Code §22-6A-12(b)]. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be
maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection at the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator the Flood
Protection Setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback Area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with other State environmental agency(ies)
requirements.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within zones AH
and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures
      (12)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area Floodplain Area.
         (Ord. 460. Passed 4-1-19.)

Administrator after a showing by the applicant of "justifiable delay" not
caused by the negligence or lack of due diligence of the applicant. Any
extension of the 180 day Start of Construction timeframe shall only be granted
if the permit holder can demonstrate compliance with this Floodplain article,
FIRM and/or FIS in effect at the time the extension is granted. All work on the
proposed development must be completed within 18 months of permit issuance, at
which time the permit shall expire, unless a time extension made in writing to
the Floodplain Administrator and filed in the official Floodplain Permit File
by the County Clerk is granted in writing by the Floodplain Administrator. The
request for a time extension shall be in writing and shall state the reasons
for the extension. When considering an extension, the Floodplain Administrator
shall consider the following criteria:
      (1)   Has the applicant diligently pursued the completion of the proposed
development during the 18 months?
      (2)   Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public safety,
health, or welfare or injurious to other property?
   (h)   Stop Work Orders, Inspections and Revocations.
      (1)   Stop-Work Orders.
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued,
a "Stop Work Order Notice" for any development found ongoing without having
obtained a Floodplain Permit. Disregard of a Stop Work Order Notice shall
subject the violator to the penalties described in Section

Order Notice, the Floodplain Permit shall be stayed pending a determination of
whether a violation actually occurred and/or abatement of the alleged
violation, whichever occurs first.
         D.   In the event of an Appeal on a Floodplain Permit, the Floodplain
Administrator shall immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall
remain in effect until a resolution of said Appeal.
      (2)   Inspections and Revocations.
         A.   During the development period, the Floodplain Administrator or
other authorized County, State or Federal Government Officials may inspect the
premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the
information provided on the Floodplain Permit Application, this article and
with all applicable Federal, State and County laws, Regulations and Ordinances.
         B.   If the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not
comply with the Floodplain Permit Application, this article or that there has
been a false statement(s) or misrepresentation(s) by any applicant in the
permitting process, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a "Stop Work Order
Notice", revoke the permit and request a temporary injunction in the Circuit
Court of City of Westover. The Floodplain Administrator shall notify any
appropriate agency or authority if the Floodplain Administrator finds a
violation of any non-Floodplain Law, Regulation or Ordinance.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized County, State or
Federal Government Officials may inspect any development covered by this or
previous Floodplain articles to determine whether any portion of the
development has been altered to be non-compliant with the requirements of this
article or other Ordinances.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to occupy, or
to permit the use of occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
building or land conforms to the requirements of this article. Occupying or
using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1721.08(d).
      (2)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect
and approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until
the utility inspector is in possession of a copy of the Certificate of
Compliance issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular
development being inspected conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance.
Inspection and approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in Section
1721.08(d).
      (3)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
development conforms to the requirements of this article. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1721.08(d).
      (4)   A Certificate of Compliance shall be issued by the Floodplain
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in the special
flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the Certificate of Compliance shall be based upon the
inspection conducted as prescribed in this article and any finished
construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing certificate,
or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a condition of the
Floodplain Permit approval process.
   (j)   Fees. Floodplain Determination fee of twenty dollars ($20.00), payable
to the Monongalia County Commission shall be assessed on all proposed
development.
      (1)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this ordinance shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to City of Westover Commission based upon a set schedule approved by
City of Westover Commission using the estimated value of the proposed
construction as determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
City of Westover Commission for any additional costs for services necessary for
review and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
         Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the Monongalia County Commission for the
additional cost of processing permits for work already underway. To more fully
recover this cost the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent
occurrence by the same person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve
any person from complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the
execution of the work or from other penalties prescribed herein. (Ord. 460.
Passed 4-1-19.)
1721.08 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.

the right of that person or entity to appeal to the City of Westover Commission
sitting as the Floodplain Appeals Board. Such appeal must be filed with the
County Clerk, in writing, within thirty (30) days after notification of the
decision of the Floodplain Administrator as announced at a regularly scheduled
City of Westover Commission Meeting. Said Appeal shall be served by the
aggrieved person by regular mail on all interested parties on the date that
said Appeal is filed. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Floodplain Appeals Board

and be heard. The determination by the Floodplain Appeals Board shall be final
in all cases, subject to any Appeal to the Circuit Court of City of Westover,
West Virginia or any other Court of competent jurisdiction.
   In the event an Appeal is filed wherein a Floodplain Permit grant has been
ruled by the Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator shall
immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall remain in effect until a
resolution of said appeal.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria. All appeals contesting only the permit fee,
the cumulative substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback
requirement, or the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of
the Floodplain Appeals Board.
   (c)   Variances. If compliance with any of the requirements of this article
would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or
landowner, the [Name of Municipality] may, upon request, grant relief from the
strict application of the requirements.
   Considerations for the issuance of Variances to this article shall adhere to
the following
criteria:
      (1)   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances.
      (2)   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the Special
Flood Hazard Area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,
shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance.
      (3)   An affirmative decision granting a Floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood
Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and (ii)
such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in this article; and
      (5)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all
decisions including justification for the decisions, and (ii) report such
decisions issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
      (6)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for issuance of a
Floodplain variance for any construction, development use or activity within
any Floodway Area that would cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (d)   Penalties. Any person, who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or direction or Order of the
Floodplain Administrator, or any other authorized employee of, shall be
unlawful and shall be referred to the Prosecuting Attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Westover Commission of not less than fifty dollars
($50.00) or more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution.
Each day during which any violation of this article continues shall constitute
a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or non-
compliance with, this article shall not excuse the violation or non-compliance
with the article or permit it to continue; and all such persons shall be
required to correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within a
reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or
relocated in non-compliance with this article may be declared by the City of
Westover Comnlission to be a public nuisance and abated as such subject to
other applicable laws and exhaustion of appellate rights. (Ord. 460. Passed 4-

1753.06 APPEAL.
   (a)   Any person who is issued a citation shall pay the fine indicated for
the violation, as set forth in Section
1753.04, in full to the office of the Municipal Court Clerk within ten days of
service of the citation. Any person alleging he or she was improperly issued
such citation may, within ten days of service of such citation, file a petition
for appeal of the citation, along with the required bond, with the Municipal
Court Clerk in accordance with the following:
      (1)   In order to properly and timely appeal his or her citation, within
ten days of service of the citation, the recipient of the citation shall pay
the required amount of the applicable fine in full to the Municipal Court
Clerk, which amount will be held by the Municipal Court as bond pending hearing
and resolution of the case by the Municipal Court and the Municipal Court Clerk
shall issue a receipt to the recipient of the citation showing the amount of
the bond paid. In addition to the bond, the recipient of the citation shall
file with the Municipal Court Clerk a petition for appeal of the citation. If
any petition for appeal filed in accordance with this section is not timely
filed or is not accompanied with the required bond, the recipient of the
citation shall be deemed to have waived his or her right to appeal the
citation, and such petition shall be summarily denied as untimely filed;
provided, however, that nothing set forth hereinabove shall prevent the
Municipal Court Judge from finding, upon a proper application and showing, that
the recipient of the citation suffers from financial hardship, and, as a
result, waiving the requirement that the bond be posted.
      (2)   Any petition for appeal filed with the Municipal Court Clerk must
be in writing, on the form to be provided by the Municipal Court Clerk, and
must be signed by the recipient of the citation affirming that the contents of
the petition are true and accurate to the best of the recipient of the
citation’s knowledge at that time. Such petition for appeal shall state the
facts and reasons in support of the petition. Upon filing any such petition for
appeal with the Municipal Court Clerk, the recipient of the citation shall
serve a copy of the petition and receipt showing proof of bond, or application
for wavier thereof, upon the City Attorney.
   (b)   Upon filing of a petition for appeal with the Municipal Court Clerk,
the Clerk or his or her designee shall place the case on the Municipal Court
Docket, set the case for hearing within 30 days from the date of the filing of
the petition for appeal, provide a notice of hearing to the recipient of the
citation, and forward a copy of the petition to the enforcement official who
issued the citation. Upon receipt of the petition, the enforcement official
shall cause a copy of the citation at issue to be forwarded to the Municipal
Court Clerk who shall file it as the original complaint alleging the violation
indicated therein.
   (c)   The Municipal Court shall treat the citation itself as the original
complaint before the court. At the close of all of the evidence presented at
the hearing on petition for appeal, should the Municipal Judge find against the
recipient of the citation, the bond posted by the recipient of the citation
shall be applied as payment for the fine imposed for the violation. In the
event the Municipal Court Judge finds that the recipient of the citation
suffers from financial hardship, the applicable fine from Section
1753.04, above, shall be imposed, and the Municipal Court Judge shall have the
ability to grant the recipient of the citation a certain amount of time to pay
the fine, at the Municipal Court Judge’s discretion. Should the Court find in
favor of the recipient of the citation, the bond, if applicable, shall be
refunded to the recipient of the citation by the Municipal Court Clerk, and the
citation shall be dismissed.
