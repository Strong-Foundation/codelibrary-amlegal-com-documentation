EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

property as being a registered landmark, it may seek and obtain from such
property owner an agreement as to such restrictions upon the use of the
property as the Commission finds are reasonable and are calculated to
perpetuate and preserve the features which led it to designate such property as
an historical landmark. All such arrangements between the Commission and the
property owner shall be in writing, and when duly signed and acknowledged,
shall be recorded in the office of the City Clerk and when so recorded shall be
notification to the assessor or the restrictions therein set forth.

assessor of the fact of such establishment and the boundaries of the district,
together with the restrictions which have been mutually agreed upon by such

factors into consideration in assessing the properties therein.

      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.

as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.

can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking

any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.

movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful

signs.

declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other

subsection creating the offense requires a period of incarceration, period of
license revocation, or fine that is greater than what is required for a
conviction under this subsection, the greater period of incarceration, period
of revocation, or fine shall be imposed: provided, however, that this section
does not apply to a second conviction that is subject to a period of license
revocation under subsection (h) of this section.
   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions
under this section:

10-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and

second or subsequent offense, as described in subsection (h) or (j) of this
section, if the person has been previously arrested for, or charged with, a
violation of this section which is alleged to have occurred within the
applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No
person may be convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this section
unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:
provided, that the court may apply the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11A-
1 et seq. to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for
a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b
to persons adjudicated thereunder. An order for home detention by the court
pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B-1 et seq. may be used
as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation
of this section, electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten
days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not
leave home for those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.

suspended by the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles pursuant to
this section must complete a comprehensive safety and treatment program as set
forth in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3 before his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle can be reinstated and his or her driving privileges restored.
   (p)   For any offense for which an alternative revocation period is
permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the
order to the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles.

         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her

year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in

355.01 PURPOSE.
   The City of Mannington has determined that in order to protect the safety,
health and welfare of its citizens, that it must regulate and in certain
instances prohibit the use and operation of all-terrain vehicles and other
related recreational vehicles upon any street, road, avenue, alley, way,
sidewalk, parking lot or right of way within the City's corporate limits and
upon all other real property which is publicly owned, leased or controlled.
(Ord. 444. Passed 7-29-19.)
355.02 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this article the words and phrases identified herein
shall have the following meanings:
   (a)   ALL TERRAIN VEHICLE (ATV) means any motor vehicle designed for off
highway use and designed for operator use only with no passengers having a seat
or saddle designed to be straddled by the operator, and handlebars or steering
wheel for steering control as defined in West Virginia Code 17A-1-1 (ii) or the
same type of off-highway motor vehicle, or golf cart, designed and equipped
with a "buddy seat" for purposes of carrying a single passenger in addition to
the operator of said vehicle.
   (b)   OTHER MOTORIZED RECREATION APPARATUS means go-cart, unregistered off
road motorized dirt bikes, whether two or three wheeled, snowmobile as defined
by West Virginia Code 17A-1-1(mm); or other related vehicles or motorized
apparatus used for the principal purpose of recreation other than all-terrain
vehicle as herein before defined and which motorized apparatus is not for the
general transportation of persons or goods.
      (Ord. 444. Passed 7-29-19.)
355.03 PROHIBITION.
   (a)   No person shall operate, ride upon or use any motorized recreational
apparatus or ATV for transportation or recreational purpose, within or upon the
public streets, roads, alleys, ways, sidewalks and crosswalks or upon any other
real property, which is publicly owned, leased or controlled, within corporate
limits of the City of Mannington, except as herein permitted.
   
   (b)   No person shall knowingly permit another person to operate, ride upon
or use any motorized recreational apparatus or ATV for transportation or
recreational purposes, within or upon the public streets, roads, alleys, ways,
sidewalks and crosswalks or upon any other real property, which is publicly
owned, leased or controlled, within the corporate limits of the City of
Mannington, except as herein permitted.
   (c)   A parent, custodian or guardian of a minor under the age of sixteen

corporate limits of the City of Mannington. The term "knowingly” includes
knowledge that the parent, custodian or guardian should reasonably be expected
to have concern with the whereabouts of said minor in his or her custody. This
requirement is intended to hold a neglectful or careless parent, custodian or

or guardian was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct of such
minor. (Ord. 444. Passed 7-29-19.)

misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and

a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or

   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;

becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.

      (2)   “Employees” means any persons constructively working for wage,
salary or commission at, or based out of, the Mannington business site.
      (3)   “Full time” means employed at least thirty-five hours per week.
      (4)   Any other term used in this section shall have the same meaning as
when used in comparable context in this article, unless a different meaning is
clearly required by the context or by definition in this section.
   (c)   Amount of Credit Allowed. There shall be allowed to taxpayers a credit
against the business and occupation tax imposed by this article. The allowable
credit will be measured by the number of new jobs provided in the City and the
type of business pursued.
      (1)   Prerequisites. There are two prerequisites that must be met before
a credit will be allowed. First, the taxpayer must show to the Mayor that the
privilege to be engaged in is industrial as defined in subsection (b)(1)
hereof. Second, the taxpayer must show to the Mayor that the business will have
a reasonable capability of enduring for at least seven years and that a minimum
number of employees will be working full-time during that entire seven year
period.
      (2)   Computation. The amount of the credit will be a set percentage of
the taxpayer’s total City tax obligation under this article. The total credits
allowed, however, for a single year or cumulatively, shall not exceed the total
cost of the taxpayer’s qualified investment or the tax obligation for that
year.
Credit in excess of tax liability in one estimate period may be applied to the
tax liability in other estimate periods in the same taxable year.
      (3)   Measure of the Credit. The length of time that the credit is to be
allowed and therefore the total credit allowable, subject only to the
investment limitation in subsection (c)(2) hereof, is to be measured by the
minimum number of jobs provided in the corporate City limits. As set forth
below, the period of years for which a credit will be allowed is directly
related to the minimum number of jobs guaranteed by the taxpayer. The period of
the credit will not be extended if the taxpayer hires more employees than he
has guaranteed the City unless there is a qualified investment to expand the
business. The extension of time granted for such an expansion will be based
only on the number of new full-time jobs created by the expansion, not by the
total number of employees.
 
Category New Jobs Created B. & O. Tax Credit Percentage of Tax Credit
1        25               1 year             100%
2        26-50            2 years            100%
(Ord. 294. Passed 5-17-93.)
3        51-75            3 years            100%
4        76-100           4 years            100%
(Ord. 343. Passed 8-21-00.)
 
   If there is a partial year of operation when the business first begins
operation, the credit will be prohibited.
   If a taxpayer should expand operations and provide at least five new jobs
while operating under a pre-existing credit period there is no carryover of the
new credit allowance to the expiration date of the existing credit. It is
possible for two or more credits to operate concurrently, and result in more
than one hundred percent credit for the taxpayer’s tax obligation. Any credit
in excess of the tax liability is not refundable and cannot be carried over
into the next tax year.
   (d)   Forfeiture of Credit. The employment of fewer workers than guaranteed
to the City will cause the credit period, dating from the first day property
was placed in service, to be shortened in relation to the lowest level of
employment maintained, or terminated if the applicable credit period for that
decreased employment level has run out of if employment drops below five full-
time workers. Work stoppage and lay-offs approved by the Mayor, or caused by
forces majeure, or severe economic depression which lasts less than three
months will not affect the taxpayer’s credit periods. However, systematic lay-
offs by any taxpayer that for all essential purposes result in employment below
the guaranteed level, as determined by the Mayor will result in termination of
all credit periods for that taxpayer.
(Ord. 293. Passed 5-17-93.)
755.09 COMPUTATION AND PAYMENT GENERALLY.
   (a)   The taxes levied under this article shall be due and payable in
quarterly installments on or before the expiration of one month from the end of
the quarter in which they accrue. The taxpayer shall, within one month from the
expiration of each quarter, make out an estimate of the tax for which he is
liable for such quarter, sign the same and mail the same, together with a
remittance in the form required by Section
755.16, of the amount of the tax, to the office of the collector. In estimating
the amount of tax due for each quarter, the taxpayer may deduct one- fourth of
the tax credit for industrial expansion allowable for the taxable year and one-
fourth of the total exemption allowed for the year. When the total tax for
which any person is liable under this article does not exceed the sum of one
hundred dollars in any year, the taxpayer may pay the same quarterly as
aforesaid or, with the consent in writing of the collector, at the end of the
month next following the close of the tax year.
   (b)   Any other provisions of this section notwithstanding, the collector,
if he deems it necessary to insure payment of the tax, may require the return
and payment under this section for periods of shorter duration than quarter
year periods.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.10 ANNUAL RETURN AND REMITTANCE.
   On or before the expiration of one month after the end of the tax year each
taxpayer shall make a return for the entire tax year showing the gross proceeds
of sales or gross income of such person’s business, trade or calling and
compute the amount of tax chargeable against him in accordance with the
provisions of this article and deduct the amount of quarterly payments as
provided in this article, if any, and transmit with his report a remittance in
the form required by Section
755.16 covering the residue of the tax chargeable against him to the office of
the collector. Such return shall be signed by the taxpayer, if made by an
individual, or by the president, vice president, secretary or treasurer of a
corporation, if made on behalf of a corporation. If made on behalf of a
partnership, joint adventure, association, trust or any other group or
combination acting as a unit, any individual delegated by such firm,
copartnership, joint adventure, association, trust or any other group or
combination acting as a unit shall sign the return on behalf of the taxpayer.
The collector, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making the annual
return on the application of any taxpayer and grant such reasonable additional
time within which to make the same as may, by him, be deemed advisable.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.11 CORRECTION OF ERRORS.
   (a)   If the taxpayer shall make any clerical error which shall be apparent
on the face of the return in computing the tax assessable against him, the
Collector shall correct such error or reassess the proper amount of taxes and
notify the taxpayer of his action by mailing to him promptly a copy of the
corrected assessment, and any additional tax for which such taxpayer may be
liable shall be paid within fifteen days after the receipt of such statement.
   (b)   If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on
the basis of the tax so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately
refunded to the taxpayer upon the requisition of the Collector and shall be
payable out of any funds available for the purpose. The taxpayer may, at his
election, apply an overpayment credit to taxes subsequently accruing under this
article.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.12 ASSESSMENT OF TAX WHEN INSUFFICIENTLY RETURNED.
   If the Collector believes that the tax imposed by this article is
insufficiently returned by a taxpayer, because the taxpayer has failed to
properly remit the tax, has failed to make a return or has made a return which
is incomplete, deficient or otherwise erroneous, he may proceed to investigate
and determine or estimate the tax liability of the taxpayer and make an
assessment therefor.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.13 APPEALS.
   If any person, having made the return and paid the tax as provided by this
article, feels aggrieved by the assessment made upon him for any year by the
Collector, he shall apply to Council by petition, in writing, within thirty
days after notice is mailed to him by the Collector, for a hearing and a
correction of the amount of the tax so assessed upon him by the Collector, in
which petition shall be set forth the reasons why such hearing should be
granted and the amount such tax should be reduced. Council shall promptly
consider such petition and may grant such hearing or deny the same. If such
hearing is denied, the petitioner shall be forthwith notified thereof; if such
hearing is granted, Council shall notify the petitioner of the time and place
fixed for such hearing. After such hearing Council may make such order in the
matter as may appear to be just and lawful and shall furnish a copy of such
order to the petitioner. Any person improperly charged with any tax and
required to pay the same may recover the amount paid, together with interest,
in such proper action or suit against the collector as may be authorized by
law.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.14 TAX YEAR.
   The assessment of taxes made in this article and the returns required
therefor shall be for the year ending on December 31. If the taxpayer, in
exercising a privilege taxable under this article, keeps the books reflecting
the same on a basis other than the calendar year, he may, with the assent of
the collector, make his annual returns and pay taxes for the year covering his
accounting period, as shown by the method of keeping his books.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.15 TAX CUMULATIVE.
   The tax imposed by this article shall be in addition to all other licenses
and taxes levied by law as a condition precedent to engaging in any business,
trade or calling. A person exercising a privilege taxable under this article,
subject to the payment of all licenses and charges which are conditions
precedent to exercising the privilege taxed, may exercise the privilege for the
current tax year upon the condition that he shall pay the tax accruing under
this article.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.16 METHOD OF PAYMENT; PENALTIES FOR NONPAYMENT.
   (a)   Every remittance of taxes imposed by this article shall be made by
bank draft, certified check, money order or certificate of deposit to the
collector, who shall issue his receipt therefor to the taxpayer and pay the
money into the City Treasury, to be kept and accounted for as provided by law.
   (b)   If any taxpayer fails to make the return required by this article or
makes his return but fails to remit in whole or in part the proper amount of
tax, there shall be added to the amount of the tax unpaid, from the date such
tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount of five percent of the tax
for the first month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency and one percent of the
tax for each succeeding month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency; provided,
that if such failure is due to reasonable cause, the collector may waive or
remit, in whole or in part, these penalties.
   (c)   If the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to evade this article
and rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be added an
additional penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax, exclusive
of penalties.
   (d)   The penalties so added shall be collected at the same time and in the
same manner and as part of the tax.
(Ord. No. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.17 TAX A PERSONAL OBLIGATION AND LIEN.
   A tax due and unpaid under this article shall be a debt due the City. It
shall be a personal obligation of the taxpayer and shall be a lien upon the
property of the taxpayer; provided, that such lien shall be subject to the
restrictions and conditions embodied in article 10C of chapter thirty- eight of
the Code of West Virginia, and any amendment thereto.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.18 POWERS OF COLLECTOR.
   The Collector may, by himself or a duly appointed agent mentioned in Section
755.23, collect taxes due and unpaid under this article, together with all
accrued penalties, under the power conferred on the Collector by law. After
delinquency shall have continued sixty days, the collector may proceed, by
himself or his agent, in the circuit court of the county to obtain an
injunction restraining the further exercise of the privilege until full payment
shall have been made of all taxes and penalties due under this article. In any
proceeding under this section, upon judgment or decree for the plaintiff, he
shall be awarded his costs.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)

   (a)   Any person exercising any privilege taxable under this article who
shall sell out his business or stock of goods or shall cease doing such
business shall file the return prescribed by Section
755.10 and remit the entire tax that may be chargeable against him because of
all business done, within thirty days after selling out his business or stock
of goods or ceasing to do such business. The tax imposed by this article shall
be a lien upon the property of such person.
   (b)   The successor in business of any such person shall withhold so much of
the purchase money as will satisfy the taxes and penalty which may be due until
the former owner shall produce a receipt from the collector evidencing the
payment of such taxes and penalty. If the purchaser of a business or stock of
goods shall fail to withhold purchase money as above provided, and the taxes
and penalty shall remain unpaid after expiration of the thirty day period
allowed for payment thereof, he shall be personally liable for the payment of
all such taxes and penalty, and the same shall be recoverable by the collector
by action or suit as provided by law.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)
755.20 PAYMENT PREREQUISITE TO FINAL SETTLEMENT OF CONTRACTS.

   The Collector, for the more effective collection of the taxes imposed by
this article, may file with the Clerk of the County Commission a certified copy
of the assessment of taxes under this article for recordation. A certificate so
filed shall be recorded in the book in which similar certificates of the State
are recorded and thereafter constitute binding notice of the lien created by
this article upon all lands of the taxpayer located within the City as against
all parties whose interest arose after such recordation. Upon payment of the
taxes delinquent under this article, the lien of which shall have been
recorded, the Collector shall certify in duplicate the fact and amount of
payment and balance due, if any, and shall forward the certificates, one to the
taxpayer and one to the Clerk of the County Commission. The Clerk of the County
Commission shall record such certificates in the book in which releases are
recorded. From the date that such certificate is admitted to record, the land
of the taxpayer in the City shall be free from any lien for taxes under this
article accrued to the date that the certificate was issued.
(Ord. 203. Passed 5-17-76.)

759.01 IMPOSITION AND RATE; COLLECTION.
   (a)   There is hereby levied and shall be collected a charge against users
of any municipal services, including police protection, fire protection, street
lighting, street maintenance, street cleaning and street improvements
(excluding those essential services of Parks & Recreational facilities, sewage
and sewage disposal and the collection and disposal of garbage, refuse, waste,
ashes, trash and other essential municipal services). The charge for such
service shall be at the following rates for each single family unit residence,
per unit, and for each multiple-family dwelling or apartment house, per each
residential unit or apartment, whether or not occupied, for each business
establishment.
 
1 year  $180.00
1 month $15.00
      (1)   This charge is not based on any tap fee, water meter or the
specific provisions of any service, but is based solely upon the residence
inside of the City limits of Mannington.
      (2)   Provided, however, that any building that is not used as a
residence is exempt from this charge. If an existing building is converted to a
non- residential structure, upon confirmation by the code enforcement officer
and application by the owner, the charge may be removed.
   (b)   (1)   The City Clerk shall be charged with the duty of mailing a
statement on a monthly, quarterly, or yearly basis to each person or business
establishment to be charged with the municipal fee hereby imposed for the fee
due for the preceding month or quarter as the case may be, but failure to mail
any statements of monthly, quarterly, or yearly charges shall not be grounds
for avoiding payment.
      (2)   A statement shall be mailed by the Clerk at least as frequently as
once each year, but at the discretion of the Clerk, a statement may be mailed
each month or quarter and any such statement may be consolidated by the Clerk
with statements for other municipal services due from such person or business
establishment. If a monthly statement is mailed by the Clerk it may be mailed
each month on a date selected by the Clerk but the Clerk shall render the
monthly billing to such person or business establishment in a uniform manner so
that each monthly billing is mailed at intervals of approximately thirty (30)
days. The Clerk may yearly or otherwise mail books for monthly payment or
similar payment books or bills.
   (c)   The City Clerk is hereby authorized to collect the municipal service
fee herein imposed on a yearly basis and if such fee is paid in advance and
paid on or before July first of each year, the Clerk is authorized to allow a
discount of eight dollars ($8.00) on the yearly fee. The City Clerk is hereby
directed to collect from any person or business establishment failing or
refusing or neglecting to pay the fees herein imposed for a period of twenty
(20) days after the date of a statement whether it be a monthly or quarterly
statement as herein provided, a penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount of
the fee shown upon the statement. Any fee paid to the City of Mannington
pursuant to the terms of this section of the City Code shall be deemed paid
upon the date payment was mailed to the City Clerk, in a properly addressed
stamped envelope. The postmark appearing on the envelope containing such fee
shall be deemed conclusive evidence of the date such payment was made.

meeting of the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Planning Commission Review. The Planning Commission shall review
the application and petition requesting the abandonment of a public right of
way at its regular meeting and shall fix a time, place and date of public
hearing on the abandonment request and shall inform the applicant of same. Such

(Ord. 369. Passed 5-16-05.)
929.06 REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Water Purveyor.
      (1)   On new installations, the Water Purveyor will provide on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer, if any, that will be required and will perform inspection
and testing.
      (2)   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the Water
Purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises and
inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the
method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to
be made. Ordinarily, ninety (90) days will be allowed. However, this time
period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the
history of the device(s) in questions.
      (3)   The Water Purveyor will not allow any cross-connection to remain
unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer which will be
generally tested to insure satisfactory operation.
      (4)   The Water Purveyor shall inform the Owner by letter, of any failure
to comply, by the time of the first re-inspection. The Purveyor will allow an
additional fifteen (15) days for the correction. In the event the Owner fails
to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second reinspection,
the Water Purveyor will inform the Owner by letter, that the water service to
the Owner’s premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five (5)
days. In the event that the Owner informs the Water Purveyor of extenuating
circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time extension may
be granted by the Water Purveyor, but in no case will exceed an additional
thirty (30) days.
      (5)   If the Water Purveyor determines at any time that a serious threat
to the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately.
      (6)   The Purveyor will begin initial premise inspections to determine
the nature of existing or potential hazards. Initial focus will be on high
hazard industries and commercial premises.
   (b)   Owner.  
      (1)   No Owner shall install or maintain an unprotected cross-connection
in a public water system.
      (2)   The Owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of
all cross-connections on his premises.
      (3)   The Owner, after having been informed by a letter from the Water
Purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested,
any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
      (4)   The Owner shall notify the public water system of any malfunction
of the backflow preventer and shall correct and test any malfunction which is
revealed by periodic testing within ten (10) days.
      (5)   The Owner shall inform the Purveyor of any proposed or modified
cross- connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the Owner
is aware, but have not been found by the Water Purveyor.
      (6)   The Owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer
unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Owners who
cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply additional
devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
      (7)   The Owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved by
the Water Purveyor.
      (8)   The Owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
Water Purveyor or the WVBPH.
      (9)   Approved Owner having a private well or other private water source
must have the approval of the Water Purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system. Permission to cross-
connect may be denied. The Owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even
if it is not cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system.
      (10)   In the event the Owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Water Purveyor’s side of the backflow
preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed.
      (11)   The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that the
device fails to operate correctly, and second reinspections for non-compliance
with Water Purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
         (Ord. 369. Passed 5-16-05.)
929.07 DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the public water system arising
from cross- connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard and
will require the installation of approved backflow prevention device.
(Ord. 369. Passed 5-16-05.)
929.08 EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the Water Purveyor to
continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the
effectiveness of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable
risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the
case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, any
existing backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle
device, or a reduced pressure principle device must be installed in the event
that no backflow device is present.
(Ord. 369. Passed 5-16-05.)
929.09 PERIODIC TESTING.
   (a)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
   (b)   The owner shall provide the public water system will all drawings,
plans, specifications, and other data related to the backflow prevention
assemblies so that the public water system can ensure the owner’s compliance
with this article.

facilities within the water customer’s premises, including plumbing diagrams,
drawings, or plans, at the request of the public water system.
   (d)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester. This
testing will be done at the owner’s expense.
   (e)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair
the device will be retested at owner’s expense to insure correct operation.
High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the
backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty (30) days after the test
date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair
tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two (2) devices is an
effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service during
testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires
such continuity.
   (f)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in subsection (a) above, in cases where there is a history of test
failures and the Water Purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be
borne by the owner.
(Ord. 369. Passed 5-16-05.)
929.10 RECORDS.
   (a)   The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections.

   No person shall use or permit the use of any building or premises or part
thereof hereafter erected, created or changed or converted wholly or partly in
its use or structure until the Building Inspector has issued a certificate of
use and occupancy stating that the building and premises comply with the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. Nothing in this section shall prevent the
continuance of the legal nonconforming use of any premises or of any existing
building.
   A record of all certificates of use and occupancy shall be kept on file in
the office of the Building Inspector and copies shall be furnished on written
request.
   No permit for the erection of any building shall be issued before
application has been made for a certificate of use and occupancy. Such
certificates shall be issued within ten days after the completed erection or
alteration has been approved. No building or premises may be occupied until the
certificate has been issued.
   All nonconforming uses under the provisions of the Ordinance, for which no
variance has been granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals, or for which
application for a certificate of use and occupancy was not submitted prior to
April 1, 1981, shall be presumed to have arisen subsequent to that date. For
purposes of determining the number of boarders or roomers maintained in
dwellings within any district, the Building Inspector may require such proof as
he deems necessary.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1305.05 CITY ATTORNEY TO INSTITUTE ACTION.
   In case any building or structure is, or is intended to be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, altered or converted, or any building, structure or
premises is, or is intended to be used in violation of, or contrary to the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the City Attorney is hereby authorized, in
addition to other remedies set forth in the West Virginia Code and in the
Ordinance, to institute any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such
erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration or conversion or use.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1305.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm or corporation who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or
refuses to comply with any provisions of this Zoning Ordinance for which no
other penalty is provided shall be fined not less than ten dollars ($10.00) nor
more than three hundred dollars ($300.00) for each offense. Fines shall begin

(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1307.02 OFFICERS; QUORUM.
   (a)   At its first meeting of each year, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
elect a chairman and a vice chairman from its membership. The vice chairman
shall have the power and authority to act as chairman during the absence or

action of the Board shall be official, however, unless authorized by a majority
of all of the members of the Board.

employees as are necessary for the discharge of its duties, all in conformity
to and in compliance with the salaries and compensation theretofore fixed by
the Municipality.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1307.03 RULES AND PROCEDURES.
   The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, and shall record the vote of all

shall make a written report to the City Council each July covering the period
of July 1 of the previous year through June 30 of the current year.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1307.04 POWERS; DUTIES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall:
   (a)   Hear and determine appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision or determination made by an administrative official or board charged
with the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance of the City or any rule or
regulation adopted pursuant thereto;
   (b)   Permit and authorize exceptions to the district rules and regulations
only in the classes of cases or in particular situations, as specified in this
Ordinance;
   (c)   Hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of this Ordinance upon
which the Board is required to act under this Ordinance; and
   (d)   Authorize upon appeal in specified cases such variance from the terms
of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where owing
to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this
Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done as follows:
      (1)   Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of
a specified piece of property at the time of enactment of the provision of this
Ordinance affecting such property by reason of exceptional situation or
condition of such piece of property, or of the use or development of property
immediately adjoining the piece of property in question, the literal
enforcement of the provisions of the Ordinance would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional and undue hardship upon the
owner of such property, unnecessary to carry out the spirit and purposes of the
Ordinance, the Board shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal, a variance
from such strict application, so as to relieve such difficulties or hardships,
and so that the spirit and purposes of this Ordinance shall be observed and
substantial justice done. In authorizing a variance the Board may attach
thereto such conditions regarding the location, character or use as it may deem
advisable in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of this Ordinance.
      (2)   No such variance in the provisions or requirements of this
Ordinance shall be authorized by the Board unless the Board finds, beyond
reasonable doubt, that all of the following conditions exist:
         A.   That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applying to the property in question or to the intended use of the
property that do not apply generally to other properties or classes of uses in
the same zoning district.
         B.   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the
same zoning district and in the vicinity affected by such variance.
         C.   That the authorizing of such variance will not:
            1.   Alter the land use characteristics of the district;
            2.   Impair the adequate supply of light and air to adjacent
property;
            3.   Increase the hazard from fire, flood and other dangers of such
property;
            4.   Diminish the marketable value of adjacent land and buildings;
            5.   Increase the congestion in the public streets;
            6.   Otherwise impair the public health, safety and general
welfare.
      (3)   No grant or variance shall be authorized unless the Board
specifically finds that the condition or situation of the specific piece of
property for which the variance is sought is not of so typical or recurrent a
nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general
regulation, under an amendment of this Ordinance, for such conditions or
situations.
   (e)   In exercising its powers and authority, the Board may reserve or
affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, as in its opinion ought to be done in the
premises, and to this end shall have all the powers and authority of the
official or board from whom or which the appeal is taken. (Ord. 310. Passed 9-
16-96.)
1307.05 APPEAL.
   (a)   From Decision of Official.
      (1)   An appeal taken from any order, requirement, decision or
determination made by an administrative official charged with the enforcement
of this Zoning Ordinance or rule and regulation adopted pursuant thereto shall
be filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   The appeal shall specify the grounds thereof and shall be filed
within such time and in such form as may be prescribed by the Board by general
rule and regulation.
      (3)   The administrative official from whom the appeal is taken shall,
upon request of the Board, transmit to it all documents, plans and papers
constituting the record of the action from which an appeal was taken.
   (b)   Hearings.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the
hearing of an appeal. Public notice of the hearing shall be given by publishing
a notice of the date, time and place of the hearing as a Class 1 legal
advertisement in compliance with West Virginia Code Article 59-3, in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City at least thirty (30) days prior to
such hearing and due notice shall be given additionally to the interested
parties.
      (2)   The Board may require the party taking the appeal to assume the
cost of public notice and due notice to interested parties.
      (3)   At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent or by an
attorney at law admitted to practice in the State.
   (c)   Staying of Work on Premises When Appeal Taken. When an appeal has been
taken and filed with the Board, all proceedings and work on the premises in
question shall be stayed (by written notice of the Board secretary sent to the
property owner by certified mail) unless the official or Planning Commission
from whom or which the appeal was taken shall certify to the Board of Zoning
Appeals that by reason of facts stated in the certification a stay would cause
imminent peril to life or property. If such certificate be filed, proceedings
or work on the premises shall not be stayed except by a restraining order
granted by the Marion County Circuit Court.

times at which the application including maps, plans, and supporting documents
for which appeal is sought is available for review. Costs of notification by
letter shall be borne by the applicant.
   Notice by certified mail requested shall be deemed to be complete upon
mailing. The failure to give personal notice to any property owner not shown on
the latest current tax records shall not invalidate any hearing or proceeding
conducted pursuant to this Ordinance.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1307.07 PUBLIC HEARING OF THE BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   (a)   Meetings of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be held at the call of

(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1309.02 PLANNING COMMISSION REVIEW.
   All proposed amendments shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for
study and recommendation. The Commission shall study proposals to determine:
   (a)   The need and justification for the change;
   (b)   When pertaining to a change in the district classification of the
property, the effect of the change, if any, on the property and surrounding
properties;
   (c)   The relationship of the proposed amendments to the purposes of the
general planning program, with appropriate consideration as to whether the
proposed change will further the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance and the
Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1309.03 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   No amendment, change or supplement in any of the provisions of the Zoning

parcel or portion thereof, within a period of one year from the date of the

Commission may recommend to Council that such reconsideration be given after
the Commission has found that either:
   (a)   There has been a substantial change in the character of the area; or
   (b)   Evidence or factors or conditions exist which were not considered by
the Commission or Council in previous deliberations which might substantially

(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1311.03 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   Where uncertainty exists with respect to the boundaries of any of the
aforesaid districts as shown on the Zoning Map, the following rules shall
apply:
      (1)   Where boundaries approximately follow streets, alleys or highways.
Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following the center
line or street line of streets, the center line or alley line of alleys, or the
center line or right-of-way line of highways such lines shall be construed to
be such district boundaries.
      (2)   Where boundaries parallel street lines, alley lines or highway
right-of-way lines. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they are
approximately parallel to the center lines or street lines of streets, the
center lines or alley lines of alleys, or the center lines or right-of-way
lines of alleys, or the center lines or right-of-way lines of highways, such
district boundaries shall be construed as being parallel thereto and at such
district there from as indicated on the Zoning Map. If no distance is given,
such dimension shall be determined by the use of the scale shown on the Zoning
Map.
      (3)   Where boundaries approximately follow lot lines. Where district
boundaries are indicated as approximately following lot lines, such lot lines
shall be construed to be the boundaries.
      (4)   Where boundaries follow railroad lines. Where a boundary of a
district follows railroad lines, such boundary shall be deemed to be located
midway between the main tracks of such railroad lines.
      (5)   Where a boundary follows a river or stream. Where a boundary of a
district follows a river or stream the boundary line shall be construed to be
at the limit of the jurisdiction of the City unless otherwise indicated on the
Zoning Map.
      (6)   Lots in two districts. Where a district boundary line divides a lot
which was in single ownership and of record at the time of enactment of this
Ordinance, the use thereon and the other district requirements applying to the
least restricted portion of such lot shall be construed as extending to the
entire lot provided the least restrictive use does not extend more than twenty-
five feet (beyond the dividing boundary line) or to the rear lot line,
whichever is less. The use so extended shall be deemed to be conforming.
      (7)   Vacation of public ways. Whenever any street, alley or public way
is vacated, the zoning boundary line shall be automatically extended to the
center of such vacation and all areas included in the vacation shall then and
henceforth be subject to all regulation of the extended districts.
      (8)   District regulations apply to schools, parks, etc. Any area shown
on the Zoning Map as park, playground, school, cemetery, waterways, street
right- of-way, or any other public or semipublic uses, shall be subject to the
zoning regulations of the most restricted adjoining district.
      (9)   Where territory has been added by annexation. When property is
annexed into the City, appropriate districts will be determined by the Planning
Commission at the time of annexation based on a land use study prepared by a
designated representative of the City.
         (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1311.04 ANNEXATION.
   During the annexation process by City Council, the Planning Commission shall
study the area proposed for annexation to provide recommendations for the most
appropriate zoning district(s) which will carry out the objectives of this
Ordinance and the community plan. Should annexation procedures be completed
prior to receiving recommendations from the Planning Commission, the newly
annexed territory shall be classified under the zoning district of the area
within the corporate limits immediately adjacent to it. As soon as practically
possible after said annexation, but no later than six (6) months from the date
of said annexation, the Planning Commission shall complete its study and
forward its recommendation to the City Council.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1311.05 APPLICATION OF DISTRICT REGULATIONS.
   The regulations set forth by this Ordinance shall be minimum regulations and
shall apply uniformly to each class or kind of structure or land, and
particularly as follows:
   (a)   No building, structure or land shall hereafter be used or occupied,
and no building or structure or part thereof shall hereafter be erected,
constructed, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered unless in conformity

be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth in
this ordinance. Yards and lots created after the effective date of this
Ordinance shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this
Ordinance.

Overlay District
1314.01   Statement of legislative intent.
1314.02   Purpose and intent.
1314.03   Applicability and designation on Zoning Map.
1314.04   Applying for an Overlay District rezoning.

1314.09   Overlay District amendment or alteration.
1314.01 STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The purpose of overlay zoning districts is to allow the City to establish
special land use regulations, standards, or procedures in areas. Overlay zoning
districts are also an appropriate way to implement long-term goals and land use
requirements of the City for a specific property or location. Overlay zoning
districts are intended to be applied only where special circumstances justify
the modification of base zoning district regulations to achieve specific land
use and design objectives.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1314.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   This section is intended to encourage innovations through regulations
that will:
      (1)   Allow greater flexibility in the application of land use and
development regulations;
      (2)   Encourage the assembly and integrated development of parcels that
might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments to the detriment of    
surrounding neighborhoods;
      (3)   Promote a more economic and efficient use of land by allowing a
variety of commercial and industrial activities, a high level of urban
amenities, and the preservation of open space.
   (b)   While use of the Overlay District is an effective planning tool to
achieve the above purposes, it is not the City's intent to confer special
privileges to any land owner or compensate a land owner for areas of a property
that are otherwise unbuildable due to existing features or constraints on the
property. (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1314.03 APPLICABILITY AND DESIGNATION ON ZONING MAP.
   (a)   The Overlay District shall be applied to property through rezoning
pursuant to Article
1309. This article is to apply only to the following zones:
      Residential R-1, or
      Residential R-2, or
      Industrial I-1, or
      Commercial C-1, or
      Commercial C-2.
   (b)   The areas for consideration and qualification for Overlay District
status are those that are immediately, and completely adjacent to Main Street
(US 250) or Buffalo Street. The parcel to be considered is restricted to be
completely within the area defined on at least one border Main Street, and the
other sides by the lesser of:
      1 City recognized plat, or
      1 City street, or
      1 City alley, or
      150 feet.
   (c)   The Overlay District shall be permitted to adopt, and abide by, all
zoning ordinances of the Commercial (C-1 or C-2) Zone.
   The Overlay District Zone shall retain its Overlay District Zone status
until such time as:
      (1)   Reversion to initial base-zone is requested by current owner of the
Overlay District Zone, or
      (2)   The Overlay District Zone is submitted as a new Overlay District
Zone by the submission of a new Overlay District Development Plan [See Section
1314.06], or
      (3)   The Overlay District Zone has ceased to function within its
guidelines as proposed within its Overlay District Development Plan [See
Section
1314.06] for a period of not less than 6 months at which point the Zone
automatically reverts to base-zone regulations, or
      (4)   By recommendation to the Mayor and City Council, the Code
Enforcement Officer [Section
1305.01] deems the Zone to be out of compliance with the approved Overlay
District Development Plan and/or Commercial C2 ordinances courses of action may
be enacted pursuant to Section
1335.99.
   (d)   This district shall be designated on the Zoning Map by the suffix "OD"
followed by a file number assigned by the City.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1314.04 APPLYING FOR AN OVERLAY DISTRICT REZONING.
   To apply for an Overlay District rezoning, all criteria set forth in Section
1314.03 should be examined and met. The application process shall then proceed
as follows:
   (a)   Application Filing and Processing. An application for an Overlay
District Development Plan shall be filed and processed in compliance with
Mannington City Zoning Ordinance [Section
1307.05], and Section
1314.06. The cost of an application fee of $100 shall be assessed.
   (b)   Project Review, Notice, and Hearing. Each Overlay District Development
Plan application shall be analyzed to ensure that the application is consistent
with all applicable provisions of this article. Each application shall be
reviewed and acted upon by the Planning Commission at a public hearing held in
compliance with Article
1309.
   (c)   Findings, Decision, and Conditions. Following a public hearing, the
City Clerk shall record the Commission's decision and the findings upon which
the decision is based. The Commission may approve the Overlay District
Development Plan with or without conditions. The Commission's recommendations
and findings will be presented to City Council by the City Clerk for final
approval and adoption.
      (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1314.05 SPECIAL INITIATION PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Initiation of an Overlay District rezoning shall only be by Resolution
of the Planning Commission and by final approval by the City Council at a
public hearing. The applicant shall prepare a report that describes the purpose
of the proposed Overlay District rezoning. If the Commission, or Council,
chooses not to initiate an Overlay District filed by a property owner, all
unexpended processing fees related to the Overlay District application shall be
refunded to that applicant.
   (b)   Examples of why an Overlay District rezoning may not be approved
include, but are not limited to:
   •   Property not adjacent to Main Street (US 250).
   •    Property is not part of one of the approved zones.
   •    Property does not abut the appropriate zones.
   •   The City Council and or the City Planning Commission deem the project to
be out of conformance with the best interests of the City.
      (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1314.06 APPLICATION CONTENTS/OVERLAY DISTRICT DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   (a)   All applications for rezoning to an Overlay District shall be filed
with the City Clerk. The application shall include an Overlay District
Development Plan that shows the proposed development in sufficient detail for
thorough analysis of the proposal and its potential impact on nearby properties
and land uses.
   (b)   At a minimum, the Overlay District Development Plan shall identify the
following:
      (1)   A statement of goals and objectives for the project, and
explanation of why an Overlay District is necessary;
      (2)   Principal circulation routes and access points, including public
right-of-way widths;
      (3)   Community design elements, including parkways and other landscape
features, fencing and wall plans, streetscape and hardscape amenities, and
architectural concepts; and
      (4)   Special regulations, standards, or design guidelines necessary to
establish and implement the objectives of the Overlay District Development
Plan.
   (c)   An approved Overlay District Development Plan shall serve as an
exhibit of the Zoning Map and shall provide direction for future development
and usage of the Overlay District. The Overlay District Development Plan shall
be annotated with the assigned Overlay District number for reference against
the Zoning Map.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1314.07 FINDINGS FOR APPROVAL.
   Prior to the approval of an Overlay District rezoning, the findings required
in Article
1309 and as follows shall be made by the City Council:
   (a)   The proposed Overlay District overlay district is necessary to promote
the efficient use of land, safeguard the natural and built environment, obtain
high-quality public amenities, and/or achieve creative and imaginative design
superior to that which would be attainable under conventional zoning district
regulations.
   (b)   If the Overlay District will modify the allowable uses or development
regulations in any base zone district, the following findings shall be made:
      (1)   That the change to permitted or conditionally permitted uses is
necessary to achieve specific objectives to the Overlay District Development
Plan, and that the revision does not have the effect of restricting locally
undesirable land uses within the project.
      (2)   The land uses and development regulations allowed by the Overlay
District Development Plan are consistent with the City Comprehensive Plan.
         (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1314.08 CONDITIONS OF OVERLAY DISTRICT REZONING.
   As a condition of rezoning to an Overlay District, the City may apply other
regulations determined necessary to implement the intent and purpose of the
district. These regulations may include, but are not limited to, design
standards, infrastructure requirements, and environmental mitigation measures.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1314.09 OVERLAY DISTRICT AMENDMENT OR ALTERATION.
   The Overlay District Amendment process allows for minor modifications to the
land use boundaries or conditions of approval associated with an Overlay
District. Land use boundaries may be adjusted only to the extent that the
diversity of all land uses is maintained and the overall density or intensity
of land uses is within 20 percent of that identified in the Plan (e.g., number
of dwelling units, floor area ratio, etc.).
   (a)   Application Filing and Processing. An application for an Overlay
District Amendment shall be filed and processed in compliance with Mannington
City Zoning Ordinance Article
1309. The cost of an application fee of $100 shall be assessed.
   (b)   Project Review, Notice, and Hearing. Each Overlay District Amendment
application shall be analyzed to ensure that the application is consistent with
all applicable provisions of this article. Each application shall be reviewed
and acted upon by the Planning Commission at a public hearing held in
compliance with Article
1309.
   (c)   Findings, Decision, and Conditions. Following a public hearing, the
City Clerk shall record the Commission's decision and the findings upon which
the decision is based. The Commission may approve an Overlay District Amendment
with or without conditions when it finds that the proposed amendment:
      (1)   Is consistent with the intent and purpose of the Overlay District;
      (2)   Will result in development that is equal to or superior quality to
that approved in the original Overlay District, and
      (3)   Is compatible with the existing and anticipated land uses in the

1315.01 STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   It is the intent of Article
1315 Conditional Uses to provide certain uses which shall be permitted only if
adequate conditions exist or can be imposed that will make such uses compatible
with the purposes of this article and the Mannington Comprehensive Plan. The
conditional use permit procedure shall provide for some measure of
individualized judgment and the imposing of conditions or certain uses in order
to make them compatible with uses in the surrounding area and not harmful to
the natural environment.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1315.02 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize the issuance of a conditional use
permit for conditional uses only in accordance with the following provisions:
   (a)   Conditional uses for which conditional use permits may be issued shall
be deemed permitted uses, subject to meeting the conditions contained in this
article.
   (b)   Each conditional use shall be considered an individual case. Such use
shall conform to the standards of this article. In addition to the specific
requirements for each of the conditional uses, the Board shall find that:
      (1)   The conditional use is in general conformance to the Comprehensive
Plan.
      (2)   The conditional use fully complies with all applicable regulations
of this or other City ordinances.
      (3)   The use will be of such location, size and character that,
generally, it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development
of the zone in which the use is situated and will not be detrimental to
adjacent properties.
      (4)   The use will maintain a high quality of life, including reasonable
privacy, quiet, physical attractiveness, orderliness, safety, and other factors
through suitable screening of outdoor lighting and parking, truck loading,
refuse disposal, and outdoor storage areas from adjacent properties.
         (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1315.03 SPECIFIC ADDITIONAL STANDARDS.

shall be required to obtain a new conditional use permit before it can be
reestablished.
   (b)   Automotive Service Stations. Free standing automotive service stations
and other permitted uses that also provide for the sale of gasoline.
      (1)   Minimum lot size shall be 7,500 square feet.
      (2)   A site plan shall be filed with the application showing the
location of all buildings, tanks, service pumps and driveways, together with
all measurements necessary to show compliance with the following standards:
         A.   Service pumps shall not be located within twenty-five (25) feet
of any buildings occupied as a residence or for church, school or other
institutional purposes.
         B.   Service pumps shall not be located within fifteen (15) feet of
the right-of-way line of any street.
   (c)   Automobile salvage, outdoor storage and junk yards may not be located

at least eight (8) feet in height; no advertisement shall be permitted thereon
and must be kept in good order and repair at all times.
   (d)   Bed and Breakfasts. When three or more rooms are offered per site for
public accommodations, the establishment shall be owner-occupied and refuse
collection and storage areas shall be screened and should be accessible by
trucks, yet located where they will not disturb adjacent properties.

total floor area of the dwelling unit and in no event occupy more than 700
square feet of floor area.

   (h)   Historically Established Business Locations. Businesses may be
established within zones that would normally preclude a business-related
endeavor if the applicant business is to occupy a location that historically
supported business establishments. An example would be the use of a storefront
already established within a residential zone. As this is a conditional use,
and must be approved on a case-by-case basis by the Mannington Planning
Commission, the following guidelines shall be followed:
      (1)   The nature of the business will not be destructive or detrimental
to the intent of the zone in which the business will operate.
      (2)   No business type will be established in a zone that will cause undo
burden on locations in, or around, the location.
      (3)   Positive consideration will be made for the reuse of existing,
historical store frontage and locations.
      (4)   Signage and advertising will be limited to Wall Sign, Awning Sign
and Projection Sign types only and will be compliant with all other relevant
City Code, Section pertaining to signs.
      Because of the establishment of a business location within a non-business
zone, a conditionally approved business will reapply for a conditional permit
on a semi-annual (every two years) basis to review compliance and appropriate
use.
      (Ord. 445. Passed 10-21-19.)
   (i)   Single Family Dwellings. An individual may wish to establish a single-
family dwelling within zones intended for nonresidential structures and
activities. To support an individual in allowing such a use, an individual may
apply for a conditional use permit to allow for the establishment of an
otherwise unallowed single-family dwelling. This conditional use may be granted
given the following conditions:
      (1)   The establishment of a residence does not detrimentally impact the
intent of the zone in which it is, or is to be, established.
      (2)   The individual occupant(s) of the residence does not have current
or future grounds or influence to provide basis for modifying the zoning
ordinance of the occupied zone that would provide advantage to the conditional
use granted herein.
      (3)   The applicant will follow all Space, Bulk and Yard regulations for
R-1 (See Section
1313.09(a)).
      As this is a conditional use, it must be approved on a case-by-case basis
by the Mannington Planning Commission. The applicant will submit a conditional
use application to the City. The conditional use permit, if so granted, will be
in effect until such time that the residence becomes unoccupied for a period of
six (6) months for any reason, at which time the permit will be considered
expired and zoning reverts to that of the base zone. This period does not
include the time period of the initial construction, unless said construction
exceeds a period of one (1) year from the grant of the initial permit.
Exceeding this time will result in a new application process. (Ord. 446. Passed
10-21-19.)

determines the dimensions of the front yard in the block, but the maximum front
yard need not exceed thirty-five (35) feet from the lot line. Provided however,
that in the event an unimproved lot is situated between two improved lots, each
having a principal building within twenty feet of the side lot line of an
unimproved lot, the front yard may be reduced to a depth equal to that of the
greater front yard of the two adjoining lots, provided, however that it may not
be reduced to below ten (10) feet.

   (b)   Landscape Plan Requirements.
      (1)   No parking lot of twenty (20) or more spaces shall be constructed,

site prior to its development, such landscape materials may be used if approved
as meeting the requirements of this section.
   (d)   Planting Materials.

the side of any parking lot abutting the right-of-way except where driveway or
other openings may be required.
      (3)   One tree shall be planted for each forty (40) linear feet of the
landscaping strip in addition to other planting materials.
   (g)   Maintenance. The owner and their agencies shall be responsible for

conditions, replacing it when necessary, and keeping it free from refuse and
debris.
   (h)   Screening. The building, parking or loading areas for multi-family
residential, office, commercial, industrial and recreational uses shall be

of such screening may be provided by the berm.
      (4)   All screening shall follow the lot line of the lot to be screened
or to be arranged within the boundaries of the lot as to substantially hide
from adjoining properties the building, parking, loading area or other activity
required to be screened.
      (5)   Screening as permitted in subsection (h), shall be installed to
screen and reduce the visual impact of garbage waste disposal containers,
storage areas, on and above-grade mechanical and electrical equipment. The

   (j)   Lighting. Lighting plans for signs, building and structures shall be
shown on the Site Plan for the proposed development. Generally, lighting and
illumination shall be designed as to not be visible from any point off the lot
on which the sign, building or structure is being illuminated.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1317.06 PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Number of Parking Spaces Required. All developments in all zoning
districts, except for the central business core of the C-2 Highway Commercial
District as shown on the Zoning Map, shall provide a sufficient number of
parking spaces to accommodate the number of vehicles that ordinarily are likely
to be attracted to the development under consideration. The basis for
determining the required number of parking spaces shall be the Table of Parking
Requirements in subsection (c) hereof.
   The number of spaces required shall also include accessible spaces adjacent
to accessible routes in compliance with the Uniform Federal Accessibility
Standards.
   It is recognized by Council that the Table of Parking Requirements as set
forth cannot cover every possible situation that may arise, and therefore in
cases not specifically covered the permit-issuing authority is authorized to
determine the parking requirements using the table as a guide.
   (b)   Flexibility in Administration Required. The Council recognizes that
due to the particularities of any given development, inflexible application of
the parking requirement set forth in the Table may result with either
inadequate parking space or parking space far in excess of its needs.
Therefore, the permit-issuing authority may deviate from the requirements in
the Table of Parking Requirements and may require more or less parking whenever
it finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standards set
forth in the Table.
   Whenever the permit-issuing authority allows or requires a deviation from
the Table of Parking Requirements, the reasons for such deviation shall be
noted on the building permit.
   (c)   Table of Parking Requirements.

   (d)   Parking Space Dimensions.
      (1)   Each parking space shall contain a rectangular area at least
nineteen (19) feet long and nine (9) feet wide. Parking spaces for disabled
people shall have an adjacent aisle sixty (60) inches wide minimum. Two
accessible parking spaces may share a common access aisle.
      (2)   Whenever parking areas consist of spaces set aside for parallel
parking, the dimensions of such parking spaces shall be not less than twenty-
two (22) feet by nine (9) feet.
   (e)   General Design Requirements.
      (1)   Parking lot driveways shall be not less than ten (10) feet in width
for one-way traffic and eighteen (18) feet in width for two-way traffic except
that ten (10) foot driveways are permitted for two-way traffic when the
driveway is no longer than fifty (50) feet and serves no more than six (6)
spaces and sufficient turning space is provided so that vehicles need not back
into a public street.
      (2)   Unless no other practical alternative is available, vehicle parking
areas shall be designed so that vehicles may exit an area without backing onto
a public street. This requirement does not apply to one and two-family dwelling
units.
      (3)   Vehicle circulation areas of all developments shall be designed so
that sanitation, emergency and public service vehicles can serve such
developments without having to make hazardous or dangerous turning movements.
   (f)   Parking and Vehicle Circulation Area Surfaces.
      (1)   Parking and vehicle circulation areas including lanes for drive-
thru windows shall be graded and surfaced with asphalt, concrete or other
material that will provide equivalent protection against potholes, erosion and
dust, and shall be properly maintained in all respects including free from
potholes.
      (2)   Parking lots surfaced in accordance with subsection (f)(1) hereof,
shall be appropriately marked with painted lines or other markings.
   (g)   Joint Use of Required Parking Spaces.
      (1)   One parking area may contain required spaces for several different
uses, but except as provided for in this section, the required space assigned
to one may not be assigned to any other use.
      (2)   To the extent that developments that wish to make joint use of the
same parking spaces operate at different times, the same space may be credited
to both uses. For example, if a church parking lot is only occupied to 50
percent of capacity on days other than Sunday, another development could make
use of 50 percent of the church lots spaces on those other days.
   (h)   Satellite Parking.
      (1)   If the number of off-street parking spaces required by this section
cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot where the principal use
associated with the parking spaces is located, then spaces may be provided on
adjacent or nearby lots in accordance with provisions of this section. These
off-site spaces are referred to as satellite parking spaces.
      (2)   All satellite parking spaces (except spaces intended for employee
use) must be located within 400 feet of a public entrance of a principal
building. Satellite parking for employee parking may be located within any
reasonable distance.
      (3)   The developer wishing to take advantage of the provisions of this
section must present satisfactory written evidence that they have the
permission of the owner or other person in charge to use such spaces. The
developer must also sign an acknowledgment that the continued validity of the
permit depends on their continuing ability to provide the required number of
parking spaces.
   (i)   Loading and Unloading Areas. In all zoning districts, in connection
with every building hereafter erected to be occupied by uses requiring the
receipt or shipment by motor vehicles of materials or merchandise, there shall
be provided and maintained on the same premises off-street loading and
unloading space accessible from an alley or easement of access, or when there
is no such alley or easement of access, from a street.
      (1)   One loading space with a minimum dimension of 12 feet by 15 feet
with 14 foot overhead clearance shall be required for each 10,000 square feet
of gross floor area. If less than 10,000 square feet exists, 5,000 or more
square feet shall require one loading space.
      (2)   Loading and unloading areas shall be located and designed to
complete the loading and unloading without obstructing or interfering with any
public right-of-way, or parking space or parking lot aisle.
      (3)   No area allocated to loading and unloading facilities may be used
to satisfy the area requirements for off-street parking, nor shall any portion
of any off-street parking area be used to satisfy the area requirements for
loading and unloading facilities.
   (j)   Parking requirements in the central business core of the C-3 Highway
Commercial District and the Historic Residential District
   It is the intent of this Ordinance to ensure that each development provides
off- street parking in amounts sufficient to meet the anticipated parking
demand. The Council recognizes, however, that physical limitations of
properties in the Central Business District of the C-3 Highway Commercial
District and the Historic Residential District may prohibit strict compliance
with established parking requirements. Therefore, required parking in these
said districts shall be determined during Site Plan Review and approved by the
City Council based upon the characteristics of the specific site and the
availability of nearby on or off-street public parking.
   (k)   Accessibility Standards. The provision of accessible parking spaces
shall be in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Uniform
Federal Accessibility standards of April 1, 1988. The following table is to be
used as a minimum guideline. Complete requirements are to be found in the
Standards.
Total Parking in Lot Required Minimum Number of Accessible Spaces
1 to 25              1
26 to 50             2
51 to 75             3
76 to 100            4
101 to 150           5
151 to 200           6
201 to 300           7
301 to 400           8
401 to 500           9
501 to 1000          2% to total
1001 and over        20 plus 1 for each 100 over 1000
      (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1317.07 EXCAVATIONS.
   No excavations for the removal of gravel or mineral deposits of any kind
shall be permitted within the City limits. (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1317.08 NOTIFICATION BY LETTER.
   At least ten (10) days prior to the hearing the owners of all real property
located within 100 feet in all directions of the property which is the subject
of the hearing shall be notified in writing by certified mail. The notice the
public hearing shall include the date, time and place of the hearing, the
nature of the appeals to be considered, the identification of the subject
property by street address, if any, or by reference to lot numbers as shown on
the current county tax maps. The notice shall also contain the location and
times at which the application including maps, plans, and supporting documents
for which appeal is sought is available for review. Costs of notification by
letter shall be borne by the applicant.
   Notice by certified mail return receipt requested shall be deemed to be
complete upon mailing. The failure to give personal notice to any property
owner not shown on the latest current tax record shall not invalidate any
hearing or proceeding conducted pursuant to this Ordinance.

1319.01 STATEMENT OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   Through the site plan review, it is the intent of these regulations to
promote the general health, safety and welfare of the City. It is the further
intent of these regulations to ensure the optimum conservation, protection,
preservation, development and use of the natural and manmade resources of the
City by regulating land use activity throughout the City through review and
approval of site plans.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1319.02 GENERAL DESCRIPTION.
   "Planned Unit Development District" as used in this Ordinance, may be
superimposed over existing zoning districts as hereinafter provided for the
following purposes:
   (a)   To produce a development which would be as good or better than that
resulting from the lot-by-lot development by applying to large areas, whether
consisting of consolidated lots or un-subdivided property, the same principles
and purposes inherent in the required provisions applying to the individual lot
or minimum area parcels.
   (b)   To correlate comprehensively the provisions of this and other
ordinances and codes of the City, to permit development which would provide a
desirable and stable environment in harmony with the Comprehensive Plan for the
City and that of the surrounding area.
   (c)   To permit flexibility that will encourage a more creative approach in
the development of land and will result in a more efficient, esthetic and
desirable use of open area while at the same time maintain substantially the
same population density and area coverage permitted in the zone in which the
project is located.
   (d)   To permit flexibility in design, placement of buildings, use of open
spaces, circulation facilities and off-street parking areas, and to best
utilize the potentials of site characterized by special features of geography,
topography, size or shape.
      (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1319.03 USES PERMITTED.
   In the Planned Unit Development District, only the following uses are
permitted:
   (a)   In a residential planned unit development, the primary use in a
planned unit development shall be residential. There shall be no accessory or
special permitted uses in the District except recreational facilities and
common meeting or other common facilities as specified in the development plan
for use only by the residents in the unit and guests.
   (b)   In planned unit developments for other than residential uses, uses
shall be limited to those permitted in the zone in which the use is located.
      (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)

(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1319.07 DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   (a)   Procedure for Approval.
      (1)   A development plan, including both maps and text, shall be
submitted with the petition to the Mayor and Council and referred to the
Planning Commission for approval and recommendations of the Commission. The
Commission shall proceed in accordance with Section
1309.02 Planning Commission Review to consider the petition, its attachments,
and such evidence as petitioners or protesters may choose to present. After
arriving at its decision, the Commission shall present its recommendations to
Council in writing, which recommendations shall comply with the development
policies of the official plan of the City and the zoning classification of
which the Planned Unit Development District is to be part of. Recommendations
of the Commission may be absolute or conditional, adding to or deleting from
the provisions of the application. The petition and attachments shall be
prepared so as to comply also with the Subdivision Regulations of the City, so
that the subdivision review may be carried out simultaneously with the
development plan review.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the Commission's recommendations, Council shall
consider the petition with all attachments and other documents or information
submitted to the Commission, with the Commission's report on recommendations,
and approves or rejects the application as transmitted, or returns the matter
to the Commission for further study in accordance with Council's directions.
Approval by Council shall constitute a limitation on the use and design of the
site to the terms of the approved District.
      (3)   The development resulting from the application of the provisions of
this section shall be made a part of the Zoning Map and identified thereon by
appropriate reference to the detailed planned unit development map and
explanatory text, if any, either by number or by symbol.
   (b)   Amendment. Prior to completion, the development plan may be amended on
petition of the person or persons developing the plan, addressed to the Mayor
and Council, having the same information included or attached which is required
to be submitted with the original petition. The petition shall be referred to
the Commission and all procedures shall be the same as for initiating
petitions.
   (c)   Expiration.
      (1)   If construction of the plan is not commenced in good faith within
one year from the date of the District becoming effective, authorization for
the plan shall expire and Council shall forthwith take all action necessary to
remove the District from the Zoning Map. No action shall be taken by the
developer in furtherance of the plan after the date the authorization expires.
      (2)   Otherwise, the District shall remain in existence and effect and
being on the land affected, regardless of whether or not development is
proceeded with or completed until Council shall by appropriate action remove
the District from the Zone Map.

specifically provided in this article. In modifying such regulations,
requirements and standards as they may apply to a planned unit development
project, the following limitations shall apply:
   (a)   Yards. The requirements for front, side and rear yards for the zone in
which the planned unit development is located shall apply to all exterior
boundary lines of the site. Other yards shall be as approved on the plan.
   (b)   Open Spaces. In addition to all other requirements, not less than ten
percent (10%) of the total area of the site shall be set aside for permanent
open spaces, none of which shall be used for parking or vehicular right of way.
   (c)   Number of Dwelling Units. The maximum number of dwelling units
permitted shall be determined by dividing the development area, exclusive of

1321.01 CONTINUATION OF USE.
   Except as otherwise provided in this article, the lawful use of any
building, structure or land at the time of the enactment of this Zoning
Ordinance, or any applicable amendment thereto, may be continued, although such
use does not conform to the provisions of this Ordinance.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1321.02 REGULATIONS.
   No existing building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use shall be
enlarged, extended, reconstructed or structurally altered, except as follows:
   (a)   Restoration. If any nonconforming building or structure, which as a
result of fire, explosion or other casualty, has less than two-thirds of its
current market value made unsafe or unusable, such nonconforming building or
structure may be restored, reconstructed or used as before, provided that the
bulk, height and area requirements shall not be in excess of those started
within sixty days and completed within one year of such occurrence or the use
of such building, structure or land as a legal nonconforming use shall not be
extended to displace a conforming use.
   (b)   Extension and Displacement. A nonconforming use shall not be extended,
but any alteration or addition to any land or any alteration, addition or
replacement of or to any existing building or structure for the purpose of
carrying on any use prohibited under the zoning rules and regulations
applicable to the district is prohibited. If a nonconforming use has been
abandoned, any future use of such land, building or structure shall be in
conformity with the provisions of the ordinance regulating the use in the
district in which such land, building, or structure may be located.
   (c)   Unsafe Structures. Any nonconforming building or structure or portion
thereof declared unsafe by proper authority may be restored to a proper
condition, subject to limitations under subsection (a) hereof.
   (d)   Alterations and Repairs. A nonconforming building or structure of
other than residential purposes may not be reconstructed or structurally
altered during its life, unless such building or structure is changed to a
conforming use. A nonconforming structure or building containing a residential
use may be altered in any way to improve interior livability provided that no
structural alteration shall be made which would increase the nonconformity with
regard to the number of housing units and incidental alterations of a building
or structure containing a nonconforming use shall be permitted provided that
such repairs and alterations do not exceed the volume or area of space occupied
by the nonconforming use.
   (e)   Change of Use. A nonconforming use of a structure may not be changed
to another nonconforming use; provided, however, that the Board of Zoning
Appeals may permit a change in a nonconforming use to a use permitted in the
next most restrictive zone consistent with the surrounding zoning district upon
such terms and conditions as such Board may prescribe; provided further,
however, that a nonconforming use so changed shall not revert to a use in the
less restrictive zone other than the zone it was initially changed to. Any new
business, if it meets the same zoning district of the original change, need not
obtain Board of Zoning Appeals approval. This subsection does not apply to any
nonconforming use not recognized in the current Zoning Ordinance.
   (f)   Prior Approval. Nothing herein contained shall require any change in
the plans, construction or designated use of a building complying with existing
laws, a permit for which had been duly granted before the date of adoption of
this Ordinance or any applicable amendment thereto, provided that such building
shall be completed according to such plans as filed within six months from the
date of this Ordinance.
      (Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1321.03 TERMINATION.
   (a)   Abandonment. The discontinuance of a nonconforming use for a period of
sixty days or the change of use of a conforming use for any period of time
shall be considered abandonment thereof, and such nonconforming use shall not
thereafter be revived.
   (b)   Partial Destruction. Any nonconforming building or structure, which as
a result of fire, explosion or other casualty, has two-thirds or more of its
estimated true value destroyed, the use of such building or structure, as a
nonconforming use, shall thereafter be terminated and any new construction
shall be in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Amortization and Fencing. Nonconforming signs shall be discontinued
and removed or changed to a use permitted in the respective district not later
than one year after the adoption of this Ordinance.
   Every junk yard existing as a nonconforming use, shall, within one year
after becoming nonconforming, be completely enclosed with a continuous solid
fence or evergreen hedge found on determination of the Zoning inspector to be
of such height and character as to screen all of the operations for public
view. Such fence or hedge shall be adequately maintained and in full conformity
with any conditions attached to such approval.

1335.01 APPROVAL.
   A final plat of a subdivision shall not be recorded by the County Clerk
unless it has first been approved, dated, and stamped by the Planning
Commission.
   (a)   The filing and recording of a plat involving the subdivision of lands
covered by the Subdivision Regulations shall be without legal effect unless
approved by the Commission; provided, that failure to obtain Commission
approval shall not invalidate or affect the title to any land within the area
of such plat; provided, however, that if such plat shall bear the seal of the
Commission it shall be presumed to have been approved thereby.
   (b)   Prior to the approval of the final plat, the subdivider shall have
installed or constructed all improvements as detailed in the City of Mannington
Design and Construction Standards Manual as referenced in Article
1343.
   (c)   For purposes of this article "subdivision" as used herein shall not
include the division of land by adjoining property owners to effect a boundary
adjustment if the same does not result in additional lots and if the tract,
parcel or lot divided becomes a part of the adjoining lot or lots, provided,
however, that no such division shall serve to create any condition which does
not otherwise comply with the terms and provisions of the ordinances of the
City. Also, "subdivision" shall not include the subdivision as a result of a
partition of land by an appropriate court of law or the division of land for
public purposes such as public schools, parks, roads and utility systems.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1335.02 INSPECTIONS.
   A duly authorized agent of the City shall conduct periodic in-the-field
inspections of all construction and installations required under these
Subdivision Regulations during the time of construction requirements of these
Regulations. He shall also conduct a final inspection of the construction and
installations required and shall make and certify to the Commission a report of
compliance by the subdivider before the final plat is approved.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1335.03 MODIFICATIONS, VARIANCES AND WAIVERS.
   If it is determined that strict compliance with these Subdivision
Regulations would result in undue and unnecessary hardship to the subdivider
due to the unusual topography or conditions beyond the control of the
subdivider then the Planning Commission may modify, vary or waive such
requirements provided that such modifications, variance or waiver will not
nullify the intent or purpose of these Regulations, and provided further that
such modification, variance or waiver and the reason therefore shall be entered
upon the minutes of the Commission.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1335.04 VARIANCE CONDITIONS AND APPLICATIONS.
   (a)   In granting modifications, variances and waivers, the Planning
Commission may attach such other reasonable conditions as will, in its
judgment, justify such modifications, variances and waivers and still maintain
substantially the objectives of these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   Each and every modification, variance or waiver of these Regulations
sought by the subdivider shall be specifically applied for in writing in letter
application form setting forth the reasons that the subdivider feels he
qualifies under this article. Any condition shown on the plat which would
require a modification, variance or waiver, shall constitute a ground for
disapproval of the plat unless such special application for modification,
variance or waiver is made and granted by the Commission.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1335.05 PERMIT.
   Prior to the issuance of a building permit allowing the construction of any
structures, the subdivision must have final plat approval.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1335.06 AMENDMENT.
   Council may from time to time adopt amendments that will tend to increase
the effectiveness of these Subdivision Regulations and expedite the approval of
the subdivision plats. These Regulations and amendments thereto may be
modified, changed, amended or rescinded only by action of Council by following
the same procedure set forth in West Virginia Code 8-24-18 to 8-24-22 for the
adoption of a Comprehensive Plan.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1335.99 PENALTY.
   Under the provisions of West Virginia Code 8-24-66 to 8-24-68, any

other legal entity who subdivides any lot, tract or parcel of land, lays out,

         A.   A division of land for residential development into lots, tracts,
parcels or other divisions of land of five to ten acres shall be regulated by

appropriate court of law, or the division of land for public purposes such as
public schools, parks, roads and utility systems.

insure compliance with any of the requirements of these Subdivision
Regulations.
   (b)   Approval or Rejection. The Commission shall notify the subdivider of
the scheduled date, place, time and agenda of the meeting at which the proposed
preliminary plat is to be reviewed. The date for such meeting shall not be more
than sixty days from the date of submission of the preliminary plat for

approval, conditional approval or disapproval. If approved conditionally, and
if necessary, the Planning Commission may require the subdivider to submit a
revised preliminary plat. If any of the requirements are modified or waived,
the reasons for such shall be specified. If the Commission should disapprove
the preliminary plat, recommendations shall be made on the basis of which the
proposed subdivision would be approved. Approval of a preliminary plat shall
not constitute approval of a final plat, but rather shall indicate an
expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a
basis to the preparation of the final plat. The Commission shall retain the
preliminary plat.
   (c)   Approved Plat. Once the preliminary plat is approved by the
Commission, the construction of the infrastructure shall begin. The
installation of all utilities, streets, lighting, sidewalks, and any other
improvements shall be installed as regulated by the City of Mannington Design

1339.05 FINAL PLAT SUBMISSION.
   The subdivider shall submit the final plat to the Planning Commission or
secretary thereof. Upon the receipt of the final plat, the Commission shall set
a date, time and place for a hearing; notify the applicant of the scheduled
place, date, time and agenda of the hearing, at which the subdivision and final
plat thereof are to be considered; and at least thirty days prior to the date
set for hearing shall publish a notice of the date, time and place of the
hearing as a Class I legal advertisement in compliance with the provisions of
West Virginia Code Article 59-3; and shall notify by direct mail any
governmental unit having a probable interest in the proposed plat of the date,
time and place of such hearing.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1339.06 ACTION ON FINAL PLAT.

shall be granted, the Commission shall employ the guidelines set forth in West
Virginia Code 8-24-30 and the requirements of these Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   Hearing; Submission of Record; Approval or Disapproval. After the
public hearing, the Commission shall approve or disapprove the final plat. If
the Commission approves the plat, it shall affix the Commission's seal upon the
lower right hand corner of the plat. If it disapproves the plat, it shall set
forth its reasons and supply the applicant with a copy thereof. In either case,
the applicant will be notified of the results by certified mail.
   (c)   Fees. The City shall establish a uniform schedule of fees proportioned
to the cost of checking and verifying proposed plats and conduction field
inspections of the infrastructure installation. An applicant shall pay the
specified fee at the time of filing his application for preliminary plat
approval.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1339.07 DISPOSITION OF PLATS.

1339.08 APPROVAL OF PLAT; FAILURE OF COMMISSION TO ACT.
   In the event that the Planning Commission fails to approve or disapprove a
final plat within 120 days from submission of the final plat, such plat shall
be deemed to have been approved by the Commission, and a certificate to that
effect shall be issued by the Commission and/or the seal of the Commission
shall be affixed upon such final plat upon demand; provided however, that the
applicant may waive this requirement and consent to the extension of such
period.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)
1339.09 PLATTING REQUIREMENTS.
   Per City of Mannington Design and Construction Standards Manual as
referenced in Article
1343 Design and Construction Standards Code.
(Ord. 310. Passed 9-16-96.)

should not be located in a special flood hazard area if at all possible. If a
critical facility must be located in a special flood hazard area it should be
provided a higher level of protection so that it can continue to function and
provide services during a flood.
      (9)   Development: Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or

Emergency Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway information,
and water surface elevations.
      (13)   Floodplain:
         A.   A relatively flat or low land area adjoining a river, stream, or
watercourse which is subject to partial or complete inundation;
         B.   An area subject to the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff
of surface waters from any source.
      (14)   Floodway: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land area that must be reserved to discharge the base flood without

foundation. The primary use of the LAG is to determine whether the structure is
located within a special flood hazard area by comparing it to the base flood
elevation.
      (23)   Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished enclosure constructed with flood resistant
materials as defined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2 and usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area

water should not damage structures and any subsurface waters related to the
base flood should not damage existing or proposed structures.
      (34)   Special Flood Hazard Area: The land in the floodplain subject to a
one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30,
and A99. This term shall also include areas shown on other flood hazard maps
that are specifically listed or otherwise described in this ordinance.
      (35)   Start of Construction: The date the permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
      (36)   State Coordinating Office: The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management.
      (37)   Stream: As defined in WV State Code 7-1-3U, any watercourse,
whether natural or man-made, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of
their size, through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless
of its volume.
      (38)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (39)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."
      (40)   Substantial Improvement:
         A.   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the Start of Construction of the
improvement.
         B.   This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         C.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
          D.   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
      (41)   Top of Bank: The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (42)   Violation: The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all the requirements of this article. Any structure or other
development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate or other evidence of compliance required by this article is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
(Ord. 402. Passed 2-6-12.)
1731.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Mannington which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood,
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Mannington by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated 06/19/2012 or the most recent revision
thereof including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by the City of Mannington by use of
historic or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized "Local
Flood Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the
level of technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall consist of the
following four specific areas:
         A.   The Floodway. shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
         B.   The Floodway Fringe. shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
         C.   The AE Area without Floodway. shall be those areas identified as
an AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
         D.   The Approximated floodplain. shall be those areas identified as
an A zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the City of Mannington where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
      (2)   A City of Mannington's base flood elevations may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon
as practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the City of Mannington shall notify the NFIP Administrator
of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The City of Mannington may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard
Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such
as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning the location of
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Mannington. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail. Elevation data certified by a Licensed
Professional Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this article if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the
applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either; (1) The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study, or (2) The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the
City of Mannington in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall
then be required to conform to all appropriate flood damage reduction
provisions of this article.
(Ord. 402. Passed 2-6-12.)
1731.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway. Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the City of Mannington during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The
resultant engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (1)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
City of Mannington, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the
adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood
hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland
limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe. Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE without Floodway. Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine; The amount being invested and, The specific
flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the
applicant to determine the elevation above which the development will be
reasonably safe from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are
required, they shall only be undertaken by a Registered Professional Engineer
who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (e)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of Mannington, The Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition prior to issuing the local
permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval..
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Mannington in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City of Mannington a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1731.08(c).
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
         (Ord. 402. Passed 2-6-12.)
1731.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.

      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed development is
to occur.
      (3)   Names, addresses, and valid WV license numbers of all contractors
working at the building site, or affidavits stating that work is being
performed by individuals exempt from contractor licensing as set forth in Title
28, Series 2, section 3.9 (b) of the West Virginia Code of state regulations or
the most recent revision thereof.
      (4)   A description of Site location sufficient to locate the project
including tax map and parcel number and most recent deed book and page number.
      (5)   A standard site plan showing size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow, the
lowest adjacent grade to the proposed foundation and/or toe of fill, the Base

Floodplain Administrator for review within five (5) business days of contract
signing. The City of Mannington does not require and will not keep copies of
the contracts or addendums. Failure to present contract or addendums for review
shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is
of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including materials and
labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information.
      (1)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the elevation of the lowest floor above the
freeboard height required by this ordinance.
      (2)   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following
information shall also be included in the application for work within the
Special flood hazard area:
         A.   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
            1.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
            2.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
            3.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, etc. When required by the Floodplain
Administrator, a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall prepare
these plans.
            4.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
            5.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic
elements of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical
construction, it is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by
obtaining elevation data completed by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Licensed Professional Surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a
mistake in elevation has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
            6.   A finished construction elevation certificate shall be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate shall confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with
permit conditions.
            7.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the City of Mannington determines that the area below the first floor
could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas
below base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement shall
state:
               a.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
               b.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1731.08(c).
         B.   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base
Flood Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements
contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by
increasing the level of flood proofing above the height required by this
ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood insurance rate on
dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one foot above
the Base Flood Elevation.
            1.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared
by a Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed
structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
            2.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing

            3.    In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion
agreement and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion
agreement to any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of
the transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1731.08(c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria:
      (1)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
         A.   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
         B.   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
         C.   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
         D.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments
which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the
approximated floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2)
acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and
shall delineate a floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain
Administrator.
            1.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
            2.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
            3.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
         E.   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
approximated floodplain area (Zone "A") boundary depicted on the map,
development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In
these cases the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly
delineate the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard
boundary area as scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer
or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
      
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
(Ord. 402. Passed 2-6-12.)

1731.06(a)(1) are applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance with this
article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence of
this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a copy of all
new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to
transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1731.08(c).
   (d)   Recreational Vehicle Placement.
      (1)   Recreational vehicles to be placed within any special flood hazard
area shall either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
      B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions. Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
   (e)   Fill. The City of Mannington officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Therefore;
      (1)   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
      (2)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
      (3)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (4)   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1731.04(a). All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or
exceed the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The City of Mannington may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City of Mannington During permit review the City of
Mannington shall consider the following issues that have the potential to cause
adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the
perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         H.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map Revision
based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         J.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback.
      (1)   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage.
      (1)   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      (2)   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (l)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area.

being inspected conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1731.08(c).
      (3)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the development conforms to the requirements of this local law. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1731.08(c).
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this article or local administrative procedures, and
any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing
certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a
condition of permit approval.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   A Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by the City of Mannington
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this article shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to the City of Mannington based upon a set schedule approved by the
City of Mannington using the estimated value of the proposed construction as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
City of Mannington for any additional costs for services necessary for review
and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the County for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.
         (Ord. 402. Passed 2-6-12.)
1731.08 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals. Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provision of this ordinance, it is
the right of that person to appeal to the Town Council of the City of
Mannington which shall be known as the Appeals Board. Such appeal shall be
filed with the Town Council of the City of Mannington, in writing, within
thirty (30) days after notification of the decision. Upon receipt of such
appeal, the Appeals Board shall set a time and place not less than (ten (10)
nor more than (sixty (60) days for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of
the time and place of the hearing shall be given to all parties at which time
they may appear and be heard. The determination by the Appeals Board shall be
final in all cases.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria.
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or
the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this ordinance
shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that
failure to grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of an appeal will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a City of Mannington official that (i) the issuance of a decision
to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result
in increased premium rates for flood insurance, (ii) such construction below
the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and property. Such
notifications shall be maintained with a record of all decisions; and
         E.   The Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such decisions
issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
         F.   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any
construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)   Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the City of Mannington,
shall be unlawful and shall be referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Mannington of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. In default
of such payment such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed 10
days. Each day during which any violation of this article continues shall
constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other
actions are hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or non-compliance with, this article shall not excuse the
violation or non-compliance with the article or permit it to continue; and all
such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-
compliance within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, altered or relocated in non-compliance with this article may be
declared by the Town Council of the City of Mannington to be a public nuisance
and abatable as such.
