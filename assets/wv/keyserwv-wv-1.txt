EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

corporations, for a limited time, the occupancy of portions of the streets,
alleys, roads and public grounds as may be necessary for works of public
utility and service, such as steam railway tracks, street railway tracks, poles
and trolley wires, telegraph and telephone poles and subways, electric light
and other electric poles, waterworks, wires, and subways and gas and steam pipe
lines.  But no such franchise shall hereafter be granted except under the
following restrictions and conditions, namely:
   No ordinance granting any franchise for the use of the streets, roads,
alleys or public grounds of the municipality, for any of the purposes of public
utility above named, or for any other purpose of like nature, except as
hereinafter provided, shall be passed unless it shall have been first proposed
in the council; and notice of the object, nature and extent of such franchise
shall be published at least thirty days by the applicant, at his expense, in
some newspaper published in said municipality, before being acting upon, and
shall have received the votes of at least a majority of all of the members
elected to the council and citizens appointed as provided in Section Nine, at a
regular meeting or meetings, and after said publication.  The votes thereon
shall  be taken by yeas and nays, and the same entered in the journal.  Upon
being passed by the council the ordinance granting  said franchise shall be
forthwith transmitted by the municipal clerk to the mayor for his approval or
disapproval, and in case of his disapproval of same, it shall not be considered
as passed unless it again receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the
members elected to the council and citizens appointed as provided in Section
Nine.  If the franchise is amended, after having been vetoed by the mayor, it
shall be subject to the veto of the mayor as in the first instance.  After the
ordinance granting such franchise has been passed, it shall be published in
full, at the expense of the applicant, at least once within the period of ten
days thereafter, in some newspaper of general circulation in the municipality
and one copy of the same shall be filed with the municipal clerk, who shall
preserve the same as a public record.
   The council may grant a permit at any time in or upon any street, road,
alley or public place; provided, that such permit may be revocable by the
council at its pleasure, at any time, whether such right to revoke be expressly
reserved in every such permit or not.
   All franchises and privileges hereafter granted shall plainly specify on
what particular streets, road, alley or other public property the same shall
apply, and no franchise or privilege shall hereafter be granted by the
municipality in general terms, or to apply to the municipality generally.  No
exclusive franchise shall ever be granted, and no franchise shall be renewed
before three years prior to its expiration.
   Every grant of any franchise shall be for a limited period of time.  If no
limit be expressly provided in the grant, the franchise shall be for one year
only.  In no case shall the franchise extend for a period exceeding thirty
years.
   No grant of any such franchise shall be made without, at the time of making
it, providing that the grantee shall indemnify the municipality against all
damages caused by the construction of such works.  All reasonable additional
provisions and conditions may be made for the protection of the public from
unnecessary damages or inconveniences by reason of such works and the operation
thereof.
   No extension or enlargement of any franchise or grant of rights or powers
previously granted to any corporation, person or association of persons, shall
be made except in the manner and subject to all the conditions herein provided
for the making of original grants of franchises.
   Council shall, in suitable, practical terms, make it an express condition of
the grant of a franchise, where it is for work that is useful chiefly to the
local public, that, at the expiration of the franchise, the grantee shall, if
required by the council, sell to the municipality the physical plant at what it
is then worth independent of any value based upon the earning power thereof,
and may also provide a means by arbitration or otherwise for determining what
said value may be.
   No grant of a franchise for any extension of, or addition to, any line of
such work, over any street or territory in said municipality, shall be made for
a period extending beyond the time limited for the expiration of the franchise
of the principal work of which it is an extension, and if the franchise of the
principal company or work is one which was granted before this act goes into
effect, the franchise  granted for the extension or addition shall nevertheless
be subject to the condition hereof, including a time limit herein specified.
   If a franchise secured from the municipality by an individual or by an
independent or new company, and the work constructed thereunder afterwards
become a part of, or to be operated as a part of, a large work of the same
kind, whose franchise was previously obtained and is limited to expire earlier,
such later franchise shall, by reason of such annexation, merger or single
operation, expire simultaneously with such earlier franchise of the old company
or work. An annual franchise tax of not less than fifty dollars shall be
charged and collected on all franchises heretofore granted by the towns of
Keyser and South Keyser or hereafter granted by the city.
SECTION 22.  MANDAMUS.
   In all cases where any individual, association of individuals or corporation
has obtained or shall obtain any right, privilege or franchise to operate a
street car line, lines of cars in whole or in part upon the streets, roads or
alleys of the municipality, or to furnish to such municipality or the
inhabitants thereof water, gas or electricity, or to construct or operate a
telephone or telegraph system in any such municipality, and the terms,
conditions or manner of exercising such right, privileges or franchises are
embodied in the ordinance or resolution of the municipality, or are otherwise,
either voluntarily or by law, imposed or assumed by said individual,
association of individuals or corporation, then and in each of such cases the
circuit court of Mineral county shall have power by mandamus to compel such
individual, association of individuals or corporation and their assigns, to use
and exercise such right, privilege or franchise in accordance with the terms
and conditions and in the manner prescribed in said ordinance or resolution or
otherwise lawfully so defined or assumed, and to do and perform each and every
obligation and duty attached to such right, privilege or franchise, whether or
not such obligation and duty be voluntarily assumed or by law attached thereto
or imposed thereby.
   Such mandamus may be awarded at the instance of the municipality in its
corporate name, or at the instance of any taxpayer or taxpayers; and the
forgoing remedy by mandamus shall not be construed to deprive such municipal
corporation, or any inhabitant thereof, of any other remedy given by law to
compel such individual, association of individual or corporation to comply with
the terms, conditions and agreements of such right, privilege, or franchise, or
of the right to recover damages for their failure so to do, or to effect,
remove or lesson the liability of such individual, association of individuals
or corporation, to forfeiture of such right, privilege or franchise for failure
so to use and exercise such right, privilege or franchise.
SECTION 23 PAVEMENTS AND SIDEWALKS.
   The council shall have the right to establish the width of any sidewalk
along any street, alley or public square, or portion thereof, and any owner, of
ground fronting on such street, alley or public square, shall in such manner as
the council shall reasonably proscribe, pave and curb the sidewalk adjacent to
such property.  In case of a failure or refusal of such owner to pave or curb
the same, the council may cause the same to be properly curbed and paved by the
city, and levy and collect from such owner, the whole cost of such curbing and
paving adjacent to such property, with a penalty of five per centum added
thereto, together with six per centum interest until paid; and in like manner
to require the owner of any property adjacent to any paved sidewalk heretofore
or hereafter constructed, to keep the same in repair and in default of doing
so, to cause the same to be repaired and to levy and collect from said owners
the whole cost thereof with a penalty of five per centum added thereto together
with six per centum interest per annum until paid.  In all cases of such
assessment, whether for the original or for the repairing of sidewalks, payment
thereof, including penalties and interest, shall be made to the city clerk
within thirty days after the completion of the work, who shall have power to
collect the same from the owner or owners of any such property, by distress and
sale in the same manner in which taxes levied for the benefit of the city are
authorized to be collected; and in addition, there shall be a lien upon such
real estate, which lien may be enforced by appropriate suit in any court of
record of Mineral county.
SECTION 24.  NUISANCES.
   The council of said city is hereby authorized to decide and adjudge what
constitutes a nuisance within the municipality, or within two miles thereof,
when not within the limits of another municipality and may require and compel
the person committing or maintaining the same, or any owner, agent, assignee,
occupant or tenant, of any lot, premises, property, building or structure, upon
or in which any nuisance may be, to abate and remove the same upon order from
such municipal body, or from the board of health, or health officer, or other
officer of the municipality acting with authority in the premises; and the
council may prescribe by ordinance a penalty for the punishment of any such
person who may refuse, fail or neglect to abate or remove any such nuisance
within the time specified in the notice therefor.
   The council may also by its own officers, appointees and employees, abate
and remove nuisances, after reasonable notice to the owner, occupant, tenant,
agent or assignee to abate and remove such nuisance, and collect the expense
thereof, with one per centum per month interest added from the date of said
notice, from said owner, occupant, tenant, agent or assignee, by distress or
sale in the same manner in which taxes levied upon real estate for the benefit
of the municipality are authorized to be collected under this act; and the
expense shall remain a lien upon said lot or part of lot the same as taxes
levied upon real estate in the municipality, which lien is in addition to the
remedy specified in this section and may be enforced as provided in Section
Twenty-five of this act.
   In case of nonresident owners of real estate, such notice may be served upon
any tenant, occupant, assignee or rental agent of said premises, or on such
nonresident owner or infant or insane owner by publication thereof for not less
than two consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in the municipality.  The
abatement or removal of any such nuisance by the municipality, and at its
expense, as herein provided, shall be prima facie proof that the said notice to
the owner, occupant, tenant, agent or assignee was given as herein required.
   The council may require all owners, tenants and occupants of improved
property, which may be located upon or near any street, road, alley, along
which may extend any sewer or system of sewerage, which the municipality may
construct, own or control, to connect with such sewer or system of sewerage,
all drains, cesspools, sinks, privies or water closets, upon their respective
properties, or premises, so that their contents may be made to empty into such
sewer or system of sewerage.
   And in all cases where any tenant, occupant or agent is required to abate
and remove any nuisance, under the provisions of this section, or comply with
the provisions of any such ordinance as is mentioned herein, the expense
thereof may be deducted out of the accruing or accrued rent of said property,
or amount due said owner or agent, and such tenant, occupant or agent may
recover the amount so paid from the owner, unless otherwise especially agreed
upon between them.
   The council may by ordinance regulate the location, construction, repair,
use, emptying, and cleaning of all water closets, privies, cesspools, sinks,
plumbing, drains, yards, pens, stables and other places where offensive or
dangerous substances or liquids are or may accumulate and may provide suitable
penalties for the violation of such regulations which may be enforced against
the owner, agents, assignees, occupant or tenant of any premises or structure
where such  violation may occur.
   The council shall have authority and jurisdiction of and over the water
reservoirs, pipe lines and property adjacent, and all other property of the
city located in Mineral County, whether the same be within the corporate limits
of said city or not, and for the protection and preservation of the same shall
have authority to pass all necessary ordinances, rules and regulations and to
provide penalties for the violation thereof; and the police judge, or officer
exercising his functions, shall have jurisdiction to try offenders against such
ordinances, and his warrant may be directed to any police officer of the city,
or to any constable or the sheriff of Mineral County, and may be served and the
offender arrested anywhere in said county.
SECTION 25  LIEN FOR TAXES, ETC.
   There shall be a lien on real estate within said city for city taxes

the owners thereof, by the authorities of such city, including expenses for
making sidewalks and paving and curbing the same, and for furnishing water,
electric lights or other public utilities when furnished by and said city, from
the time the same are assessed or imposed, which shall have priority over all
other liens except taxes or debts due the United States and the lien for taxes
due the state, county or district; and such lien may be enforced by the council
in the same manner provided by law for the enforcement of a lien for county
taxes, and any time after six months after such lien attaches, the city may in
its own corporate name proceed to the enforcement of said lien against the real
estate chargeable therewith by a suit in equity.  If any real estate within
said city be returned delinquent for the nonpayment of city taxes due thereon,
a copy of such delinquent list shall be certified by the council to the auditor
of this state and the same may be sold for city taxes, interest and commissions
thereon in the same manner, at the same time, and by the same officers as real
estate is sold for state taxes; and a return of such sales made to and a deed
executed therefor, if not redeemed, in the same manner and with like effect, as
the return of sales of real estate for state taxes is made and deed therefor
executed to the purchasers.
   Liens against real estate for the cost of abating or removing nuisances by
the municipality, as provided in Section Twenty-four herein and the cost of
constructing and repairing sidewalks, walkways and curbs by the municipality as
provided in Section Twenty-three herein, may be enforced by suit in equity,
before any court having jurisdiction, as other liens against real estate  are
enforced, and this remedy shall be in addition to the imposition of all other
remedies and penalties in the premises under the provision of this act;
provided, that in the case of laying or repairing sidewalks, and abating
nuisances, there shall be first admitted to record in the Office of the Clerk
of the County Court of Mineral County, an abstract or statement of the
judgement of the council fixing the amount of the expense of laying or 
repairing such sidewalk or curb or abating or removing such nuisance, together
with the penalty of one per centum per month on said amount from the time so
fixed until paid, as provided in this act.  Said abstract or statement may be
certified by the City Clerk; and after the amount of the assessment and penalty
is due by the terms of the ordinance or resolution laying the same, and a
certificate of such levy and assessment, together with the name of the owner
and occupier of said property, its location and description, has been filed in
the Office of the Clerk of the County Court of Mineral County, and in
satisfaction of the amount so due such municipality, and cost of the
proceeding, the said real estate may be sold, and the proceeds applied to the
payment of the amount so due.
   Water, electric light, power and heating bills and other bills of like kind
due the municipality, owning or operating such plant or plants, may be
distrained for and collection enforced in the same manner in which the
collection of taxes owing to the municipality may be enforced.  The municipal
authorities may also shut off the supply of such water, light, heat, power or
other commodity from such delinquent person or company and refuse thereafter to
furnish such service or commodity to said delinquent until all arrearages are
paid.

amended in its passage as to change its general purpose.  No ordinance shall be
considered for final passage at the meeting at which it is introduced, unless
by unanimous consent entered of record.  No ordinance shall contain more than
one subject, which shall be clearly expressed in its title; nor shall any
ordinance be passed by the council unless a majority of all the members elected
to the council shall concur therein by yeas and nays when the question is put
upon its passage.
SECTION 29  ORDINANCES AND VETOES SHALL BE RECORDED, ETC.
   All ordinances passed by the council, and vetoes of the mayor, shall be
spread at large upon the journal, and at the next regular meeting such
ordinances and vetoes shall be read in open council, and the mayor shall sign
said minutes, when found correct or corrected, in the presence of the council. 
The council shall provide a well bound book in which shall be copied all
ordinances in the order in which they are passed, which ordinances so copied
shall be compared  with the originals by the mayor and shall be signed by him
when found correct.  Such book shall be indexed so as to show in brief form the
substance of the ordinance.  All copies thereof certified, under the hand of
the City Clerk and the seal of the City, shall be received by all courts and
justices in this state as evidence.  But the council may adopt, by ordinance,
properly designating and describing it, a code of laws and ordinances, which
when adopted shall be printed in book form, or it may be adopted as a whole
after it is printed, and the said code shall be and become the laws and
ordinances of said City, and shall be received as such in all courts of this
state, and the printed volumes published under the order of the council shall
be so received as evidence of what is printed therein until errors or omissions
be affirmatively shown therein.
SECTION 30  DUTIES OF THE CITY CLERK.
   The City Clerk shall serve for a term of two years, unless sooner removed
for cause.  He shall, before entering upon the discharge of his duties as such
clerk, take and subscribe to the oath of office prescribed in Section Fifteen
of this act, and shall execute such bond as shall be fixed by council which
bond shall be approved by council and filed with the treasurer.
   In addition to all other duties prescribed in this act, the City Clerk shall
keep the records of the council, and he, or his deputy, shall be present at all
regular and special meetings of that body.  It shall be his duty to properly
record in a well bound book all the proceedings of council as well as a
complete record of all ordinances, franchises, bonds, permits and resolutions
adopted or passed by council, and to properly index the same, for the
convenience and inspection of the council, or any city official or taxpayer.
   Before any business at any regular meeting of the council is undertaken it
shall be the duty of the clerk to read publicly to the council the minutes of
all regular or special meeting of that body, not therefore read or approved,
and upon approval of same by council, the signatures of the mayor and clerk
shall forthwith be affixed.  All records of council so approved and signed, or
duly authenticated copy thereof, signed by the clerk and under the seal of the
city, shall be admitted as evidence in any proper case in any court in this
state.
   The City Clerk, except as may be otherwise herein provided, shall be the
custodian of the records and papers of the city and the seal of the city, which
shall be kept by him at his office, and the records and papers shall be open to
public inspection at all proper hours.  He shall, acting under existing laws,
in so far as they are not in conflict with this act, perform such duties
relating to all city elections held under this act, as the clerks of the
circuit or county courts perform, under state laws, in relation to the holding
of general or special elections; and he shall likewise be the custodian of all
registration books, ballots, tally sheets, etc., pertaining to all municipal
elections.
   The City Clerk shall have power within the municipality to administer oaths
and take acknowledgments of deeds and other instruments required by law to be
acknowledged, in the same manner and with like effect and under the same
penalties as notaries public, justices of the peace and other officers of the
state are authorized to administer oaths, or take acknowledgments, under state
laws.
   It shall be the duty of the City Clerk, who shall be the assessor, to make
an assessment of the property within the city subject to taxation,
substantially in the manner and form in which assessments are made by the
assessor of the county, and return the same to the council on or before the
first day of August in each year, and for the purpose he shall have all powers
conferred by law on county assessors.  He shall list the number of dogs in the
city and the names of the persons owning the same, which list shall be returned
to the council.  In order to aid the said council in ascertaining the property
and tithables subject to taxation by said city, the City Clerk (who shall act
as assessor) of said city, shall have access to all books and public records of
Mineral County without expenses to said city or assessor, and he shall also
have the same power and be subject to the same penalties in ascertaining and
assessing the property and subjects of taxation in said city as are granted and
imposed upon the county assessors throughout the state by the general state
law, and the council shall also have authority to prescribe by ordinance such
other rules and regulations as may be necessary to enable and require such
assessor to ascertain and properly assess all property and tithables liable to
be taxed by said city so that such assessment and taxation shall be uniform,
and to enforce such ordinances by reasonable fines and penalties.  And the said
city assessor, making the valuation for assessment, shall make the same
assessment for both real and personal property as the assessor of said county
for the assessment year assessed by the county assessor.  The City Clerk shall
have an office in the city hall, council chamber or such other place as the
council may designate and provide.  He shall keep his office open at least
three consecutive hours in the forenoon and afternoon of each day.
   In addition to the duties hereinbefore set out and otherwise provided in
this act, the City Clerk shall by virtue of his office be the police judge of
the city, and his oath of office and the conditions of his bond shall extend to
and cover his duties and obligations as police judge.  The City Clerk shall, as
such police judge, be ex officio a justice of the peace with authority to issue
warrants or other process for all offenses within the police jurisdiction of
the city, of which a justice of the peace has jurisdiction under state laws,
and for all violations of any city ordinances.  In order to preserve the peace
and good order of the city and protect the persons property therein, riotous
and disorderly persons in the city may be arrested and detained before issuing
any warrant therefor.  He shall hold daily sessions of his said court, Sundays
excepted.  He shall have and exercise all of the civil jurisdiction conferred
by law upon justices of the peace, but before proceeding to act in such
capacity, he shall file with the Clerk of the County Court of Mineral County, a
certificate from the mayor of said city showing his appointment and
qualification as City Clerk, and shall thereupon take the oath and execute the
bond required to be taken and executed by justices of the peace.
   The police judge may commit persons charged with felony or misdemeanor to
jail or take bond for their appearance before the grand jury, but he shall
receive no fees or other compensation for such services; he shall have power to
issue executions for all fines, penalties and costs imposed by him, and he may
require the immediate payment thereof, and in default of such payment may
commit the person so in default to jail, until the fine and penalty and costs
shall be paid or satisfied, and any one so committed may be required to work
during imprisonment, as required by council.
   If any person is sentenced to imprisonment, or any person or corporation is
assessed with a fine of ten dollars or more, such person or corporation shall
be allowed an appeal from said decision of the police judge to the Circuit
Court of Mineral County, upon the execution of an appeal bond with surety
deemed sufficient and approved by the police judge in a penalty double such
fine and costs conditioned that the person or corporation proposing to appeal
will perform and satisfy any judgement which may be rendered against him or it
by said court on such appeal; and in no case shall a fine of less than ten
dollars be given by the police judge, if the defendant, his agent or attorney
request that the fine be made as much as ten dollars.
   If the appeal be taken, the warrant or arrest, the transcript of the
judgement, the appeal bond and other papers of the case shall be forthwith
delivered by the police judge to the Clerk of the Court to which such appeal is
taken, and said court shall proceed to try the case as upon indictment or
presentment and render such judgement, including that of costs, as the law and
evidence may demand.
   The police judge shall be authorized to suspend sentence or parole any
juvenile offender under the age of sixteen years, who may be brought before him
for the violation of any ordinance of the city or charged with any misdemeanor
under the laws of the state; he shall prescribe the conditions of such parole
and enter them in his docket and may commit the offender to the care and
custody of any proper person, with a view to the correction and reformation of
such offender, and may take from such person such bond or security, conditioned
as he shall prescribe.  The chief of police, or a policeman designated by him,
shall attend all sessions of the police court and perform such duties as may be
required by ordinance or requested by the police judge.
   The police judge shall keep in a well bound book a complete record of all
cases heard and considered by him, and he shall account for and pay over the
amount of all fines, as well as the fees of himself and other officers, under
salary, collected by him, weekly, to the treasurer of the city, and shall make
monthly reports thereof, and of all other matters pertaining to his office to
the council of the city.  In the absence of the police judge the mayor of the
city shall sit as such police judge with the same power and authority.
   The police judge, if an attorney, shall not practice in said police court as
an attorney or counselor or in any case appealed or removed therefrom, but
shall have the right to practice law as an attorney in other courts and cases.
   In addition to the other duties to be performed by the City Clerk, he shall
also be the city collector, charged with the duty of collecting all taxes,
levies, assessments, water rents and all other funds due the city, except
licenses; and as such collector shall have and exercise all of the rights,
authority and powers conferred upon town sergeants by the general law of the
state with reference to the collection of taxes and funds of cities, towns and
villages, and upon sheriffs with reference to the collection of state and
county taxes and funds.  He shall at least once in each week, or oftener if the
council so require, account for and pay over to the city treasurer all moneys
received by him as such collector; he shall before entering upon the duties of
his office give the bond hereinbefore required, payable to the City of Keyser
in the penalty of not less than five thousand  dollars, conditioned for the
faithful performance of the duties of the office of City Clerk, collector and
police judge and to account for and pay over, as required by law, all moneys
which may come into his hands by virtue of any and all of said offices, and
shall be chargeable with all of the city taxes, levies, assessments and water
rents, from the time the bills therefor are required to be made up and
collected, and with all moneys of the city, including fines, fees and
penalties, that may come into his hands. He shall receive no fees or
commissions for his services, but shall account to the city for all fees
received by him, except those received by him when acting in civil suits,
taking depositions or acknowledgments.  He shall at the first stated meeting of
the council in each month make his report to the council of all moneys and
credits coming to his hands as City Clerk, police judge and collector,
accompanied by a receipt or receipts from the treasurer showing that said
moneys have been paid to him, and he shall publish once in every six months a
detailed itemized statement of all receipts and expenses of the city for the
proceeding six months.
   The City Clerk may appoint such deputies and assistants, with the approval
of the council, as the duties of his office render necessary.  The deputies
shall take the oath required of the City Clerk and shall give such bond as he
may require, but such deputies or assistants shall not perform any judicial
duty of the police judge.
   The salary fixed for the City Clerk, which shall not be increased or
diminished during his term of office, shall be deemed to include all the
services of all deputies, clerks and agents employed by him, and no additional
allowance shall be made for, or on account of, any such services so rendered by
the City Clerk.
SECTION 31.  DUTIES OF THE TREASURER.
   The Treasurer shall receive and account for all moneys from all sources of
municipal revenue.  All license taxes and fees shall be paid him direct by the
person to whom such license is issued, and no license shall be valid without
the receipt of the treasurer for such tax and fees endorsed thereon.  All
officers and agents of the city, authorized to receive money for the city, or
revenues thereof, from any source whatsoever, shall pay over to the Treasurer
such moneys and revenues within one week after the receipt thereof, or sooner
if required by the council.
   He shall keep the funds of the city in some bank or banks within the city,
which shall pay to the city two per centum or more per annum interest on such
deposits, payable quarterly, based on the average daily balance on such funds
in all accounts.  If no bank within the city is willing at any time to receive
deposits of the Treasurer, and to pay such interest thereon, the Treasurer
shall report this fact to council, which shall thereupon designate a bank or
banks in which he shall deposit such funds for the time being, and until some
bank in the city will receive deposits at the rate of interest so fixed.
   Said bank or banks shall give bond in the penalty prescribed by council, and
with sureties to be approved by council, conditioned for the prompt payment,
whenever lawfully required, of all public moneys, or parts thereof, which may
be deposited with them.
   The salary fixed for the Treasurer, which shall not be increased or
diminished during his term of office, shall be deemed to include all the
services of all deputies, clerks and agents employed by him, and no additional
allowance shall be made for or on account of any such service so rendered by
the Treasurer.  He shall give bond or bonds in an amount to be fixed by
council, which bond shall be approved by council, before entering upon the
discharge of any of the duties of his office, and file same with the clerk. 
The Treasurer shall pay all warrants or other proper orders legally drawn and
presented, out of any moneys at the time in the fund on which such warrant or
order is drawn, but no money shall be paid by him except as the same shall have
been appropriated by the council and upon an order signed by the mayor and city
clerk.  If no money is in the fund with which to pay such warrant or order, the
Treasurer shall endorse on the back thereof the words “no funds,” and affix the
date of such endorsement, and shall preserve a record of such endorsement in
his office.  The Treasurer shall perform any other duties which council may
from time to time prescribe and which are not inconsistent with the general
scope of his duties.
SECTION 32.  DUTIES OF CITY ATTORNEY.
   The city attorney shall be the legal advisor of the city and all its
officers in all matters arising and in which legal proceedings may be taken; he
shall prosecute all suits, actions and proceedings instituted on behalf of said
city and defend all suits and actions against said city, and, when requested in
writing, shall give his written opinion to the mayor, council, or any standing
committee thereof, upon such legal questions as may be referred to him
affecting the city’s interests; he shall perform such other duties as may be
required.  It shall be his duty to attend sessions of the police court, when
requested by the mayor or police judge, and prosecute all trials therein and
all appeals that are taken from such court; and for his services he shall
receive such compensation as the council shall provide.
SECTION 33.  POLICE DEPARTMENT.
   The council shall by ordinance establish a police department, of which
department the chief of police shall be in  command.  He shall be charged with
the duty of preserving peace and good order in the city and of protecting the
persons and property of the citizens.  He shall have the right to stop,
suppress or prevent any immoral, obscene or improper shows, theatrical
performances or moving picture exhibitions.  Policemen may be suspended,
removed and discharged at any time by the mayor, upon his own motion or that of
the chief of police, for good cause, in which event the mayor shall report such
suspension, removal or discharge, together with the reason therefor, to the
council at its next meeting.  The council shall consider such suspension,
removal or discharge and may make such order in reference thereto as it may
deem wise.  The council shall have the power to suspend, without pay, the chief
of police, or any policemen against whom charges are preferred.
   Whenever any notice is required to be given, or any summons, warrant or
other process is required to be served or otherwise executed, under the
provisions of this act, it shall be sufficient if such notice, summons,
warrant, or other process be executed by an officer of the police department of
said city in the same way or manner in which the laws of the state prescribe
for executing summonses and subpoenas by state officers, unless otherwise
provided by this act.  The chief of police may also execute within this city
and civil writ or process issued by the police judge, or any justice of the
peace or court in Mineral County, and shall have all the powers conferred by
law upon constables and sheriffs, but he shall not act in such capacity until
he shall have first qualified before the County Court of Mineral County  and
given the bond required of constables.
SECTION 34.  DUTIES OF THE STREET COMMISSIONER.
   The street commissioner shall perform such duties as are now, or which may
hereafter be imposed upon him by any ordinance of said city, and shall receive
such compensation as may be fixed by council.
SECTION 35.  POWER TO CONDEMN.
   The council shall have the right to institute proceedings, in the name of
the city, for the condemnation of real estate for streets, alleys, avenues,
sewers, drains, market grounds, city hall, reservoirs, electric light plant,
pipe liens, or for any other ground, within or without the city, necessary for
public improvements and which the council is authorized to acquire or maintain
under this act; such proceedings shall conform to the provision of Chapter
Forty-two of the Code of West Virginia, and the costs thereof shall be borne by
the city, except that in contests involving a hearing in the Circuit Court,
costs shall be recovered by the prevailing party.
SECTION 36.  RECALL.
   The holder of any elective office may be removed at any time by the electors
qualified to vote for a successor of such incumbent.  The procedure to effect
the removal of an incumbent of an elective office shall be as follows: A
petition signed by electors entitled to vote for a successor to the incumbent
sought to be removed, equal in number to at least twenty percentum of the
entire vote for all candidates for the office of mayor cast at the last
preceding general municipal election, demanding an election of a successor of
the person sought to be removed, shall be filed with the city clerk, which
petition shall contain a general statement of the grounds for which the removal
is sought.  The signatures to the petition need not all be appended to one
paper, but each signer shall add to his signature his place of residence,
giving the street and number.  One of the signers of each such paper shall make
oath before an officer competent to administer oaths, that the statements
therein made are true as he believes, and that each signature to the paper
appended is the genuine signature of the person whose name it purports to be. 
Within ten days from the date of filing such petition, the city clerk shall
examine and from the voter’s register ascertain whether or not said petition is
signed by the requisite number of qualified electors, and if necessary, the
council shall allow him extra help for that purpose, and he shall attach to
said petition his certificate showing the result of said examination.  If, by
the clerk’s certificate, the petition is shown to be insufficient, it may be
amended within ten days from the date of said certificate.  The clerk shall,
within ten days after such amendment, make like examination of the amended
petition and if his certificate shall show the same to be insufficient, it
shall be returned to the person filing the same, without prejudice, however, to
the filing of a new petition to the same effect.
   If the petition shall be deemed to be sufficient, the clerk shall submit the
same to the council without delay.  If the petition shall be found to be
sufficient, the council shall order and fix a date for holding said election,
not less than thirty days nor more than forty days from the date of the clerk’s
certificate to the council that a sufficient petition is filed.
   The council shall make, or cause to be made, publication of notice and all
arrangements for holding such election, and the same shall be conducted,
returned and the result thereof declared in all respects as are other city
elections.  So far as applicable, except as otherwise herein provided,
nominations hereunder shall be made without the intervention of a primary
election by filing with the clerk at least ten (10) days prior to said special
election, a statement of candidacy accompanied by a petition signed by electors
entitled to vote at said special election, equal in number to at least ten per
centum of the entire vote for all candidates for the office of mayor at the
last preceding general municipal election, which said statement of candidacy
and petition shall be substantially in the form set out in Section Six of this
act, so far as the same is applicable, substituting the word “special” for the
word “primary” in such statement and petition and stating therein that such
person is a candidate for election instead of nomination.
   The ballot for such special election shall be in substantially the following
form:
OFFICIAL BALLOT.
   Special election for the balance of the unexpires term of                as
                                      .
   For                                .
               (Vote for one only)
               (Names of candidates)
         [  ]                                             
         [  ]                                             
         (Name of present incumbent.)
             Office ballot, attest:
               (Signature)                                                     
       
                                          City Clerk.
   The successor of any officer so removed shall hold office during the
unexpired term of his predecessor.  Any person sought to be removed may be a
candidate to succeed himself, and unless he requested otherwise in writing, the
clerk shall place his name on the official ballot without nomination.  In any
such removal election, the candidate receiving the highest number of votes
shall be declared elected.  At such election, if some other person than the
incumbent receives the highest number of votes, the incumbent shall thereupon
be deemed removed from the office upon qualification of his successor.  In the
case the party who received the highest number of votes should fail to qualify
within ten days after receiving notification of election, the office shall be
deemed vacant.  If the incumbent received the highest number of votes, he shall
continue in office, and those electors who signed the petition demanding such
special election shall, unless it be otherwise ordered by the council, pay the
costs of such election, which said costs shall be a lien against the property
of all of such petitioners, collectable and enforceable in like manner and to
the same extent as taxes due to the city are collected.  The said method of
removal shall be cumulative and additional to the methods heretofore provided
by law.
SECTION 37.  INITIATIVE.
   Any proposed ordinance may be submitted to the council by petition signed by
electors of the city equal in number to the percentage hereinafter required. 
The signatures, verification, authentication, inspection, certification,
amendment and submission of such petition shall be the same as provided for
petition under Section Thirty-six hereof.
   If the petition accompanying the proposed ordinance be signed by electors
equal in number to twenty per centum of the votes cast for all candidates for
mayor at the last preceding general election, and contains a request that the
said ordinance by submitted to a vote of the people, if not passed by the
council, such council shall either:
   (a)   Pass such ordinance without alteration within twenty days after
attachment of the clerk’s certificate to the accompanying petition or,
   (b)   Forthwith, after the clerk shall attach to the petition accompanying
such ordinance his certificate of sufficiency, the council shall call a special
election, unless the general municipal election is fixed within ninety days
thereafter, and at such special or general municipal election, of one is so
fixed, such ordinance shall be submitted without alteration to the vote of the
electors of said city.  But if the petition is signed by not less than ten per
centum of the electors, as above defined, then the council shall within twenty
days, pass said ordinance without change, or submit the same at the next
general city election occurring not more than ninety nor less than thirty days
after the clerk’s certificate of sufficiency is attached to said petition.
   The ballot used when voting upon said ordinance, shall contain these words:
“for the ordinance,” and “against the ordinance,” (stating the nature of the
proposed ordinance.)  If a majority of the qualified electors voting on the
proposed ordinance shall vote in favor thereof, such ordinance shall thereupon
become a valid and binding ordinance of the city; and any ordinance proposed by
petition, or which shall be adopted by a vote of the people, cannot be repealed
or amended except by a vote of the people.  Any number of proposed ordinances
may be voted upon at the same election in accordance with the provisions of
this section; but there shall not be more than one special election in any
period of six months for such purpose.
   The council may submit a proposition for the repeal of any such ordinance or
for amendments thereto, to be voted upon at any succeeding general city
election; and should such proposition so submitted receive a majority of the
votes cast thereon at such election, such ordinance shall thereby be repealed
or amended accordingly.  Whenever any ordinance or proposition is required by
this act to be submitted to the voters of the city at any election, the city
clerk shall cause such ordinance or proposition to be published once in each of
the newspapers published in said city; such publication to be not more than
twenty nor less than five days before the submission of such proposition or
ordinance to be voted on.
SECTION 38.  REFERENDUM.
   No ordinance or franchise passed by the council, except when otherwise
required by the general laws of the state or by the provisions of this act,
except an ordinance for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health
or safety, which shall contain a statement of its urgency, shall go into effect
before ten days from the time of its final passage, and not then unless within
two days after passage, Sundays and holidays excepted, the same shall have been
published in full in some newspaper published and generally circulated in said
city.  And if during ten days a petition signed by electors of the city, equal
in number to at least twenty per centum of the entire vote cast for all
candidates for mayor at the last preceding general municipal election at which
a mayor was elected, protesting against the passage of such ordinance, or
franchise, be presented to the council, the said ordinance or franchise shall
thereupon be suspended from going into operation, and it shall be the duty of
the council to reconsider such ordinance, or franchise, and if the same is not
entirely repealed, the council shall submit the ordinance, or franchise, as is
provided by Sub-section (b) of Section Thirty-seven of this act, to the vote of
the electors of the city, either at the general election or at a special
municipal election to be called for that purpose, and such ordinance or
franchise shall not go into effect or become operative unless a majority of the
qualified electors voting on the same shall vote in favor thereof.  Said
petition shall be in all respects in accordance with the provision of said
Section Thirty-seven, except as to the percentage of signers, and be examined
and certified to by the clerk in all respects as therein provided.
SECTION 39.  PETITIONS.
   Petitions provided for in this act shall be signed by none but legal voters
of the city.  Each petition shall contain, in addition to the names of the
petitioners, the street and house number in which the petition resides, his age
and length of residence in the city.  It shall also be accompanied by the
affidavit of one or more legal voters of the city, stating that the signers
thereof were, at the time of signing, legal voters of said city, and the number
of signers at the time the affidavit was made.
SECTION 40.  ELECTION TO ADOPT OR REJECT CHARTER.
   But this act shall not be effective unless the same shall be first submitted
to the voters within the territory embraced and described in Section Two
hereof, at a special election called for the purpose and adopted by the
majority of the votes cast at such election.  Said special election shall be
held on the first Tuesday in May, in the year One Thousand Nine Hundred and
Thirteen, unless this act shall not have taken effect on that day, in which
case such election shall be held on the first Tuesday after the day on which
this act would go into effect but for this section.  The council of the Towns
of Keyser and South Keyser shall provide for circulation of printed copies of
this act or publication thereof in such manner as said council deems best.  The
election shall be held in the election precincts at which the first primary and
general election is to be held under this act, as provided in Section Three
hereof, and the election officers shall be appointed for such special election
and the result thereof ascertained, in the manner provided by Section Six of
the act.  The ballot shall be prepared under the direction of the council of
the Town of Keyser and shall be headed: “Special election for ratification or
rejection of a new charter for Keyser,” and underneath said head shall be the
words, in separate lines, “for new charter,” and “against new charter.”  Any
voter desiring to vote for adoption of this act shall strike out the words
“against new charter,” and any voter desiring to vote for rejection of this
act, shall strike out the words “for new charter.”  And in the event that this
act shall not be in effect on the second Tuesday preceding the first Tuesday
after the first Monday in June, One Thousand Nine Hundred and Thirteen, the
first primary election hereunder shall be held on the second Tuesday of June,
and the first general election shall be held on the fourth Tuesday of June, One
Thousand Nine Hundred and Thirteen.
SECTION 41.  ACTS REPEALED
   All acts in conflict or inconsistent with this act, are to the extent of any
such conflict, hereby repealed, but this act shall not be construed to repeal,
change or modify any previous acts not inconsistent with this act, or to take
away any powers heretofore conferred upon the City of Keyser, or upon the mayor
or council, or any other of the officers thereof, conferred by general law,
except so far as the same may be inconsistent with the powers hereby conferred.

successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02 , may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn.  But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk.  Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway
in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait.  No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05  FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal).  When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal).  When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of  vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.

in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising.  This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)

   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second

section:
      (1)   Any conviction under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), (d),
(e) or (f) of this section or under a prior enactment of this section for an
offense which occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the
date of arrest in the current proceeding;

violation occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of

a second or subsequent offense under this section if the person has been
previously arrested for or charged with a violation of this section which is
alleged to have occurred within the applicable time period for prior offenses,
notwithstanding the fact that there has not been a final adjudication of the
charges for the alleged previous offense.  In that case, the warrant or
indictment or information must set forth the date, location and particulars of
the previous offense or offenses.  No person may be convicted of a second or
subsequent offense under this section unless the conviction for the previous
offense has become final, or the person has previously had a period of
conditional probation imposed pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b).
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d) or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection  (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   For purposes of this section, the term “controlled substance” has the
meaning ascribed to it in West Virginia Code Chapter 60A.
   (o)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation: 
provided, that the court may apply the provisions  of West Virginia Code 62-11A
to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for a first
offense under this section:  provided however, that the court may impose a term
of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b) to persons
adjudicated thereunder.  An order for home detention by the court pursuant to
the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B may be used as an alternative
sentence to any period of incarceration required by this section for a first or
subsequent offense:  provided, however, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of second offense under this
section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than five days of
the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave
home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West Virginia Code
62-11B-5:  provided, however, that for any period of home incarceration ordered
for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation  of this section,
electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten days of the total
period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not leave home for
those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.  (WVaC 17C-5-2)

section, the words “drives a vehicle in this Municipality” do not mean or
include driving or operating a vehicle solely and exclusively on one’s own
property.  (WVaC 17C-5-2)
   (q)   For purposes of this article, the phrase "in this Municipality" means
anywhere within the physical boundaries of this Municipality, including, but
not limited to, publicly maintained streets and highways, and subdivision
streets or other areas not publicly maintained but nonetheless open to the use
of the public for purposes of vehicular travel.
   (r)   When used in this section, the terms or phrases "driving under the

333.011  PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND  LOCK PROGRAM.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (g) hereof, whenever any person who
has not previously been convicted of any offense under Section
333.01  or any statute of the United States or of any state relating to driving
under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance or any other drug:
      (1)   Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)   Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under subsection (c) of Section
333.01 , the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent
of the accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding any
provisions of this code to the contrary, place him or her on probation, which
conditions shall include, that he or she successfully completes the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-
3a.  Participation therein shall be for a period of at least 165 days after he
or she has served the fifteen days of license suspension imposed pursuant to
West Virginia Code 17C-5A-2.
   (b)   A defendant’s election to participate in deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in West Virginia Code 17C- 5A-2.
   (c)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (d) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)
(1) hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test
and Lock Program, or if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable
time after the alleged violation was committed.      
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard.  If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Test and Lock
Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statue of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable Federal or State constitutional provision, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (d)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges.  This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program.  A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objection on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney.  If there are no
objections filed within the thirty day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant.  If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (c) hereof.
   (e)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1, et seq.  Except as
provided in subsection (j), (k) and (l) of Section
333.01  regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and
discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status
he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial.  No person as to whom a dismissal
and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of
perjury, false swearing or otherwise giving false statement by reason of his or
her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response
to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made
in connection with any subsequent offense as that term is defined in subsection
(l) of Section
333.01 .

controlled substance or any other drug; or
      (4)   If the person refused the secondary chemical test pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-7.
   (h)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, trial
and conviction, pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the
Division of Motor Vehicles; provided, that any person who has previously been
convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard.  If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

345.35  OPERATION OF VEHICLES WITH SAFETY BELTS.
   (a)   A person shall not operate a passenger vehicle on a public street or
highway unless the person, any passenger in the back seat under eighteen years
of age, and any passenger in the front seat of such passenger vehicle is
restrained by a safety belt meeting applicable federal motor vehicle safety
standards.  For the purposes of this section, "passenger vehicle" means a motor
vehicle which is designed for transporting ten passengers or less, including
the driver, except that such term does not include a motorcycle, a trailer or
any motor vehicle which is not required on the date of the enactment of this
section under a federal motor vehicle safety standard to be equipped with a
belt system.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all passenger
vehicles manufactured after the first day of January, 1967, and being 1968
models and newer.
   (b)   The required use of safety belts as provided herein does not apply to
a duly appointed or contracted rural mail carrier of the United States Postal
Service who is actually making mail deliveries or to a passenger or operator
with a physically disabling condition whose physical disability would prevent
appropriate restraint in such safety belt if the condition is duly certified by
a physician who shall state the nature of the disability as well as the reason
such restraint is inappropriate.
   (c)   A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages:  provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct
an in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party's failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of.  Upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine (1) that the injured party failed to wear
a safety belt, and (2) that the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a
failure to mitigate damages.  The trier of fact may reduce the injured party's
recovery for medical damages by an amount not to exceed five percent (5%)
thereof.  In the event the plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of five
percent (5%) of medical damages, the court shall make the calculations and the
issue of mitigation of damages for failure to wear a safety belt shall not be
presented to the jury.  In all cases, the actual computation of the dollar
amount reduction shall be determined by the court.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, no
points may be entered on any driver's record maintained by the Division of
Motor Vehicles as a result of a violation of this section.
   (e)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to abrogate or
alter the provisions of Section
345.31 relating to the mandatory use of child passenger safety devices.

vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle.  The photographs must show the
vehicle in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. 
Within the discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers
may issue citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the
illegally parked vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement
agency, who may issue a citation, which includes the photographs and the form,
to the owner of the illegally parked vehicle.  Volunteers shall be trained on
the requirements for citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or
designated accessible parking areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   The Municipality in enforcing this section shall retain all fines and

363.03 DESIGNATION OF PARKING SPACES.
   The Chief of Police is hereby directed and authorized to mark off individual
parking spaces in the parking zones designated and described in Section
363.02  and in such other zones as may hereafter be established, said parking
spaces to be designated by lines painted or durably marked on the curbing or
surface of the street.  At each space so marked off it shall be unlawful to
park any vehicle in such a way that said vehicle shall not be entirely within
the limits of the space so designated.  (Ord. 221.  Passed 6-4-86.)
363.04 INSTALLATION OF PARKING METERS.
   In said parking meter zones the Chief of Police shall cause parking meters
to be installed upon the curb or sidewalk immediately adjacent to the parking
space provided in Section
363.03 , and the Chief of Police shall be responsible for the regulation,
control, operation, maintenance, and use of such parking meters.  Each device
shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal parking upon the deposit
of the appropriate coin or coins, lawful money of the United States of America,
for the period of time prescribed by this article.  Each device shall be so
arranged that upon the expiration of the lawful time limit it will indicate by
a proper visible signal that the lawful parking period has expired and in such
cases the right to such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease and the
operator, owner, possessor or manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties
hereinafter provided.  (Ord. 221.  Passed 6-4-86.)
363.05 OPERATION OF PARKING METERS.
   Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer of the Fire or
Police Department, or in compliance with the directions of a police officer or
traffic control sign or signal, when any vehicle shall be parked in any parking
space alongside or next to which a parking meter is located, the operator of
such vehicle shall, upon entering the said parking meter space, immediately
deposit or cause to be deposited in said meter such proper coin of the United
States as is required for such parking meter and as is designated by proper
directions on the meter, and when required by the directions on the meter, the
operator of such vehicle, after the deposit of the proper coin or coins, shall
also set in operation the timing mechanism on such meter in accordance with
directions properly appearing thereon, and failure to deposit such proper coin,
and to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required, shall constitute
a violation of this article.  Upon the deposit of such coin (and the setting of
the timing mechanism in operation when so required) the parking space may be
lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the period of time which has been
prescribed for the part of the street in which said parking space is located,
provided that any person placing a vehicle in a parking meter space adjacent to
a meter which indicates that unused time has been left in the meter by the
previous occupant of the space shall not be required to deposit a coin so long
as his occupancy of said space does not exceed the indicated unused parking
time.  If said vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the
parking time limit set for such parking space, and if the meter shall indicate
such illegal parking, then, and in that event, such vehicle shall be considered
as parking overtime and beyond the period of legal parking time, and such
parking shall be deemed a violation of this article.

363.06 PARKING TIME LIMITS.
   (a)   Parking or standing a vehicle in a designated space in a parking meter
zone shall be lawful for the time limit and upon making the required coin
deposit prescribed upon the meters in such zones, which times and required coin
deposits shall be clearly marked and noted thereon or within said meters by

of Council of the City of Keyser, adopted and entered of record at a regular
meeting of said Council.

525.01  CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section.  A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;

assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit.  The court may cause
a citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that
they appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the
issuance of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered
for the penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the
principal and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. 
The money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to
the treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the
offender was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment.  The fact that a mercantile establishment

the trade as such, selling to licensed retail merchants or jobbers, or to
others in wholesale prices.
      (Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.02 IMPOSITION OF PRIVILEGE TAX.
   (a)   There shall be levied and collected annual privilege taxes against the
persons, on account of the business and other activities, and in the amounts to
be determined by the application of rates against values or gross income as set
forth in Section
725.04 .  If any person liable for any tax under Section
725.04  shall ship or transport his products or any part thereof out of the
City without making sale of such products, the value of the products in the
condition or form in which they exist, immediately before transportation out of
the City shall be the basis for the assessment of tax imposed in such
sections.  Council shall prescribe equitable and uniform rules for ascertaining
such value.
   (b)   In determining value, however, as regards sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relation between the buyer and seller is such that the gross proceeds from the
sale are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter to the sale. 
Council shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for determining the value
upon which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as
possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like
quality or character where no common interest exists between the buyer and
seller but the circumstances and conditions are otherwise similar.
   (c)   Gross income included in the measure of the tax under Section
725.04 except in the case of production of natural gas, shall neither be added
nor deducted in computing the tax levied under the other sections of this
article.
 
   (d)   A person exercising any privilege taxable under Section
725.04 and engaged in the business of selling his natural resources or
manufactured products at retail in the City shall be required to make returns
of the gross proceeds of such retail sales and pay the tax imposed for the
privilege of engaging in the business of selling such natural resources or
manufactured products at retail in the City.  But any person exercising any
privilege taxable under Section
725.04 and engaging in the business of selling his natural resources or
manufactured products to manufacturers, wholesalers or jobbers, and in the case
of limestone, and sand, gravel or other mineral products, to commercial
consumers, shall not be required to pay the tax imposed for the privilege of
selling such natural resource products or manufactured products at wholesale.
 
   (e)   Manufacturers exercising any privilege taxable under Section
725.04 shall not be required to pay the tax imposed for the privilege of
selling their manufactured products for delivery outside of the City, but the
gross income derived from the sale of such manufactured products outside of the
City shall be included in determining the measure of the tax imposed on such
manufacturer.
   (f)   A person exercising privileges taxable under the other sections of
this article, producing coal, oil, natural gas, minerals, timber or other
natural resource products, the production of which is taxable under Section
725.04, and using or consuming the same in this business, shall be deemed to be
engaged in the business of mining and producing coal, oil, natural gas,
minerals, timber or other natural resource products for sale, profit or
commercial use, and shall be required to make returns on account of the
production of the business showing the gross proceeds or equivalent in
accordance with uniform and equitable rules for determining the value upon
which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as possible
to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like quality or
character by other taxpayers, which rules Council shall prescribe.  (Ord. 181. 
Passed 7-19-78.)
725.03 MEASURE OF TAX.
   The measure of the tax assessed in this article shall not include gross
income derived from commerce between this state and other states of the United
States or between this state and foreign countries.  (Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-

725.05 EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   There shall be an exemption in every case of ten dollars ($10.00) in
amount of tax computed under the provisions of this article.  A person
exercising a privilege taxable hereunder for a fractional part of a tax year

year.  Only one exemption shall be allowed to any one person, whether he
exercises one or more privileges taxable hereunder.
   (b)   The provisions of the article shall not apply to:

      (2)   Nonprofit cemetery companies organized and operated for the
exclusive benefit of their members;
      (3)   Fraternal societies, organizations and associations organized and

      (4)   Corporations, associations and societies organized and operated

         (Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.06 PAYMENT OF TAXES.
   (a)   The taxes levied in this article shall be payable in quarterly
installments on or before the expiration of thirty days from the end of the
quarter in which they accrue.  The taxpayer shall, within thirty days from the
expiration of each quarter, make out an estimate of the tax for which he is
liable for such quarter, verify the same by oath, and mail the same together
with a remittance in the form required by subsection (b) of this section for
the amount of the tax, to the office of the supervisor of business, privilege
and occupation tax.  The supervisor, if he deems it necessary to insure payment
of the tax, may require return and payment under this section for other than
quarter year periods.  In estimating the amount of the tax due for each quarter
in the taxpayer may deduct one-fourth of the total exemption allowed for the
year.
   (b)   All remittances of taxes imposed by this article shall be made to the
City, by bank draft, certified check, cashier’s check, money order or
certificate of deposit, and the City Clerk shall issue his receipts therefor to
the taxpayer and shall pay the money into the City Treasury to be kept and
accounted for as provided by law.
(Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.07 RETURN AND REMITTANCE BY TAXPAYER.
   On or before thirty days after the end of the tax year, each person liable
for the payment of a tax under Section
725.05  shall make a return showing the gross proceeds of sales or gross income
of business, trade or calling and compute the amount of tax chargeable against
him in accordance with the provisions of this article and deduct the amount of
quarterly payments (as hereinbefore provided), if any, and transmit with his
report a remittance in the form required by Section
725.06  covering the residue of the tax chargeable against him to the office of
the supervisor, such return shall be verified by the oath of the taxpayer, if
made by an individual, or by the oath of the president, vice-president,
secretary or treasurer of a corporation, if made on behalf of a corporation. 
If made on behalf of a partnership, joint adventure, association, trust or any
other group or combination acting as a unit shall make the oath on behalf of
the taxpayer.  If for any reason it is not practicable for the individual
taxpayer to make the oath, the same may be made by any duly authorized agent. 
The supervisor, for good cause shown, may extend the time for making the annual
return on the application of any taxpayer and grant such reasonable additional
time within which to make the same as may, by him, be deemed advisable.
(Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.08 ERRONEOUS COMPUTATION.
   (a)   If the taxpayer shall make any error in computing the tax assessable
against him the supervisor shall correct such error or reassess the proper
amount of taxes, and notify the taxpayer of his action by mailing to him
promptly a copy of the corrected assessment, and any additional tax for which
such taxpayer may be liable shall be paid within ten days after the receipt of
such statement.
   (b)   If the amount already paid exceeds that which should have been paid on
the basis of the tax so recomputed, the excess so paid shall be immediately
refunded to the taxpayer upon the requisition of the supervisor and shall be
payable out of any funds available for the purpose of the City Clerk and
Mayor.  The taxpayer may, at his election, apply an overpayment credit to taxes
subsequently accruing hereunder.
(Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.09 FAILURE TO MAKE RETURN; ASSESSMENT BY SUPERVISOR.
   If any person fails or refuses to make a return, either in whole or in part,
or if the supervisor has reasonable grounds to believe that any return made is
so deficient as not to form the basis of a satisfactory assessment of the tax,
he may proceed as he deems best to obtain information on which to base the
assessment of the tax.  The supervisor may by himself or his duly appointed
agent, make examination of the books, records and papers, and audit the
accounts of any such person, and may take evidence, administered by himself or
his agent, on oath, of any person who he may believe shall be in possession of
any relevant information.  As soon as possible after procuring such information
as he may be able to obtain as to any person failing or refusing to make a
return, the supervisor shall proceed to assess the tax and shall notify the
person assessed of the amount of the tax.  The assessment of the tax by the
supervisor shall be final as to any person who refused to make a return.  (Ord.
181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.10 APPEAL FROM ASSESSMENT.
   If any person, having made the return and paid the tax as provided by this
article, feels aggrieved by the assessment so made upon him for any years by
the supervisor, he may apply to Council by petition, in writing, within thirty
days after notice is mailed to him by the supervisor for a hearing and
correction of the amount of the tax so assessed upon him by the supervisor, in
which petition shall be set forth the reason why such hearing should be granted
and the amount of such tax should be reduced.  Council shall promptly consider
such petition, and may grant such hearing or deny the same.  If denied, the
petitioner shall be forthwith notified thereof; if granted, Council shall
notify the petitioner of the time and place fixed for such hearing.  After such
hearing, Council may make such order in the matter as may appear to it just and
lawful and shall furnish a copy of such order to the petitioner.  Any person
improperly charged with any tax and required to pay the same may recover the
amount paid, together with interest, in any proper action or suit against the
City as may be authorized by law.
(Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.11 TAX YEAR.
   The assessment of taxes herein made and the returns required therefore shall
be for the calendar year ended December 31; if the taxpayer, in exercising a
privilege taxable under this article, keeps the books reflecting the same on a
basis other than such year, he may, with the assent of the supervisor, make his
annual returns, and pay taxes for the year covering his accounting period, as
shown by the method of keeping his books.
(Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.12 TAX CUMULATIVE.
   The tax imposed by this article shall be in addition to all other licenses
and taxes levied by law as a condition precedent to engaging in any business,
trade or calling.  A person exercising a privilege taxable under this article,
subject to the payment of all licenses and charges which are condition
precedent to exercising the privilege taxed, may exercise the privilege for the
current tax year upon the condition that he shall pay accruing taxes under this
article.
(Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.13 TAX A DEBT; LIEN OF UNPAID TAX.
   (a)   A tax due and unpaid under this article shall be a debt due the City. 
It shall be the personal obligation of the taxpayer and shall be a lien upon
the property used in the business or occupation upon which such tax is imposed,
and lien shall have priority over all other liens and obligations, except those
due the United States of America and the state.
   (b)   A penalty of five percent of the tax shall be added for any default
for thirty days or less and for each succeeding thirty days elapsing before
payment, there shall be secured by the lien herein provided.  (Ord. 181. 
Passed 7-19-78.)
725.14 COLLECTION.
   (a)   The supervisor may, by himself, or by duly appointed agent as
mentioned in Section
725.19  collect taxes due and unpaid under this article, together with all
accrued penalties.  After delinquency shall have continued sixty days, the
supervisor may proceed when authorized by Council in the circuit court of the
county, to obtain an injunction restraining the further exercise of the
privilege until full payment shall have been made of all taxes and penalties
due under this article.  In any proceeding under this section upon judgment or
decree for the plaintiff he shall be awarded his cost.
   (b)   In the event a business subject to the tax imposed by this article
shall be operated in connection with a receivership or insolvency proceeding,
the court under whose direction such business is operated shall, by the entry
of a proper order in the cause, make provision for the regular payment of such
taxes as the same become due.
(Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.15 SALE OF BUSINESS.
   The tax imposed by this article shall be lien upon the property of any
person subject to the provisions hereof who shall sell out his business or
stock of goods, or shall quit business, and such person shall be required to
make the return provided for under Section
725.07 within thirty days after the date he sold out his business or stock of
goods, or quit business, and his successor in business shall be required to
withhold sufficient of the purchase money to cover the amount of such taxes due
and unpaid until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt from the
City showing that the taxes have been paid.  If the purchaser of a business or
stock of goods shall fail to withhold purchase money as above provided, and the
taxes shall be due and unpaid after the thirty day period allowed, he shall be
personally liable for the payment of the taxes accrued and unpaid on account of
the operation of the business by the former owner.
(Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.16 RECORDATION OF TAX LIEN.
   The supervisor, for the more effective collection of the tax, may file with
the Clerk of County Commission of Mineral County, a certified copy of an
assessment of taxes under this article for recordation.  A certificate so filed
shall be recorded or in any book provided for that purpose, and thereafter
shall constitute binding notice of the lien created by this article upon all
lands of the taxpayer located in the City as against all parties whose interest
arose after such recordation.  Upon payment of taxes delinquent under this
article, the lien of which shall have been recorded, the supervisor shall
certify in duplicate the fact and amount of payment and the balance due, if
any, and shall forward the certificate, one to the taxpayer and one to the
Clerk of County Commission.  The Clerk of the County Commission shall record
the certificate in the book in which releases are recorded.  From the date that
such a certificate is admitted to record the land of the taxpayer in the City
shall be free from any lien for taxes under this article accrued to the date
that the certificate was issued.  (Ord. 181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.17 COLLECTION BY DISTRAINT.
   When authorized and directed by Council, the supervisor shall distrain upon
any goods, chattels, or intangibles represented by negotiable evidences of
indebtedness of any taxpayer delinquent under the article for the amount of all
taxes and penalties accrued and unpaid hereunder.  The lien created by this
article on real estate may be enforced by any means provided by law.  (Ord.
181.  Passed 7-19-78.)
725.18 OFFENSES AND PENALTIES.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to make a return provided to
be made in Section
725.06  and
725.07  of this Article; or to make any false or fraudulent return or false
statement in any return, with intent to defraud the City or to evade payment of
the tax, or any part thereof, imposed by this article; or for the president,
vice-president, secretary or treasurer of any corporation to make or permit to
be made for any corporation or association any false return, or any false
statement in any return required in this article, with the intent to evade the
payment of any tax hereunder, and any person violating any of the provisions of
this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and, on conviction thereof, shall
be fined not more than one thousand dollars or imprisoned not exceeding one
year in the county jail or punished by both fine and imprisonment at the
discretion of the Court within the limitations aforesaid.  In addition to the
foregoing penalties, any person who shall knowingly swear to or verify any
false or fraudulent return, or any return containing any false or fraudulent
statement with the intent aforesaid, shall be guilty of the offense of false
swearing and, on conviction thereof, shall be punished in the manner prescribed
by law.  Any corporation for which a false return, or a return containing a
false statement, as aforesaid, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
punished by a fine of not more than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
725.19 ADMINISTRATION OF POWERS AND DUTIES OF SUPERVISOR.

   The following words and phrases when used in this ordinance shall have the
following respective meanings:
   (a)   “Person” includes individuals, firms, partnerships, associations,
corporations and government entities of whatever form or character.
   (b)   “Public utility service” means any service or tangible personal
property supplied by a person who is a public utility subject to the
jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission of West Virginia and which is
purchased, used or consumed within the corporate limits of this municipality.
   (c)   “Purchaser” includes every person who purchases, uses or consumes a
public utility service.
   (d)   “Supplier” includes every person who sells, furnishes or supplies a

729.02 LEVY OF TAX; AMOUNT.
   There is hereby levied against the purchaser of any public utility service
an excise tax as set forth herein.  Such tax shall be in the amount of two
percent of the gross amount (exclusive of any federal or state tax thereon) of
each periodic statement for each such public utility service rendered such
purchaser by the supplier thereof.  The tax hereby levied is in addition to all
other taxes levied by this municipality.
(Ord. 160(B).  Passed 5-23-01.)
729.03 COLLECTION; EFFECTIVE DATE; ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   The amount of tax levied pursuant to this ordinance shall be added to
and constitute a part of the cost of the purchaser of the public utility
service purchased, used or consumed by such purchaser.  Each purchaser of a
public utility service shall pay to the supplier thereof, at the time of

periodic statement, bears to the total number of days covered by such
statement.
   (c)   The official of this municipality charged with responsibility for
collection of taxes due this municipality shall have authority to promulgate

in question.
         C.   The water purveyor shall not allow any cross-connection to remain
unless it is protected by an approved backflow preventer which will be
regularly tested to insure satisfactory operation.
         D.   The water purveyor shall inform the owner by letter, of any
failure to comply, by the time of the first re-inspection. The water purveyor
shall allow an additional fifteen (15) days for the correction. In the event
the owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the
second re-inspection, the water purveyor shall inform the owner by letter, that
the water service to the owner's premises will be terminated within a period
not to exceed five (5) days. In the event that the owner informs the water
purveyor of extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been
made, a time extension may be granted by the water purveyor, but in no case may
exceed an additional thirty (30) days.
         E.   If the water purveyor determines at any time that a serious
threat to the public health exists, the water service shall be terminated
immediately.
         F.   The water purveyor shall begin initial premises inspections to
determine the nature of existing or potential hazards. Initial focus will be on
high hazard industries and commercial premises.
      (2)   Owner.
         A.   The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection
of all cross-connections on its premises.
         B.   The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the water
purveyor, shall at its expense, install, maintain and test, or have tested, any
and all backflow preventers on its premises.
         C.   The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer
which is revealed by periodic testing.
         D.   The owner shall inform the water purveyor of any proposed or
modified cross connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the
owner is aware, but have not been found by the water purveyor.
         E.   The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow
preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass.
Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply
additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
         F.   The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved
by the water purveyor.
         G.   The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
water purveyor or the WVBPH.
         H.   Any owner having a private well or other private water source
must have the approval of the water purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the water purveyor's system. Permission to cross-
connect may be denied. The owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even
if it is not cross-connected to the water purveyor's system.
         I.   In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the water purveyor's side of the backflow
preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed.
         J.   The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semiannual device testing retesting in the case that the
device fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspections for non-compliance
with water purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
   (g)   Degree of Hazard.  The water purveyor recognizes the threat to the
public water system arising from cross connections.  All threats will be
classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved
backflow prevention device.
   (h)   Existing In-use Backflow Prevention Devices.  Any existing backflow
preventer shall be allowed by the water purveyor to continue in service unless
the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present
backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health.
Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential
installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow
preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced
pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow
devise is present.
   (i)   Periodic Testing.
      (1)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
      (2)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester.
This testing will be done at the owner's expense.
      (3)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test shall be
required or replaced.  When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the
repair the device will be retested at owner's expense to insure correct
operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected
if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In
other situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty (30) days after the
test date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair
tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two (2) devices is an
effective means of the owner insuring that uninterrupted water service during
testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner desires
such continuity.
      (4)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in paragraph "A" above, in cases where there is a history of test
failures and the water purveyor is of the opinion that due to the degree of
hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of additional tests
shall be born by the owner.
   (j)   Record.  The water purveyor will initiate and maintain the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections.
      (2)   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections
      (3)   Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the WVBPH.
   Upon request, the water purveyor will submit records of inspection, surveys,
tests or corrective actions to the West Virginia Bureau of Public Health.
   (k)   Non-liability.  Neither the Keyser Water Board, the City of Keyser or
any of its delegated agents, employees or assigns shall be liable for any
damage resulting from the enforcement of this Ordinance or any work, services,
inspections, etc. undertaken by the City of Keyser in accordance with the terms
of this Ordinance or any other laws, regulations or directives of the WVBPH
which may be required for purposes of the City of Keyser, it's citizens and
users under the directives of the WVBPH.
   (l)   Right of Entry for Purpose of Inspection.  The water purveyor, and any
of its duly authorized employees, agents or other representatives of the City
of Keyser and the Keyser Water Board bearing proper credentials for purposes of
inspection, observation, measurements, sampling and testing pertinent to the
compliance of the instant ordinance and for the protection of the Keyser City
water supply shall have a right of entry onto private property for purposes of
compliance and enforcement in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance.
   (m)   Required Safety Procedures.  While performing the necessary work on
private properties under the terms of this Ordinance, the water purveyor and
any of its duly authorized employees, agents or other representatives shall
observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the City of
Keyser or other state or federal law regulation.
   (n)   Penalties.  Any owner violating any provisions of this Ordinance shall
be guilty of a misdemeanor and liable unto the City of Keyser in an amount
equal to the amount of damages incurred by the City as a result of the
violation. In addition to any such damages incurred by the City as a result of
such violation, the violator shall be fined not less than $50.00 nor more than
$250.00 for a first offense under this Ordinance. For a second or any
subsequent offense, the violator shall be fined not less than $100.00 nor more
than $500.00.

   (k)   Unauthorized Connections Prohibited.
      (1)   No person shall connect to or turn on any sewer service, or cut-in,
interconnect, tap or make any alterations to any main or distribution or
collection pipe of the City sewer system or permit any connection or tapping to
be made to the sewer system on his premises or the premises occupied by him, or
knowingly use the sewer service from connections in violation of any of the
provisions of this article or any rules or regulations adopted by the Utility
Board or the State of West Virginia, with respect thereto.
      (2)   Roof drains, yard and area drains, footer drains, or any line
carrying flow other than exclusively sanitary wastewater is prohibited from
connection to the sanitary sewer system.
   (l)   Establishment of Schedule of Rates: Use of Water Meters.
      (1)   For the payment of the proper and reasonable expense of operation,
repair, replacement, improvements, additions, betterment, extensions and
maintenance of the sewer system and for the payment of the sums required to pay
the principal and interest of all sewer revenue bonds as they become due, the
Utility Board shall enact and may from time to time amend a schedule of just
and equitable rates or charges for the use of and service rendered by the
municipal sewer system, which schedule of rates or charges shall be based upon
the metered amount of water supplied to the premises; and each schedule shall
be maintained on file in the office of the City Administrator while it is in
effect.
      (2)   Until such time as the Utility Board adopts a schedule of rates or
charges pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this section, the rates and
changes in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this article shall
continue in full force and effect.
   (m)   Established Rates Applicable to Premises Subsequently Served.  The
rates or charges so established for any class of users or property served shall
be extended to cover any additional premises hereafter served which fall within
the same class, without the necessity of any hearing or notice.
   (n)   Subject to Established Rates or Charges.  The City of Keyser shall be
subject to the established charges and rates, or to charges and rates
established in harmony therewith, for services rendered to the City and shall
pay such rates or charges, when due, from corporate funds which shall be deemed
to be a part of the revenues of the sewage system and works and be applied as
provided for the application of such revenues.

All rates or charges provided for by this article shall be billed and collected
monthly by the Utility Board or by persons or agencies authorized by the
Utility Board. All bills shall be considered due and payable on or before the
tenth day following the date rendered.
   (p)   Lien for Enforcement of Collection of Billed Rates or Charges.  All
such rates or charges, if not paid when due, shall be a lien upon the premises
served by such system or works, and if such rates or charges are not paid
within thirty (30) days after due, then the amount thereof, together with a
penalty of ten percent (10%) and a reasonable attorney's fee, may be recovered
by the City in a civil action in the name of the Utility Board. In connection
with such action, such lien may be foreclosed against such lot, parcel of land
or building, in accordance with the laws relating thereto.
   (q)   Industrial Use of Sewers.  Where the character of sewage from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it imposes
a burden upon the sewer system in addition to the burden imposed by the average
sewage entering the sewer system, such additional charge shall be made
therefore as the Utility Board shall deem to be fair and equitable to meet the
additional cost of collection, treatment and disposal of such sewage; and the
Utility Board may, if it deems advisable to do so, compel the owner, tenant or
occupant of such manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises to
treat such sewage in such manner as shall be specified by the Utility Board or
other applicable State law before discharging into the sewer system.
   (r)   Duration of Liability for Sewer Service.  Liability for service shall
begin for a user on the date of connection to the sewer system, and such
liability shall continue thereafter unless such premises are disconnected from
the sewer system with the approval of the Utility Board.  After such liability
begins, no allowance shall be made for vacant houses unless user requests in
writing that the Utility Board have the same system shut off, nor will any
allowance be made for any shut off period that is less than thirty (30) days.
   (s)   User’s Responsibility to Keep Sewer Clean.  The owner, tenant or
occupant of the property shall be continuously and solely responsible for
maintaining and keeping the sewer pipe leading to and between the plumbing
system of his premises to the connecting sewer line clean and free from
obstruction, and shall not cause, suffer or permit any article or thing, liquid
as well as solid, to be introduced into the pipe which causes a stoppage
thereof.  In the event of any such obstructions or stoppage, the Utility Board
shall have the right to cut off the water connection, which shall not be
reconnected until such sewer pipe is cleaned and maintained properly, and in
the further event of the failure of such user to remedy such obstruction or
stoppage, the Utility Board or its representatives shall have the right to
enter upon said premises and make necessary repairs, the costs and expenses of
which shall be included as part of the charges against such premises.
   (t)   Leaks.  No allowance or adjustment of any sewer bill shall be made for
water leaks of any nature occurring on the user’s side of the meter if the
water so leaked enters the sewer.
   (u)   Not Liable for Damage.  Neither the Utility Board or the City shall be
liable for any damage resulting from bursting of any sewer main, service pipe
or valve, or from discontinuing the operation of its sewer collection,
treatment and disposal facilities, for repairs, extensions or connections, or
from the accidental failure of the sewage collection, treatment and disposal
facilities from any cause whatsoever.  In cases of emergency, the Utility Board
shall have the right to restrict the use of its sewage collection, treatment
and disposal facilities in any reasonable manner for the protection of the City
and its sewer system.
   (v)   Tampering with Sewer Appurtenances.  No person shall turn, lift,
remove, raise or tamper with any cover or any manhole, basin, inlet or other
appurtenance of any public sanitary and/or storm sewer or of any combined sewer
or sanitary sewer of the City without a written permit from the Utility Board.
   (w)   Entering Sewer.  No person, other than one employed by the Utility
Board, or its representatives, shall enter any public sanitary and/or storm
sewer or appurtenance thereof or enter any public combined sewer or sanitary
sewer without a written permit from the Utility Board.
   (x)   Injury to Sewer.  No person shall break or damage any public sewer or
appurtenance of part thereof.  (Ord. 252.  Passed 9-9-99.)

described waters or wastes to any public sewer:
      (1)   Any gasoline, benzene, naphtha, fuel oil, or other flammable or
explosive liquid, solid, or gas.
      (2)   Any waters containing toxic or poisonous solids, liquids, or gases
in sufficient quantity, either singly or by interaction with other wastes which
injure or interfere with any waste treatment process; constitute a hazard to
humans or animals; create a public nuisance; or create any hazard in the
receiving waters of the wastewater treatment plant.
      (3)   Any waters or wastes having a pH lower or higher than that normally
encountered in the system, or having any other corrosive property capable of
causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment/operation and personnel of
the wastewater works without a permit to do so.
      (4)   Solid or viscous substances in quantities or of such size capable
of causing obstruction to the flow in sewers, or other interference with the
proper operation of the wastewater facilities such as, but not limited to,
ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings, metal, glass, rags,
feathers, tar, plastics, wood, ungrounded garbage, whole blood, paunch manure,
hair and fleshings, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc.,
either whole or ground by garbage grinders.
   (d)   Toxic Substances.  The following described substances, materials,
waters, or waste shall be limited in discharges to City sewer system to
concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers, wastewater
treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property,
or constitute a nuisance. The Utility Board may set limitations lower than the
limitations established in the regulations below if, in its opinion, such
additional limitations are necessary to meet the above
objectives. In forming its opinion as to the acceptability, the Utility Board
will give consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject waste in
relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of construction of
the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the
wastewater treatment plant, degree of treatability of the waste in the
wastewater treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or
restrictions on materials or characteristics of waste or wastewater discharged
to the sanitary sewer, which shall not be violated without approval of the
Utility Board, are as follows:
      (1)   Wastewater having a temperature higher than 150 degrees Fahrenheit
(65 deg. Celsius).
      (2)   Wastewater containing more than 25 milligrams per liter of
petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oils, or product of mineral oil origin.
      (3)   Wastewater from industrial plants containing floatable oils, fat,

applicable state or federal regulations.
      (8)   Quantities of flow concentrations, or both which constitute a
"slug" as defined herein.
      (9)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the wastewater treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
      (10)   Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or
wastes in the public sewer system, release obnoxious gases, from suspended
solids which interfere with the collection system, or create a condition
deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
   (e)   Conditional Service.
      (1)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which in the judgment of the Utility Board may
have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment,
or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a
public nuisance, the Utility Board may:
         A.   Reject the wastes.
         B.   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
public sewers.
         C.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge, and/
or
         D.   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes covered by existing taxes or sewer charges.
         E.   Terminate the users sewerage service.
      (2)   When considering the above alternatives, the Utility Board shall
give consideration to the economic impact of each alternative on the
discharger. If the Utility Board permits the pretreatment or equalization of
waste flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be
subject to the review and approval of the Utility Board.
   (f)   Grease. Oil and Sand Separators.  Grease, oil and sand interceptors
shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Manager, they are necessary for
the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive
amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except
that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the Utility Board, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors the owner

as preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the Utility Board
and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or
character may be accepted by the Utility Board for treatment. (Ord. 252. 
Passed 9-9-99.)
925.05 POWERS AND AUTHORITY OF INSPECTORS.
   (a)   Right of Entry for Purpose of Inspection.  The Manager, duly
authorized employees or other representatives of the Utility Board bearing
proper credentials for the purpose of inspection, observation, measurements,
sampling, and testing pertinent to discharge to the community system shall have
a right of entry to private property for purposes of inspection in accordance
with the provisions of this article.
   (b)   Collection of Information.  The Manager, duly authorized employees or
other representatives of the Utility Board are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial processes that have a direct bearing on the kind and
source of discharge to the wastewater collection system.
   (c)   Required Safety Procedures.  While performing the necessary work on
private properties, the Manager, duly authorized employees or other
representatives of the Utility Board shall observe all safety rules applicable
to the premises established by the company or other State or Federal
regulation.
   (d)   Right of Entry To and From All Negotiated Easements.  The Manager,
duly authorized employees or other representatives of the Utility Board bearing
proper credentials and identification shall be permitted to enter all private
properties through which the City holds a duly negotiated easement for the

sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the wastewater facilities
lying within said easement. All entry and subsequent work if any, on said
easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly
negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved.
(Ord. 252.  Passed 9-9-99.)
925.06  MINIMUM STANDARDS FOR PRIVATELY CONSTRUCTED SANITARY SEWERS.
   Sanitary sewers shall be designed and constructed in accordance with the
following minimum standards.
   (a)    Minimum Size.  No public sewer shall be less than eight (8) inches in
diameter except that six (6) inch diameter pipe may be used for short, dead-end
sewers where no possibility of future extension exists.
   (b)    Depth.  In general, sewers shall be sufficiently deep so as to
receive sewage from basements and to prevent freezing.
   (c)   Slope.  All sewers shall be so designed and constructed to give mean
velocities, when flowing full, of not less than 2.0 feet per second, based on
Manning's formula using an "n" value of 0.013. The following are the minimum
slopes which shall be provided:
Sewer size
Minimum Slope in Feet per 100 feet
6 inch
0.62
8 inch
0.40
10 inch
0.28
12 inch
0.22
15 inch
0.15
 
   Sewers on 20 percent slope or greater shall be anchored securely with
concrete anchors, or equal, spaced as follows:
- Not over 36 feet center to center on grades 20 percent and up to 35 percent.
- Not over 24 feet center to center on grades 35 percent and up to 50 percent.
- Not over 16 feet center to center on grades 50 percent and over.
   (d)   Alignment.   Sewers shall be laid with straight alignment and constant
slope between manholes.
   (e)   Increasing Size.  When a smaller sewer joins a larger one, the invert
of the larger sewer should be lowered sufficiently to maintain the same energy
gradient. An approximate method for obtaining these results is to place the
crown of both sewers at the same elevation.
   (f)   High Velocity Protection.  Where velocities greater than 15 feet per
second are expected, special provisions shall be made to protect against
internal erosion by high velocity. The pipe shall conform to appropriate ASTM
or AWWA specifications which provide protection against internal erosion.
   (g)   Materials. 
      (1)   Any generally accepted material for sewers will be given
consideration, but the material selected should be adapted to local conditions,
such as character of industrial wastes, possibility of septicity, soil
characteristics, exceptionally heavy external loadings, abrasion and similar
problems.
      (2)   All sewers shall be designed to prevent damage for superimposed
loads. Proper allowance for loads on the sewer shall be made based on the width
and depth of trench. When standard strength sewer pipe is not sufficient, the
additional strength needed may be obtained by using extra strength pipe or by
special construction.
   (h)   Joints and Infiltration.
      (1)   Sewer joints shall be designed to prevent infiltration and to
prevent the entrance of roots. When clay sewer pipe is used, the joints shall
be compression joints for vitrified claybell and spigot pipe and made in
conformance with the appropriate ASTM Specification. When concrete pipe is
used, single rubber ring gasket joints shall conform to the appropriate ASTM
specification. When asbestos cement pipe is used, joints using couplings and
gaskets shall be made in conformance with the requirements of the manufacturer.
Joints for organic material pipe shall be compression gaskets. No joints or
material shall be less than those hereinafter described.
      (2)   An acceptance test shall be specified for all gravity sewer lines.
The test may be either a water test or an air test. Where water testing is used
(infiltration or exfiltration), the leakage outward or inward shall not exceed
100 gallons per inch of nominal pipe diameter per mile per day for any section
of the system including manholes. Where the exfiltration test is employed, the
line shall be subjected to a minimum of 4 feet of head or head to top of the
manhole, whichever is the lesser above the crown of the pipe at the upstream
manhole of the section being tested. The infiltration test shall be allowed
only when it can be shown that the hydrostatic head at the pipeline is a
minimum of 4 feet above the crown of the pipe for the entire length of the pipe
being tested.
      (3)   Where air testing is used, test methods and acceptability criteria
shall be in accordance with the appropriate ASTM specifications. Air testing
shall generally be acceptable for all types of pipe materials. If air testing
is employed, the manholes shall be tested by exfiltration.  Inflatable stoppers
shall be used to plug all lines into and out of the manhole being tested. The
stoppers shall be positioned in the lines far enough from the manhole to insure
testing of those portions of the lines not air tested. The manhole shall then
be filled with water to the top. A 12-hour soak shall be allowed. Leakage shall
not exceed ½ gallon per hour.
   (i)   Bedding. 
      (1)   The sewer pipe shall be bedded in compacted granular material
placed on a flat trench bottom. The granular bedding shall have a minimum
thickness of 6 inches under the barrel of the pipe and shall extend up the
sides to a minimum height of one-half the outside diameter of the pipe. The
remainder of the side fills and to a minimum depth of 12 inches over the top of
the pipe shall be filled with compacted select backfill material, containing no
stones.
      (2)   Bedding material shall be placed in maximum 6 inch layers and
compacted of 98% density in accordance with ASSHTO T-99.
   (j)   Backfill and Tamping.  The following procedures shall govern for
placing and compacting backfill above the bedding zone (the bedding zone
extends to at least 12 inches above the crown of the pipe):
      (1)   Trenches shall be carefully backfilled with excavated material
approved for backfilling, consisting of earth, loam, sandy clay, sand and
gravel, soft shale or other approved materials, free from large clods of earth
or stones larger than four inches in diameter.
      (2)   Backfill above the bedding zone shall be placed in maximum two (2)
foot layers and thoroughly tamped to 95% density.
      (3)   Trenches in state highway right-of-ways shall be excavated,
backfilled and compacted in accordance with the requirements of the West
Virginia Department of Highways and Transportation.
   
   (k)   Manholes shall conform to the following requirements:
      (1)   Manhole location.  Manholes shall be installed at the end of each
line; at all changes in grade, size or alignment; at all intersections; and at
distance not greater than 400 feet.  Terminal cleanouts may be acceptable on
lines less than eight inches in diameter in lieu of manholes on a case-by-case
basis.
      (2)   Drop Manholes.  Drop pipe shall be provided for a sewer entering a
manhole at an elevation of 24 inches or more above the manhole invert. Outside
drop connections shall be encased in concrete. Where the difference is
elevation between the incoming sewer and the manhole invert is less than 24
inches, the invert shall be filleted to prevent solids deposition.
      (3)   Manhole Diameter.  The minimum diameter of manholes shall be 48
inches. Manholes shall be constructed with an eccentric top.
      (4)   Manhole Materials.  Manholes shall be constructed of precast
concrete conforming to ASTM designation C-478. Manhole wall and bottom
construction shall be such as to ensure water tightness.
      (5)   Manhole Flow Channel.  The flow channel through manholes shall be
of such shape and slope to provide smooth transition between inlet and outlet
sewers and to reduce turbulence.  Benches shall be sloped to the channel to
prevent accumulation of solids.
      (6)   Manhole Connections.  Line connections directly to the manhole or
to short stups integral with the manhole shall be made with flexible joints.
Flexible joints are joints which permit the manhole to settle without
destroying the watertight integrity of the line connections.
   (l)   Building Connections.  
      (1)   Building connections to the sewer mains shall be made by means of
full-body eye fittings.
      (2)   Sewers shall be designed and constructed in a manner that will
protect the water system from any possible contamination. Wherever possible,
sewers should be laid at least 10 feet, horizontally, from any existing or
proposed water main. Should local conditions prevent a lateral separation of 10
feet, a sewer may be laid closer than 10 feet to a water main if the elevation
of the crown of the sewer can be maintained at least 18 inches below the invert
of the water main. Whenever sewers must cross under water mains, the sewer
shall be laid at such an elevation that the top of the sewer is at least 18
inches below the bottom of the water main.
      (3)   Properly engineered plans and specifications for the sewage
collection system shall be submitted to the City of Keyser for review and
approval. In addition, documentation shall be submitted showing that State
Health Department approval of the plans and specifications and a permit to
proceed with construction have been obtained.
      (4)   During construction, the City of Keyser shall have the right to
inspect the work and to ascertain that the system has been tested and meets the
minimum requirements set forth in the approved plans and specifications.
      (5)   If the proposed sewage collection system contains special items
such as pumping stations, inverted siphons, aerial sewers, etc., the design
shall be in accordance with standard engineering practice, subject to the final
approval of the City of Keyser.
      (6)   The City of Keyser shall be reimbursed by the applicant for all
costs incurred for plan review, construction inspection, testing,
administrative activities, and related matters.
         (Ord. 252.  Passed 9-9-99.)
925.07  AMENDMENTS.
   (a)   The City of Keyser shall, upon an annual basis, or as deemed necessary
from time to time between annual reviews, review and cause to be enacted, such
amendments to the Sewer Use Ordinance as may be recommended by the Utility
Board as otherwise are necessary to bring this Ordinance into compliance with
applicable Federal and State regulations and changes thereto.  All such
amendments shall clearly delineate Article and Section to the altered or
expanded.
   (b)   It shall be the responsibility of the Utility Board and the Keyser
City Attorney to review and render a decision as to a precedence involving a
present or past Ordinance to insure compliance with applicable statutes prior
to rendering such precedence. Upon resolution of the discrepancy and the
precedence set, an amendment to the Sewer Use Ordinance.
(Ord. 252.  Passed 9-9-99.)

(Ord. 252.  Passed 9-9-99.)
925.10 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Rules and regulations for the government of sewerage utilities,
adopted by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia, and now in effect,
and all amendments thereto and modifications thereof hereafter made by said
Commission.
   (b)   In the event a building or premises discharging sewage, water or other
liquid wastes into the municipal sanitary sewer system uses water supplied on
other than a metered basis from the City of Keyser municipal water system or
from any other source of water supply, the owner or occupant shall be required
to cause a water or sewer meter or other measuring devise to be installed but
pending such installation the sewer service rates and charges to such building
or premises shall be based upon an estimated quantity of water used based upon
prior average usage.
   (c)   In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises uses water in
excess of 50,000 gallons per month and it can be shown to the satisfaction of
the City Council that a substantial portion of the water as measured by the
water meter does not and cannot enter the sewer facilities of the City, then
the City may determine, in such manner as may be found practical, the amount of
sewage entering the sewer system and the sewer service rate or charge shall be
based thereon, or, the City may require or permit, at user’s expense and fees,
the installation of additional meters or measuring devices in such manner as to
determine the quantity of sewage actually entering the sewer facilities, in
which case the sewer service rate or charge shall be based thereon. (Issued 12-
14-16.)

925.12 SCHEDULE NO. 2
   (a)   Surface or Ground Water Surcharge.  An additional amount shall be
charged where surface or groundwater is introduced into the sanitary system
where evidence of a violation exists.  Surcharge formula to be applied in cases
where surface drainage is connected to the utility’s sewer system.
   (b)   Applicability. 
      (1)   Whenever the utility has discovered that a customer’s roof drain,
downspout, storm sewer or similar facilities conducting surface water have been
connected to the utility’s sewer system and such customer has failed to take
appropriate actions, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand by the
utility in accordance with the Rules of the Public Service Commission, to
eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the customer
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
            S = A x R x 0.0006233 x C
         S =   the surcharge in dollars
         A=   the area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection
         R =   the measured monthly rainfall, in inches
               0.0006233 =   a conversion factor to change inches of rain x
square feet of surface water to thousands of gallons of water
         C =   the utility’s approved rate per thousand gallons of metered
water usage
      (2)   The Utility shall not impose the surcharge unless and until the
customer has been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
hand delivery, that it has been established by smoke testing, dye testing or
on-site inspection that rain or surface water is being introduced into the
sanitary sewer system at the customer’s location, and that the customer has not
acted within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice to divert the water
from the sanitary sewer system.  The surcharge shall be calculated and imposed
for each month that the condition continues to exist.  Failure to pay the
surcharge and/or correct the situation shall give rise to the possible
termination of water service in accordance with the Rules of the Public Service
Commission of West Virginia.  (Issued 12-14-16)
925.13 SCHEDULE NO. 3.
   Surcharge Formula to be Applied in the Case of Users Producing Unusual
Waste.  The charge for the treatment of unusual waste will be calculated on the
basis of the following formula:
               Ci = VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
      Ci   =charge to unusual users per year
      Vo   =average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume,
in dollars per gallon
      Vi   =volume of wastewater from unusual users, in gallon per year
      Bo   =average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD) in dollars per pound
      Bi   =weight of BOD from unusual users, in pounds per year
      So   =average unit cost of treatment (including sludge treatment)
chargeable to total solids in dollars per pound
      Si   =weight of total solids from unusual users in pounds per year
   When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and
the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made.  Waste containing
materials which, in judgment of the City of Keyser Sanitary Board, should not
be introduced into the sewer system need not be handled by it.  The results of
this preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of the
proposed sewer service and the charge thereof, based upon the formula set out
above.
   Thereafter, unusual sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and at the
conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation and audit of the
City of Keyser Sanitary Board records, new cost figures will be calculated for
use in the above formula.  The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities

APPLICABILITY
   Whenever the utility has discovered that a customer’s roof drain, downspout,
storm sewer or similar facilities conducting surface water have been connected
to the utility’s sewer system and such customer has failed to take appropriate
action, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand by the utility in
accordance with the Rules of the Public Service Commission, to eliminate such
connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the customer calculated on the
basis of the following formula:
            S = A x R x 0.0006233 x C
      S   =the surcharge in dollars
      A   =the area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection
surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet

within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice to divert the water from
the sanitary sewer system.  The surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for

         Ci   =charge to unusual users per year
         Vo   =average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to
volume, in dollars per gallon
         Vi   =volume of wastewater from unusual users, in gallons per year
         Bo   =average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD) in dollars per pound
         Bi   =weight of BOD from unusual users, in pounds per year
         So   =average unit cost of treatment (including sludge treatment)
chargeable to total solids in dollars per pound
         Si   =weight of total solids from unusual users in pounds per year
   When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and
the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made.  Waste containing
materials which, in judgement of the City of Keyser Sanitary Board, should not
be introduced into the sewer system need not be handled by it.  The results of
this preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of the
proposed sewer service and the charge thereof, based upon the formula set out
above.
   Thereafter, unusual sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and at the
conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation and audit of the
City of Keyser Sanitary Board records, new cost figures will be calculated for
use in the above formula.  The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities
shall be paid by the unusual user.  Based on these audited figures, additional
billings covering the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each unusual
user, or refund given by the City of Keyser Sanitary Board, as the case may
be.  Such audited figures will then be used for the preliminary billing for the
next fiscal year, at the end of which an adjustment will be made as aforesaid.

   Where the amount of sanitary sewage discharged into the Sanitary Board’s
System by certain industrial plant or plants cannot be accurately determined by

plant or plants will pay to the Sanitary Board a sewer charge calculated at
fifty (50) gallons of water per each employee at the plant each working day.
   (e)   SCHEDULE NO. 5
AVAILABILITY
   Available for haulers of septic waste, leachate or other wastewater.

   (c)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  This article supersedes any
provisions or restrictions currently in effect in flood-prone areas.  However,
any underlying ordinance shall remain in full force and effect to the extent
that those provisions are more restrictive.
   (d)   Severability.  If any section, paragraph, sentence, clause or phrase
of this article should be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such
decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this article which shall
remain in full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this
article are hereby declared to be severable.
   (e)   Municipal Liability.  The granting of a permit or approval of a
subdivision plan in identified flood-prone area(s) shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the Municipality or by
any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the
proposed use, and shall create no liability upon the Municipality, its
officials or employees.
(Ord. 173.  Passed 8-12-09.)
1711.02  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   Issuance of Permit.  The Building Permit Officer shall issue a

construction will be in conformance with all applicable requirements and
regulations.
   (b)   Application Procedures.  Application for such a building permit shall
be made, in writing, to the Building Permit Officer on forms supplied by the
Municipality.  Such application shall contain at least the following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant.
      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed construction is
to occur.
      (3)   Name and address of contractor.
      (4)   Site location.

Permit Officer, no changes of any kind shall be made to the application, permit
or any of the plans, specifications or other documents submitted with the
application without the written consent or approval of the Building Permit
Officer.
   (d)   Placard.  In addition to the building permit, the Building Permit
Officer shall issue a placard which shall be displayed on the premises during
the time construction is in progress.  This placard shall display the number of
the building permit, the date of its issuance and signature of the Building
Permit Officer.
   (e)   Start of Construction.  Work on the proposed construction shall begin
within six (6) months after the date of the issuance of the building permit or
the permit shall expire, unless a time extension is granted in writing, by the
Building Permit Officer.  Construction shall be considered to have started with
the first replacement of permanent construction of this site, such as the
pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation.  For a
structure without a basement or poured footings, the start of construction
includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure of any part
thereof on its pilings or foundation, or the affixing of any prefabricated
structure or mobile home to permanent site.  Permanent construction does not
include land preparation, land clearing, grading, filling, excavation for
basement, footings, piers or foundation, erection of temporary forms, the
installation of piling under proposed subsurface footings, or the installation
of sewer, gas and water pipes, or electric or other service lines from the
street.
   (f)   Inspection and Revocation.  During the construction period, the
Building Permit Officer or other authorized official may inspect the premises
to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the information
provided on the permit application and with all applicable municipal laws and
ordinances.  In the event the Building Permit Officer discovers that the work
does not comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and
ordinances, or that there has been a false statement or misrepresentation by
the applicant, the Building Permit Officer shall revoke the building permit and
report such fact to the City Building Commission for whatever action it
considers necessary.
   (g)   Fees.  Application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a
fee, payable to the municipality, based upon the estimated cost of the proposed
construction as determined by the Building Permit Officer at the following
rates:
Estimated Cost           Fee
$00.00 to $500.00        $0.00
$501.00 to $2,000.00     $10.00

And:  an additional assignment of $20.00 for each addition $1,000.00 or part
thereof beyond the first $12,000.00.
   For purposes of determining an estimated cost of the proposed construction,
the Building Permit Officer shall have the right to review and inspect any 
contractor estimates, mortgage applications or other information in the
possession of the applicant, which would assist the Building Permit Officer in
assessing a fair cost of construction.
   (h)   Appeals.  Any person aggrieved by the Building Permit Officer’s
estimate of the cost of the proposed construction may appeal to the City
Building Commission.  Such appeal must be filed, in writing, within thirty (30)
days after the determination of the Building Permit Officer.  Upon receipt of
such appeal, the City Building Commission shall set a time and place not less
than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days for the purposed hearing of the
appeal.  Notice of the time and place of the hearing of the appeal shall be
given to all parties at which time they may appear to be heard.  The
determination of the estimated cost by the City Building Commission shall be
final in all cases.  Any person aggrieved by a final determination of the City
Building Commission shall be entitled to seek an appeal before the Circuit
Court of Mineral County within twenty (20) days of the date of the final
determination.
   (i)   Penalties.  Any person, partnership, business or corporation who fails

construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.  Although
a    permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does
not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of

the fair market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement.
         B.   This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined    herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
The term does not, however,    include any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violation of State or local health, sanitary or
safety code specifications which have been identified    by the local Code
Enforcement Official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions.
         C.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with
all Ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure.  Documentation that a specific Ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer.  Any
exemption from Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to
occur when the first    alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other
structural part of the building commences    whether or not the alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure.

side of a stream indicate the top of the bank.  In the field a professional
familiar with fluvial geomorphology should    document the top of the bank. 
When a professional is not employed the top of the bank may be considered to be
the top of the first significant slope landward of the water's edge when it is
followed by at least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (42)   Variances. If compliance with any of the requirements of this
article would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder,
developer or landowner, the City of Keyser may, upon request, grant relief from
the strict application of the requirements.           
   Considerations for the issuance of Variances to this article shall adhere to
the    following criteria:
         A.   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon; (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances.
         B.   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the Special
Flood Hazard Area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,
shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance.
         C.   An affirmative decision granting a Floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
         D.   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in
writing and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that:
            (i)   The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a
structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance, and
            (ii)   Such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases
risk to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record
of all decisions as required in this Ordinance; and
         E.   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall:
            (i)    Maintain a record of all decisions including justification
for the decisions, and
            (ii)    Report such decisions issued in its biannual report to the
    Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (43)   Violation.  The failure of any structure or development to be
fully compliant with all the requirements of this Ordinance. Any structure or
other development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate or other evidence of compliance required by this Ordinance is
presumed to be in violation until such time as the documentation is provided. 
(Passed 2-14-18.)
1721.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Keyser which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Keyser by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) dated 03/19/2013 or the most recent revision thereof
including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by the City of Keyser by use of historic
or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized "Local Flood
Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the level of
technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas.  The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area Without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated Floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area. 
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by City of Keyser where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/
or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes.  However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      (2)   City of Keyser's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions.  As soon as
practical but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the City of Keyser shall notify the NFIP Administrator of
the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   City of Keyser may identify and regulate new flood hazard or
ponding areas.  These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map"
using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies.
   (d)   Boundary Disputes.  Should a dispute concerning the location of a
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Keyser. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail.  Elevation data certified by a Licensed
Professional Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this ordinance if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOFA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area.  A LOMA is required within 90 days of a permit
being issued. If a LOMA is not received within 90 days of the permit being
issued the applicant will not receive a Certificate of Occupancy or Completion,
thus denying the applicant occupation of the structure or activation of power
until this requirement is met. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest
the applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either; The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study, or  The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the City
of Keyser in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall then be
required to conform to all appropriate flood damage reduction provisions of
this ordinance.
         (Passed 2-14-18.)
1721.04  UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway.  Within any Floodway Area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the City of Keyser during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The
resultant engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (1)   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere.  In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the Floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant  amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
City of Keyser, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent
land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood hazard area
as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of
the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe.  Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities, and/
or development shall be under taken in strict compliance with the flood-
proofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable
codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE  Without Floodway.  Within any AE  without Floodway Area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).
      (1)   Within any Approximated Floodplain Area:
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
         B.   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the
specific flood risk at the site.  The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
will be reasonably safe from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses or other techniques.  When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
are required, they shall only be undertaken by a Registered Professional
Engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study shall include a cover letter,
signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in
basic terms.  In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided
that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (e)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of Keyser's Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office,  any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream.  Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  In addition prior to issuing the local
permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from which Federal or State Law requires approval.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the CITY OF KEYSER in writing that
the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment.  If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City of Keyser a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1721.08 (c).
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.  (Passed 2-14-18.)
1721.05  CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   General.

contracts or addendums.  Failure to present contract or addendums for review
shall void the permit.  If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work
is of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including material
and labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. 
      (1)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation
requirements contained herein.  Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the elevation of the lowest floor above the
freeboard height required by this Ordinance.
      (2)   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following
information shall also be included in the application for work within the
Special flood hazard area:
         A.   For all structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
            1.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
            2.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer or licensed Professional Surveyor.
            3.   Plans showing the methods of elevating the proposed structure

Administrator, a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall prepare
these plans.
            4.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
            5.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic
elements of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical
construction, it is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by
obtaining elevation data completed by a Registered Professional Engineer or
licensed Professional Surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor.  If a
mistake in elevation has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
            6.   A finished construction elevation certificates shall be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate shall confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities, is elevated in compliance with
permit conditions.
            7.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the City of Keyser determines that the area below the first floor
could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas
below base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more).  This agreement shall
state:
               i.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this Ordinance.
               ii.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement.  It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.  Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1721.08 (c).
         B.     For all structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the
Base Flood Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing
requirements contained herein.  Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this Ordinance.  In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
            1.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared
by a Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed
structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
            2.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits,
certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional
Surveyor.
            3.   A Flood Proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the
plans in subsection (c)(2)B.1. hereof, stating that the finished structure,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, are designed so that:
               i.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               ii.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic,
hydrodynamic, buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood
depths, velocities, pressures, and other factors associated with the Base
Flood.
         C.     For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant
materials used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage, (Appurtenant
Structures only)
            1.   A site plan prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor.  The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.  The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
            2.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must
be prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
               i.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
               ii.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized
by allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
                  a)   A minimum of two openings have a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
                  b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
                  c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves
or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
            3.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion
agreement and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion
agreement to any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of
the transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1721.08 (c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.
      (1)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks.  These
proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they
are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
         A.   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
         B.   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fill areas.
         C.   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
         D.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments
which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the
approximated floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2)
acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include Base Flood Elevation data and
shall delineate a floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain
Administrator.
            1.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the Base Flood.
            2.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
State and Local Water Resource Department.
            3.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study.  This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
         E.   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant    vertical distance above the
Approximated Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development
of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the
site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two
(2) or five (5) feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to
be developed and the location of the special flood hazard boundary area as
scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed
Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.  (Passed 2-14-
18.)
1721.06  SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
   Design and Construction Standards.  In order to prevent excessive damage to
buildings, structures, and related utilities and facilities, the following
restrictions apply to all development, subdivision proposals, manufactured home
parks, new construction and to construction of substantial improvements, and
the repair of substantial damage, to existing structures occurring in the
Special flood hazard area.
   (a)   Basements and Lowest Floors.
      (1)   Residential Structures - All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement,
ductwork and utilities, elevated to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Non-residential Structures - All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of non-

ductwork and utilities, elevated to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation;
or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so
that the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water from the lowest structural element to two feet above the Base
Flood Elevation.
      (3)   Openings - For all new construction, relocation, substantial
improvements, and repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters.  Designs for
meeting this requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.

         C.   All manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10.1,10.2, and 10B
as authorized by West Virginia Code § 21-9-4 or the most recent revisions
thereof. The anchoring shall be adequate to resist flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement.  Methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to the
over-the-top and frame ties, attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground
anchors may not be adequate to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements.
This requirement is in addition to applicable State and Local anchoring
requirements for resisting wind forces.
         D.   Permanently attached rigid skirts and/or perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block shall have openings to prevent collapse and damage to supporting
piers. The openings shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            i.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.

      (2)   The licensed WV manufactured home installer placing the unit shall
perform a site inspection    and certify in writing that the manufactured home
has been installed to the standards set forth    in this Ordinance.
   (c)   Appurtenant Structures.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection 2 below, appurtenant structures
shall be located out of the Special Flood Hazard Area or elevated to two feet
above the Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
      (3)   Use of the structure shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
         A.   Structures shall be no more than 200 square feet in size and
valued at less than $5,000.00.
         B.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
         C.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to minimize
flood damage.
         D.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately

resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         E.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2 shall be used in the construction of the below BFE.
         F.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         G.   The venting requirements contained in subsection (a) hereof are
applicable and shall be strictly adhered to. 
      (4)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance with this
Ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence
of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature.  A copy of
all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.  Failure
to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1721.08 (c).
   (d)   Recreational Vehicle Placement.  Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days.  Or,
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use.  A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnected utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions.  Or,
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
   (e)   Fill.
      (1)   The City of Keyser officially recognizes the beneficial functions
the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during floods.
Therefore:
      (2)   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
      (3)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of soil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (4)   No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway
      (5)   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1721.04 (a). All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or
exceed the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties.  The City of Keyser may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties.  When required,
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered
Professional Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.  The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.  In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the City of Keyser.  During permit
review the City of Keyser shall consider the following issues that have the
potential to cause adverse impact to the subject property and adjacent
properties:
            i.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            ii.   Blocking drainage from adjacent properties.
            iii.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            iv.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            v.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.   
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Fill Site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection.  For non-residential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the
perimeter of a non-residential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only.  Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         H.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            i.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            ii.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued.  After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance can be
issued. 
         J.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development.  All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback.  A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice
the width of the watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the
top of the opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained
from the top of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural
vegetation shall be maintained in this area.  Where natural vegetation does not
exist along the watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high
priority shall be given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize
banks, enhance flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      (1)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the  Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback Area.  The conditions shall be the minimum necessary and
shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage.
      (1)   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      (2)   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures
   (l)   Backflow Preventers.  Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area Floodplain Area.  (Passed 2-14-18.)

investigation that a permitted development is non-compliant with the provisions
of this law and/or the conditions of the permit, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify the violator by means of written violation notice. Violation
notice
   shall specify the nature of the violation and request that the violation be
corrected within fifteen (15) days from the date appearing on the notice.
Failure to correct the violation within this time period shall be cause    for
revocation of the permit and the governing body or authorized employee or agent
to;
         A.   Seek an injunction in the Circuit Court of Mineral County to 
restrain the violator from continuing the violation including but not limited
to request for the removal of structure and land use from the property
involved; and
         B.   Seek a misdemeanor conviction in Magistrate Court or Circuit
Court. 
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use of occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the building or land conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance. Occupying
or using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1721.08 (c).
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the utility
inspector is in possession of a copy of the Certificate of Compliance issued by
the Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular development being
inspected conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance.  Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1721.08 (c).
      (3)   In areas of flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a Certificate of
Compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
development conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance.  Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section 8.3 of this Ordinance.
      (4)   A Certificate of Compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this Ordinance or local administrative procedures
and any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood
proofing certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as
a condition of the permit approval process.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   A Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by the City of Keyser.
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this ordinance shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to City of Keyser based upon a set schedule approved by the City of
Keyser  using the estimated value of the proposed construction as determined by
the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
City of Keyser for any additional costs for services necessary for review and/
or inspection of proposed development.  Services include, but are not limited
to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain Administrator may
require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional costs may include
reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the County for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway.  To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this Ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.
         (Passed 2-14-18.)
1721.08 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
