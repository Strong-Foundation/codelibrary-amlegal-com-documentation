vested by law in a justice of the peace, except that he shall have no
jurisdiction in civil cases or causes of action arising out of the corporate
limits of the City; he shall have the same powers to issue attachments in civil
cases as a justice of this County has, although the cause of action may have

of his County; any warrant or other process issued by him may be executed any
place within the County of Brooke; and it shall be his duty especially to see

property therein are protected, and to this end he may cause the arrest and
detention of all riotous and disorderly persons in the City before issuing his
warrant therefor; he shall have power to issue executions for all fines,
penalties and costs imposed by him, or he may require immediate payment

West Virginia; and all the provisions of said chapter relating to moneys
received by justices shall apply to like moneys received by the Mayor; and for
such services when acting in the capacity of a justice of the peace, he shall
receive such fees as are allowed by law to justices for similar services.

discretion, to sentence such person to labor without compensation, on any of
the streets or alleys, or any of the public works or improvements, undertaken,
or to be undertaken by the City, in lieu of the fine so imposed for a period
not exceeding thirty days.
   In rendering such judgment, and giving such sentence, the Mayor shall

   It shall be unlawful for any person in said City to hold himself or herself
out as a fortuneteller, clarivoyant, mind reader, or palmist and purport and
claim to tell the future or the past by the above or any other hidden or secret
methods or science, or to practice the above calling, avocation or profession,
and the Council may pass an ordinance prohibiting the same and prescribing
penalties for its violation.  Nothing in this section contained shall be
construed so as to control any religious association or body.
   SECTION 21.  CURBING, PAVING STREETS, SIDEWALKS, ETC.; SEWERS AND  GUTTERS.
   If the owner of any real property next adjacent to any sidewalks,
crosswalks, drains and gutters within said City, shall fail or refuse to curb,
pave, recurb or repave or to keep the same clean in the manner or within the
time required by the Council, it shall be the duty of the Council to cause the
same to be done at the expense of the City and to assess the amount of such
expenses to such owner of the property abutting thereon and the same may be
collected by the City Collector and Treasurer in the same manner provided for
the collection of City taxes.  Council shall always have authority to pave or
repave, curb or recurb or otherwise permanently improve streets, alleys,
crosswalks, drains and gutters and sewers in said City at the expense of the
City.
   The City of Wellsburg having upon the ninth day of April, 1908, by a special
election, adopted, chapter 8 of the Acts of the legislature of 1908, as a
method for paving and sewering within said City, therefor, section 8-8-1, et
seq., West Virginia Code 1931, is hereby adopted and made a part of the Charter
of the City of Wellsburg, with the exception that all paving and repaving,
curbing and recurbing and sewering, which shall be done in the City, the whole
cost thereof, other than that portion which is chargeable to a street railway
company, or other railway company, shall, including the intersection of streets
and alleys, be charged to the owners of the property abutting upon any street
so improved or sewered.

other claims in his hands for collection and to read a list of such as he shall
not have been able to collect by reason of insolvency, removal or other causes;
to which list he shall make affidavit that he used due diligence to collect the
same but has been unable to do so, and if the Council shall be satisfied of the
correctness of said list and affidavit, it shall allow the City Collector and
Treasurer a credit for said claim; he shall pay any money in his hands to the
City, upon the order of council and not otherwise.
   SECTION 23.  POWERS OF CITY COUNCIL AS TO ZONING, ETC.
   For the purpose of promoting health, safety, morals, or the general welfare
of the community, Council is hereby empowered to regulate and restrict the
height, number of stories, and size of buildings and other structures, the
percentage of lot that may be occupied, the size of yards, courts, and other
open spaces, the density of population, and the location and use of buildings,
structures, and land for trade, industry, residence or other purpose.
   District.  For any or all such purposes the Council may divide the
Municipality into districts of such number, shape and area as may be deemed
best suited to carry out the purpose of this article; and within such districts
it may regulate, and restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction,
alteration, repair or use of buildings, structures, or land.  All such
regulations shall be uniform for each class or kind of buildings throughout
each district, but the regulations in one district may differ from those in
other districts.
   Purposes in view.  Such regulations shall be made in accordance with a
comprehensive plan and designed to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure
safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and the general
welfare; to provide adequate light and air; to prevent the overcrowding of
land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to facilitate the adequate
provision of transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public
requirements.  Such regulations shall be made with reasonable consideration,
among other things, to the character of the district and its peculiar
suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the value of
buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout such
Municipality.
   Method of procedure.  The Council shall provide for the manner in which such
regulations and restrictions and the boundaries of such districts shall be
determined, established, and enforced, and from time to time amended,
supplemented, or changed.  However, no such regulation, restriction, or
boundary shall become effective until after a public hearing in relation
thereto, at which parties in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to
be heard.  At least fifteen days' notice of the time and place of such hearing
shall be published, in an official paper, or a paper of general circulation, in
such Municipality.
   Changes.  Such regulations, restrictions, and boundaries, may from time to
time be amended, supplemented, changed, modified, or repealed.  In case,
however, of a protest against such change, signed by the owners of twenty
percent or more either of the area of the lots included in such proposed
change, or of those immediately adjacent in the rear thereof extending one
hundred feet therefrom or of those directly opposite thereto extending one
hundred feet from the street frontage of such opposite lots, such amendment
shall not become effective except by the favorable vote of three-fourths of all
members of the Council of such Municipality.  The provisions of the previous
section relative to public hearings and official notice shall apply equally to
all changes or amendments.
   Zoning Commission.  In order to avail itself of the zoning powers conferred
by this article, the Council shall appoint a commission, consisting of
freeholders of the Municipality, to be known as the Zoning Commission, to
recommend the boudaries of the various original districts and appropriate
regulations to be enforced therein.  Such Commission shall make a preliminary
report and hold public hearings thereon before submitting its final report and
Council shall not hold its public hearings or take action until it has received
the final report of such Commission.  Where a municipal planning commission
already exists, it may be appointed as the Zoning Commission.  The members of
the Commission shall serve without compensation.
   Board of adjustment.  The Council may provide for the appointment of a Board
of Adjustment, and in the regulations and restrictions adopted pursuant to the
authority of this article may provide that the said Board of Adjustment may, in
appropriate cases and subject to appropriate conditions and safeguards, make
special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance in harmony with its general
purpose and intent and in accordance with general or specific rules
therein contained.
   The Board of Adjustment shall consist of five members each to be appointed
for a term of three years and removable for cause by the appointing authority
upon written charges and after public hearing.  Vacancies shall be filled for
the unexpired term of any member whose term becomes vacant.
   The Board shall adopt rules in accordance with the provisions of an
ordinance adopted pursuant to this article.  Meetings of the Board shall be
held at the call of the chairman and at such other times as the Board may
determine.  Such chairman, or in his absence the acting chairman, may
administer oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses.  All meetings of the
Board shall be open to the public.  The Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent
or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately
filed in the office of the Board and shall be a public record.
   Appeals to the Board of Adjustment may be taken by any person aggrieved or
by any officer, department, board, or bureau of the Municipality affected by
any decision of the administrative officer.  Such appeal shall be taken within
a reasonable time, as provided by the rules of the Board, by filing with the
officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board of Adjustment a notice
of appeal specifying the grounds thereof.  The officer from whom the appeal is
taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the
record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed from,
unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of
Adjustment after the notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property.  In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
of Adjustment or by a court of record on application on notice to the officer
from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
   The Board of Adjustment shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the
appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time.  Upon the hearing any
party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   The Board of Adjustment shall have the following powers:
   (a)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in any
order, requirement, decision, or determination made by an administrative
official in the enforcement of this article or of any ordinance adopted
pursuant thereto;
   (b)   To hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the ordinance
upon which such Board is required to pass under such ordinance;
   (c)   To authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the
terms of the ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest; where,
owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of the
ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of the
ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.
   In exercising the above mentioned powers such Board may, in conformity with
the provisions of this article, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination appealed from, and
may make such order, requirement, decision, or determination as ought to-be
made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the
appeal is taken.
   The concurring vote of four members of the Board shall be necessary to
reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of any such
administrative official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter
upon whch it is required to pass under any such ordinance, or to effect any
variation in such ordinance.
   Any person or persons, jointly or severally, aggrieved by any decision of
the Board of Adjustment, or any taxpayer, or any officer, department, board, or
bureau of the Municipality, may present to a circuit court of the County, a
petition, duly verified setting forth that such decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, specifying the grounds of the illegality.  Such petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty days after the filing of the decision in
the office of the Board.
   Upon the presentation of such petition the court may allow a writ of
certiorari directed to the Board of Adjustment to review such decision of the
Board of Adjustment and shall prescribe therein the time within which a return
thereto must be made and served upon the realtor's attorney, which shall not be
less than ten days and may be extended by the court.  The allowance of the writ
shall not stay proceedings upon the decision appealed from, but the court may,
on application, on notice to the Board and on due cause shown, grant a
restraining order.
   The Board of Adjustment shall not be required to return the original papers
acted upon by it, but it shall be sufficient to return certified or sworn
copies thereof or of such portions thereof as may be called for by such writ. 
The return shall concisely set forth such other facts as may be pertinent and
material to show the grounds of the decision appealed from and shall be
verified.
   If upon the hearing, it shall appear to the court that testimony is
necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence or
appoint a referee to take such evidence as it may direct and report the same to
the court with his findings of fact and conclusions of law, which shall
constitute a part of the proceedings upon which the determination of the court
shall be made.  The court may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may
modify the decision brought up for review.
   Costs shall not be allowed against the Board unless it shall appear to the
court that it acted in bad faith or with malice in making the decision appealed
from.
   Remedies.  In case any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted, or maintained, or any building,
structure or land is used in violation of this article or of any ordinance or
other regulation made under authority conferred hereby, the proper local
authorities of the Municipality, in addition to other remedies, may institute
any appropriate action or proceedings to prevent such unlawful erection,
construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair, conversion, maintenance, or
use, to restrain, correct, or abate such violation, to prevent the occupancy of
such building, structure or land, or to prevent any illegal act, conduct
business, or use in or about such premises.
   Conflict with other laws.  Wherever the regulations made under authority of
this article require a greater width or size of yards, courts, or other open
spaces, or require a lower height of building or less number of stories, or
require a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or impose other
higher standards than are required in any other statute or local ordinance or
regulation, the provisions of the regulations made under autority of this
article shall govern.  Wherever the provisions of any other statute or local
ordinance or regulation require a greater width or size of yards, courts, or
other open spaces, or require a lower height of building or a less number of
stories, or require a greater percentage of lot to be left unoccupied, or
impose other higher standards than are required by the regulations made under
authority of this article, the provisions of such statute or local ordinance or
regulation shall govern.
   Municipal Planning Commission - Appointment.  The Council is hereby
authorized to appoint a Municipal Planning Commission.
   Same - Compensation.  The Municipal Planning Commission shall consist of not
less than five citizens, all of whom shall be taxpayers and residents, who
shall be nominated by the Mayor and confirmed by the Council of the town.  The
members of the Commission first appointed shall serve respectively for terms of
one year, two years and three years, divided equally or as nearly equally as
possible between these terms.  Thereafter members shall be appointed for terms
of three years each.  Vacancies shall be filled by appointment for the unex-
pired term only.  Members of the Commission shall serve without compensation.
   Same - Duties.  The duties of the Commision shall be to prepare plans for
the development of the whole or any portion of the Municipality and of any land
outside of the Municipality which, in the opinion of the Commission, bears
relation to the planning of the Municipality; provided, however, that the power
of the Municipal Planning Commission shall not extend beyond the territorial
limits of the Municipality except so far as is reasonably necessary to protect
the community, both within and without the corporate limits, against the
inadequate streets, highways, and sewers and inadequately planned and zoned
territory, provided, further, that when two or more municipal corporations in
close proximity might otherwise have conflicting jurisdiction under this
section, the first municipal corporation to exercise such extraterritorial
jurisdiction shall thereby acquire exclusive jurisdiction over such territory.
   Such plans shall show recommendations for new streets, bridges, parks,
parkways, playgrounds and any other public areas or public improvements. 
Whenever the Commission shall have agreed upon a plan for the development of
the Municipality or any portion thereof, such plan or plans shall be submitted
to the Mayor and Council for their consideration and action.
   Before the final action shall be taken by any municipality or department
thereof on the location and design of any public building, public memorial,
street, park, parkway, playground or other public area, such question shall be
submitted to the Municipal Planning Commission for investigation and report.
   Plans of land and streets to be submitted to Commission and approved by
Mayor and Council.  All plans, plats, or replats of land laid out in building
lots, and the streets intended to be dedicated to public use, shall be
submitted to the Municipal Planning Commission for their consideration and no
such plat or replat shall be filed in the office of the clerk of the county
court, as provided by law in other cases, until such plat or replat shall have
endorsed upon it the fact that it has first been submitted to the Municipal
Planning Commission, and by the Municipal Planning Commission to the Mayor and
Council and by the Mayor and Council duly approved.
   Commission may employ help; expenses.  The Municipal Planning Commission
shall have the power and authority to employ engineers and clerks, and/or any
other help necessary, and to meet such expenses the Municipal Planning
Commission shall submit to the Mayor and Council its budget for each fiscal

thereupon consider such budget and make such allowances to the Municipal
Planning Commission as it shall deem proper.
   SECTION 24.  CHIEF OF POLICE.
   The Chief of Police, shall, subject to the directions of the City Manager,
have charge of and be responsible for the police force of the City and see that
all subordinate police officers faithfully perform their official duties; he

majority of all the councilmen elected concurring by yeas and nays, appoint all
the subordinate police officers, he shall be ex officio a constable within the

thereof to the Council and pay said fines and costs and all City moneys that

shall have in all respects the same power to enforce the collection of fines
and costs as the sheriff of Brooke County now has, or may hereafter have, to
enforce the collection and payment of fines and costs; he shall have all the
powers, rights and privileges within the corporate limits of the City and
anywhere within Brooke County in regard to the arrest of persons, the
collection of claims and the execution and return of process, that can be
legally exercised by a constable of a district in which the said City is
situated, and he and his sureties shall be liable to all fines, penalties and
forfeitures that a constable of a district is liable to, for any failure or
dereliction in his office, to be recovered in the same manner  and in the same
courts that the fines, penalties and forfeitures may be recovered against such
constable.  All subordinate police officers shall have all the powers, rights
and privileges of a constable of the district within the corporate limits of
the City, in regard to the arrest of persons and the execution and return of
all criminal writs and process issued by the Mayor, but the Council may exempt
them from giving the bond required by constables.
   The Chief of Police shall before entering upon the duties of his office,
execute a bond for the faithful performance by him of the duties of his office,
and for the accounting for any paying over as required by law, all the money
which may come into his hands by virtue of his office, with sureties
satisfactory to the Council in a penalty of two thousand dollars, and shall for
his compensation receive a salary of not less than six hundred dollars nor more
than one thousand dollars per month during his tenure of office, the same to be
affixed by the Council.  (Acts 1931, ch. 82; 12-14-54; 2-18-75; 6-19-81)
   SECTION 25.  CONDEMNATION.
   Said City shall have the right to condemn real estate therein for streets,

from time to time prescribe.
   SECTION 27.  CONDUCT OF ELECTIONS.
   Council shall appoint three commissioners and two clerks in each ward,

Said commissioners shall make return of the elections so held by them, to the
Council of said City, as soon as practicable after such elections are held; and
Council shall thereupon ascertain and publish the result of such election and
enter said result upon the journal thereof.  The City Clerk shall provide the
necessary poll books and ballot boxes for such elections, at the expense of the
City, and the provisions of section 3-1-1 et seq., of the Code of West
Virginia, insofar as they are applicable thereto, and not inconsistent with the
provisions of this Act, shall apply to and govern such elections.
   SECTION 28.  PAYMENT OF SALARIES.

the same is acted upon.
   SECTION 30.  ORDINANCES AS EVIDENCE.
   All ordinances of said City and all entries in the journal of the Council
thereof which shall be printed or published by authority of the Council, or

as prima facie correct.
   SECTION 31.  MAINTENANCE OF ROADS OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS.
   The City shall construct, keep in repair and maintain its own roads, streets
and alleys and by reason thereof shall not be required to pay any district or
county road levies for the construction or maintenance of roads outside of the
City limits, except levies to pay the bonded indebtness of the County of
Brooke, now outstanding.
   SECTION 32.  SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION.
   In addition to the method of securing the laying of sidewalks set out in
section 20 of this Charter, the Council of said City may cause any sidewalk to
be constructed, laid, relaid or otherwise permanently improved in the City of
Wellsburg, in the following manner and upon the following terms:  Notice shall
first be given the abutting property owners by publication for two successive
weeks in one newspaper published in said City by giving location of property in
front of which sidewalks shall be laid, but no error in said publication shall
in any way affect the validity of the certificate hereinafter provided for, or
any of them.  The contract for same shall, after due advertisement in which
Council shall reserve the right to reject any and all bids, be let to the
lowest responsible bidder and upon completion and acceptance of the work,
Council shall order the Mayor and City Clerk to issue to the contractor doing
the work a certificate for the amount of the assessment to be paid by the owner
of any lot or fractional part thereof fronting on such sidewalk, and the amount
specified in said assessment certificate shall be a lien in the hands of the
holder thereof upon the lot or part of a lot fronting on such sidewalk and such
certificate shall draw interest from the date of said assessment, and the
payment may be enforced in the name of the holder of such certificate by a
proper suit in equity in any court having proper jurisdiction to enforce such
liens and Council shall fix the amount of such assessment and do all things in
connection therewith necessary as is provided for paving or improving streets
and alleys and such certificates shall be issued one for each abutting lot or
portion thereof payable six months from the date of the completion and
acceptance of the work and shall be a lien in the hands of the holder thereof
upon the particular lot against which they are assessed in the same way and
manner and of the same effect that assessments for street paving liens under
the other provisions of this Act created; provided, however, that Council shall
not receive any bids or let any sidewalk contract between the first day of
October and the first day of March of any year.  Nothing in this section shall
be so construed as to prevent any abutting lot owners from having his own
sidewalk put in if done before the advertising hereinbefore mentioned and
provided same is done according to the lines, grades and specifications of the
City Engineer, for which no charge shall be made.  The total cost of
constructing, laying, relaying or otherwise permanently improving any sidewalk
or walks shall be borne by the owners of the land abutting upon said sidewalk;
corner lots shall be assessed for the amount in front or alongside of said lot
and extended to the curb line.
   SECTION 33.  PUBLICATION OF ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; CONTENTS OF ANNUAL
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ETC.
   The municipal corporation shall cause to be published in two newspapers of
opposite politics, if there be such published therein, at a compensation not to
exceed the rate provided by law for like publications, for one issue, or, if no
such newspaper be published therein, to publish in pamphlet form not less than
one hundred copies of a sworn statement of the financial condition of such
corporation.  Such statement shall contain a summary account of the receipts
and expenditures of the City or Municipality showing the source from which all
money was derived, and the purpose for which expended, and also a specific
statement of the debts of such municipal corporation, showing the purpose for
which any debt was contracted, the time it becomes due, the rate of interest,
up to what time the interest thereon has been paid, the amount of money in the
Treasury at the end of the preceding administration and the debts contracted by
it.  Such statement shall be prepared by the municipal corporation every twelve
months and shall then be printed according to the provisions of this section. 
Either method of the report shall be sworn to by the recorder, by the Mayor and
two members of the City Council.  One copy of such printed report shall be
delivered to the judge of the judicial district, one to the clerk of the county
court, one to the clerk of the circuit court, one shall be kept as a part of
the records of the City or municipal corporation, and the remainder shall be
held for distribution as called for by the taxpayers.  If a City Council fail
or refuse to perform the duties hereinbefore named, every member of such
Council and the recorder thereof concurring in such failure or refusal shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall be fined not less
than ten nor more than one hundred dollars.  If any of the provisions of this
section are violated, it shall be the duty of the prosecuting attorney of the
county in which such violations are made to immediately present the evidence
thereof to the grand jury if in session, and if not in session, he shall cause
such violation to be investigated by the next succeeding grand jury.
   SECTION 34.  CITY TAX BILLS.
   It shall be the duty of the City Collector and Treasurer to prepare the tax
bills which shall be based upon the County assessor's valuation of real and
personal property within the City; it shall be the duty of the police officers
to make a list of all dogs in the Municipality and the names of the owners
thereof which list shall be returned to the Council.
   It shall be the duty of the City Collector and Treasurer to collect all
taxes, special assessments and other moneys other than fines due the
Municipality and he is hereby vested with the same rights to distrain for the
same as is vested in the sheriff for the collection of taxes.  He shall give
bond conditioned according to law in such penalty and with such security as the
Council may require and in a sum not less than ten thousand dollars.
   SECTION 35.  COLLECTION OF TAXES.
   The City Collector and Treasurer shall begin the collection of taxes upon
the first day of October of each year; when the taxes of any one person or
corporation amount to a sum greater than ten dollars they may be collected, the
one-half during the month of October and the remaining one-half during the
month of April of the following year; all unpaid taxes shall bear interest at
the same rate as State and County taxes, thirty days after the same are due.
   SECTION 36.  TAXES AS A LIEN; UNCOLLECTIBLE TAXES.
   There shall be a lien on all real estate within the Municipality for the
taxes assessed thereon for municipal purposes.  The lien for municipal taxes
shall attach and the taxes shall become due at the same time, be subject to the
same discount, and bear interest the same rate and from thirty days after due,
the same as State and County taxes; and such lien may be enforced by the
Council in the same manner provided by law for the enforcement of the lien for
State and County taxes, or in such other manner as the Council may by ordinance
prescribe.  If any real estate within such Municipality be returned delinquent
for the nonpayment of the taxes thereon, copies of such delinquent list may be
certified by the Council to the auditor, and such real estate may be sold for
the taxes, interest and costs of publication thereon, in the same manner, at
the same time and by the same officer as real estate is sold for the nonpayment
of State and County taxes; provided, that any such delinquent real estate list
of any municipality that may be certified to the Auditor as herein provided
shall be so certified to them before the first day of September in the year
next succeeding that for which such taxes were assessed; provided further, that
in all cases where a delinquent list of real estate is certified to the Auditor
as aforesaid, the Council shall at the same time certify a like list to the
clerk of the county court of the county wherein such real estate is situated
and returned delinquent by such Council; and it shall be the duty of such clerk
forthwith to record the list so certified to him in the record of delinquent
real estate kept in his office, and in which is recorded the delinquent list of
real estate returned by the sheriff of his county.  The Council shall pay to
such clerk for recording such list a reasonable compensation therefor, not to
exceed one cent for each parcel of real estate so certified to him and twenty-
five cents for recording the certificate of such list.
   The City Collector and Treasurer, after ascertaining which of the taxes in
the City cannot be collected, shall, on or before the first Monday in June next
succeeding the year for which such taxes are assessed, make out an alphabetical
list of the taxes on personal property and real property which have not been
paid and the Collector and Treasurer returning such list shall at the foot
thereof subscribe the following oath:  "I, A. B., City Collector and Treasurer
of the City of Wellsburg, do swear that the foregoing list is, I verily
believe, correct and just; that I have received no part of the taxes for which
the persons and property therein mentioned are returned delinquent; and that I
have used due diligence to find property within the City liable to distress for
such taxes, but have found none."
   A copy of every such list shall be posted on the front door of the City Hall
at least two weeks before the session of the Council at which they are
presented for examination.
   SECTION 37.  POWER OF COUNCIL TO PASS ORDERS, ETC., ORDINANCES, ETC.;
ENFORCEMENT AND CONSTRUCTION OF ORDINANCES.
   To carry into effect the powers conferred upon such Town or its Council, by
this chapter or by any future Act of the legislature of the State, the Council
shall have power to make and pass all needful orders, bylaws, ordinances,
resolutions, rules and regulations, not contrary to the Constitution and laws
of this State; and for a violation thereof, to prescribe reasonable fines,
penalties and imprisonment in the County jail or the place of imprisonment in
such corporation, if there be one, for a term not exceeding thirty days.  Such
fines, penalties and imprisonments shall be recovered, imposed or enforced
under the judgment of the Mayor of such town or the person lawfully exercising
his functions.
   The fact that a municipal ordinance vests in the Council or some other body
or officer a discretion to do, or refuse to do, a given thing, shall not
invalidate such ordinance when it would be impractical to lay down by ordinance
for all cases a uniform guide for exercising such discretion.  This section
shall not be construed to mean that a delegation of discretion in any other
case shall necessarily invalidate an ordinance.  But, if any case, a delegated
discretion is exercised in an arbitrary or discriminatory manner, such
ordinance, as so applied, shall be unlawful and void.
   SECTION 38.  PUBLIC UTILITIES.
   The Council shall have the authority to authorize, per West Virginia State
Code and Ordinance, either a Combined Water and Sanitary Board or a separate
Water Board and separate Sewer Board.  (Amended 12-10-96.)
   SECTION 39.  TAX LEVY FOR 1931.
   The tax levy which was laid in August of the year 1930, having been laid to

traffic control device applicable thereto placed in accordance with the
provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible

(WVaC 17C-3-4a)
313.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn.  But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04  PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk.  Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway
in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait.  No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05  FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal).  When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal).  When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of  vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06  UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising.  This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07  ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter,
deface, injure, knock down or remove any official traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
other part thereof.  (WVaC 17C-3-9)

and other traffic control devices, as adopted in West Virginia Code 17C-3-1,

to the speed limit and any other traffic restrictions.
   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this

ten-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and
      (3)   Any period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West

violation occurred within the ten-year period immediately preceding the date of
arrest in the current proceeding.

a second or subsequent offense under this section if the person has been
previously arrested for or charged with a violation of this section which is
alleged to have occurred within the applicable time period for prior offenses,
notwithstanding the fact that there has not been a final adjudication of the
charges for the alleged previous offense.  In that case, the warrant or
indictment or information must set forth the date, location and particulars of
the previous offense or offenses.  No person may be convicted of a second or
subsequent offense under this section unless the conviction for the previous
offense has become final, or the person has previously had a period of
conditional probation imposed pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b).
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d) or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance or a drug does not constitute a defense
against any charge of violating subsection  (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of

meaning ascribed to it in West Virginia Code Chapter 60A.

of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation: 
provided, that the court may apply the provisions  of West Virginia Code 62-11A
to a person sentenced or committed to a term of one year or less for a first
offense under this section:  provided however, that the court may impose a term
of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(b) to persons
adjudicated thereunder.  An order for home detention by the court pursuant to
the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B may be used as an alternative
sentence to any period of incarceration required by this section for a first or

333.011 PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (g) hereof, whenever any person who
has not previously been convicted of any offense under Section
333.01 or any statute of the United States or of any state relating to driving
under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance or any other drug:
      (1)   Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)   Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under subsection (c) of Section
333.01, the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of
the accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding any
provisions of this code to the contrary, place him or her on probation, which
conditions shall include, that he or she successfully completes the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-
3a.  Participation therein shall be for a period of at least 165 days after he
or she has served the fifteen days of license suspension imposed pursuant to
West Virginia Code 17C-5A-2.
   (b)   A defendant’s election to participate in deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in West Virginia Code 17C- 5A-2.
   
   (c)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (d) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)
(1) hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test
and Lock Program, or if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable
time after the alleged violation was committed.   
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard.  If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Test and Lock
Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statue of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable Federal or State constitutional provision, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (d)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges.  This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program.  A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objection on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney.  If there are no
objections filed within the thirty day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant.  If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (c) hereof.
   (e)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1, et seq.  Except as
provided in subsection (j), (k) and (l) of Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial.  No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing or otherwise giving false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as that term is defined in subsection
(l) of Section
333.01.
   (f)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.

section:
      (1)   In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision of

333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5 has been charged;
      (2)   If the person holds a commercial driver’s license or operates
commercial motor vehicle(s);
      (3)   The person has previously had his or her driver’s license revoked
under West Virginia Code 17C-5-2(a) or under any statute of the United States
or of any state relating to driving under the influence of alcohol, any
controlled substance or any other drug; or
      (4)   If the person refused the secondary chemical test pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-7.
   (h)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, trial
and conviction, pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the
Division of Motor Vehicles; provided, that any person who has previously been
convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard.  If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

prosecuted for a violation of subsection (c) of Section
333.01, whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be liable for any court cost assessable against a person convicted of

345.35  OPERATION OF VEHICLES WITH SAFETY BELTS.
   (a)   A person shall not operate a passenger vehicle on a public street or
highway unless the person, any passenger in the back seat under eighteen years
of age, and any passenger in the front seat of such passenger vehicle is
restrained by a safety belt meeting applicable federal motor vehicle safety
standards.  For the purposes of this section, "passenger vehicle" means a motor
vehicle which is designed for transporting ten passengers or less, including
the driver, except that such term does not include a motorcycle, a trailer or
any motor vehicle which is not required on the date of the enactment of this
section under a federal motor vehicle safety standard to be equipped with a
belt system.  The provisions of this section shall apply to all passenger
vehicles manufactured after the first day of January, 1967, and being 1968
models and newer.
   (b)   The required use of safety belts as provided herein does not apply to
a duly appointed or contracted rural mail carrier of the United States Postal
Service who is actually making mail deliveries or to a passenger or operator
with a physically disabling condition whose physical disability would prevent
appropriate restraint in such safety belt if the condition is duly certified by
a physician who shall state the nature of the disability as well as the reason
such restraint is inappropriate.
   (c)   A violation of this section is not admissible as evidence of
negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages:  provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct
an in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party's failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of.  Upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine (1) that the injured party failed to wear
a safety belt, and (2) that the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a
failure to mitigate damages.  The trier of fact may reduce the injured party's
recovery for medical damages by an amount not to exceed five percent (5%)
thereof.  In the event the plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of five
percent (5%) of medical damages, the court shall make the calculations and the
issue of mitigation of damages for failure to wear a safety belt shall not be
presented to the jury.  In all cases, the actual computation of the dollar
amount reduction shall be determined by the court.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, no
points may be entered on any driver's record maintained by the Division of
Motor Vehicles as a result of a violation of this section.
   (e)   Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to abrogate or
alter the provisions of Section
345.31 relating to the mandatory use of child passenger safety devices.

vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle.  The photographs must show the
vehicle in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. 
Within the discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers
may issue citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the
illegally parked vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement
agency, who may issue a citation, which includes the photographs and the form,
to the owner of the illegally parked vehicle.  Volunteers shall be trained on
the requirements for citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or
designated accessible parking areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.

ensuring responsible handling.
   When used in this section, the following words, terms and phrases and their
derivations shall have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except

to chase or approach in either a menacing fashion or an apparent attitude of
attack, or has attempted to bite or otherwise endanger any person, whether or
not the dog is on or off the premises of its owner, keeper or harborer. 
“Dangerous Dog” means any dog that, because of its aggressive nature, training
or characteristic behavior, presents a risk of serious physical harm or death
to human beings or domestic animals, or would constitute a danger to human
life, physical well-being or property or other domestic animals if not kept

utilized by law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties and
does not include a police dog that has chased or approached in either a
menacing fashion or an apparent attitude of attack, or has attempted to bite or
otherwise endanger, any person while the police dog is being used to assist one
or more law enforcement officers in the performance of their official duties.

obedient to that person’s commands.
   (b)   A dangerous dog which is found to be not under the immediate control
of its owner, keeper, harborer or some other responsible person, or is
unsecured and not physically restrained and confined in a locked pen which has
a top, locked fenced yard or other locked enclosure which has a top shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and fined up to two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00) for
a first offense and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for any additional offenses
pursuant to this section and also subject to any additional penalties as may be
applicable.
   (c)   Nothing in this provision shall preclude the impoundment of any
dangerous dog if such is found to be necessary by the Chief of Police, any law
enforcement officer or County Animal Control Officer who may file a complaint
or issue a citation for violations of this section to be prosecuted in the
Municipal Court if the dog is impounded the court may recommend release of the
dog to its owners after the owner, keeper or harborer has paid all fees
incurred for the impoundment.  In no instance shall the City of Wellsburg be
responsible for any fees associated with the impoundment of a dangerous dog
pursuant to the duties and responsibilities of law enforcement in carrying out
the intent of this section.
   (d)   The provisions and penalties contained in this section are in addition
to and not dependent upon other sections and articles of this Code.  Nothing
contained in this section shall substitute for any other state or local
requirements incumbent upon owners of vicious or dangerous dogs.  Likewise,

shall constitute a defense to any action for personal injury, wrongful death or
damage to property.  (Passed 6-13-05.)

525.01  CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section.  A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit.  The court may cause
a citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that
they appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the
issuance of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered
for the penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the
principal and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. 
The money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to
the treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the
offender was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.  (WVaC 61-8D-10)
525.02  CRUELTY TO CHILDREN.
   No person shall cruelly ill treat, abuse or inflict unnecessary cruel
punishment upon, any infant or minor child, and no person, having the care,
custody or control of any minor child, shall willfully abandon or neglect the
minor child.
   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.  (WVaC 61-8-
24)
525.03  PARENTAL LIABILITY FOR ACTS OF CHILDREN.
   The custodial parent or parents of any minor child shall be personally

2 for damages which are the proximate result of any one or a combination of the
following acts of the minor child:
   (a)   The malicious and willful injury to the person of another; or
   (b)   The malicious and willful injury or damage to the property of another,
whether the property be real, personal, or mixed; or
   (c)   The malicious and willful setting fire to a forest or wooded area
belonging to another; or
   (d)   The willful taking, stealing and carrying away of the property of
another, with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of possession.
   For purposes of this section, "custodial parent or parents" means the parent
or parents with whom the minor child is living, or a divorced or separated
parent who does not have legal custody but who is exercising supervisory
control over the minor child at the time of the minor child's act.
   Persons entitled to recover damages under this section shall include, but
are not limited to, the State, any municipal corporation, county commission and

or organization of any kind or character.  The action may be brought in
magistrate or another court of competent jurisdiction.  Recovery hereunder
shall be limited to the actual damages, based upon direct out-of-pocket loss,
taxable court costs, and interest from date of judgment.  The right of action
and remedy granted herein shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any
rights of action and remedies therefor against a parent or parents for the
tortious acts of his or their children heretofore existing under the provisions
of any law, statutory or otherwise, or now so existing independently of the

to be used as a weapon, consisting of a sharp-edged or sharp-pointed blade,

cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds.  "Knife" includes, but is not limited to,
any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and one-half
inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any other

or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement shall not be

knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury or
death.

City Collector and Treasurer may require.  If the applicant desires to operate
more than one such store, he shall make a separate application for each store.

Treasurer that he has ceased operation of the store, or that he proposes to
cease operation of the store prior to July 1 of the year next ensuing.  All
applications for renewal shall be made on the forms and in the manner
prescribed by the City Collector and Treasurer.  Each application for renewal
shall be accompanied by a filing fee of fifty cents ($ .50) for each license

admissible and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the tax due under the

FLAT RATE CHARGE (Customers with non-metered water supply)
                     
   Each customer shall pay a minimum charge of $43.86 per month

DELAYED PAYMENT PENALTY
The above schedule is net.  On all current usage billings not paid in full when
due, ten percent (10%) will be added to the net current amount unpaid.  This
delayed payment penalty is not interest and is only to be collected once for
each bill where it is appropriate.
LEAK ADJUSTMENT INCREMENT PRODUCED
An amount not to exceed $3.00 per 1,000 gallons to be used when the bill
reflects unusual consumption which can be attributed to eligible leakage on
customer’s side of the meter.  This rate is used to calculate consumption above
the customer’s historical average usage.  The City shall establish a non-
discriminatory policy regarding this provision for leak adjustments.
RESALE RATE
   The rate to be used when selling water to another water utility for resale:
   $5.25 per 1,000 gallons
BULK WATER SALES - $4.85 per 1,000 gallons.
SERVICE CONNECTION CHARGE
The following charges are to be made whenever the utility installs a new tap to
serve an applicant.
A tap fee of $100.00 will be charged to customers applying for service before
construction is completed adjacent to the customer’s premises in connection
with a Certificate proceeding before the Commission.  This pre-construction tap
fee will be invalid after the completion of construction adjacent to the
applicant’s premises that is associated with a Certificate proceeding.
A tap fee of $350.00, or the actual cost of the connection (solely determined
by the City), whichever is greater, shall be made for each new connection to
the water system.
WATER DISCONNECT/RECONNECT FEES/ADMINISTRATIVE FEES
Water service will not be restored until all past due water bills have been
paid in full and all accrued penalties plus a disconnection charge of $25.00
have been paid.
There shall be a $25.00 reconnection charge paid prior to restoration of water
service which had been previously disconnected for any reason.
SECURITY DEPOSIT
The municipality or governing body, but only one of them, may collect from all
new applicants for service a deposit of $50.00 or two twelfths of the average
annual usage of the applicant’s specific customer class, whichever is greater,
to secure the payment of water service rates, fees and charges in the event
they become delinquent as provided in this section.  In any case where a
deposit is forfeited to pay service rates, fees and charges which were
delinquent and the user’s service is disconnected or terminated, no
reconnection or reinstatement of service may be made by the municipality or
governing body until another deposit equal to $50.00 or a sum equal to two
twelfths of the average usage for the applicant’s specific customer class,
whichever is greater, is remitted to the municipality or governing body.  After
twelve months of prompt payment history, the municipality or governing body
shall return the deposit to the customer or credit the customer’s account with
interest at a rate as the Public Service Commission may prescribe:  Provided,
that where the customer is a tenant, the municipality or governing body is not
required to return the deposit until the time the tenant discontinues service
with the municipality or governing body.  Whenever any rates, fees, rentals or
charges for services or facilities furnished remain unpaid for a period of
twenty days after the same  become due and payable, the user of the services
and facilities provided is delinquent and the user is liable at law until all
rates, fees and charges are fully paid.  The municipality or governing body
may, under reasonable rules promulgated by the Police Service Commission, shut
off and discontinue water services to a delinquent user of water facilities ten
days after the water services become delinquent regardless of whether the
municipality or governing body utilizes the security deposit to satisfy any
delinquent payments: provided further, that nothing contained within the rules
of the Police Service Commission shall be deemed to require any agents or
employees of the municipality or governing body to accept payment at the
customer’s premises in lieu of discontinuing service for a delinquent bill.
As of the date of passage, the applicable provision of the PSC Water Rules,
Rule 4.2.a.1:
For a municipal water system only, the deposit shall not be more than either
fifty dollars ($50.00) or two-twelfths of the average annual usage of the
applicant’s specific customer class, whichever is greater.
This tariff, in accordance with the above cited statutory language and PSC
Water Rules, produces a Security Deposit of $65.00 (based on 4,000 gpm x 2
months) for residential customers.  All other classes of customers will have
their required deposit calculated in accordance with the above language in
regards to average usage.
SCHEDULE II

APPLICABILITY

less than the pre-construction peak runoff of flow rate for 2-year/24-hour, 10-
year/24-hour and 25-year/24-hour storms. In redevelopment projects, a peak
runoff reduction of 10% from the preexisting peak runoff rate of flow must be
achieved.  However, no reduction shall be required beyond the peak runoff rate
of flow that would occur from the parcel in its natural, undeveloped state.
      (3)    Design backup:
         A.   Calculations of volumetric runoff and peak runoff rate of flow
for both pre-development and post-development;

   (i)   All development and/or redevelopment projects shall minimize the
impact to the water environment by applying structural and/or non-structural
management practices selected to address site-specific conditions. The minimum
requirement for runoff water quality treatment shall be a reduction of 80% of
the average post-development total suspended solids and a reduction of 40% of
the average post-development phosphorus load.
   (j)    No construction shall be performed in a manner that will negatively
impact the water environment in the vicinity of construction or in other areas,
regardless of whether this impact is manifested by flow restrictions, increased
runoff, diminishing channel or flood plain storage capacity, harm to aquatic
life or any other manifestation of negative impact.
   (k)    New construction or reconstruction shall be permitted only after
temporary or permanent erosion and sediment control management practices have
been placed and are operational to the satisfaction of the Utility. The Utility
may halt construction, void a permit, or take other enforcement actions
consistent with this article upon a finding of inadequate erosion and sediment
control management practices upon a site or property subject to the provisions
of this article.
   (l)    All active construction sites shall be inspected by the owner no less
than weekly and within 24 hours after a 0.25 inch rain event to ensure and
verify effective erosion and sediment control. The owner shall maintain records
of these inspections. The Utility may halt construction on properties that do
not provide satisfactory proof of compliance with this requirement.
   (m)    The owner of a completed new development and/or redevelopment
construction shall submit to the Utility within 30 days of substantial project
completion and nas-built" plans of the stormwater management facilities located
upon the property/site.
   (n)    Waivers for providing stormwater management.
      (1)    Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as
required by this article unless a waiver of these requirements is granted by
the Utility. A written request for waiver must be submitted to the Utility in a
prescribed form.
      (2)    The Utility may not waive the minimum requirements for stormwater
management of water quality protection.
      (3)   On-site storm water management requirements may be waived by the
Utility if the Utility finds that meeting the minimum on-site stormwater
management requirements is not feasible due to tbe unique natural or existing
physical characteristics of a site, or that the property owner would suffer an
undue hardship if required to meet the full requirements of this regulation. 
To be eligible for a waiver, the applicant must also demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Utility that the waiver will not result in any of the
following impacts to downstream waterways:
         A.   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures:
      B.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         C.   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion; or
         D.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life and/or
property.
      (4)    Where compliance with the full requirements for on-site stormwater
management is waived, the applicant shall satisfy storm water management
requirements by accomplishing a mitigation measure approved by the Utility.
Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   Alternative means for on-site management of stormwater discharges
that have been established in a storm water management plan that has been
approved by the Utility.
         B.   The creation of appropriately designed and constructed stormwater
management facility or drainage improvements on other properties, public or
private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities. This alternative
facility must provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater
than that which would be afforded by the waived on-site practices and there
must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long-term operation and
maintenance of the off-site practice. The Utility shall, to the maximum extent
practical, ensure that the benefits arising from the off-site practice shall be
realized in the same basin/watershed as the waived management practice.
         C.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the City of
Wellsburg or the grant of an easement to the City of Wells burg, to be
dedicated to preservation reforestation and/or the creation of green space,
wetlands, or permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic
habitat.
      Any mitigation measure shall provide a level of environmental protection
and/or improvement that is, in the sole discretion of the Utility,
approximately equal to or greater than that which would have been provided by
the waived practice.
   (o)   Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. Where the Utility
waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, and the
applicant does not complete an approved mitigation project, the applicant shall
be required to pay a fee in lieu of stormwater management practices, in an
amount as determined by the Utility. This amount shall be approximately equal
to the cost of stormwater management and based on the cubic feet of storage
required for stormwater management of the development in question. All of the
monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate stormwater capital
improvements program project, and shall be made by the applicant prior to the
issuance of any stormwater permit for the development.

   The purpose of this Article is as follows.
   (a)    To protect the public water system served by the City through the
Combined Waterworks and Sewage System Board from the possibility of
contamination or pollution by isolating within its customer's internal
distribution water systems, such contaminants or pollutants that could backflow
due to back-pressure or back-siphonage into the public water system.
   (b)    To promote the elimination and/or control of cross-connections and
backflow conditions, actual or potential, within a customer's internal
distribution water systems, nonpotable systems, plumbing fixtures and
processes; and
   (c)    To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection and  backflow prevention control which will effectively prevent the
contamination or pollution of the public and/or customer's water systems from
cross-connections and backflow conditions.  (Ord. 2009-12-1.  Passed 2-9-10.)

private sector personnel to assist him/her in the survey of their facility or
facilities and to assist him/her in the selection of proper containment
assemblies and/or fixture isolation devices, and the proper installation of
these assemblies or devices.  (Ord. 2009-12-1.  Passed 2-9-10.)
1103.06  RESPONSIBILITIES OF WATER PURVEYOR AND OWNER.
   (a)   The Water Purveyor shall perform the following functions:
      (1)    On new installations, the Water Purveyor will provide an on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer assembly or assemblies, if any, that will be required based
on actual or potential cross-connections and the degree of health hazards.
      (2)    For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the
Water Purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or
premises for actual and potential cross-connections and backflow conditions and
inform the Owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the
method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to
be made. The Owner will be allowed to ninety (90) days to make the correction
unless the Water Purveyor determines that a shorter period is necessary based
upon the degree of hazard and the history of the devices and assemblies already
in place.
      (3)    The Water Purveyor will not allow any actual or potential cross-
connection to remain unless it is protected by an approved air gap or backflow
preventer assembly or assemblies, which must be regularly tested or inspected
to insure satisfactory operation.
      (4)    The Water Purveyor shall inform the Owner by letter of any failure
to comply prior to a re-inspection. The Water Purveyor will allow an additional
fifteen (15) days for the correction or corrections. In the event the Owner
fails to comply by the time of a second re-inspection, the Water Purveyor will
inform the Owner by letter, that the water service to the Owner's premises will
be terminated within a period not to exceed five (5) days. In the event that
the Owner informs the Water Purveyor of extenuating circumstances as to why the
correction or corrections have not been made, a time extension may be granted
by the Water Purveyor, but in no case will exceed an additional thirty (30)
days.
      (5)    If the Water Purveyor determines at any time that a serious threat
to the public health exists, water service will be terminated immediately.
      (6)    The Water Purveyor will conduct initial and follow-up premise
inspections to determine the nature of existing or potential hazards. The main
focus will be on high hazard industries and commercial premises.
      (7)   The Water Purveyor must report any backflow incident occurring in
the public water system as soon as possible but no later than twenty-four hours
(24) after the incident to the WVBPH.
   (b)    The Owner shall have the following responsibilities:
      (1)    The Owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection
of all actual or potential cross-connections and/or backflow conditions on his/
her premises.
      (2)    The Owner, after having been informed by a letter from the Water
Purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested,
any and all backflow preventer assemblies on his premises.
      (3)    The owner shall correct within thirty (30) days any malfunction of
an air gap or backflow preventer assembly or assemblies which is revealed by
periodic inspection or testing.  This may also involve the removal and/or
replacement of the backflow preventer assemblies.
      (4)    The Owner shall inform the Water Purveyor of any proposed or
modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the
Owner is aware, but which have not been found by the Water Purveyor.
      (5)    The Owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow
preventer assembly unless there is a backflow preventer assembly of the same
type on the bypass. The Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of
the assembly or assemblies must supply additional assemblies to allow testing
to take place.
      (6)    The Owner shall install only backflow preventer assemblies
approved by the Water Purveyor or the WVBPH.
      (7)    The Owner shall install backflow preventer assemblies in a manner
approved by the Water Purveyor and general industry standards.
      (8)    Any Owner having a private well or other auxiliary water source
must have the approval of the Water Purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Water Purveyor's system. Permission to cross-
connect may be denied. The Owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer assembly at the service entrance if a private water source is
maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the Water Purveyor's system.
      (9)    In the event the Owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Water Purveyor's side of a backflow
preventer assembly, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer assembly
installed.
      (10)    The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
service, permits, periodic assembly testing, retesting in the case that a
backflow  preventer assembly fails to operate correctly and follow-up re-
inspections for non-compliance with Water Purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
      (11)    The Owner must maintain for a minimum of three years records of
installation and removal, all testing, repair and maintenance for all
assemblies or devices in the Owner's water distribution systems
      (12)   The owner will report any backflow incidents occurring in their
facilities buildings as soon as possible but not later than twenty-four hours
after the incident to the Water Purveyor and to the WVBPH.  The Owner must
maintain for a minimum of three years all records and reports of all backflow
incidents occurring in their facilities or buildings.  These records and
reports are to be made available to the Water Purveyor and/or WVBPH upon
request.  (Ord. 2009-12-1.  Passed 2-9-10.)
1103.07  DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the public water system arising
from cross-connections and backflow conditions.  All threats will be classified
by degree of hazard which will determine the requirements for the installation
of approved backflow preventer assemblies.
(Ord. 2009-12-1.  Passed 2-9-10.)
1103.08  EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing backflow preventer assembly shall be allowed by the Water
Purveyor to continue in service unless the degree of hazard is such as to
supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer assembly, or
there is an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard
has increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a
business establishment, any existing backflow preventer assemblies must be
upgraded to a reduced pressure principle assembly, or a reduced pressure
principle assembly must be installed in the event that no backflow preventer
assembly is present.  (Ord. 2009-12-1.  Passed 2-9-10.)
1103.09  PERIODIC TESTING.
   (a)    Backflow preventer assemblies shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
   (b)    Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester. This
testing will be done at the Owner's expense.
   (c)    Any backflow preventer assembly which fails during a periodic test
will be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of
the repair, the assembly will be retested at the Owner's expense to insure
correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue
unprotected if the backflow preventer assembly fails the periodic test and
cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not
more than thirty days after the test date may be established. The Owner is
responsible for the costs of all testing, repair service, replacement parts, or
a replacement assembly.  Parallel installation of two assemblies is an
effective means of the owner insunng uninterrupted water service during testing
or repair of one of the assemblies and is strongly recommended when the Owner
desires such continuity.
   (d)    Backflow preventer assemblies shall be tested at least semi-annually
in cases where there is a history of test failures and the Water Purveyor feels
that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. 
Cost of the additional tests will be borne by the Owner.
(Ord. 2009-12-1.  Passed 2-9-10.)
1103.10  RECORDS.
   (a)    The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain up to date the
following:
      (1)   Master files on customer evaluations and/or inspections of cross-
connections and backflow conditions.
      (2)    Master files on all customer backflow preventer assemblies.
      (3)    Master files on customer backflow preventer tests, repairs and
replacements.  Records for replaced backflow preventer shall be maintained for
a period of one year after date of removal from service.
      (4)    Records and reports of any backflow incidents occurring in the
public or consumer water systems shall be maintained for at least three years
after the date of the incident.
      (5)    Copies of any of the above and other records and/or reports
supplied to the WVBPH for at least three years after submission.
   (b)    Upon request, the Water Purveyor will submit records of inspection
and noncompliance, surveys, test results, corrective actions, and backflow
incident reports to the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health. 
(Ord. 2009-12-1.  Passed 2-9-10.)
1103.11  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this article or the application thereof shall for any
reason be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder of this article,
but shall be confined in its operation to the provision thereon directly
involved in the controversy in which such judgment shall have been rendered,
and the applicability of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall
not be affected thereby.

1317.01  GENERAL PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Sequence of Steps.  Under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance, all new
construction, alterations and changes in type of occupancy must be made in
conformance with the requirements contained herein.  All persons desiring to
undertake such new construction, alterations or changes shall conform to the
following general procedure, as well as to all other applicable provisions of
this Ordinance.
      (1)   Application for zoning permit.  Applicant applies to the Zoning
Officer for a zoning permit by filling out the appropriate application and by
submitting the required fee.
      (2)   Issuance of zoning permit.  If the action proposed in the
application is in accord with the regulations contained in this Ordinance, a
zoning permit will be issued by the Zoning Officer either on his own authority
or, in certain cases as described in subsection (b) hereof, after referral to
the Board of Zoning Appeals or to the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Action in accordance with zoning permit.  After receipt of the
zoning permit the applicant may proceed to undertake the construction,
alteration or change in use permitted by the zoning permit.
      (4)   Application for occupancy permit.  After completion of the
construction, alteration or change in use, and before occupancy takes place on
the premises, the applicant shall apply to the Zoning Officer for an occupancy
permit stating that the completed action is in accord with the zoning permit.
      (5)   Inspection by zoning officer.  The Zoning Officer inspects the
premises and issues an occupancy permit if he finds the action has occurred in
accordance with the zoning permit.
      (6)   Issuance of occupancy permit.  The receipt of the occupancy permit
by the applicant ensures him the right to continue the use as approved.
   (b)   Zoning Permit Types.  Under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance, four
general classes of zoning permits may be issued under which compliance with
this Ordinance may occur.  Each of these classes requires a different
procedural action as described below:
      (1)   Principal permitted uses.  An application for a zoning permit for a
"principal permitted use" in a zoning district requires only the review of the
Zoning Officer, who determines whether the proposed construction, alteration or
change in use is in accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.  The
Zoning Officer then either issues or refuses to issue a zoning permit according
to his decision.
      (2)   Special uses.  An application for a zoning permit for a "special
use" must be referred to the Board of Zoning Appeals and to the Planning
Commission by the Zoning Officer.  The Zoning Officer is not empowered to make
an independent decision on this matter, although he may submit recommendations
to the Board of Zoning Appeals and to the Planning Commission.  The Planning
Commission reviews the application and analyzes the proposed special use to
determine compliance with the provisions of this Ordinance.  The Planning
Commission then gives its recommendations to the Board of Zoning Appeals who
meets and makes a final decision on the special use.  The Board of Zoning
Appeals then notifies the Zoning Officer to either issue or refuse a zoning
permit accordingly.
      (3)   Zoning permit after an appeal.  The applicant may appeal to the
Board of Zoning Appeals any action taken by the Zoning Officer or by any other
administrative official or board charged with the enforcement of this Ordinance
by submitting an application for an appeal to the Zoning Officer and to the
Secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The Board gives notice of the date
for a public hearing and reviews the application to determine if the appeal
should be granted.  After the public hearing, and after reaching its decision,
the Board of Zoning Appeals can order the Zoning Officer to either issue or
refuse a permit accordingly.
      (4)   Permit after a variance request.  Where the applicant feels that
there are practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in the way of
carrying out the strict letter of this Ordinance he may appeal for a variance
by submitting an application requesting such variance to the Zoning Officer and
to the Secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The Board gives notice of the
date for a public hearing and reviews the application.  After the public
hearing and reviews and after reaching its decision, the Board can order the
Zoning Officer to issue or refuse a zoning permit accordingly.  (5-16-67)

kept on file in the office of the Zoning Officer.
      (1)   Application for permit.  Application for an occupancy permit shall
be made in writing on a form furnished by the Zoning Officer setting forth such
facts as the Zoning Officer may require.
      (2)   Permit shall continue.  An occupancy permit once granted shall
continue in effect so long as there is no change of use, regardless of change
in the personnel of tenants or occupants.
   (c)   Certificate of Nonconforming Use.  The owner of the premises occupied
by a lawful nonconforming use or building may secure within a year a
certificate of nonconformance use from the Zoning Officer.  Such certificate

1317.05  VARIANCES.
   (a)   Board May Authorize Variance.  Upon appeal and after public notice in
a newspaper of general circulation in the City and after hearing, and subject
to appropriate safeguards and conditions for the protection of public and of
neighboring properties, the Board of Zoning Appeals may vary the strict
application of any of the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that
such variance shall be in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow, shallow
or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions, whereby such strict
application would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship that
would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land or building involved,
but in no other case.
   (b)   Purpose of Variance.  The sole purpose of any variance shall be to
prevent discrimination, and no variance shall be granted which would have the
effect of granting a special privilege not shared by other property in the same
vicinity and zone.
   (c)   Required Showing for Variances.  No variance in the strict application
of any provision of this Ordinance shall be granted by the Board unless it
finds the following:
      (1)   That there are special circumstances or conditions, fully described
in the findings, applying to the land or buildings that do not apply generally
to land or buildings in the neighborhood.
      (2)   That the circumstance or conditions are such that the strict 
application of the provisions of this Ordinance would deprive the applicant of
the reasonable use of such land or building.
      (3)   That for reasons fully set forth in the findings, the granting of
the variance is necessary for the reasonable use of the land or building and
that the variance as granted by the Board, is the minimum variance that will
accomplish this purpose.
      (4)   That the granting of such variance will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements
in such vicinity and district in which the property is located.  (5-16-67)
1317.06  APPEALS AND PETITIONS.
   (a)   Appeal from Decision of Administrative Official.  An appeal taken from
the requirement, decision or the determination made by an administrative
official charged with the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance shall be filed
with the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   The appeal shall specify the grounds thereof and shall be filed within such
time and in such form as may be prescribed by the Board by general rule.
   The administrative official from whom the appeal is taken shall, upon
request of the Board of Zoning Appeals, transmit to it all documents, plans and
papers constituting the record of the action from which an appeal was taken.
      (1)   Hearing of appeal.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall fix a
reasonable time for the hearing of an appeal.  Public notice shall be given of
the hearing and due notice shall be given additionally to the interested
parties.
         The Board of Zoning Appeals may require the party taking the appeal to
assume the cost of public notice and due notice to interested parties.
         Upon the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent or by
attorney.
      (2)   Staying of work on premises.  When an appeal from the decision of
any official has been taken and filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals, all
proceedings and work on the premises concerning when the decision was made
shall be stayed unless the official from whom the appeal was taken shall
certify to the Board of Zoning Appeals that, by reason of facts stated in the
certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property.  In such
case, proceedings or work shall not be stayed except by a restraining order
which may be granted by the circuit court of the county in which the premises
affected are situated, on application, on notice to the officer or board from
whom the appeal is taken and the owner of the premises affected and on due
cause shown.
   (b)   Petitions to the Circuit Court.
      (1)   Petition for writ of certiorari.  Every decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be subject to review by certiorari.
         Any person or persons, firm or corporation jointly or severally
aggrieved by any decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, may present to the
Circuit Court of the County in which the premises affected are located a
petition duly verified, setting forth that such decision is illegal in whole or
in part, and specifying the grounds of the illegality.  The petition shall be
presented to the court within thirty days after the date of the decision and
the order of the Board of Zoning Appeals complained of.
      (2)   Notice to adverse parties.  On filing a petition for a writ of
certiorari with the Clerk of the Circuit Court, the petitioner shall cause a
notice to be issued and served by the Sheriff upon the adverse party or
parties, if any, as shown by the record of the appeal in the office of the
Board of Zoning Appeals.
         The adverse party or parties shall be any property owner whom the
record of the Board of Zoning Appeals shows to have appeared at the hearing
before the Board in opposition to the petitioner.  If the record shows a
written remonstrance or other document opposing the request of petitioner
containing more than three names, the petitioner shall be required to cause
notice to be issued and served upon the three property owners whose names first
appear upon the remonstrance or document.  Notice to the other parties named
shall not be required.
         The notice shall state that a petition for a writ of certiorari has
been filed in the Circuit Court of the County, asking for a review of the
decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals, designating the premises affected and
the date of the decision and the time fixed for the return of the writ of
certiorari by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         The service of the writ of certiorari by the sheriff on the chairman
or secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall constitute notice to the
Board and to the City or any official or board thereof charged with the
enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance, and no further summons or notice with
reference to the filing of such petition shall be necessary.
      (3)   Action of Court on petition.  Upon presentation of a petition for a
writ of certiorari, the Circuit Court of the County, or a judge thereof in
vacation shall direct the Board of Zoning Appeals within twenty days from the
date of such citation, to show cause why a writ of certiorari should not
issue.  If such Board fails to show to the satisfaction of the court that a
writ should not issue then the Court may allow a writ of certiorari directed to
the Board of Appeals.  The writ shall prescribe the time in which a return
shall be made to it.  This time shall not be less than ten days from the date
of issuance of the writ and may be extended by the court or judge thereof.
      (4)   Stay of work on allowance of writ.  The allowance of the writ of
certiorari shall not stay proceedings or work on the premises affected under
the decision to be brought up for review.  The Court may, however, on
application and on notice to all parties to the decision and on due cause shown
grant such relief as the circumstances of the case may require, including an
order staying the work until final determination of the case by the Court. 
Such staying order may be issued by the Court without requiring the petitioner
to enter into a written undertaking to the adverse party affected thereby for
the payment of damages by reasons of such staying order.
      (5)   Return to writ by Board of Zoning Appeals.  The answer to the writ
of certiorari by the Board of Zoning Appeals must concisely set forth such
facts and data as may be pertinent and present material to show the grounds of
the decision appealed from.  It shall include copies of all reviews pertaining
to the case in dispute.
         The answer must be verified by the secretary of the Board.
         The Board shall not be required to return the original papers acted
upon by it.  It shall be sufficient to return certified copies of all or such
portion of the papers as may be called for by the writ.
      (6)   Action by the Court.  The Court may decide and determine the
sufficiency of the statements of illegality contained in the petition without
further pleadings and may make its determination and render its judgment with
reference to the legality of the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals on the
facts set out in the return to the writ of certiorari.
         If it shall appear to the court that testimony is necessary for the
proper disposition of the matter, it may take evidence to supplement the
evidence and facts disclosed by the return to the writ of certiorari, but no
such review shall be by trial de nova.
         In passing upon the legality of the decision of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, the court may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the
decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals brought for review.
      (7)   Appeals from Court judgment.  An appeal may be taken to the Supreme
Court of Appeals of West Virginia from the final judgment of the Court
reversing, affirming or modifying the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals
in the same manner, and upon the same terms, conditions and limitations as
appeals in other civil actions.  (5-16-67)

consistent with the zoning classification assigned to the nearest or adjacent
property that is not otherwise zoned for recreational use.
   (b)   Any property designated on the City's zoning map as "institutional"

and approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 89-4.  Passed 6-14-89.)
1323.10  ADULT ENTERTAINMENT FACILITY.
   Adult entertainment facilities, as defined in this section, shall be
regulated to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of
the City.  In addition to the general purpose of the Zoning Code, these
regulations shall prevent any location of such facility from having a harmful
effect, and shall seek to discourage a concentration of adult businesses within
the City, thereby reducing or eliminating the adverse secondary effects from
such businesses.  The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor
the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any
communicative materials including sexually oriented materials.  Similarly, it
is not the intent or the effect of this section to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market.  Neither is it the intent nor effect of
this section to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material. 
Rather, the intent of this section is an exercise of traditional zoning
authority for the purposes set forth in West Virginia Code Section 8-24-1 and
Section 8-24-39.  The provisions of this zoning classification are not intended
to supersede the provisions of any other ordinance of the City of Wellsburg or
law of the State of West Virginia.  The provisions of this zoning ordinance are
in addition to any other law or regulation.
   (a)   Adult Entertainment Facility Defined.  Under the terms of this Zoning
Ordinance, such facility is defined as follows: nightclub, bar, restaurant,
supper club, lounge, live or movie theater, cabaret, bookstore, or other
establishment in which a person or persons appear in a state of nudity in the
performance of their duties or material is available depicting person or
persons in a state of nudity.  Nudity shall mean the showing of the human
genitals less than completely and opaquely covered, the pubic region, the
buttocks, the female breast below a point immediately above the top of the
areola, or the human male genitals in a discernibly turgid state, even if
completely and opaquely covered.  Such facilities, to the average person and
applying contemporary community standards, appeal to prurient interest; may
include patently offense representations or descriptions of ultimate sexual
acts, normal or perverted, actual or simulated, of masturbation, excretory

1329.06  BILLBOARDS.
   There is hereby instituted a moratorium against the erection of any new
“billboards”, as that term is popularly used for off-premise advertising within
the City.  Those billboards already in existence within the City as of the date
of passage of this section shall be restricted to their existing size and may
not be enlarged.  The term “Billboard” shall not apply to any on-premise
advertising of a business.  (Ord. 96-5.  Passed 11-12-96.)
1329.07  VIDEO LOTTERY ESTABLISHMENTS.
   The City of Wellsburg’s City Council believes that the proliferation of
video lottery establishments throughout the City must be subject to certain
zoning restrictions so that such establishments are not so closely located as
to dominate one particular locality to the near exclusion of other business
establishments; are not located in close proximity to schools, churches, public
parks or residential neighborhoods.  The City believes that such proliferation
is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the community.  Further,
Council believes that it is reasonable to place zoning restrictions upon
establishments providing for video lottery terminals so that concerns such as
traffic, parking provisions, character of the surrounding neighborhood, goals
of the Comprehensive Plan and distance requirements can be addressed prior to
such establishment being given approval to operate and a license to do business
within the City.
   (a)   General Requirements for Establishments Providing Video Lottery
Terminals:
      (1)   No such establishment is permitted in any residential zone of the
City.
      (2)   No such establishment is permitted within 600 feet of another such
establishment already providing video lottery or having a license to do so.
      (3)   No such establishment is permitted within 600 feet of a school that
is part of a public or private school system.
      (4)   No such establishment is permitted within 600 feet of a church.
      (5)   No such establishment is permitted within 600 feet of a municipally
owned public park.
   (b)   For the purpose of this section, distance shall be measured in a
straight line, without regard to intervening structures or objects, from the
nearest portion of the parcel of real estate upon which an establishment
providing video lottery is located to the nearest property line of the premises
of a church, a public or private school, or a public park.
   (c)   Any permits and Video Lottery Business Licenses shall not issue until
the zoning officer has confirmed the general distance requirements in
subsection (a) are met.

grade (below ground level) on all sides.

is to be used only when calculating the starting time for expiration of a
Floodplain Permit.) means the date the Floodplain permit was issued, including
permits for substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date.
         The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a

condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-
related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a
year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."
      (47)    "Substantial Improvement" means any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the Start of Construction of the improvement.

would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         C.   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
      (48)   "Top of Bank" means the lines depicted on the FIRM maps
delineating each side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a
professional familiar with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of
bank. When a professional is not employed the top of the bank will be
considered to be the top of the first significant slope landward of the water's
edge when it is followed by at least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (49)   "Variance" means a grant of relief by a community from the terms
of a floodplain management regulation.
      (50)    "Violation" means the failure of any structure or development to
be fully compliant with all requirements of this ordinance. A structure or
other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or
other evidence of compliance required by this ordinance is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided. No future
improvements or developments can be made to structures found to be in violation
unless the development is to bring the structure into compliance with the
current ordinance. 
         (Ord. 2018-09.  Passed 10-9-18.)
1711.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOOD PLAIN AREA.
   (a)    Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Wellsburg which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Wellsburg by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated April 19, 2010 or the most recent
revision thereof.
      (2)    The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those areas
which have been identified as flood hazard areas by the City of Wellsburg by
use of historic or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized
"FIRM".  These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the level of
technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)    Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)    The "Floodway area" shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include
floodway areas identified by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)    The "AE Area without Floodway" shall be those areas identified as
an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (3)    The "Approximated floodplain" shall be those areas identified as
an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
      (4)    The AO and AH floodplain those areas identified as Zones AO and AH
on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by 1-percent-
annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between one and three
feet, In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established to guide
floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (c)    Changes in Designation of Area. The delineation of the identified
special flood hazard area may be revised by the City Council, City of Wellsburg
where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or more detailed studies
conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a River Basin
Commission or other qualified agency or individual document the necessity for
such changes.  However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   A county's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from
physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable but, not
later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the
County shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting
technical or scientific data.
   The City of Wellsburg may identify and regulate new flood hazard or ponding
areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map using best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of
record, historic high water marks and/or approximate
study methodologies.
   (d)    Elevations Prevail. If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed
development
is above the Base Flood Elevation, and the following is provided to the
Floodplain Administrator:
      (1)   Elevation information and a site plan demonstrating that all
proposed development will occur above the Base Flood Elevation, or
      (2)   A Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA removing the site from
SHFA then the sire shall be constructed to be outside the Floodplain Area and
shall not be required to conform to the provisions of this ordinance.
         If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is below
the Base Flood Elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the site shall
be considered to be within the flood plain area and the proposed structure
shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this ordinance.
   (e)    Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Flood Plain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the County Commission
sitting as the "Floodplain Appeals Board." The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant/applicant.
(Ord. 2018-09.  Passed 10-9-18.)
1711.04  UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)    Floodway. Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering
study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   Because flood ways present increased risk to human life and
property due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the floodway
shall be preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (2)    New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (3)    When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (4)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable Federal and State Law, Ordinances and
Regulations.
      (5)    In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of City of
Wellsburg's Floodplain Administrator be determined to be the channel of the
stream and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the
special flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site
to the upland limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)    AE Zone without Floodway. Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (c)    Approximated Flood Plain (Zone A). Within any Approximated Flood
Plain Area,
      (1)   The Flood Plain Administrator shall use elevation and flood way
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)    When data from an acceptable source is not available, the Flood
Plain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all proposed
development to determine (a) the amount being invested and (b) the specific
flood risk at the site. The Flood Plain Administrator shall then require the
applicant to determine the elevation above which the development and adjacent
properties including but not limited to existing buildings will be reasonably
safe from flooding using hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other. When
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Flood Plain Administrator.
      (3)    Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided
that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      (4)   Within any apportioned Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than once (1) foot at any point.
   (d)    Alteration or Relocation of a Stream. Whenever a developer intends to
alter or relocate a stream within the special flood hazard area the developer
shall:
      (1)   Notify in writing, by certified mail, the City of Wellsburg's Flood
Plain Administrator, The State Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities
and any adjacent property owners of all such intended activities prior to the
alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all required notifications
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In addition prior
to issuing the local permit the Flood Plain Administrator shall require copies
of all necessary permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or
State Law requires approval.
      (2)    The developer shall also assure the City of Wellsburg in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Flood Plain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a registered professional engineers, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the flood plain administrator.
      (3)    Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The flood plain administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the County a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer this
agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred.  A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the flood plain administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Flood plain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1711.08.
      (6)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the Flood
Plain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for
this purpose.

   (c)    Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this ordinance.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also
be included in the application for work within the special flood hazard area:
      (1)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure

of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification. The
elevation certificate must confirm that the structure in question together with
attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit conditions.

required by this ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         C.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         D.   A Flood proofmg Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in (1) above, stating the structure in question, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            (i)    The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            (ii)    The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.

materials used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage, (Appurtenant
Structures only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            (i)    Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            (ii)    Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               (I)    A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               (II)    The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
               (III)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves
or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of flood waters.
               (IV)    In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-conversion
Agreement and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It
shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-conversion
Agreement to any purchaser at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of
the transferred Non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Flood Plain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the non-conversion agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Flood Plain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1711.08.
   (d)    Site Plan Criteria. Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks. 
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Flood Plain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (1)    The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Flood Plain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (2)    Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (3)    A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to flood plain areas, proposed lot sites, and fills.
      (4)   Where the subdivision and/or manufactured home park lie partially
or completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five ( 5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify
the site plan.
      (5)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Flood Plain area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2)
acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and
shall delineate a floodway.
         (i)    When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the Base Flood
Elevation.
         (ii)    If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
         (iii)    If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (6)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
Approximated floodplain area (zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development
of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the
site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two
(2) or five (5) feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to
be developed and the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled
from the FEMA map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (e)    Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas. 
Subdivisions of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
that 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.  (Ord. 2018-09. 
Passed 10-9-18.)

   (d)    Appurtenant Structures. When possible, appurtenant structures shall
be located out
of the special flood hazard area. Where appurtenant structures not connected to
the principal structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood
Elevation, the following flood damage reduction provisions and other
requirements apply:
      (1)    Use of the structure shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
         A.   Structures shall be no more than 300 square feet in size and
valued at less than seven thousand dollars ($7,000.00).
         B.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
         C.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to minimize
flood damage.
         D.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         E.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         F.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         G.   Opening requirements:  Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls

exit of floodwaters.
         H.   In addition, a Non-conversion Agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
buyers of the existence of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement at closing to the
purchaser via notarized signature, a copy of all new nonconversion agreements
shall be provided to the Flood Plain Administrator. Failure to transfer the
non-conversion agreement and provide a signed copy to the Flood Plain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1711.08.
   (e)    Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any
special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. or,
      (2)    Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. or,
      (3)    Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
ordinance.
   (f)    Fill. The City Council of the City of Wellsburg officially recognizes
the beneficial functions the Floodplain Area serves in storage and
transportation of water during floods. Placement of fill in the special flood
hazard area is discourages and should be minimized.    Placement of fill in
other areas of the special flood hazard area shall be restricted to functional
purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill shall only be permitted in the
same permit with the related structure or other functional purpose. Placement
of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to elevate yards, parking lots,
or fields will not generally be considered a functional purpose. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the developer to provide compensatory storage before
permitting fill.
   No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway unless it has been demonstrated
through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with
currently accepted technical standards that the proposed fill will not result
in any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   All fill placed in special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
      (1)    Fill shall be used to the extent to which it does not adversely
affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall consider
the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to the
subject property and adjacent properties:
         A.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
         B.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
         C.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
         D.   Increase to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating erosion
problems.
         E.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when determining
whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and adjacent
properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst topography,
stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
      (2)    Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
      (3)    A Fill Site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with preconstruction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
Ordinance and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
      (4)    Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in subsection 5 below. For non-residential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
      (5)    At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25)
percent of the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
      (6)    Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
      (7)    Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
      (8)    Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (9)    Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
         A.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second of less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
         B.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
      (10)    All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
can be issued. The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving  said request and executing Form I, "Overview &
Concurrence Form" or other form as may be required by FEMA.
      (11)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
   (g)    Placement of Structures and Other Development.  All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
      (2)    So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (h)    Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)    All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools, and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (i)    Flood Protection Setback.  A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice
the width of the watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the
top of the opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained
from the top of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas
wells and well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100
feet from any perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir, or
wetland. [See W.Va. Code §22-6A-12(b)].  To reduce erosion, natural vegetation
shall maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along
the watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall
be given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and
enhance aquatic resources.
      (1)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection at the discretion of the Flood plain Administrator.
      (2)    At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator, the Flood
Protection Setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
   
   (j)   Storage.
      (1)    No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with the requirements of other State
environmental agency or agencies.
      (2)    Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
      (3)    Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
   (k)    Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)    All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of 
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)    All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)    Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (l)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within zones AH and
AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
   (m)    Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the flood
plain.
(Ord. 2018-09.  Passed 10-9-18.)

Administrator shall immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall
remain in effect until a resolution of said Appeal.
      (2)    Inspections and Revocations.

         C.   The Flood Plain Administrator or authorized county, state, or
federal government official may inspect any development covered by this or
previous Floodplain Ordinance to determine whether any portion of the

      (1)    In the special flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Flood Plain Administrator stating that
the building or land conforms to the requirements of this ordinance.  Occupying
or using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1711.08.
      (2)    In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect
and approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until
the inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance
issued by the Local Flood Plain Administrator stating that the particular
development being inspected conforms to the requirements of this ordinance.
Inspection and approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in Section
1711.08.
      (3)    In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Flood Plain Administrator stating that
the development conforms to the requirements of this ordinance. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1711.08.
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Floodplain
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)    Issuance of the Certificate of Compliance shall be based upon the

the City of Wellsburg for any additional costs for services necessary for
review and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Flood Plain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs.  Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the City for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.
         (Ord. 2018-09.  Passed 10-9-18.)
1711.08  APPEALS AND PENALTIES.

City of Wellsburg sitting as the Floodplain Appeals Board. Such appeal must be
filed with the County Clerk, in writing, within thirty (30) days after
notification of the decision of the Floodplain Administrator as announced at a
regularly scheduled City Council for the City of Wellsburg Meeting. Said Appeal
shall be served by the aggrieved person by regular mail on all interested
parties on the date that said Appeal is filed.  Upon receipt of such appeal,
the Floodplain Appeals Board shall set a time, date and place not less than ten
(10) nor more than sixty (60) calendar days for the purpose of hearing the
appeal.  Notice of the time, date and place of the hearing shall be given to

Floodplain Appeals Board shall be final in all cases, subject to any Appeal to
the Circuit Court of Brooke County, West Virginia or any other Court of
competent jurisdiction.
   In the event an Appeal is filed wherein a Floodplain Permit grant has been
ruled by the Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator shall
immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall remain in effect until a
resolution of said appeal.
   (b)    Appeal Review Criteria. All appeals contesting only the permit fee,
the cumulative substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback
requirement, or the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of
the Floodplain Appeals board.
   (c)    Variances.  If compliance with any of the requirements of this
Ordinance would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder,
developer or landowner, the City of Wellsburg may, upon request, grant relief
from the strict application of the requirements.
   Considerations for the issuance of Variances to this Ordinance shall adhere
to the following criteria:
      (1)   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances.
      (2)    An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the Special
Flood Hazard Area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,
shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance.
      (3)    An affirmative decision granting a Floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood
Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and
         (ii)   Such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk
to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of
all decisions as required in this Ordinance; and
      (5)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall maintain a record of all
decisions including justification for the decisions, and report such decisions
issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (6)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for issuance of a
Floodplain variance for any construction, development use or activity within
any Floodway Area that would cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (d)    Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this ordinance or order of the Flood Plain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the community, shall be
unlawful, and shall be referred to the Prosecuting Attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Wellsburg of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus the costs of prosecution.  Each
day during which any violation of this ordinance continues shall constitute a
separate offense. In default of such payment such person shall be imprisoned
for a period not to exceed 10 days. Each day during which any violation of this
ordinance continues shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to the
above penalties, all other actions are hereby reserved including an action in
equity for the proper enforcement of this ordinance. The imposition of a fine
or penalty for any violation of, or non-compliance with, this ordinance shall
not excuse the violation or non-compliance with the ordinance or permit it to
continue; and all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such
violations or non-compliance within a reasonable time. Any structure
constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered or relocated in non-compliance
with this ordinance may be declared by the City Council of the City of
Wellsburg to be a public nuisance and abatable as such subject to other
applicable  laws and exhaustion of appellate rights.

provisions of this ordinance are hereby declared to be severable.
   (b)    Liability. The granting of a permit or approval of a subdivision or
development plan in an identified flood-prone area, shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the City of Wellsburg or
by any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the
proposed use, and shall create no liability upon the City of Wellsburg. This
ordinance does not create a private cause of action. All applicants proposing

1718.01  ADOPTION.
   Pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 8, Article 12, Section 16c of
the West Virginia Code, there is hereby adopted a Vacant Building Code for the
City of Wellsburg.
(Ord. 2012-2-1.  Passed 3-13-12.)
1718.02  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City has determined that an uninspected and unmonitored vacant
building may present a fire hazard, may provide temporary occupancy by
transients (including drug users and traffickers), may detract from private
and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and
that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by the regulation
of such vacant buildings.
   (b)   Owners of uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings shall register
such vacant buildings with the City, make payment of a fee for the registration
thereof, and otherwise conform to these vacant building regulations.
   (c)   This article ensures that, through a registration, inspection, and
monitoring process, vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from
trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in
times of emergency, will not impede private and/or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and will not present otherwise
a public hazard.
   (d)   The City, by and through its various departments and authorities, (the
Building Enforcement Agency and the Urban Renewal Authority) shall inspect and
monitor vacant buildings shall assess the effects of the condition of those
buildings on nearby structures, and promote substantial efforts to rehabilitate
and develop such buildings when appropriate.
   These provisions will streamline and consolidate the existing procedure
(that is, complaint, research, notification, inspection, orders, fines, liens,
appeals and due process lien enforcement), by placing the responsibility to
register and maintain vacant structures on the building owner before a
building's condition falls into disrepair or otherwise merits a complaint. 
(Ord. 2012-2-1.  Passed 3-13-12.)
1718.03  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Definitions.  For purposes of this section, the following words and
phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows:
      (1)   Boarded:  A building or structure subject to the provision of this
section shall be deemed to be "boarded" if in place of one or more exterior
doors, other than a storm door, or of one or more windows, there is a sheet or
sheets of plywood or similar material covering the space for such door or
window.
      (2)   Exterior maintenance and major systems: The phrase "exterior
maintenance and major systems" shall mean the safe and lawful maintenance of
the facade, windows, doors, roof and other parts of the exterior of the
building and the maintenance of its major systems consisting of the roof, the
electrical and plumbing systems, the water supply system, the sewer system, and
the sidewalk, driveway, if any, area of the lot, as applicable, particularly in
connection with codes adopted by the City as well as all applicable local,
state and federal laws.
      (3)   Occupied: Any building or structure shall be deemed to be occupied
if one or more persons actually conducts a lawful business or resides in all or
any part of the building as the licensed business occupant, or as the legal or
equitable owner/occupant(s) or tenant(s) on a permanent, non-transient basis,
or any combination of the same.  For purposes of this section, evidence offered
to prove that a building is so occupied may include, but shall not be limited
to, the regular receipt of delivery of regular mail through the U.S. Postal
Service; proof of continual telephone, electric, gas, heating, water and sewer
services; a valid city business license, or the most recent, federal, state or
city income tax statements indicating that the subject property is the official
business or residence address of the person or business claiming occupancy; or
proof of bonafide pre-rental inspection.
      (4)   Open: A building or structure subject to the provisions of this
section shall be deemed to be "open" if any one or more exterior doors other
than a storm door is broken, open and/or closed but, without a properly
functioning lock to secure it, or if one or more windows is broken or not
capable of being locked and secured from intrusion, or any combination of the
same.
      (5)   Owner: An owner of the freehold of the premises or any lesser
estate therein, a mortgagee, a vendee-in-possession, assignee of rents,
receiver, executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or
corporation that is directly or indirectly in control of a building subject to
the provisions of this section, and as set forth below.
      (6)   Vacant: a building or structure shall be deemed to be vacant if no
person or persons actually, currently conduct a lawfully licensed business, or
lawfully reside, dwell, or live in any part of the building as the legal or
equitable owner(s) or tenant-occupant(s), or owner-occupant(s), or tenant(s) on
a permanent, non-transient basis.  A building or structure shall be deemed
vacant and subject to the registration and possible penalty provisions provided
herein if the exterior maintenance and major systems of the building and the
surrounding real property thereof, as defined in this section, are in violation
of the building codes or health and sanitation codes and if there is not proof
of continual utility service evidencing actual use of electric, gas (i.e.,
applicable heating sources), water service, etc.  Continued is meant to be
without more than one thirty (30) day interruption in any given three hundred
sixty (360) day period.  In order for such continual utility service to be
considered as being actually in use as described in this section, it must be
more than merely registered to the owner for purposes of billing and must be
utilized, at a minimum, in order to keep the property and the major systems of
the building in compliance with building and safety codes.  The person or
entity asserting that there has been continued utility service has the burden
to produce actual bills evidencing utility service for the relevant period.
   (b)   All vacant structures shall also comply with the following criteria:
      (1)   Exterior property areas are to be mowed regularly and non-
cultivated gardens maintained at no more than 17 inches of growth.  All noxious
weeds are prohibited.
      (2)   Structure is to be broom swept and cleared of all contents, not
including building materials or components to be used in the future renovation
at that structure.
      (3)   Electrical service is to be provided to the building via temporary
pole service on the exterior of the structure or create a permanent service for
the structure and install two GFCI protected receptacles.
      (4)   NEC and OSHA compliant string lighting is to be provided to the
entire structure so that it may be illuminated as needed to view the structure.
      (5)   Unstable interior and exterior surfaces and components are to be
removed.  Unstable or unsound accessory buildings are to be razed or renovated.
      (6)   Using wood sheet goods; all loose, deteriorated and broken windows
and doors are to be covered to eliminate the danger of their falling and to
prevent the unwanted entry of trespassers.  Such wood sheet goods are to be cut
and neatly fit, not just nailed over the opening.
      (7)   All loose or deteriorated trim, gutter or overhang extensions
(masonry or frame) are to be removed or reattached to prevent falling.
      (8)   Regular routine monitoring of the structure is to occur by the
owner to ensure that the building is being kept in compliance with the above
items.
      (9)   Utilities need to be connected to the structure.
   (c)   Applicability.  The requirements of this section shall be applicable
to each owner of any building that is found to be vacant pursuant to the
language contained herein. Each such owner shall cause to be filed a notarized
registration statement, which shall include the street address and parcel
number of each such vacant building, the names and addresses of all owners, as
hereinafter described, and any other information deemed necessary by the
Building Enforcement Agency.  The registration fee(s) as required by this
section shall be billed by the City and shall be paid by last day of the month
when the property has been registered.  For purposes of this section, the
following shall also be applicable:
      (1)   If the owner is a corporation, the registration statement shall
provide the names and residence addresses of all officers and directors of the
corporation and shall be accompanied by a copy of the most recent annual
franchise tax report filed with the secretary of state;
      (2)   If an estate, the name and business address of the executor of the
estate;
      (3)   If a trust, the name and address of all trustees, grantors, and
beneficiaries;
      (4)   If a partnership, the names and residence addresses of all partners
with an interest of ten percent or greater;

1718.04  INSPECTION.
   At the time of registration, the Building Inspector, Fire Chief and Police
Chief shall determine whether it is necessary for any or all of them to inspect
the structure so as to identify any public safety issues needing to be
addressed.  Inspections shall also be available to verify the status of any
property concerning occupancy, vacancy, etc.  If an internal inspection is
deemed necessary, the owner will be notified of the same and arrangements made
for the same.  If the owner fails or refuses to consent to and arrange for an
inspection, the city will seek an administrative search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, which shall include the Municipal Court, to authorize
inspection of the premises for the purpose of determining the structural
integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to insure its structural
integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire fighters and police
officers in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do not
present a hazard to the public during the time that the building remains
vacant.
(Ord. 2012-2-1.  Passed 2-13-12.)
1718.05  CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   The property owners shall be notified in writing of any corrective action
deemed necessary for life, safety and building code matters by City officials,
the applicable code provisions or regulations, and will be afforded a
reasonable time to the corrective action.  Corrective action concerning the
occupancy of vacant structures is discussed later herein.
(Ord. 2012-2-1.  Passed 3-13-12.)
1718.06  REGISTRATION AND FEES.
   (a)   At the time of adoption of this article, all owners of realty within
the City of Wheeling that contain a vacant structure, as defined above, shall
register the same with the office of the Collector Treasurer of the City.  For
those structures that qualify as a vacant structure and after the adoption of
this article, the owner thereof shall be required to register the structure
with the Collector Treasurer Office within  30 days after the structure is
found to meet the definition of a vacant structure.  The registration form
shall require information from the registrant deemed necessary by the City
Manager, Building Inspector, Fire Chief, City Engineer and Police Chief of the
City, so as to ensure that the purpose of this article is met.  Specifically,
the above named City officers shall have the authority to require that the
property owner provide a professional opinion (architect, engineer, etc.) to
determine the structural integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to
ensure its structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire
fighters and police officers in time of emergency, and that the building and
its contents do not present a hazard to the public during the time the building
remains vacant.  The above named officers shall have the authority to issue
orders to the owner for corrective action deemed necessary.  The Building
Inspector and Fire Chief shall rely upon the West Virginia State Building Code
and Fire Code, as well as other applicable law, for guidance during any such
structural review.
   (b)   Registration statement and fees; local agent.  If none of the persons
listed, as above, is shown at an address within the state, the registration
statement also shall provide the name and address of a person who resides
within the state and who is authorized to accept service of process on behalf
of the owners and who shall be designated as a responsible, local party or
agent, both for purposes of notification in the event of an emergency affecting
the public health, safety or welfare and for purposes of service of any and all
notices or registration statements as herein authorized and in connection
herewith.  Registration shall be required for all vacant buildings, whether
vacant and secure, vacant and open or vacant and boarded, and shall be required
whenever any building has remained vacant for 45 consecutive days or more.  In
no instance shall the registration of a vacant building and the payment of
registration fees be construed to exonerate the owner, agent or responsible
party for compliance with any other building code or housing code requirement. 
One registration statement may be filed to include all vacant buildings of the
owner so registering, but each structure constitutes a separate fee.  The owner
of the vacant property as of the last day of the month when the property has
been registered of each calendar year shall be responsible for the payment of
the non-refundable annual registration fee.  Said annual fee shall be billed by
the  City; and based on the duration of the vacancy as determined by the
following scale:
   No fee for properties that are vacant for less than one year;
$200.00 for properties that are vacant for at least one year but less than two
years;
$400.00 for properties that are vacant for at least two years but less than
three years;
$600.00 for properties that are vacant for at least three years or more.
   (c)   Use of Fees by City.  The fees collected pursuant to this section
shall be deposited into a separate account maintained by the Treasurer, which
shall be used for the following purposes:
      (1)   To improve public safety efforts, especially for police and fire
personnel, who most often contend with the dangerous situations manifested in
vacant properties;
      (2)   Monitor and administer this section; and
      (3)   Repair, close or demolish a vacant structure as authorized by
Chapter 8, Article 12, Section 16 of the West Virginia Code and by Article
1719 of the Codified Ordinances of the City.
         (Ord. 2012-2-1.  Passed  3-13-12.)
1718.07  RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   (a)   Appeal Rights.  The owner shall have the right to appeal the
imposition of the registration fees to the City Manager; upon filing an
application in writing to the department of licenses and inspections no later
than 15 calendar days after the date of the billing statement.  On appeal, the
owner shall bear the burden of providing satisfactory objective proof of
occupancy as defined in this article specifically.
   (b)   One Time Waiver of Registration Fee.  A one-time waiver of the
registration fee, or an extension of a waiver for up to 90 days from the date
of the current billing statement, may be granted by the City Manager or his
designee upon application of the owner and upon review and advice of the
Building Inspector if the owner:
      (1)   Demonstrates with satisfactory proof to the City Manager or his
designee that he/she is in the process of demolition, rehabilitation, or other
substantial repair of the vacant building; and
      (2)   Objectively demonstrates to the City Manager or his designee a
reasonable anticipated length of time for the demolition, rehabilitation, or
other substantial repair of the vacant building;
      (3)   Provides satisfactory proof to the City Manager or his designee
that he/she was actively attempting to sell or lease the property during the
vacancy period; or
      (4)   Provides satisfactory proof to the City Manager, to be evaluated on
a case-by-case basis, that the vacancy is temporary and may be due to illness
of the owner, active military service, or some other reasonable explanation
believed to be short term in nature and documentable as necessary.
   (c)   Within 30 days, or as soon thereafter as possible, after the waiver
application is received by the City Manager or his designee shall grant or deny
the waiver, or request for extension, in writing, and dispatch the written
decision by mail to the owner.  If the owner properly submitted an application
for a one-time waiver or request for extension to the City Manager or his
designee, and the City Manager or his designee rendered a decision which the
owner seeks to appeal to the City Council,  the owner must file an application
in writing no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the City Manager or
his designee's decision.  City Council shall either grant or deny the appeal.
Thereafter the decision of City Council is final unless within thirty (30) days
of such decision the owner appeals for injunctive relief to the Circuit Court
of Ohio County.  (Ord. 2012-2-1.  Passed 3-13-12.)
1718.08  AMENDING INFORMATION.
   (a)   Duty to Amend Registration Statement.  If the status of the
registration information changes during the course of any calendar year, it is
the responsibility of the owner, responsible party or agent for the same to
contact the department of licenses and inspections within 30 days of the
occurrence of such change and advise the department in writing of those
changes.
   (b)   Exceptions.  This section shall not apply to any building owned by the
United States, the state, the City, or any of their respective agencies or
political subdivisions.
   (c)   Violations and Penalties for Failure to Register.  The failure or
refusal for any reason of any owner, or agent of an owner acting on behalf of
the owner, to register a vacant building upon adoption of this section or to
pay any fees required to be paid pursuant to the provisions of this section,
within thirty days after they become due, shall constitute a violation
punishable upon conviction thereof by a fine in the amount of not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each
failure or refusal to pay a required vacant building fee, as applicable.  In
such cases, whenever the minimum fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00) is
imposed, it shall not be subject to suspension or reduction for any reason. 
(Ord. 2012-2-1.  Passed 3-13-12.)
1718.09  REINSPECTION.
   All vacant structures are subject to reinspection on an annual basis or as
deemed necessary pursuant to Section

(Ord. 2012-2-1.  Passed 3-13-12.)
1718.10  NON-PAYMENT OF FEES/LIENS.
   (a)   Delinquent Registration Fees as a Lien.  After the owner is given
notice of the amount of the registration fee due, except for those owners that
have properly perfected an appeal pursuant to Section
1718.07 , and the owner fails to pay the amount due, said amount shall
constitute a debt due and owing to the City and the City may commence a civil
action to collect such unpaid debt.
   (b)   "Lien" or "liens" as used in this section shall arise whenever the
fees and charges as described in this section are levied or imposed.  The liens
created in this article shall be subject to the provisions of Part Seven -
Business Regulation and Taxation Code of the City of Wellsburg, concerning lien
security and priority.
   (c)   If an owner fails to pay the registration fee as assessed and the City
begins the collection action to enforce its lien, then the Code Enforcement
Officer shall post the written notice on the property and send the written
notice to the owner(s) by certified and regular mail.
   (d)   The City may take action to sell the subject property by means of
forfeiture and the court ordered enforcement process to collect the debt owed
the City.  Should the City take the steps necessary to sell the subject
property, the City shall do so, subject to all liens and real and personal
property taxes that are due.  Purchasers of the subject property shall be
similarly responsible for registration pursuant to this section in the same
manner as the prior owner and must begin the registration process anew if said
property remains vacant.
(Ord. 2012-2-1.  Passed 3-13-12.)
1718.11  RELATION TO OTHER CODES AND LAWS.
   It is to be understood that the intent and purpose of this Article are

1719.17  DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS.
   (a)    No building in the City shall be intentionally demolished by or at
the instance of its owner, unless owner (or his authorized agent, such
authority to be evidenced in writing) shall have first obtained a demolition
permit from the City Manager, or his designee, upon a form and in the manner
prescribed by the City Manager.
   (b)    The City Manager or his designee shall require the following
conditions to be satisfied by the applicant prior to issuance of the permit:
      (1)    Written notification to all public utilities having service lines
or facilities in, over, under, or near the subject property, of the anticipated
dates of demolition, and that the utility provider's assistance will be
required to secure any affected utility lines or facilities.
      (2)    Purchase or maintenance of a casualty and liability insurance
policy protecting and indemnifying the owner, his contractor or employees, the
city, adjoining property owners, and members of the public from injury, loss of
life, or property damage resulting from the anticipated demolition work, and
delivery of a certificate of insurance evidencing such coverage.
      (3)    An annual license is required for the privilege of razing or
demolishing houses or other businesses and structures. Any owner wishing to
raze or demolish his own house or other business or structure without securing
a license and paying a license fee may do so upon securing a permit from the
City, and delivering a bond. No license or permit shall be issued until a bond
in the penal sum of no less than ten thousand dollars ($10,000.00) is necessary
to protect the City, he shall set forth in writing to the applicant the
required amount of the bond and the reasons such higher amount is required. No
license or permit shall be issued unless the required documents have been
received and approved by the City which include the following: all signatures
for disconnection for service; liability insurance or bond with the City of
Wellsburg as additionally insured; letters to adjoining property owners (copies
of letters and certified mail receipts to be submitted); and completed
demolition permit application and fee.
      (4)    The applicant may be relieved of the requirements of subsection
(b)(2) or (3) in the event of extreme financial hardship and upon approval of
the Building Enforcement Agency following review of the condition of the
subject property, the necessity for its prompt demolition, the financial
circumstances given in support of the applicant's hardship and the likelihood
of injury or damage to the public from the subject demolition.
      (5)    A permit fee shall be required based upon the cost of demolition
and removal based upon the fee structure set forth in Section
1707.01(d), which shall be paid by the applicant. Issuance of the demolition
permit shall be considered to be the equivalent of issuance of a building
permit, as those terms are used and referenced in Section
731.14, for purposes of payment and collection of any business and occupation
tax payable on account of the demolition work.
   (c)    Demolition shall be completed within thirty days from issuance of the
permit; provided, for good cause shown, the City Manager may extend the
completion period an additional thirty days. No further extension shall be
granted, except with the approval of the Building Enforcement Agency.
   (d)   (1)    A demolition shall be deemed completed when:
         A.    All utility services and lines have been properly secured in a
manner acceptable to the utility provider; and
         B.    All visible debris and materials shall have been removed from
the City; and
         C.    Any remaining cellar, basement or excavation shall have been
filled with fill materials suitable for the intended future purpose of the
site.
      (2)    Burying of construction debris which consists of structural lumber
shall not be allowed on the demolition site.
   (e)   (1)    Upon failure of the applicant to faithfully comply with the
provisions of the demolition permit, the City Manager may declare a default,
providing written notice thereof to the owner at his last given address. In the
event such default is not cured within ten days of the date of mailing such
notice of default, the City Manager may declare a forfeiture of the surety bond
or cash bond and collect the proceeds thereof. Such proceeds shall be applied
by the City toward completion of the demolition or to any costs or fees
incurred in collecting such proceeds.
      (2)    The City may, but shall not be obligated merely by such
forfeiture, to enter upon the subject property to complete the demolition, and
the owner shall remain liable to the City for all reasonable costs, fees and
expenses incurred thereby, including any deficiency after application of the
forfeited bond proceeds. The City may record a lien for such deficiency against
the subject property in the Office of the County Clerk, and may thereafter
foreclose same in the manner provided by law for foreclosure of mechanics
liens.
   (f)    Failure of the owner to faithfully comply with the provisions of this
section and all conditions of the demolition permit, as extended or modified,
shall be deemed a violation of this section, punishable upon conviction in a
court of competent jurisdiction by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars
