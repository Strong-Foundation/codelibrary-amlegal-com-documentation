EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Charles Town Codified Ordinances was

the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

County Court of Jefferson County may, however, upon the request of the Council
of the corporation of Charles Town surrender its jurisdiction and control of

owners or property holders having lots or land adjacent to and abutting on said
street or alley, whose lot or land may be benefited or injured by the opening
of such street or alley or by the widening of any such street or alley, and
shall make report as provided in said chapter, but lot owners and property
holders shall be named in the application and served with notice as required by
said chapter, and the duties of such Commissioners and their oaths shall cover
the duties herein imposed. All assessments for benefits under this Act shall be

part thereof to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any cause does not
affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section or part thereof.

111.01  RULES OF COUNCIL.
   (a)   Time and Place of Meetings.
      (1)   Regular meetings. The regular meetings of Council shall generally
be held at the Council Chambers located at 101 East Washington Street, on the
first and third Mondays, unless otherwise scheduled, in each month at 7:00 p.m.
A list of regular meeting dates will be available on the exterior City Hall
bulletin board and website. If Council shall determine that the Council
Chambers in City Hall are not or will not, for any reason, be an appropriate
place for the holding of a meeting, the Council may, upon motion, second and
majority vote, designate another place open to the public within the City for
the holding of such meeting. Council may also hold remote meetings when special
circumstances warrant such action but only after a motion, second, and majority
vote. As with all public meetings, all Council members must be able to hear and
be heard by other members and the proceedings must be accessible to the public
so they can observe the Council in action.
      (2)   Special meetings. A special meeting is a separate Council session
held at a different date and time than a regular meeting and may be called by
the Mayor, the Presiding Officer of Council in the event of a mayoral vacancy,
or any three (3) members of Council. The purpose for holding a special meeting
is to address matters that arise between regular meetings and require action by
Council before the next regularly scheduled meeting. Notice of time, place, and
purpose of the meeting, including a clear and specific description of any
proposed action to be taken by Council, must be provided to all members at
least three (3) days, excluding weekends and legal holidays, prior to the
special meeting. A special meeting notice will be issued along with an agenda
announcing any special meeting.
   (b)   Attendance. Members of Council are expected to be physically present
for regular meetings but may attend up to four (4) regular meetings remotely
during any fiscal year, provided appropriate technology is available that
enables them to hear and be heard by other members of Council. Any member
attending a meeting remotely after the four (4) approved regular meetings will
only be able to observe the work of Council and may not participate as a member
in discussion or any votes.
 
   (c)   Council may waive, via a resolution, the four (4) regular meeting
limit on remote participation for all members when extenuating circumstances
arise and more flexibility is needed to promote the orderly conduct of Council
business.
   (d)   Agendas.
      (1)   The City Clerk shall prepare a written agenda for all scheduled
meetings which shall consist of items submitted by the Mayor, City Council
members, and the City Manager.
      (2)   The agenda shall be posted on the exterior bulletin board for City
meetings located at 105 South George Street and on the City website three (3)
days prior to the scheduled meeting. Revisions to the posted agenda can be
made, however, the amended agenda must be made available at least two (2) days
in advance of the scheduled meeting. For purposes of calculating the number of
days in any notice period contained in these rules Saturdays, Sundays, and

regulations or requirements within thirty (30) days following the public
hearing, the City Council may designate the property or properties as historic,
and approve, amend or reject the proposed regulations and requirements.
   (d)    Within thirty (30) days following the designation or approval, the
owners and occupants of each designated historic property shall be given
written notification of such designation or approval by the City Council, which
notice shall apprise said owners and occupants of the necessity of obtaining a
certificate of appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change within
a Historic Overlay District.
(Ord. 2017-001. Passed 4-18-17.)
141.12 CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   The Historic Landmarks Commission shall have power and authority to regulate
properties in the Historic Overlay District according to the following
provisions:
   (a)    No buildings, site or structure shall be moved or demolished until
after an application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to
and approved by the Historic Landmarks Commission, except as otherwise provided
by in these Codified Ordinances or as provided by rules, regulations, policies,
procedures and standards adopted and published by the Historic Landmarks
Commission.
   (b)    The style, material, size and location of outdoor advertising signs
shall be under the control of the Historic Landmarks Commission. No sign may be
change, altered or installed on any private building, site or structure until
after and application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted
to and approved by the Historic Landmarks Commission.
   (c)    The Historic Landmarks Commission may request such plans, elevations,
specifications, drawings, photographs and other information as may be
reasonably deemed necessary to enable it to make a determination on the
application for a certificate of appropriateness.
   (d)    The Historic Landmarks Commission shall hold a public hearing upon
each application for a certificate of appropriateness. Notice of time and place
of the hearing shall be given in a newspaper of general circulation in the City
at least fourteen (14) days before the hearing, and by posting such notice on
or near the main entrance of any hall or room where the Historic Landmarks
Commission usually meets. The Historic Landmarks Commission shall take such
action as required to inform the owners of any property likely to be affected
by the application and shall give the applicant and such owners the opportunity
to be heard.
   (e)    The Historic Landmarks Commission shall approve or reject an
application for a certificate of appropriateness within forty-five (45) days
after filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property or a
building, site or structure located within the Historic Overlay District.
Evidence of approval shall be by a certificate of appropriateness.
   (f)    In passing upon the appropriateness of proposed action, the Historic
Landmarks Commission shall consider, in addition to other pertinent factors,
the historical and architectural integrity and significance; architectural
style design arrangement, texture and materials of the architectural features;
and the relationship and general compatibility thereof to the historic value
and exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in
the surrounding area.
   (g)    The Historic Landmarks Commission shall approve the application and
issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed action
would be appropriate. If the action is rejected, the Commission shall place
upon its record and shall transmit a record of such action and the reasons
therefor, in writing, to the applicant. In such written record, the Commission
may make recommendations relative to design, arrangement, texture, material and
similar features. The applicant may make modifications to the plans and may
resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
   (h)    In cases where the application covers a material change in the
appearance of a structure that would require the issuance of a building permit,
the rejection of an application for a certificate of appropriateness by the
Historic Landmarks Commission shall be binding upon the building inspector or
other administrative office charged with issuing building permits.
   (i)    If the City Council authorizes and such action is reasonably
necessary or appropriate for the preservation of a unique historic property,
the Historic Landmarks Commission may enter into negotiations with the owner
for acquisition by gift, purchase, exchange or otherwise of the property or any
interest therein.
   (j)   If strict application of any provision of this article would result in
exceptional practical difficulty upon any owner of any specific property, the
Historic Landmarks Commission shall have the power to vary or modify strict
adherence to the provisions or to interpret the meaning of the provision so as
to relieve such difficulty. Provided, that such variance, modification, or
interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of
the provisions so that architectural or historical integrity or character of
the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting
variations, the Historic Landmarks Commission may impose such reasonable and
additional stipulations and conditions as well as in its judgment to best
fulfill the purpose of this article.
   (k)    The Historic Landmarks Commission shall keep a record of all
applications for certificates of appropriateness and of all its proceedings.

Landmarks Commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of
appropriateness may appeal such determination to the Mayor and Council of the
City of Charles Town who may reverse or affirm the decision of the Historic
Landmarks Commission by a majority vote. If any person is adversely affected by
the decision by the Mayor and Council relative to the issuance or denial of a
certificate of appropriateness, he may appeal such decision to the Circuit
Court of Jefferson County. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude a
person subject to this ordinance as defined herein from exercising any and all
rights and pursuing any and all remedies, provided for under federal, state
and/or local law, including, but not limited to the Circuit Court of Jefferson
County.
   (m)    Nothing in this Article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a historic
property, which maintenance or repair does not involve a material change in
design, material, or outer appearance thereof, nor to prevent any property
owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other laws,
ordinances or regulations.
   (n)    Undertaking permitted, funded, licensed or otherwise assisted by the
state shall be reviewed in accordance with Subsection (e), Section Five (§29-1-
S(e)), Article One, Chapter Twenty-Nine of the State Code and shall be

(Ord. 2022-001. Passed 2-22-22.)
   147.02 BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPOSITION.
   (a)   The Charles Town Utility Board of Directors shall consist of five (5)
members with full voting powers, four (4) of whom shall be appointed by the
Charles Town City Council ("City Council") (such appointed directors being
referred to herein as "Appointed Directors") and the other of whom shall be the
then-serving Charles Town City Manager on an ex officio basis (the "Ex Officio
Director"). No officer or employee of the City or CTUB, other than the City
Manager, whether holding a paid or unpaid office, shall be eligible to be
appointed a Director except as expressly provided in Section
147.02(a)(l) below. The Board of Directors structure shall be configured as
follows:
      (1)   The Chair of the Board of Directors shall be the Charles Town City
Manager. In the event of a vacancy in the position of Charles Town City
Manager, City Council may appoint an individual to serve as the interim
Director and Chair of the Board of Directors in the place and stead of the Ex
Officio Director (the "Interim Director and Chair") until such time as a City
Manager is duly appointed and has taken the oath of office. Notwithstanding any
other provision to the contrary in this Article
147 and without limitation of who may be appointed, City Council may appoint
any member of City Council or other officer or employee of the City, excluding
any officer or employee of CTUB, as the Interim Director and Chair. City
Council may remove a person serving as Interim Director and Chair at any time
and substitute another person meeting the criteria of this section in such
role.
      (2)   Not less than one (1) Director should possess a professional
background and/or experience in water and/or sewer utilities that would benefit
the Board of Directors. Such background includes but is not limited to:
engineering with a background in water and/or sewer utilities; land
development; construction; accountant; legal; or environmental protection.
      (3)   Not less than one (1) Director shall be a resident of Charles Town
and a ratepayer in the System.
      (4)   Since CTUB has acquired the Ranson sewer system and as such
provides services to the City of Ranson, the City Council will consider the
City of Ranson's recommendation(s) for an individual to serve as one of the
Directors, using the following process:
         A.   The City of Ranson shall have the right to nominate not more than
three (3) individuals who are residents of Ranson and who reside within the
service territory of Ranson; or an individual who is employed by the City of
Ranson, to serve as a Director.
         B.   The City Council may select one (1) of the individuals so
nominated by the process in the preceding paragraph, or the City Council may
request the City of Ranson to nominate not more than three (3) additional
individuals, each of whom shall satisfy all of the preceding paragraph's
criteria, who have not previously been so nominated, for consideration by the
City Council to serve as Director for the current vacancy.
         C.   Although the City Council is not obligated to appoint any of the
nominees as Director using the above method, it is the intention of this
section to provide a seat on the Board of Directors that best represents the
interests of the City of Ranson. City Council retains the discretion to appoint
a Director at will if a suitable nominee is not presented.
      (5)   Since CTUB has acquired the Jefferson County Public Service
District (JCPSD) system and as such provides services to those areas previously
serviced by the JCPSD, the City Council will consider the Jefferson County
Commission's ("Commission") recommendation(s) for an individual to serve as one
of the Directors, using the following process:
         A.   The Commission shall have the right to nominate not more than
three (3) individuals to serve as a Director, each of whom shall satisfy all
ofthe following criteria:
            1.   Resident of Jefferson County, West Virginia;
            2.   Customer of the CTUB served by the assets of the former JCPSD
Sewer System, or extensions thereof; and
            3.   Customer of the CTUB paying the same prevailing sewer rate
charged to the customers of the former JCPSD Sewer System.
         B.   The City Council may select one (1) of the individuals so
nominated by the process in the preceding paragraph, or the City Council may
request the Commission to nominate not more than three (3) additional
individuals, each of whom shall satisfy all of the preceding paragraph's
criteria, who have not previously been so nominated, for consideration by the
City Council to serve as Director for the current vacancy.
         C.   Although the City Council is not obligated to appoint any of the
nominees as Director using the above method, it is the intention of this
section to provide a seat on the Board of Directors that best represents the
interests of Jefferson County residents who are former JCPSD rate payers and
are currently served by CTUB. City Council retains the discretion to appoint a
Director at will if a suitable nominee is not presented.
         D.   The Commission shall then have the right to appoint an individual
to serve as the County Liaison ("Liaison") to the Board of Directors, the
identity of which individual shall be at the sole and exclusive discretion of
the Commission, and such individual as Liaison:
            1.   Shall not be voting member of the Board of Directors, nor have
the right to make or second any motion at a meeting of the Board of Directors;
            2.   Shall have the right to engage in all discussion and debate at
meetings of the Board of Directors, with the exception of any executive session
under W.V. Code Section 6-9A-l, et seq., as would any Director, and such right
to engage in discussion and debate of the Board of Directors shall not be
limited as would a member of the public; and
            3.   Shall receive all notices of meetings and documents and other
materials provided to the Board of Directors either in anticipation of, or
prior to, any meeting of the Directors, except to the extent any such documents
or other materials relate to, or are in connection with, any issue which could
be considered in executive session by the Board of Directors pursuant to W.V.
Code Section 6-9A-1, et seq.

dollars ($150.00) per month, and in addition, shall be reimbursed for any and

   Only a defendant who has been charged with an offense for which a period of
confinement in jail may be imposed is entitled to a trial by jury. If a
municipal court judge determines, upon demand of a defendant, to conduct a

plan, and may on its own motion or by petition, waive, modify, or convert the
outstanding fines, forfeitures, or restitution to community service in an

property and well-being caused by the convicted party.

party and must be paid at the time of conviction. Only the fine can be commuted
via community service.
   (j)   Failure to complete the full amount of community service in the

party to the City of Charles Town and must be paid upon the expiration of the
community service term.

177.05 MASTER LIST.
   (a)   Each Jury Commission must employ either a jury wheel or a jury box.
The choice of employing a jury wheel or jury box is in the discretion of the
Municipal Judge.
   (b)   (1)   If the Municipal Judge chooses to employ a jury wheel, the Jury

or ordered by the Municipal Judge to be placed in the jury wheel or jury box.
In October of each even-numbered year the jury wheel or jury box shall be
emptied and refilled as prescribed in this article: Provided, that the Jury
Commission shall take measures to ensure that a sufficient number of jurors has
been drawn from the earlier jury wheel or jury box before it is emptied to
provide jurors for all jury panels until the jury wheel or jury box is refilled
and additional jurors may be drawn therefrom; and those jurors drawn from the
former wheel or box shall remain eligible as jurors until the last day of
December of that year, and if drawn for a particular jury which has not
finished hearing or deciding the matter before it by the last day of December
of that year, such person shall remain eligible as a juror for that particular
unfinished case until such case is finished or the juror is otherwise
discharged as provided by law.
   (c)   The names or identifying numbers of prospective jurors to be placed in
the jury wheel or jury box shall be selected by the Jury Commission at random
from the master list in the following manner; the total number of names on the
master list shall be divided by the number of names to be placed in the jury
wheel or jury box and the whole number next greater than the quotient shall be
the "key number", except that the key number shall never be less than two. A
"starting number" for making the selection shall then be determined by a random
method from the numbers from one to the key number, both inclusive. The
required number of names shall then be selected from the master list by taking
in order the first name on the master list corresponding to the starting number

required number of names has been selected. Upon recommencing at the start of
the list, or if additional names are subsequently to be selected for the master
jury wheel or jury box, names previously selected from the master list shall be
disregarded in selecting the additional names. The Jury Commission is not
required to, but may, use an electronic or mechanical system or device in
carrying out its duties.
   (d)   Prior to implementing the procedure described in subsection (c), the
Commission shall strike from the master list names of all those persons who
have served as jurors in the preceding two years.
177.07 DRAWINGS; NOTICE OF DUTY; QUALIFICATION FORMS.
   (a)   The Municipal Judge shall provide by order rules relating to the
random drawing by the Jury Commission of panels from the jury wheel or jury box
for juries in Municipal Court. Upon receipt of the direction and in the manner
prescribed by the Court, the Jury Commission shall publicly draw at random from
the jury wheel or jury box the number of jurors specified.
   (b)   If a jury is ordered to be drawn, the Clerk thereafter shall cause
each person drawn for jury service to be served not less than thirty days
before the date for which the persons are to report for jury duty with a
summons either personally or by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, addressed to the person at their usual residence, business or post
office address, requiring them to report for jury service at a specified time
and place.
   (c)   If the summons provided in subsection (b) hereof is served by
registered or certified mail, the Clerk shall also serve in the same mail with
the summons a juror qualification form accompanied by instructions to fill out
and return the form by mail to the Clerk within ten days after its receipt. If
the summons provided in subsection (b) hereof is served personally, such
service shall also include a like juror qualification form with similar
instructions to complete and return the form. The juror qualification form is
subject to approval by the Municipal Judge as to matters of form and shall
elicit the name, address of residence, sex, race and age of the prospective
juror and whether the prospective juror:
      (1)   Is a citizen of the United States and a resident of the City;
      (2)   Is able to read, speak and understand the English language;
      (3)   Has any physical or mental disability substantially impairing the

declaration that the responses are true to the best of the prospective juror's
knowledge and an acknowledgement that a willful misrepresentation of a material
fact may be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
or imprisonment for not more than thirty days, or both. Notarization of the
juror qualification form shall not be required. If the prospective juror is
unable to fill out the form, another person may do it for the prospective juror
and indicate that such person has done so and the reason therefor. If it
appears there is an omission, ambiguity or error in a returned form, the Clerk
shall again send the form with instructions to the prospective juror to make
the necessary addition, clarification or correction and return the form to the
Clerk within ten days after its second receipt.
   (d)   Any prospective juror who fails to return a completed juror
qualification form as instructed shall be directed by the Jury Commission to
appear forthwith before the Clerk to fill out the juror qualification form. At
the time of the prospective juror's appearance for jury service, or at the time
of any interview before the Court or Clerk, any prospective juror may be
required to fill out another juror qualification form in the presence of the
Court or Clerk, at which time the prospective juror may be questioned, but only
with regard to the responses to questions contained on the form and ground for
the prospective juror's excuse or disqualification. Any information thus
acquired by the Court or Clerk shall be noted on the juror qualification form.
   (e)   A prospective juror who fails to appear as directed by the Commission
pursuant to subsection (b) hereof shall be ordered by the Court to appear and
show cause for failure to appear as directed. If the prospective juror fails to
appear pursuant to the Court's order or fails to show good cause for failure to
appear as directed by the Jury Commission, such prospective juror is guilty of
civil contempt and shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   (f)   Any person who willfully misrepresents a material fact on a juror
qualification form or during any interview described in subsection (b) hereof
for the purpose of avoiding or securing service as a juror, shall be fined not
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisoned not more than thirty
days, or both.
177.08 DISQUALIFICATION FROM JURY SERVICE.
   (a)   The Court, upon request of the Jury Commission or a prospective juror
or on its own initiative, shall determine on the basis of information provided
on the juror qualification form or interview with the prospective juror or
other competent evidence whether the prospective juror is disqualified for jury
service. The Clerk shall enter this determination in the space provided on the
juror qualification form and on the alphabetical lists of names drawn from the
jury wheel or jury box.
   (b)   A prospective juror is disqualified to serve on a jury if the
prospective juror:
      (1)   Is not a citizen of the United States, at least eighteen years old
and a resident of the City;
      (2)   Is unable to read, speak and understand the English language;
      (3)   Is incapable, by reason of substantial physical or mental

its discretion;
      (4)   Has served as a municipal, magistrate, petit or grand juror within

shall be entitled to the additional defense that he/she did not own the real
estate at the time of the commission of the violation or that the violation was

areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere with the public
convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
   (b)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of police
officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and areas

interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
   (d)   The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for which

obstruction of the street on a regular basis.
 
   (c)   The Chief of Police may require signs and other notice to the public
to be furnished by the person or organization blocking or obstructing such
street.
 
   (d)   The permit may be refused or cancelled if:

interfere with the public convenience and safe use of the streets and highways.
      (2)   The blockage or obstruction require the diversion of a great number
of police officers and other assets of the City so as to deny normal police
protection to the Municipality or to financially burden the Municipality.

movement of police vehicles, firefighting equipment or ambulance service to
other areas of the Municipality.
      (4)   The blockage or obstruction would unreasonably interfere with other

313.01 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   The driver of any vehicle shall obey the instructions of any official
traffic control device applicable thereto placed in accordance with the
provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible

does not state that signs are required, such section shall be effective even
though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.

313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at

section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may

permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.

333.011 PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM.
   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,
without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, shall
defer further proceedings and impose probation, when:
         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)    In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision
of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5 has been charged;
      (2)    If the person holders a commercial driver’s license or operates
commercial motor vehicles;

motor vehicle revoked for any offense under a municipal ordinance of this state
or any other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state
which has the same elements as an offense described in this article; or
      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.
   (h)   A person prosecuted for an offense under Section
333.01(c), whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of this
section, shall be required to pay the amount of court costs that could be
assessed against a person convicted of the offense. Payment of such costs may
be made a condition of probation. The costs assessed pursuant to this
subsection, whether as a term of probation or not, shall be distributed as
other court costs in accordance with West Virginia Code 50-3-2; 14-2A-4; 30-29-
4; and 62-5-2, 62-5-7 and 62-5-10.

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.

   (c)   A person may not tamper with or modify an electric bicycle so as to
change the motor-powered speed capability or motor engagement between pedal-
assist and throttle-assist types of engagement. If a motor on an electric

provisions of this subsection are not applicable to a modified electric bicycle
operated solely and exclusively on a person’s own property.

multiuse trail, or single-use trail unless it is within a highway or roadway:

from the acts for which the person is convicted.
 
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
 
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
 
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and

neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.

becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
 
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

531.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the finding of the City Council that there should exist an effective
and prompt means of deterring the recreational use of marijuana within the City
of Charles Town by means of local enforcement and prosecution. And, therefore,
while the City Council has determined that more serious drug offenses should
continue to be prosecuted under state and federal statutes, the simple
possession of less than 15 grams of marijuana is within the proper scope of
local enforcement and should therefore be the subject of a City Ordinance.
(Ord. 01-10. Passed 6-4-01.)

01-10. Passed 6-4-01.)

532.01  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Attempt. A person is guilty of an attempt to commit a crime if, acting
with the kind of culpability otherwise required for commission of the crime,
(s)he:
      (1)   Purposely engages in conduct which would constitute the crime if
the attendant circumstances were as a reasonable person would believe them to
be;
      (2)   When causing a particular result is an element of the crime, does
or omits to do anything with the purpose of causing such result without further
conduct on his/her part; or
      (3)   Purposely does or omits to do anything which, under the
circumstances as a reasonable person would believe them to be, is an act or
omission constituting a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to
culminate in his/her commission of the crime.
   (b)   “Conduct” Which may be Held a Substantial Step Under Subsection (a)
(3). Conduct shall not be held to constitute a substantial step under
subsection (a)(3) of this section unless it is strongly corroborative of the
actor’s criminal purpose.
   (c)   “Conduct” Designed to Aid Another in Commission of a Crime. A person
who engages in conduct designed to aid another to commit a crime which would
establish his/her complicity if the crime were committed by such other person
is guilty of an attempt to commit the crime.
   (d)   Renunciation of Criminal Purpose.
      (1)   When the actor’s conduct would otherwise constitute an attempt
under subsection (a)(2) or (a)(3) of this section, it is an affirmative defense
which (s)he must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that (s)he abandoned
his/her efforts to commit the crime or otherwise prevented its commission,
under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary renunciation of his/
her criminal purpose. The establishment of such defense does not, however,
affect the liability of an accomplice who did not join in such abandonment or
preventions.
      (2)   Within the meaning of this article, renunciation of criminal
purpose is not voluntary if it is motivated, in whole or in part, by
circumstances, not present or apparent at the inception of the actor’s course
of conduct, which increase the probability of detection or apprehension or
which make more difficult the accomplishment of the criminal purpose.
Renunciation is not complete if it is motivated by a decision to postpone the
criminal conduct until a more advantageous time or to transfer the criminal
effort to another but similar objective or victim. Renunciation is also not
complete if mere abandonment is insufficient to accomplish avoidance of the
offense in which case the actor must have taken further and affirmative steps
that prevented the commissions thereof.
   (e)   Public Place. “Public place” means any place in which the public has
access, including but not limited to a public street, road, thoroughfare,
sidewalk, bridge, alley, plaza, park, recreation or shopping area, public
transportation facility, vehicle used for public transportation, parking lot,
public library or any other public building, structure, or area.
   (f)   Controlled Substance and Deliver/Delivery. The following terms shall
have the meanings set forth in W.Va. Code Section 60A-1-101, which code
definitions, as may from time to time be amended, are hereby adopted and
incorporated herein:
      (1)   “Controlled Substances” (See West Virginia Code Section 60A-1-101
(d)).
      (2)   “Deliver” or “delivery” (See West Virginia Code Section 60A-1-101
(g)).
         (Ord. 2000-12. Passed 5-15-00.)
532.02 UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY; DISORDERLY PERSONS OFFENSE.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, whether on foot or in a motor vehicle,
to: wander, remain or prowl in a public place with the purpose of unlawfully
obtaining or distributing a controlled substance or controlled substance
analog; and engage in conduct that, under the circumstances, manifests a
purpose to obtain or distribute a controlled substance or controlled substance
analog. It shall not be a defense to the prohibitions of this section that the
accused attempted but was unsuccessful in accomplishing the criminal purpose.
   (a)   A person, whether on foot or in a motor vehicle, commits a disorderly
person offense, if (s)he wanders, remains or prowls in a public place with the
purpose of unlawfully obtaining or distributing a controlled substance or
controlled substance analog; and engages in conduct that, under the
circumstances, manifests a purpose to obtain or distribute a controlled
substance or controlled substance analog.
   (b)   Conduct that may, if warranted under the circumstances, be deemed
adequate to manifest a purpose to obtain or distribute a controlled substance
or controlled substance analog includes, but is not limited to conduct such as
the following:
      (1)   Repeatedly beckoning to or stopping pedestrians or motorists in a
public place;
      (2)   Repeatedly passing objects to or receiving objects from pedestrians
or motorists in public place;
      (3)   Repeatedly circling in a public place in a motor vehicle and on one
or more occasions passing any object to or receiving any object from a person
in a public place.
   (c)   The element of the offense described in subsection (b)(1) of this
section may not be established solely by proof that the actor engaged in the
conduct that is used to satisfy the element described in subsection (b)(2)
hereof.
      (Ord. 2000-12. Passed 5-15-00.)
532.99 PENALTY.
   Any person who shall violate the provisions of this article shall, for the
first such offense, be subject to a fine of up to five hundred dollars
($500.00). A subsequent second offense in violation of the provisions of this
article shall be punishable by a fine of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000)

   (c)   Breach of Peace; Detention. An act of shoplifting as defined herein,
is hereby declared to constitute a breach of peace and any owner of

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting. Such reasonable

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not

   (c)   "Concealed" means hidden from ordinary observation so as to prevent

or death.

transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms "metallic or false knuckles" includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.

741.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; PURPOSE.
   Council hereby finds that in order to provide essential Municipal services,
City revenue needs require the imposition of the following license taxes upon
the businesses and commercial ventures listed in this article.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.02 DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Except where otherwise defined in this article, businesses,
occupations, trades, commercial ventures and terms of art used in Sections
741.14 through
741.27 have those meanings given them in the West Virginia Code, as amended and
in force on January 1, 1970.
   (b)   Except as otherwise defined in this article, terms, phrases,
occupations, trades, commercial ventures and terms of art used in sections of
this article other than those referred to in subsection (a) hereof shall have
the meaning given to them in the West Virginia Code, as amended and currently
in force and, when there is more than one such meaning, they shall have the
meaning given in the sections of the West Virginia Code imposing any State
license tax correlative to the City's license tax.
   (c)   "Fee" and "tax" may be used interchangeably to refer to the charges
imposed under this article.
   (d)   "Person" includes, wherever the context will permit, not only natural
persons, but all other legal entities such as partnerships, corporations,
business trusts and the like.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.03 PAYMENT AND TERM OF LICENSE.
    Except as otherwise specified in this article, the entirety of any license
fee designated as an annual fee shall be billed on or about June 1 in each
year, and shall be paid within thirty days of the bill being sent. All annual
licenses provided for by this article shall be issued for a term of one year
beginning on July 1 and ending on the next succeeding June 30. Biennial
licenses shall be issued for a term of two years, commencing on July 1 and
ending on June 30 two years after the initial license date. Where licenses of
other periods are authorized by this article, they shall be of such duration,
and shall begin and end on such dates, as the City Treasurer may provide; but
the City Treasurer shall select such dates as State law requires, if any, for
any correlative State licenses, certificates or permits.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.04 FEES TO CONSTITUTE DEBTS DUE THE CITY.
   The fees provided for in this article shall constitute debts due to the City
and may be collected by the City Treasurer by an appropriate action in either
the circuit courts or magistrate courts of West Virginia.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.05 APPLICABILITY; NONTRANSFERABILITY.
   Except where otherwise expressly provided herein, the fees provided for
herein apply to any person undertaking the herein described activities, trades
or professions for any part, no matter how small, of a given time period in
which the fee is imposed. Except where otherwise expressly provided herein, the
licenses provided for in this article are not transferable; that is, the
payment by one person of a license fee provided for in this article shall not
exempt or excuse a purchaser from, a successor to, or assignee of, any such
person from the payment of the prescribed fee for the maintenance or possession
of a particular license for the conduct of a particular activity. The licenses
provided for herein are nontransferable personal privileges. The fees provided
for in this article apply only to persons engaging in the specified acts,
having the specified ownership, or carrying on the specified operation or
conduct of a trade or business where the foregoing are located within the
geographic limits of the City.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.06 EFFECT OF IMPOSITION OF LICENSE TAX.
   In every case where this article imposes a license tax or fee, it shall be
deemed that a license is required to perform the activity at each location
within the City and that a license can and must be issued by the City Treasurer
with respect to that activity at each location within the City, but only upon
payment of the requisite fee and completion of the requisite application. The
imposition of a license tax by this article shall mean that the payment of the
tax is a prerequisite to the lawful conduct of the activity upon which the tax
is imposed, at each location within the City.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.07 ACTS PROHIBITED.
   Whenever a license tax is imposed by this article, no person shall engage in
the activity or occupation upon which the fee is levied, nor own or operate any
device upon which the fee is levied, without first paying the tax and acquiring
the license provided for under this article.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.08 EFFECT OF LICENSE.
   In any case in which a license is required by this article, the issuance of
the license shall be deemed a prerequisite to the lawful conduct of the
activity for which the license is required. Issuance of any license under this
article shall not, however, make valid or legal any act not otherwise valid or
legal or not otherwise authorized by other provisions of law. Nothing in this
article shall authorize any act, activity or ownership not otherwise lawful.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.09 DUTIES AND POWERS OF CITY TREASURER.
   The City Treasurer shall have the power to prepare application forms for any
licenses required under this article. The application may contain questions on
or blanks for any information reasonably deemed necessary by the City
Treasurer. The City Treasurer is expressly authorized to require applicants to
have, and to provide evidence of, a valid and existing West Virginia Business
Franchise Registration Certificate. Proper completion of an application is a
condition precedent to the City Treasurer having any duty to issue a license.
Upon proper completion of a license application and payment of the requisite
fee, the City Treasurer shall issue the requested license to the applicant. The
form of the license and information thereon shall be such as the City Treasurer
may reasonably prescribe. The City Treasurer, or his designated agent, shall
have the power to examine activities and locations of each business to
determine compliance with this article. (Ord. 2024-09. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.10 LICENSE FEES CUMULATIVE.
   The license fees imposed in this article are cumulative and the imposition
of any one fee does not preclude the imposition of other fees upon any one
individual or entity. The fees imposed by this article are imposed for engaging
in certain trades or activities, or for the use or possession of certain
devices. The pursuit of a particular trade or activity, or the ownership or use
of a particular device, shall not excuse a person or entity from the
requirement for a license and payment of a license fee for each such activity
or device for which, if engaged in or possessed singly, a license requirement
and license fee would be imposed.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.11 CHANGE IN NAME OR PARTNERS.
   A change in the name under which a person does business shall not require
the person to seek, any new license for any activity licensed under a prior
name; nor shall the withdrawal or addition of partners to a partnership require
the partnership to obtain a new license, provided that the partnership always
retains at least one partner who was a member of the firm at the time the
license was granted. (Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.12 OTHER TAXES.
   The City Treasurer may refuse to issue any license required by this article
to any person, firm or corporation delinquent in the payment of any tax or fee
due the City under any ordinance or tariff until such delinquent tax or fee is
paid.
(Ord. 2024-009. Passed 11-18-24.)
741.13 DISPLAY OF CERTIFICATE.
   The licenses provided for in this article shall be evidenced by license
certificates. The holder of a license shall display the license certificate in
a prominent place at or near the location of the licensed activity or device,
and shall make the license certificate available for inspection by City police,
the City Treasurer or his designated agent.

days from the date of filing the petition, unless continued by agreement of the

thirty (30) days after the date it sold out its business or stock of goods, or
quit business, and its successor in business shall be required to withhold a
sufficient amount of the purchase money to cover the amount of such tax,
interest and penalty due and unpaid until such time as the former owner shall
produce a receipt from the treasurer showing that all tax, interest and penalty
has been paid. If the purchaser of a business or stock of goods fails to
withhold purchase money as hereby provided, and the tax, interest and penalty
shall be due and unpaid after the thirty-day period allowed, the successor
shall be personally liable for the payment of the tax, interest and penalty
accrued and unpaid on account of the operation of the business by the former

permittee fails or refuses to file any return required hereby or fails or
refuses to pay any delinquent tax, interest or penalty due and owing to the
municipality.
   (b)   In the event of such a revocation or denial, the treasurer will
provide written notice to the affected person at least five (5) days prior to

revocation/ denial review meeting, the general grounds of said contemplated
action, and shall advise the affected person of its rights to appear at said
hearing in person and represented by legal counsel, and to be heard orally upon
the merits of the person's defense. The treasurer may request legal advice from
the City Attorney, and adopt such procedures for its decorum and the dispatch
of business at such hearings as the treasurer may regard advisable. The
revocation decision of the treasurer will be final.
   (c)   Each license or permit that has been revoked or denied pursuant to
this section may be issued or re-issued upon payment of all delinquent tax,
interest or penalty due and owing to the municipality and satisfaction of all
relevant licensing conditions otherwise imposed by the municipality. (Ord.

745.31 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND COMPROMISES.
   The treasurer, with approval of the City Manager, is authorized to enter
into an agreement in writing with any person relating to the liability of such
person in respect of the tax, interest and penalty imposed by this article for

745.32 ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS CONCERNING CONTRACTING.
   (a)   Without limiting the generality of the administrative and collection
powers granted to the treasurer in this article, the treasurer is also
empowered to require any person engaging or continuing within the municipality
in the business of contracting to furnish a list of the names, addresses and
amounts paid by them to any subcontractors employed and suppliers of materials
used upon any job or to do any work within the municipality. The treasurer may
also require every person engaging or continuing within the municipality in the
business of contracting who is a nonresident of the State to pay or guarantee
the payment of the amount of the tax imposed by this article for the privilege
of engaging in the business of contracting within the municipality, such
payment of such tax to be based upon the amount of the building permit issued
by the municipality for the work to be performed by such person, as a condition
precedent to the issuance of such building permit. In lieu of such prior
payment in cash of such tax any such nonresident may guarantee the payment of
such privilege tax provided for herein by delivering to the municipality a
bond, with good and adequate surety, payable to the municipality, and
conditioned to pay such tax on or before the estimated date of the completion
of the work to be performed by such person within the municipality.
   (b)   Any person engaging a contractor or subcontractor within this
municipality shall withhold payment in sufficient amount to cover taxes
assessed by this article in the final settlement of such contracts until the
receipt of a certificate from the treasurer to the effect that all taxes levied
and accrued under this article against the contractor have been paid. If any
person fails to withhold as provided herein and the contractor or subcontractor
fails to timely pay such tax, such person shall be personally liable for the
payment of such taxes, and the same shall be recoverable by the treasurer by
appropriate legal proceedings.
(Ord. 2024-007. Passed 9-16-24.)
745.33 CLAIMS FOR REFUND OR CREDIT.
   (a)   Any taxpayer claiming to have overpaid any tax, interest or penalty
imposed by this article shall file its claim with the treasurer within three
(3) years after the due date of the return in respect of which the tax was
imposed, and not thereafter.
   (b)   If, as a result of the claim, the treasurer shall be of the opinion
that the tax, interest or penalty, or any part thereof, was overpaid, the
treasurer shall refund the same to the taxpayer. If the treasurer denies the
claim, the taxpayer may within thirty (30) days after notice of denial file
with the treasurer a petition for refund or credit, which shall be heard in
accordance with Section
745.27 of this article. A taxpayer's failure to abide by express procedures
contained in this section precludes taxpayer's right to any refund or credit of
tax, interest and penalties paid or collected under this article. (Ord. 2024-
007. Passed 9-16-24.)
745.34 INTEREST AND PENALTY; CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   If any person, as required by this article, fails to complete and
submit their semi-annual tax return, or submits their tax return after the due
date, or submits their tax return but fails to remit in whole the proper amount
of tax owed, to the appropriate municipal authorities, then there shall be
added to the amount of tax owed and unpaid, from the date such tax should have
been paid, a penalty in the amount of twenty-five (25.00%) percent of the tax
due for the period of such failure or delinquency. In addition, such tax and
penalty shall bear an interest at the rate of twelve percent (12.00%) per annum
from the due date of the payment until paid. Whoever engages in any activity
contrary to the provisions of this article shall, in addition to paying the
tax, penalty, and interest imposed by this article, be subject to a fee of
fifty dollars ($50.00) for each month or fraction thereof during in which that
person has been in default of filing and/or remitting to the municipality taxes
due including penalties and interest. This fee will not exceed $250.00 for any
semi-annual tax reporting period. It shall be the duty of the treasurer to
collect the full amount of the tax, penalty, interest, and fee(s) imposed. The
person(s) responsible for remitting the tax, after all required taxes,
penalties, and interest, less the accrued fees, have been paid in full, may for
good cause shown, request that the municipality waive the penalty, interest,
and fees owed in whole or in part. The municipality may waive the penalty,
interest, and fees owed in whole or in part upon the recommendation of the
municipality's Finance Committee. The City Manager may grant a fifteen (15) day
grace period for delinquent zero return filings. After the grace period has
expired the City Manager may waive the fees for returns with zero balances.
Repeat waiver requests within a three year period will not be considered.
 
   (b)   Interest and penalties may be collected in the same manner as the tax
imposed by this article.
   (c)   Any person who shall willfully, and with intent to evade, refuse to
pay all or any part of the tax imposed by this article shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor. If the amount of the unpaid tax shall be less than one thousand
dollars ($1,000), such person shall, in addition to such tax, penalties and
interest as is owed, be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) nor
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), and if the amount of the unpaid tax
shall be one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, such person shall, in addition
to such tax, penalties and interest as is owed, be fined not less than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000), or
imprisoned not more than thirty days, or be both fined and imprisoned as herein
provided. Each day or part thereof that any violation continues shall be deemed
to constitute a distinct and separate offense and be punishable accordingly.
   (d)   Whoever knowingly makes a false statement in any tax form or
application shall be fined not less than two hundred dollars ($200.00) nor more
than one thousand dollars ($1,000). Each false statement, whether made with or
without other false statements on any one or more applications shall constitute
a separate offense. And, whoever shall knowingly make a false statement in two
separate "tax filings", whether or not said applications shall have been filed
consecutively, and whether or not said person shall have been previously
convicted thereof, shall be fined not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00)
nor more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) and imprisoned not more than six
months, or both. (Ord. 2024-007. Passed 9-16-24.)
745.35 SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of this article is held unconstitutional or invalid, on its
face or as applied, the remaining provisions of this article shall remain in
full force and effect; and to this end, the provisions of this article are
declared to be severable.

Will Absorb Tax; Accounting By Hotel.
      (1)   The consumer shall pay to the hotel operator the amount of tax
imposed by the City, which tax shall be added to and shall constitute a part of
the consideration paid for the use and occupancy of the hotel room, and which
tax shall be collectible as such by the hotel operator who shall account for,
and remit to the City, all taxes paid by consumers. The hotel operator may
commingle tax collected hereunder with the proceeds of the rental of hotel
accommodations. The City's claim shall be enforceable against, and shall be
superior to, all other claims against the moneys so commingled excepting only
claims of the State for moneys held by the hotel pursuant to the provisions of
West Virginia Code 11-15. All taxes collected pursuant to the provisions of
this article shall be deemed to be held in trust by the hotel until the same
shall have been remitted to the taxing authority as hereinafter provided.
      (2)    A hotel or hotel operator shall not represent to the public in any
manner, directly or indirectly, that it will absorb all or any part of the tax
or that the tax is not to be considered an element in the price to be collected
from the consumer.
   (b)    Collection of Tax When Sale on Credit. A hotel operator doing
business wholly or partially on a credit basis shall require the consumer to
pay the full amount of tax due upon a credit sale at the time such sale is made

voluntary or compulsory, in receivership, bankruptcy or otherwise, of the
property or estate of any person, all taxes due and unpaid authorized under
this article shall be paid from first money available for distribution in
priority to all claims and liens except taxes and debts due to the United
States which under federal law are given priority over the debts and liens
created by municipal ordinance or order of the County Commission for this tax
and taxes and debts due to the State of West Virginia. Any person charged with
the administration or distribution of any such property or estate who shall
violate the provisions of this section shall be personally liable for any taxes
accrued and unpaid which are chargeable against the person whose property or
estate is in administration or distribution.
   (d)   Failure to Collect or Remit Tax; Liability of Hotel Operator. If any
hotel operator fails to collect the tax authorized by this article and levied
pursuant to this article or shall fail to properly remit such tax to the taxing
authority, he shall be personally liable for such amount as he failed to
collect or remit; provided, that such hotel operator shall not be held liable
for failure to collect such tax if the hotel operator can by good and
substantial evidence prove the refusal of the purchaser to pay this tax despite
the diligent effort in good faith of the hotel operator to collect the tax.
(Passed 12-4-06.)
   (e)   Total Amount Collected to be Remitted. No profit shall accrue to any
person as
a result of the collection of the tax authorized under this article.
Notwithstanding that the total amount of such taxes collected by a hotel
operator may be in excess of the amount for which a consumer would be liable by
the application of the levy of six percent (6%) for the occupancy of a hotel
room or rooms, the total amount of all taxes collected by any hotel operator
shall be remitted to the taxing authority as hereinafter provided.
(Passed 7-1-08.)
   (f)   Tax Return and Payment.  
      (1)   The tax authorized by this article shall be due and payable in
monthly installments on or before the fifteenth day of the calendar month next
succeeding the month in which the tax accrued, provided, that the credit in
which the tax authorized by this article is not collected by the hotel operator
at the time of such sales, such tax shall not, for purposes of this article, be
regarded as having accrued until the date on which it is either received by the
hotel operator or upon the expiration of the thirty day payment period set
forth in subsection (c) hereof, whichever shall first occur. The hotel operator
shall, on or before the fifteenth day of each month, prepare and deliver to the
Treasurer of the City of Charles Town a return for the preceding month, in the
form prescribed by Council. Such form shall include all information necessary
for the computation, collection and subsequent distribution of the tax as the
City may require. A remittance for the amount of the tax due shall accompany
each return. Each return shall be signed by the hotel operator or his duly
authorized agent.
      (2)    For the first month that the tax is delinquent, there shall be
assessed by the Treasurer a penalty in the amount of five percent (5%) of the
tax due for the delinquent period. For each additional month that the tax
remains delinquent, there shall be further assessed an additional one percent
(1%) penalty per month until the tax is paid. No payment for a subsequent
period shall be collected until all prior delinquent taxes have been paid in
full with all penalties assessed thereto.
   (g)    Special Rule For Taxes Due in Amounts Less Than $10.00 Per Month. In
the event that the tax due for any reporting period is less than ten dollars
($10.00), the reporting requirements as stated under subsection (f) hereof are
hereby waived and no reporting shall be required until such time that the tax
liability exceeds ten dollars ($10.00).

complete and accurate records of taxable sales and of charges, together with a
record of the tax collected thereon, and shall keep all invoices and other
pertinent documents in such form as the taxing authority may require. Such
records and other documents shall be preserved for a period of not less than
three years, unless the taxing authority shall consent in writing to their
destruction within
that period or shall require that they be kept for a longer period.
   (i)   Liability of Officers. If the taxpayer is an association or
corporation, the officer thereof actually participating in the management or
operation of the association or corporation shall be personally liable, jointly
and severally, for any default on the part of the association or corporation;

921.02 GENERAL.
   (a)   This article has been enacted in compliance with requirements of the
United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the West Virginia
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) and the West Virginia Public
Service Commission (PSC).
   (b)   In accordance with EPA requirements this article shall be reviewed no
less often than every two years. Particular items to be included in the review
include the wastewater contribution of customers and customer classes and the
total cost of operation and maintenance of the wastewater facilities. As a
result of the review Council shall revise the effective rates and charges to
accomplish the following:
      (1)   Maintain the proportionate distribution of operation and
maintenance costs among customers and customer classes;
      (2)   Generate sufficient revenue to pay the total operation and
maintenance costs necessary to the proper operation and maintenance (including
replacement) of the wastewater facilities; and
      (3)   Apply excess revenues collected from a class of customers to the
costs of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next year
and adjust rates accordingly.
   (c)   In general, sewer service charges shall be based upon the volume of
water delivered to the customer's property. This volume is measured by the
water meter serving the premises. In cases where a significant volume of the
water delivered to the premises is not returned to the sanitary sewer system or
water from another source is discharged to the sanitary sewer system the
customer may request, or the utility may require, special flow measuring
devices to properly measure the volume of waste water entering the sanitary
sewer system. Such special flow measuring devices shall be furnished,
installed, and maintained by and at the expense of the customer with the
approval of the utility. In some situations suitable formulae may be used to
determine waste water flow in lieu of special metering devices. Such formulae
shall be approved by both the customer and the utility and are subject to the
approval of the Commission. All flow meters used in serving bulk or resale
customers shall be owned and operated by the utility providing service to the
bulk or resale customer. (Passed 3-5-07.)

(Passed 3-5-07.)
921.04  CUSTOMER RELATIONS.
   (a)   Information as to Service. Each utility shall, upon request, give its
customers such information and assistance as is reasonable, in order that
customers may enjoy safe and efficient service.
   (b)   Explanation of Computing Bills. Each utility shall adopt some means of
informing its customers as to the method of computing bills, either by printed
description on its bills, or by a notice to the effect that the method will be
explained at the office of the utility upon request.
   (c)   Explanation of Rates. It shall be the duty of the utility to explain
to the customer at the beginning of service, or whenever the customer shall
request the utility to do so, the utility's rates applicable to the type of
service furnished to the customer and all other classes of customers, and to
assist him in obtaining the best rate for his service requirements. The
responsibility for the selection, however, rests with the applicant. In the
event the customer's use of service changes such that a rate schedule other
than the one initially selected becomes favorable, the responsibility for
requesting a change in rate schedule, consistent with the provisions of the
service agreement, shall rest with the customer. The utility shall, on its
periodic statements, annually inform its customers that, if they so request, it
shall supply them with a copy of the utility's rate or rates applicable to the
type of service to be furnished to all classes of customers with a concise
written explanation of the rates, and an identification of any classes of
customer for whom rates are not summarized.

each utility shall publicize by newspaper or bill insert to its customers its
collection agents to whom customers may deliver payment of sewer bills.
   (e)   Application for Sewer Service.
      (1)   All applicants desiring sewer service may be required to make
written application at the office of the utility on printed forms provided
therefore setting forth in said application all purposes for which sewer will
be used upon their premises. The utility may require the applicant to provide
identification at the time of application for service. All applicants for
service shall be required to designate on every application for service whether
the applicant is a tenant or an owner of the premises to be served. If the
applicant is a tenant, he shall state the name and address of the owner or
owners of the premises to be served.
      (2)   Any change in the identity of the contracting customer at a
premises will require a new application for sewer service, and the utility may,
after reasonable notice, discontinue sewer service until such new application
has been made and accepted, but the former customer shall remain liable for
sewer service furnished to said premises until he has given notice in writing
to the utility to discontinue sewer service. In the event the customer of
record has died or has become incapable of being responsible for sewer service,
that individual’s spouse may become the customer of record without being
required to complete a new application for sewer service, or paying a new
deposit.
      (3)   In the event that a publicly or privately owned water utility,
city, incorporated town, other municipal corporation or other public service
district, owns and operates water facilities within the same service territory
as the public service district providing sewer service to the area, then the
sewer public service district shall provide the customer with a proper receipt
and shall instruct the customer to present said receipt to the water utility
when application for water service is made.
         (Passed 3-5-07.)
921.05 CUSTOMER SERVICE PIPES.
   (a)   No customer, plumber, company owner or any agent shall connect to the
utility's main or to any utility service pipe, or extend the pipes therefrom to
any premises for the purpose of securing sewer service, until application has
been made therefore to the utility as provided in these rules and permission
for doing so has been granted by the utility in writing.
   (b)   Once an application for service has been granted, the customer shall
install and maintain the customer service pipe.
   (c)   The utility’s authorized employee shall inform the customer of the
location of the point of service. The customer shall install the customer
service pipe to the point of service after which the utility will install the
utility service pipe from the main to the point of service.
   (d)   Where the utility's service pipe is already installed to the point of
service, the customer shall connect with the utility service pipe as installed.
   (e)   The customer service pipe shall be installed in a workmanlike manner,
shall conform to all reasonable rules and regulations of the utility, and shall
be maintained by the customer at his own expense.
   (f)   The utility will specify the size, kind, quality and location of all
materials used in the customer’s service pipe and the customer shall comply
with those specifications. Refer to the City of Charles Town Sewer Standards
and Specifications.
   (g)   A customer must maintain his service pipe in good condition and free
from all leaks and defects, at the customer's cost and expense. A customer’s
failure to comply with this rule may result in termination of water or sewer
service pursuant to these rules.
   (h)   The customer's service pipe shall be laid below the frost line at all
points and shall be placed on firm and continuous earth so as to give
unyielding and permanent support; and be installed in a trench at least two
feet in a horizontal direction from any other trench wherein gas pipe, water
pipe, or other facilities, public or private, are or are to be installed.
   (i)   A customer’s service pipe shall not pass through or across any
premises or property other than that to be served nor across any portion of the
property that could practicably be sold separately from the immediate premises
served and no pipes or plumbing in any premises shall be extended therefrom to
adjacent or other premises.
   (j)   The customer's service pipe and all connections and fixtures attached
thereto shall be subject to the inspection of the utility before use, and all
premises, including any and all fixtures within the said premises, shall at all
reasonable hours be subject to inspection by a duly authorized employee of the
utility.
   (k)   The utility shall make changes and bear the full costs of changes in
the customer's service pipe required due to changes in grade, relocation of
mains, and other causes not related to the customer. The customer shall bear
the full costs of changes in service pipe or meter location desired by the
customer for his or her convenience.
   (l)   The customer shall not attach any fixtures to, or make any branches
in, the customer service pipe between the point of service and the premises
served. Violation of this rule may result in termination of service pursuant to
these rules.
   (m)   The connection of surface drains to the sanitary system is prohibited.
As a means to deter prohibited connections where surface or ground water is
introduced into the sanitary system, the utility may add a surcharge to the
customer's sewer bill where evidence of a violation exists. The surcharge shall
be authorized by separate schedule to the utility's sewer tariff filed pursuant
to the Commission’s Rules for the Construction and Filing of Tariffs, 150CSR2,
but the utility need not file revenue, expense, or other financial data unless
otherwise ordered by the Commission. The charge for roof drains, downspouts,
storm sewers or similar facilities connected to the sanitary sewer system will
be calculated by the formula or rate clearly stated in the tariff, and will not
be cumulative to any metered rate for sewer service. The tariff should further
provide that the surcharge will not be imposed unless and until the customer is
notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery, that
it has been established by smoke testing, dye testing, or on-site inspection
that rain or surface water is being introduced into the sanitary sewer, and
that the customer has thirty (30) days to divert that water from the sanitary
sewer.
(Passed 3-5-07.)
921.06 SEWER USER CHARGES.
   (a)   Rates. Sewer user charges, or rates, are imposed upon and shall be
collected from the owner of each improved property which shall be connected
with the sanitary sewer system, for use of the sewer system, whether such use
shall be direct or indirect. The sewer user charges shall commence and shall be
effective as of the date of connection of each such improved property to the
sewer system, and shall be payable as provided herein, in accordance with the
rate ordinance as adopted by Council.
   (b)   Surcharge for High Strength Users. Users discharging any water or
wastes with a thirty day average BOD in excess of 300 milligrams per liter or a
thirty day average suspended solids content in excess of 300 milligrams per

requiring unusual attention or expense to handle or treat, shall pay, in
addition to the base monthly sewer user charges, an additional surcharge as
determined by the City of Town Utility Board.
(Passed 3-5-07.)
921.07 DEPOSITS FROM CUSTOMERS.
   (a)   Security Deposits for Utilities Other than Public Service Districts. A
utility, other than a public service district, may require the applicant or
customer to make a deposit with it initially, and from time to time, to secure
payment of sewer service rates and charges. Such deposit shall not be more than
one-twelfth (1/12) of the annual estimated charge for residential service and
or one sixth (1/6) of the annual estimated charge for all other service. The
utility shall not be bound to supply sewer service until this condition is
fulfilled. After the customer has paid bills for service for twelve (12)
consecutive months without a delinquency, the utility shall promptly and
automatically refund the deposit plus accrued interest. Calculation of the
above twelve (12) month period shall commence from the first regular payment or
following the payment of a delinquent bill or bills. Interest at the rate as
calculated in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, shall be paid
from the date of deposit until the date of refund of the security deposit. The
utility shall have a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, to
ascertain that the obligations of the customer have been fully performed before
being required to return any deposit in the case where there has not been an
automatic refund.
   (b)   Return of Deposit to Customers Who Are Not Tenants. After a customer
who is not a tenant has paid bills for service for twelve (12) consecutive
months without a delinquency, the utility shall promptly and automatically
refund the deposit plus accrued interest. Calculation of the above twelve (12)
months’ period shall commence from the first regular payment or following the
payment of a delinquent bill or bills.
   (c)   Interest at the rate as determined in accordance with Rule 4.2.a.8.
shall be paid from the date of deposit until the date of refund of the security
deposit. All customer security deposits shall be placed in an interest bearing
account at a local federally insured financial institution. The district shall
have a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty (30) days, to read and remove
meters and to ascertain that the obligations of the customer have been fully
performed before being required to return any deposit in the case where there
has not been an automatic refund.
   (d)   The interest rate to be paid by all sewer utilities other than public
service districts shall be determined as follows. The rate which utilities
shall be required to pay shall be the average of the one-year United States
Treasury Bill rates for October, November and December of the preceding
calendar year. By January 15 of each year, Staff of the Commission shall make
the necessary calculations and file with the Commission its calculations. The
Commission will issue an order setting the rate to be paid by the utilities
until the next annual Commission order. The simple interest shall be paid at
the date of discontinuance of service or at the end of the deposit period.
   (e)   Record of Deposit. Each utility holding a cash deposit shall keep a
record showing: (i) The name and current address of each depositor; (ii) the
amount and date of the deposit; and (iii) each transaction concerning the
deposit.
   (f)   The Receipt. Concurrently with receiving a cash deposit, the utility
shall deliver to the applicant for service, or customer, a receipt showing: (i)
The date thereof; (ii) the name of the applicant or customer and the address of
the premises served or to be served; (iii) the service furnished or to be
furnished; and (iv) the amount of the deposit and the fact that interest will
be paid at a Commission determined rate. Each utility shall provide automatic
means to refund the deposit of a customer, when so entitled, if the original
receipt cannot be produced. A receipt or proof of payment will not be necessary
under the provisions for an automatic refund.
   (g)   Unclaimed Deposits. Should a utility have retained, through no fault
of its own, deposits made by customers whose service has been discontinued
during any calendar year, it shall, on or before the first day of March, in
each year, mail to the customer’s last known address a check as refund of the
deposit plus accrued interest, or at the utility’s option, publish a list of
such depositors in a newspaper published and of general circulation in each of
the county(ies) in which it operates and in which the deposits were made,
showing as of the thirty-first (31st) day of December immediately preceding,
the amount of each such deposit, together with the interest due thereon, and
notifying depositors listed therein that their deposits are being held to their
credit and will be returned upon request. The utility will not be liable for
any interest on such deposits after publication of such lists. Upon completion
of the above procedure, the utility shall follow the provisions of the Uniform
Unclaimed Property Act, codified in the W. Va. Code §36-8-1 et seq., with
regard to the disposition of any unclaimed deposit.
   (h)   This rule shall not affect residential customer security deposits
required by a utility prior to the passage of W. Va. Code §24-3-8 on March 12,
1983.
   (i)   All utilities that collect security deposits must do so in a non-
discriminatory manner. (Passed 3-5-07.)
921.08  BILLING INFORMATION.
   (a)   All bills for sewer service shall state whether the charge is based
upon quantities of water consumed at the premises, flat rate or other charge.
Bills shall be rendered periodically, and if based upon metered water
consumption they shall show the readings of the water meter at the beginning
and end of the period for which the bill is rendered, the date of the water
meter readings, the number of cubic feet or gallons of water supplied, and the
authorized rate. If the utility must, for any reason, render an estimated bill,
the bill shall be clearly marked as an estimated bill. All bills shall state
“This utility is regulated by the Public Service Commission of West Virginia”
and “Rates available upon request.”
   (b)   First and last bills, monthly or quarterly, for sewer service rendered
for periods of five (5) days more or five (5) days less than the normal billing
period, will be computed in accordance with the rate applicable to that
service, by the amount of sewer blocks, and the minimum charge as set forth in
that rate will be prorated on the basis of the number of days in the period in
question, to the total number of days in the normal period.
   (c)   Utilities desiring to adopt mechanical billing of such nature as to
render compliance with all the terms of Rule 4.3.b., impractical, may make
application to the Commission for relief from part of these terms. After
consideration of the reasons given when asking for relief, the Commission may
allow the omission of part of these requirements.
   (d)   On all bills which include charges for items other than authorized
sewer charges, the other factors used in computing the bill shall be clearly
stated so that the amount may be readily verified from the information
appearing upon the bill.
   (e)   Each bill shall bear on its face the latest pay date and the date it
shall be a delinquent bill if not paid. On all current usage billings not paid
in full by the latest pay date, ten percent (10%) will be added to the net
current amount unpaid. This delayed payment penalty is not interest and is to
be collected only once for each bill where it is appropriate.
   (f)   When a utility receives a customer payment at a time when both a
delinquent bill and a current bill are outstanding, the utility will apply the
payment first to the current bill, and apply any leftover amounts to the
delinquency. Provided, that this rule shall not apply to payments from
customers whose delinquencies have been addressed in a deferred payment
agreement. If a termination notice has been issued then the payment should
first be applied to the delinquent amount that is the subject of the
termination notice. (Passed 3-5-07.)
921.09 ADJUSTMENT OF BILLS AND COMPLAINTS.
   (a)   Adjustment of Bills.
      (1)   Fast meters. If the water utility makes a refund to the customer
pursuant to Rule 4.4.a. of the Commission’s “Rules for the Government of Water
Utilities,” 150CSR3, the sewer utility will make a corresponding adjustment to
the sewer charges associated with the same period of time based on the
corrected meter reading and the applicable sewer rates.
      (2)   Dead Meters. At any time that a water utility calculates water
usage and bills for water service pursuant to the provisions in Rule 4.4.b. of
the Commission’s “Rules for the Government of Water Utilities,” 150CSR3, the
sewer utility will bill for sewer service for the corresponding time period
based on the water usage calculated and billed by the water utility.
      (3)   Leaks on the customer’s side of the meter.
         A.   Each utility shall develop and implement a written policy
concerning the adjustment of customer bills where they are based upon metered
water consumption or are actually metered sewer lines, and the bill reflects
unusual water usage which can be attributed to leakage on the customer’s side
of the point of service. Leaking commodes, dripping faucets, malfunctioning
appliances and similar situations shall not constitute leaks which entitle the
customer to a recalculated bill. The policy shall be maintained in the
utility’s office for inspection by the public and shall be applied in a non-
discriminatory manner to all customers. The reasonableness of the utility’s
policy or practice with respect to a policy shall be subject to Commission
review in a formal complaint proceeding.
         B.   The policy shall provide for a recalculated bill to reflect the
utility’s incremental cost of treating or purchasing the treatment of the
sewage, as contained in the utility’s tariff, for all amounts above the
customer’s historic usage. Historic usage shall be defined as the average usage
of the preceding twelve (12) months or actual period of service if less than
twelve (12) months. If using the historic usage would result in an unreasonable
calculation, adjustments may be made. If such adjustments are made, the utility
should advise its customer that a dispute regarding such adjustments may be
taken to the Commission in the form of an informal complaint. Any amounts which
the customer can prove did not enter the sanitary sewer system shall be
credited at full tariff rates.
         C.   As an alternative to using the incremental cost of treating or
purchasing the treatment of the sewage, the utility may, at its option, use an
adjustment which allows it to recover the Commission’s estimate of "typical
incremental cost" per thousand gallons of sewage on usage above the historic
usage. The Commission shall from time to time establish its estimate of
"typical incremental cost" by order.
         D.   However, in future rate cases the utility’s incremental cost of
treating or purchasing the treatment of the sewage shall be determined and the
rate placed in an appropriate tariff as the leak adjustment rate. After a rate
has been determined in a rate case, the utility shall not have the option to
use the Commission’s estimate of "typical incremental cost" found in Rule
4.4.c.3.
   (b)   Complaints.
      (1)   Investigation of complaints. Each utility shall make a full and
prompt investigation of all complaints made to it by its customers, either
directly or through the Commission. In the event that the complaint is not
resolved, the utility shall, before service is discontinued, notify the
customer that he may file an informal or formal complaint with the Commission.
      (2)   Record of complaints. The utility shall keep a record of all
complaints received, which record shall show the name and address of the
complainant, the date and character of the complaint, and the adjustment or
disposal made thereof.
      (3)   Disposition of records. Records of complaints shall not be
destroyed until a summary has been prepared for permanent record, showing the
character of complaints made, the number of each type received in each month,
and the disposition of the complaints.
   (c)   Disputed Bills. In the event of a dispute between the customer and the
utility respecting any bill, the utility shall conduct an investigation and
report the result thereof to the customer. In the event that the complaint is
not resolved, the utility shall, before water or sewer service is discontinued,
notify the customer that he may file an informal or formal complaint with the
Commission.
(Passed 3-5-07.)
921.10 DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE.
   (a)   Any customer requesting service to be discontinued shall give notice
thereof to the utility during regular business hours. Unless a different period
shall be mutually agreed upon by written contract, service will be discontinued
by the end of the next business day. Until the utility shall have such notice,
the customer may be held responsible for all service rendered.
   (b)   Utility Discontinuance of Service.
      (1)   Consideration of health and sanitation require that sewer service
should not be discontinued because of non-payment of service charges unless the
utility has first acquired the approval of the Commission. The sewer utility
shall make use of such legal remedies as may be available for the collection of
delinquent accounts prior to application to the Commission for other relief.
      (2)   Notice of discontinuance. 
         A.   In the case of a sewer utility requesting termination of water
service for non-payment of sewer service, service shall actually be
discontinued no sooner than ten (10) days following the date that a sewer
utility has mailed to a customer a statement that sewer bills are delinquent.
         B.   Where conditions hazardous to life or property are found to exist
on the customer’s premises, or where the utility’s regulating, measuring or
collection equipment or facilities have been tampered with, the water may be
shut off without notice in advance.
         C.   Where written notice is required it must be sent first class
mail, address service requested. Written notice shall comply with Sewer Form
No. 1, attached to these rules. The written notice shall become void if the
utility service has not been discontinued within thirty (30) days of the date
indicated on the notice for termination.
         D.   Prior to disconnecting water service for non-payment of a sewer
bill, the water utility shall make at least two (2) attempts to notify the
customer through personal contact. First, the water utility shall either
telephone or visit the customer at least 24-hours prior to a scheduled
disconnection. Second, the water utility shall knock on the customer’s door
immediately prior to a disconnection. The inability to make personal contact
shall not prevent the water utility from terminating service.
         E.   Service shall not be discontinued on a Saturday, or Sunday, any
day that is a federal or state holiday, a day on which either the water
utility’s or the sewer utility’s business office is not open to accept payment,
or on the day before such days, unless an emergency exists.
         F.   All disconnections shall be performed between the hours of 8:00
a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
         G.   The water utility shall accept payment at the customer’s premises
in lieu of discontinuing service for a delinquent sewer bill. The payment must
be for the entire amount of the delinquency to prevent termination. However, a
utility may refuse payment by check if the customer has, during the previous
twelve (12) months, attempted to make a payment by a check subsequently
returned by the bank for insufficient funds.
         H.   If a customer has received notice of a scheduled termination,
and, to avoid such termination, makes payment by check which is subsequently
dishonored by the bank, the sewer utility may then request the water utility to
terminate service only after it has mailed notice, by first class mail, to the
customer at least five (5) calendar days, excluding state or federal holidays,
prior to termination; provided that at the option of the utility, either
personal contact or telephone contact may be substituted for contact by first
class mail.
         I.   If a landlord of a single-unit dwelling or a master-metered
mobile home park, apartment building, motel, hotel or other multiple or single-
unit dwelling is responsible for payment of a utility bill, written notice of
termination in the form of Sewer Form No. 2 shall be placed at a location
readily available for public inspection on the premises at least five (5) days
prior to the scheduled termination of service to that mobile home park,
apartment building, motel, hotel or other multiple or single-unit dwelling in
order to provide notice of the scheduled termination to the tenants of said
mobile home park, apartment building, motel, hotel or other multiple or single-
unit dwelling. If the billing address for any single-unit service is different
than the service location, a written notice in the form of Sewer Form No. 2
shall be delivered or posted at a visible location on the premises where the
service is to be terminated at least five (5) days prior to the scheduled
termination. This notice shall inform the occupant(s) of the date on or after
which termination of service will occur and shall state the steps the occupant
(s) can take to avoid termination of service.
         J.   A sewer customer who has been notified that water service is to
be terminated for non-payment of sewer bills shall be given the opportunity to
enter into a deferred payment agreement: Provided, that such customer has
demonstrated an ability to pay but only in installments. The customer shall be
informed at the time a disconnect notice is issued of the availability of a
reasonable payment plan.
            1.   The details of the deferred payment agreement are to be
negotiated between the utility and the customer and may consider several
factors, including, but not limited to the following: Amount of the
delinquency; ability of the customer to pay; payment history; time the
delinquency has been outstanding; reasons why the delinquency has been
outstanding; and any other relevant factors.
            2.   The deferred payment agreement shall include language
informing the customer of the right to challenge the reasonableness of the
proposed payments to the Commission.
            3.   During the challenge, the utility may not terminate service;
provided that the current bill must be paid by the customer on time and in full
in order to protect his rights under this rule.
            4.   Once a deferred payment agreement has been established, the
customer must pay the current bill on time and in full and make timely payments
in accordance with the deferred payment agreement.
            5.   If the customer's financial condition significantly changes
and the existing payment agreement results in hardship, the utility shall
renegotiate the payment agreement, consistent with the provisions of Rule
4.8.b.10.A. The customer shall provide documentation in support of his claim
that his financial condition has changed. During the renegotiation period the
customer must continue to pay the current bill on time and in full and make
some payment on the delinquency.
            6.   If the deferred payment is not received in accordance with the
terms of the agreement, or the payment is made with a check subsequently
dishonored by the bank, the utility may terminate service only after it has
mailed written notice, by first class mail, to the customer at least five (5)
calendar days, excluding state or federal holidays, prior to notifying the
water utility to terminate service provided that at the option of the utility,
either personal contact or telephone contact with the customer may be
substituted for contact by first class mail. If the customer pays the
delinquent payment within that notice period, service shall not be terminated.
However, if the customer has, during the previous twelve (12) months, attempted
to make payment by a check which was subsequently dishonored by the bank, the
utility may refuse the customer’s check and immediately terminate service
without additional notice.
         K.   A sewer utility requesting termination of water service for non-
payment of sewer bills shall provide the water utility with a copy of the
notice provided to the customer as required by Rule 4.8.b.1.
         L.   A sewer utility will provide the water utility with a written
request for termination of water service for non-payment at least twenty- four
(24) hours before the end of the 10-day notice period to the customer.
      (3)   Once a disconnected customer has paid his delinquency in full, or
the utility has agreed to enter into a deferred payment agreement with the
customer, and all disconnect and or reconnect fees have been paid, the utility
shall reconnect the customer’s water service as soon as possible, but no later
than twenty-four (24) hours from the time the customer pays all disconnect and
reconnect fees.
      (4)   Charge for reconnection. Whenever the supply of water is turned off
for non-payment of sewer bills, the water utility may make a charge as provided
for in Rule 4.8.c. of the Commission’s “Rules for the Government of Water
Utilities,” 150CSR7.
      (5)   The utility shall not refuse, deny or discontinue service to an
applicant or present customer due to a delinquency in payment for service by a
previous occupant of the premises to be served unless such applicant or present
customer and such previous occupant are members of the same household and were
members of the same household at the time the delinquent bill was incurred.
      (6)   Combined water and sewer public service districts. Any public
service district providing water and sewer service to its customers shall have
the right to terminate water service for delinquency in payment of either water
or sewer bills; provided that proper notice is given and procedures followed as
set out in these rules.
   (c)   Refusal to Serve Applicants.
      (1)   Non-compliance with rules. Any utility may decline to serve an
applicant until he has complied with these rules and the utility’s rules set
forth in a Commission approved tariff governing sewer service.
      (2)   Applicant's facilities inadequate. The utility may refuse to serve
an applicant if the applicant's installation of sewer piping is hazardous or of
such character that satisfactory service cannot be provided.
      (3)   A bill which has been found to be contractually uncollectible by a
court or could reasonably be found to be uncollectible by reason of an
applicable statute of limitations shall not be used by a utility to deny or
discontinue service.
      (4)   Applicant's recourse. In the event that the utility shall refuse to
serve an applicant under the provisions of this rule, or any other rule
incorporated herein, the utility shall inform the applicant of the basis of its
refusal, and the applicant may apply to the Commission for a ruling thereon.
The refusal must be in writing with a copy sent to the Commission.

921.11 ACCESS TO PROPERTIES.
   (a)   The utility shall, at all reasonable times, have access to service
connections and other property owned by it on a customer's premises for purpose
of inspection, maintenance and operation.
   (b)   Identification for Employees. Every employee, whose duties regularly
require him to enter a customer's premises, shall wear a distinguishing uniform
or other insignia identifying him as an employee of the utility and shall carry
on his person an identification card which will identify him as an employee of
the utility, containing a photograph of said employee. The identification card
shall contain the telephone number of the utility as well as other pertinent
information necessary to identify the employee. All other employees, whose
duties require occasional entry into the homes or premises of customers, shall
carry an identification card containing information as herein required. (Passed
3-5-07.)

(Passed 3-5-07.)
921.14 GREASE TRAPS.
   (a)   The purpose of this section is to control discharges into the public
sewerage collection system and wastewater treatment plant that interfere with
the operations of the system, cause blockage and plugging of pipelines,
interfere with normal operation of pumps and their controls, and contribute
waste of a strength or form that either causes treatment difficulties or is
beyond the treatment capability of the wastewater treatment plant.
   (b)   Control Plan for (Fog) and Food Waste:
      (1)   Any new construction, renovation, or expansion of Food Service
Facilities shall be required to submit to the City a FOG and food waste control
plan that will effectively control the discharge of undesirable materials into
the wastewater collection system.
      (2)   Any existing Food Service facilities shall also be required to
submit a FOG and food waste control plan that will effectively control the
discharge of undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system.
Existing facilities shall not be exempt from the requirements of this
ordinance. There will be no “Grandfathering.”
   (c)   General Criteria:
      (1)   Installation Requirements: All existing, proposed, or newly
remodeled Food Service facilities inside the City of Charles Town wastewater
service area shall be required to install, at the user’s expense an approved,
properly operated and maintained grease trap.
      (2)   Sanitary sewer flows: Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals,
lavatories, etc. shall not be discharged into the grease trap. These flows
shall be conveyed separately to the sanitary sewer service lateral.
      (3)   Floor Drains: Only floor drains which discharge or have the
potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease trap.
      (4)   Garbage grinders/disposers: It is recommended that solid food waste
products be disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means. If a
grinder/disposal is used it must be connected to the grease trap. The use of
grinders is discouraged since it decreases the operational capacity of the
grease trap and will require an increased pumping frequency to ensure
continuous and effective operation.
      (5)   Dishwashers: Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the grease
trap. Dishwashers discharge soap and hot water which can melt grease and allow
it to pass through an undersized grease trap. Traps must be sized accordingly
to allow enough detention time to allow water to cool and grease to solidify
and float to the top of the trap.
      (6)   Location: Grease trap shall be installed outside the building
upstream from the sanitary sewer service lateral connection. This will allow
easy access for inspection, cleaning, and removal of the intercepted grease at
any time. A grease trap may not be installed inside any part of a building
without written approval by the City of Charles Town Utility Board.
      (7)   Pass Through Limits: No User shall allow wastewater discharge
concentration from grease trap to exceed 100 MgPL (milligrams per liter) as
identified by EPA method 413.
   (d)   Design Criteria:
      (1)   Construction: Grease traps shall be constructed in accordance with
The City of Charles Town’s standards and shall have a minimum of two
compartments with fittings designed for grease retention. All grease removal
devises or technologies shall be subject to the written approval of the Charles
Town Utility Board. Such approval shall be based on demonstrated removal
efficiencies of the proposed technology.
      (2)   Access: Access to grease traps shall be available at all times, to
allow for their maintenance and inspection. Access to trap shall be provided by
two manholes (one on each compartment) terminating at finished grade with cast
iron frame and cover.
      (3)   Load-Bearing Capacity: In areas where additional weight loads may
exist, the grease trap shall be designed to have adequate load- bearing
capacity. (Example: vehicular traffic in driving or parking areas).
      (4)   Inlet and Outlet Piping: Wastewater discharging to a grease trap
shall enter only through the inlet pipe of the trap. Each grease trap shall
have only one inlet and one outlet pipe.
      (5)   Grease Trap Sizing: The required size of the grease trap shall be
calculated using EPA-2 model. All grease traps shall have a capacity of not
less than 1,000 gal. nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gal. If the calculated
capacity exceeds 3,000 gal., multiple units plumbed in series shall be
installed.
      (6)   Central Business District: The Central Business District (CBD)
shall be exempt to the sizing requirements of
921.14 and subject to the following requirements -
         A.   Compliance with the WV State Building Code
         B.   If sized by gallon capacity the tank shall have a liquid volume
of not less than 150 gals. (ref: WVDHHR manual of Environmental Health
Procedures - Procedure WW13)
         C.   If sized by standard PDI-G101 method the tank shall have a
minimum of 50 lbs. of grease capacity.
         D.   All calculations shall be using maximum occupancy numbers
established by the State Fire Marshall or the Code Official. All plans are
subject to Fire Marshall and Health Department review as part of building plan
review.
         E.   No building permit for food service in the CBD will be issued
without Charles Town Utility Board review for maintenance requirements. (Passed
8-15-11)
   (e)   Grease Trap Maintenance:
      (1)   Cleaning/Pumping: The user at the user’s expense shall maintain all
grease traps to assure proper operation and efficiency and maintain compliance
with the City’s Pass Through Limits. Maintenance of grease trap shall include
the complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater,
and bottom sludge and solids. This work shall be performed by a qualified and
licensed hauler. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the trap
from which it was removed or any other grease trap, for the purpose of reducing
the volume to be disposed, is prohibited. This service shall also include a
thorough inspection of the trap and its components. Any needed repairs shall be
noted. Repairs shall be made at user’s expense.
      (2)   Cleaning/Pumping frequency: The grease trap must be pumped out
completely a minimum of once every four months, or more frequently, as
determined by the City of Charles Town Utility Board, as needed to prevent
carry over of grease into the sanitary sewer system.
      (3)   Disposal: All waste removed from each grease trap must be disposed
of at a facility approved to receive such waste in accordance with the
provisions of this program. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any
private or public portion of the City’s sanitary sewer collection system. All
pumpage from grease traps must be tracked by a manifest, which confirms
pumping, hauling, and disposal of waste. The customer must obtain and retain a
copy of the original manifest from the hauler.
      (4)   Maintenance Log: A grease trap cleaning/maintenance log indicating
each pumping for the previous 24 months shall be maintained by each Food
Service Facility. This log shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler,
and disposal site and shall be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection.
Said log shall be made available to the City of Charles Town Utility Manager or
their representative upon request.
      (5)   Submittal of Records: Each user shall submit all cleaning and
maintenance records to the City of Charles Town Utility Manager. The
maintenance records shall include the following information:
         A.   Facility name, address, contact person, and phone number
         B.   Company name, address, phone number, and contact name of person
responsible for performing the maintenance, cleaning, pumping, or repair of
grease trap.
         C.   Types of maintenance performed.
         D.   Dates maintenance was performed.
         E.   Date of next scheduled maintenance.
         F.   Copies of manifests.
   The user shall be required to submit maintenance records to the City of
Charles Town Utility Manager on a biannual basis (twice per year). Records
shall be submitted by March 1st and September 1st of each year. The records
shall be submitted to:
Attn. City of Charles Town Utility Manager
P.O. Box 14
Charles Town, WV 25414
   The City of Charles Town Utility Manager will perform periodic inspections
of these facilities and shall notify the user of any additional required
maintenance or repairs. Upon written notification by the City of Charles Town
Utility Manager, the user shall be required to perform the maintenance and
records of said maintenance within 14 calendar days. Upon inspection by the
City of Charles Town Utility Manager the user may be required to install, at
his expense, additional controls to provide a complete system which prevents
discharges of undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system.
   (f)   Additives: Any biological additive(s) placed into the grease trap or
building discharge line including but not limited to, enzymes, commercially
available bacteria, or other additives designed to absorb, purge, consume,
treat, or otherwise eliminate fats, oils, and grease shall require written
approval by the City of Charles Town Utility Board prior to use. The use of
such additives shall in no way be considered as a substitution to the
maintenance procedures required herein,
   (g)   Chemical Treatment: Chemical treatments such as drain cleaners, acid,
or other chemical solvents designed to dissolve or remove grease shall not be
allowed to enter the grease trap.
   (h)   Sand, Soil, and Oil Interceptors: All car washes, truck washes,
garages, service stations, car and truck maintenance facilities, fabricators,
utility equipment shops, and other facilities (as determined by the City of
Charles Town Utility Board) that have sources of sand, soil, and oil shall
install effective sand, soil and oil traps, interceptors, and/or oil/water
separators. These systems shall be sized to effectively remove sand, soil, and
oil at the expected flow rates. These systems shall be, at the user’s expense,
cleaned or pumped on a regular basis to prevent impact upon the wastewater
collection and treatment systems. Users whose systems are deemed to be
ineffective by the Utility Board shall be asked to change the cleaning
frequency or to increase the size of the system. Owners or operators of washing
facilities will be required to prevent the inflow of detergents and rainwater
into the wastewater collection system. Oil/water separator installations shall
be required at facilities that accumulate petroleum oils and greases and at
facilities deemed necessary by the Utility Board.
   (i)   Laundries: Commercial laundries shall be equipped with an interceptor
with a wire basket or similar device, removable for cleaning, that prevents
passage (into the wastewater collection system) of solids ½” or larger in size
such as rags, strings, buttons, or other solids detrimental to the system.
   (j)   Control Equipment: The equipment or facilities installed to control
FOG, food waste, sand, soil, oil, and lint must be designed in accordance with
the Southern Plumbing Code, the West Virginia Department of Environmental
Protection and Conservation guidelines, most current engineering standards, or
other applicable guidelines approved by the Utility Board. Underground
equipment shall be tightly sealed to prevent inflow of rainwater and shall be
easily accessible to allow regular maintenance and inspection. Control
equipment shall be maintained by the owner and/or operator of the facility as
to prevent a stoppage of the wastewater collection system, and the accumulation
of FOG, food waste, sand, soil, and lint in the collection lines, pump
stations, and wastewater treatment plant. If the City of Charles Town is
required to clean out the wastewater collection lines, as a result of a
stoppage resulting from poorly maintained control equipment (or lack thereof)
the owner or operator shall be required to refund the labor, equipment,
materials, and any overhead costs to the City including any fines incurred due
to any sanitary sewer overflow due directly to the stoppage. The City retains
the right to inspect and approve any and all installations of control
equipment.
   (k)   Alteration of Control Methods: The City of Charles Town, through the
Utility Board, reserves the right to request additional control measures if
existing control equipment is shown to be insufficient to protect the
wastewater collection system and wastewater treatment plant from interference
due to the discharge of FOG, sand, soil, lint, or any other undesirable
materials.
   (l)   Enforcement and Penalties: Any person who violates this ordinance, in
part or whole, shall be guilty of a civil violation punishable under and
according to the general penalty provision of the City of Charles Town’s
Codified Ordinances. Each day’s violation of this ordinance shall be considered
a separate offense. (Passed 3-5-07.)
921.15 VALIDITY.
   (a)   All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflict with this article
are hereby repealed.
   (b)   The invalidity of any section, clause, sentence, or provision of this
article shall not affect the validity of any other part of this article which
can be given effect without such invalid part or parts.

Public Service Commission of West Virginia (the "PSC") Title 150 Legislative
Rule Series 7 Rules for the Government of Water Utilities (the "Water Rules")
and Series 5 Rules for the Government of Sewer (the "Sewer Rules"), CTUB will
make a leak adjustment only when the water usage being adjusted is in excess of
200% of the customer's historical usage that can be attributed to leakage on
the customer's side of the point of service. The leak adjustment will be
computed pursuant to applicable rules of the Public Service Commission, the
leak adjustment rate (incremental cost of water and/or wastewater) and the

EXCESS POLLUTION SURCHARGE
   A surcharge to recover extraordinary costs is levied upon customer
discharges placing extraordinary demand upon treatment facilities, as measured
by waste stream parameters of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and/or suspended
solids in the wastewater. Users discharging any water or wastes with a zero-day
average B.O.D. in excess of 300 milligrams per liter or a 30-day average
suspended solids content in excess of 300 milligrams per liter or containing
suspended solids with a character or quantity of pollutant requiring unusual
attention or expense to handle or treat, shall pay, in addition to the base
monthly sewer user charges, an additional surcharge (Cs) as determined by the
following formula:
Cs = Be (B) + Sc (S) + Pc (P)Vu
   B = Concentration of B.O.D. from a user above a base level (300 mg/I)
   Be= 0 & M cost of treatment of unit of biochemical oxygen demand (B.O.D.)
   S = Concentration of suspended solids from a user above a base level (300mg/
l)
   Sc = 0 & M costs for treatment of a unit of suspended solids
   Pc = 0 & M cost for treatment of a unit of any pollutant
   P = Concentration of any pollutant from a user above a base level
   Vu= Volume contribution from a user per unit of time.

925.02 SPECIFICATIONS FOR WATER LINES.
   The purpose of this section is to establish consistent and uniform
guidelines for the installation of water lines and connections thereto in the
Charles Town Water Department service area. The document shall be considered a
reference manual dated, December 2001, and amended May 2002, and shall be
considered a stand-alone document available to the public.
(Ord. 02-15. Passed 6-17-02.)
925.03 CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL.
   (a)   The City of Charles Town Utility Board recognizes that Cross-
Connections and Backflow conditions either existing or potential in a public
water system and/or a customer’s water distribution system pose a threat to the
public health and the environment. Therefore, the following program and
articles of policy apply to our public water system (Water Purveyor) and to our
customer’s water distribution system(s) (Owner).
   (b)   Purpose:
      (1)   To protect the public water system served by the City of Charles
Town Utility Board from the possibility of contamination or pollution by
isolating within its customer’s internal distribution water system(s), such
contaminants or pollutants that could backflow due to back-pressure or back-
siphonage into the public water system.
      (2)   To promote the elimination and/or control of cross-connections and
backflow conditions, actual or potential, within a customer’s in-plant potable
water system(s) and non-potable systems.
      (3)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program of cross-
connection control which will effectively prevent the contamination or
pollution of the public and/or customer’s water system(s) from cross-
connections.
   (c)   Authority:
      (1)   By the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974 and 1996 amendment,
and the Code of West Virginia Chapter 16, Article 1 Public Health Laws, WV
Bureau for Public Health Chapter 1, Article 5B, the Water Purveyor has the
primary responsibility for preventing water from unapproved sources, or any
other substances, from entering the public potable water system.
      (2)   City of Charles Town Utility Board, Rules and Regulations, adopted.
   (d)   Responsibility: The Water Purveyor shall be responsible for the
protection of the public potable water distribution system from contamination
or pollution due to backflow from back-pressure or back-siphonage of
contaminants or pollutants through the water service connection. If, in the
judgment of the Water Purveyor, an approved backflow preventer assembly is
required at the water service connection to any customer’s premises, the Water
Purveyor, or his delegated agent, shall give notice in writing to said customer
to install an approved backflow preventer assembly at each service connection
to his premises. The customer shall, within ninety (90) days, install such
approved assembly, or assemblies, at his own expense, and failure or refusal,
or inability on the part of the customer to install said assembly or assemblies
within ninety (90) days, shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water
service to the premises until such assembly or assemblies have been properly
installed.
   (e)   Definitions:
      (1)   Approved shall mean, accepted by the Water Purveyor as meeting an
applicable specification stated, or cited in the WV Department of Health and
Human Resources regulation, or as suitable for the proposed purpose.
      (2)   Auxiliary Water Supply shall mean, any water supply or water
source, on or available, to a customer’s premises other than the Water
Purveyor’s approved public water system.
      (3)   Backflow shall mean, the flow of water or other liquids, mixtures
or substances, under positive or reduced pressure in the distribution pipes of
a potable water supply from any source other than its intended source.
      (4)   Backflow Preventer shall mean, a device or assembly, or means
designed to prevent backflow in a potable water system. Most commonly
categorized as air gap, atmospheric vacuum breaker, barometric loop, double
check with intermediate atmospheric vent, double check valve assembly, hose
bibb vacuum breaker, pressure vacuum breaker, reduced pressure principle
assembly, and residential dual check.
         A.   Air Gap: A physical separation sufficient to prevent backflow
between the free-flowing discharge end of the potable water system and any
other system. Physically defined as a distance equal to twice the diameter of
the supply side pipe diameter but never less than one (1) inch.
         B.   Atmospheric Vacuum Breaker: A device which prevents backflow by
creating an atmospheric vent when there is either a negative pressure or sub-
atmospheric pressure in a water system.
         C.   Barometric Loop: A fabricated piping arrangement rising at least
thirty- five (35) feet at its topmost point above the highest fixture it
supplies. It is utilized in water supply systems to protect against back-
siphonage.
         D.   Double Check Valve Assembly: An assembly of two (2) independently
operating spring loaded check valves with tightly closing shut-off valves on
each side of the check valves, and properly located test cocks for the testing

   (g)   Requirements:
      (1)   Water Purveyor.
         A.   On new installations, the Water Purveyor will provide an on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer assembly(ies), if any, that will be required and will
perform inspection and testing.
         B.   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the
Water Purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or
premises for actual and potential cross-connections and backflow conditions and
inform the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the
method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to

failure to comply, prior to a re-inspection. The Water Purveyor will allow an
additional fifteen (15) days for the corrections(s). In the event the Owner
fails to comply with the necessary correction(s) by the time of a second re-
inspection, the Water Purveyor will inform the Owner by letter, that the water
service to the Owner’s premises will be terminated within a period not to
exceed five (5) days. In the event that the Owner informs the Water Purveyor of
extenuating circumstances as to why the correction(s) has not been made, a time
extension may be granted by the Water Purveyor, but in no case will exceed an
additional thirty (30) days.
         E.   If the Water Purveyor determines at any time that a serious
threat to the public health exists, water service will be terminated
immediately.
         F.   The Water Purveyor will conduct initial and follow-up premise
inspections to determine the nature of existing or potential hazards. The main
focus will be on high hazard industries and commercial premises.
      (2)   Owner.
         A.   The Owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection
of all actual or potential cross-connections and/or backflow conditions on his/
her premises.
         B.   The Owner, after having been informed by a letter from the Water
Purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested,
any and all backflow preventer assemblies on his premises.
         C.   The owner shall correct within thirty (30) days any malfunction
or an air gap or backflow preventer assembly(ies) which is revealed by periodic
inspection or testing. This may involve the removal and/or replacement of the
backflow preventer assembly(ies)
         D.   The Owner shall inform the Water Purveyor of any proposed or
modified cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the
Owner is aware, but have not been found by the Water Purveyor.
         E.   The Owner shall not install a by-pass around any backflow
preventer assembly unless there is a backflow preventer assembly of the same
type on the by-pass. Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the
assembly(ies) must supply additional assemblies necessary to allow testing to
take place.
         F.   The Owner shall install backflow preventer assemblies approved by
the Water Purveyor or the WVBPH.
         G.   The Owner shall install backflow preventer assemblies in a manner
approved by the Water Purveyor and general industry standards.
         H.   Any Owner having a private well or other auxiliary water source
must have the approval of the Water Purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system. Permission to cross-
connect may be denied. The Owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer assembly at the service entrance if a private water source is
maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system.
         I.   In the event the Owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Water Purveyor’s side of a backflow
preventer assembly, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer assembly
installed.
         J.   The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
service, permits, periodic assembly testing, retesting in the case that a
backflow preventer assembly fails to operate correctly, and follow-up re-
inspections for non-compliance with the Water Purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
   (h)   Degree of Hazard: The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the
public water system arising from cross-connections and backflow conditions. All
threats will be classified by degree of hazard which will determine the
requirements for the installation of approved backflow preventer assemblies in
accordance with the Cross-Connection and Backflow Prevention Manual dated
March, 2002. The following list contains industries, commercial establishments
and other facilities that have historically posed threats to the public water
supply and includes, but is not limited to, automotive manufacturing plants,
chemical, planting, processing plants, chemical tank car cleaning facilities,
breweries, bottling plants, canneries, packing houses, meat processing
operations, dairy processing operations, photographic developing laboratories,
research laboratories, oil and gas production, storage or transmission
operations, power plants, Hospitals, medical buildings, sanitariums, nursing or
convalescent homes, clinics, dentist offices, mortuaries, morgues, funeral
homes, refrigeration or cold storage plants, laundries, dry cleaning
operations, car washes, grain elevators, restaurants, taverns, beauty salons,
barber shops, greenhouses, marinas, schools, churches, parks, golf courses
(lawn sprinkling systems), cemeteries (lawn sprinkling systems), sewage
treatment plants, sewage lift stations, water treatment plants, private homes
with wells, swimming pools, lawn sprinkling systems and apartment complexes.
   (i)   Existing In-Use Backflow Prevention Devices: Any existing backflow
preventer assembly shall be allowed by the Water Purveyor to continue in
service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness
of the present backflow preventer assembly, or there is an unreasonable risk to
the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of
a residential installation converting to a business establishment any existing
backflow preventer assemblies must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle
assembly, or a reduced pressure principle assembly must be installed in the
event that no backflow preventer assembly is present.
   (j)   Periodic Testing:
      (1)   Backflow preventer assemblies shall be tested and inspected at
least annually.
      (2)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester.
This testing will be done at the Owner’s expense.
      (3)   Any backflow preventer assembly which fails during a periodic test
will be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of
the repair, the assembly will be retested at the Owner’s expense to ensure
correct operation. High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue
unprotected if the backflow preventer assembly fails the periodic test and
cannot be repaired immediately. In other situations, a compliance date of not
more than thirty (30) days after the test date may be established. The Owner is
responsible for the costs of all testing, repair service, replacement parts, or
a replacement assembly. Parallel installation of two (2) assemblies is an
effective means of the owner insuring uninterrupted water service during
testing or repair of one of the assemblies and is strongly recommended when the
Owner desires such continuity.
      (4)   Backflow preventer assemblies will be tested more frequently than
specified in #1. above in cases where there is a history of test failures and
the Water Purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard involved, additional
testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be born by the Owner.
   (k)   Records:
      (1)   The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain (update) the
following:
         A.   Master files on customer cross-connections.
         B.   Master files on customer backflow preventer tests, repairs and
replacements.
         C.   Copies of any of the above and other records and/or reports
supplied to the WVBPH.
      (2)   Upon request, the Water Purveyor will submit records of inspection
and non-compliance, surveys, tests results and/or corrective actions, and
backflow incident reports to the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health.

1102.05a  URBAN DEER.
   (a)   Purpose: The City of Charles Town is vested with the authority and
responsibility for protection of the health, safety, and welfare of its
citizens. The City has directly experienced an increased problem of deer
overpopulation in some of the rural annexed areas, more specifically defined as
agriculturally-zoned land that was annexed into the City after 1999 that
continues, without interruption, to be actively used for agricultural purposes.
Deer exist in these areas of the City in such numbers as to pose an
unacceptable risk of disease, vehicle damage, crop damage, and property damage.
The City Council has determined two measures that would alleviate the problem
of deer overpopulation: (1) allowing the issuance of crop damage deer permits
through the West Virginia Department of Natural Resources (WVDNR) and (2)
allowing these areas to be hunted in accordance with current WVDNR game laws.
   (b)   Provisions:
      (1)   Appropriate deer permits must be obtained by the permit holder from
the WVDNR and all hunt participants shall comply with all permit requirements
and all laws and regulations of the State of West Virginia.
      (2)   Crop Damage Permits (January - September)
         A.   Crop Damage Permit Holders must register their permits, in
writing, with the City of Charles Town Chief of Police and give the Chief
written notice, not less than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the commencement
of any hunt, identifying all individuals who will participate in the hunt, the
duration of the hunt, and the area to be encompassed by the hunt. The location
of the hunt must provide sufficient specificity so that the Chief and the
Charles Town police department staff may readily identify the area on a map of
the City and respond to inquiries in regard thereto. This registration must be
done in person, by at least one representative from each group of hunters, no
less than once per calendar year, after receiving current WVDNR permits, and
prior to the initial hunt in any calendar year.
      B.   Jefferson County Dispatch must also be notified, by the permit
holder, via the non- emergency number when permit holders are arriving and
departing a hunt area to execute crop damage permits. Permit numbers must be
referenced when calling Jefferson County Dispatch.
         C.   Only archery and crossbows that comply with the rules and
regulations of the WVDNR may be used while executing a crop damage permit.
      (3)   Yearly Hunting Permits (September - December)
         A.   Eligible persons will also be permitted to hunt the rural annexed
areas from September to December in compliance with the WVDNR yearly hunting
regulations.
          B.   Archery, crossbows, and shotguns that comply with the rules and
regulations of the WVDNR may be used while executing a yearly hunting permit.
      (4)   Hunting may only occur between sunrise and sunset.
      (5)   Rifles may not be used for hunting at any time on rural annexed
land.
      (6)   All hunters must shoot from an elevated position such as a tree
stand that is no less than ten (10) feet above the ground while facing toward
the center of the designated area.
      (7)   Permit holders will be responsible for the removal and cleaning up
of all deer carcasses and remains resulting from the controlled hunt within
twenty-four (24) hours of the hunt.
      (8)   In the event that a wounded animal escapes the hunt area, the
permit holder shall contact the Charles Town police department not later than
at the conclusion of the hunt and inform the staff of the location outside the
hunt at which the wounded animal is believed to be located. The permit holder
will not leave the hunt area in pursuit of a wounded animal.
   (c)   Penalties.  Any violation of this Section shall be punishable by a
fine of up to five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each offense.
(Ord. 2021-005. Passed 10-12-21.)
1102.06 BIRD SANCTUARY.
   (a)   No person shall trap, hunt, shoot, or attempt to shoot or molest in
any manner any bird or wild fowl or to rob bird nests or wild fowl nests,
provided, however, if starlings or similar birds are found to be congregating
in such numbers in a particular locality that they constitute a nuisance or
menace to health or property in the opinion of Council, then in such event,
Council shall meet with representatives of the Audubon Society, Bird Club,
Garden Club or Humane Society, or as many of such Clubs as are found to exist
in the City, after having given at least three days actual notice of the time
and place of the meeting to the representatives of such Clubs.
   (b)   If as a result of the meeting no satisfactory alternative is found to
abate such nuisance in the opinion of Council, then the birds may be destroyed
in such numbers and in such manner as is deemed advisable by Council under the
supervision of the Chief of Police.

section shall constitute a misdemeanor.

of any person within the City, the owner or occupier thereof shall forthwith

the landowner's name, address, phone number and signature. Written permission
must be dated and will expire 1 year from that date and will become void if the

of the caregiver when conducting any functions related to the management of
free-roaming cats on that property.
      (2)    A "Cat Caregiver Registration" shall be required of any individual
that wishes to manage free-roaming cat colonies/groups or conduct trap-neuter-
return activities according to the previsions of this section. This
registration shall be provided by the City at no cost to the caregiver and
valid for 2 years after the date of issuance. This registration may be revoked
by the City at any time if the City believes the individual is incapable of
performing duties associated with managing free-roaming cats or if the
individual is not complying with the provisions of this section. Appeals of
revocations shall be made to the City Council.
      (3)    All cats that are part of free-roaming cat programs must be
sterilized, vaccinated against the threat of rabies, and ear-tipped for easy
identification; if these requirements are met, the free-roaming cat is exempted
from licensing, stray, at-large and possibly other provisions of this ordinance
or other City Ordinances that apply to owned animals.
      (4)    If a person is providing care for free-roaming cats, he or she is
required to provide certain necessities on a regular/ongoing basis, including,
but not limited to, proper nutrition and medical care as needed. The following

1104.01 GENERAL.
   (a)   Title. This article shall be known as the "City of Charles Town Tree
Ordinance."
   (b)   Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this article is to provide City
government with power and authority over all trees and shrubs located within
the street rights-of-way, parks, and other public places of the City; and over
trees, and shrubs located on private property as permitted by state law. This

the City. The provisions of this ordinance are enacted to:
      (1)   Maintain city trees and forests in good health using appropriate
arboricultural practices;
      (2)   Establish and maintain optimal level of age and species diversity
that are ideal for our region through efficient and cost-effective management
of the urban forest;
      (3)   Select, situate, and maintain street trees appropriate to maximize
ecosystem services and minimize hazard, nuisance, hardscape damage, and
maintenance costs;
      (4)   Centralize tree management under a City-appointed board with the
necessary expertise;
      (5)   Foster support for community forestry through educational projects
that encourage good tree management on privately owned properties;
      (6)   Promote equity, diversity, and inclusion in all aspects of
community forestry;

      (8)   Achieve the City's established goals in the Jefferson County Urban
Tree Canopy Plan.

will not adversely affect the surrounding infrastructure such as sidewalks,
curbs, above ground or underground utilities, including, but not limited to,
heaving of the infrastructure by the root system.
   (b)   Topping Prohibited. Except where trees are severely damaged by storms
or other causes, or are so situated in relation to obstructions as to render
proper pruning impossible, it shall be unlawful for any person to utilize the
inappropriate pruning technique known as topping to any tree on public lands.
   (c)   Utilities. Utilities shall comply with the ANSI 300 Standards for tree
care operations on or adjacent to public lands. A utility shall not be required
to obtain a permit for routine operations affecting trees, if such work is done
in strict accordance with said Standards. Upon review and recommendation of any
application for waiver of said regulations by the Tree Board, a permit may be
issued by the City Code Enforcement Officer that modifies the pruning
specifications, provided that the permit shall not be contrary to the purposes
and policies herein.
   (d)   Injuring Trees.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person, except with written permit as
herein provided, to improperly prune, including topping, or remove, vandalize,
poison, injure, kill or administer any treatment of any tree situate, in whole
or in part, upon public lands, or to place or maintain upon public lands, any
stone, cement or other impervious matter or substance in such a manner as may
obstruct the free access of air and water to the roots of any tree within such
public lands. This provision shall not apply to the paving, repairing or
altering of the public streets, sidewalks, and other public places by the City.
      (2)   Injury to trees is prohibited in that no person shall, in the case
of public trees, do, or cause to be done by others, any of the following acts:

device or material around or through a tree;
         B.   Permit any toxic chemical, gas, smoke, brine, oil or other
injurious substance to seep, drain or be emptied upon or about any tree or
shrub;
          C.   Set fire or permit fire to burn when such fire or the heat of
such will injure any portion of any tree;
         D.   Remove any guard, stake or other device or material intended for
the protection of any public tree or close or obstruct any open space about the
base of a public tree or shrub designed to permit access to air, or water or
fertilizer;

destroy public trees.
      (3)   Any violation of this section shall be enforced pursuant to Article
171 Municipal Court of the Codified Ordinances and subject to the fines,
penalties, and costs imposed by the municipal court judge.
   (e)   Emergencies. The City shall use a risk assessment policy adopted by
Council to determine the condition of dead or dying trees on public property
and cause their removal as appropriate. Public trees may also be removed as
soon as possible when they pose a threat to public health and safety or
obstruct any public way.
(Ord. 2020-011. Passed 12-7-20.)

of Agriculture has implemented a quarantine program or spray program affecting
the geographical area of Charles Town, the City shall have authority to enter
upon private lands in the City to assist in such program including the
mandatory spraying or treatment of trees.
   (c)   Clarification of Property Owner.
      (1)   Prior to exercising authority conferred by this section, the City
shall exercise due diligence to give the owner of the affected real estate
notice and an opportunity to correct the condition.
      (2)   When a situation occurs that threatens the health and welfare of
the community or impedes the use of or threaten public property, the exercise
of due diligence to give any property owner notice may be abdicated by order of
the Council and such order may further authorize action by the City in the
absence of a State ordered quarantine program.

1741.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Intent. The intent of this article is to:
      (1)   Promote the general health, welfare, and safety of the community.
      (2)   Encourage the utilization of appropriate construction practices in
order to prevent or minimize flood damage in the future.
      (3)   Minimize danger to public health and safety by protecting water
supply and sanitary sewage disposal in cooperation with the County Sanitarian,
and to protect natural drainage.
      (4)   Ensure the Jefferson County Assessor obtains information concerning
improvement of real property as required by West Virginia State Code §11-3-3A.
      (5)   Reduce financial burdens imposed on the community, its governmental
units, and its residents, by preventing the unwise design and construction of
development in areas subject to flooding.
   (b)   Authority. This article is adopted pursuant to West Virginia Code §8A-
7-2(b)(12), which gives municipalities the authority to identify flood-prone
areas subject to periodic flooding and regulate with specific control the
permitted use, type of construction and height of floor levels above base flood
elevation permitted in the area so as to lessen or avoid the hazards to persons
and damage to property resulting from the accumulation of storm or flood
waters.
   (c)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This article supersedes any
ordinances currently in effect in flood prone areas. However, any ordinance
shall remain in full force and effect to the extent that its provisions are
more restrictive.
   (d)   Applicability. This article shall apply to all lands within the City
of Charles Town that are subject to the One Hundred (100) Year Flood as shown
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Charles Town by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) dated December 18, 2009, or the most recent revision
thereof. In all areas covered by this district, no person, partnership,
business, or corporation shall undertake or cause to be undertaken, any
development or new construction, substantial improvement, the placement or
relocation of any structure (including manufactured homes) within the
floodplain area, unless a permit has been obtained from the City. In addition,
where land is to be subdivided, utilized for manufactured home park or
subdivision or otherwise developed, a site plan must be submitted to, and
approved by, the City prior to any development.
   (e)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods may
occur on rare occasions or the flood height may be increased by man-made or
natural causes, such as ice jams and bridge openings restricted by debris. This
article does not imply that areas outside the One Hundred (100) Year Flood area
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or land uses permitted within
area will be free from flooding or flood damage. This article shall not create
liability on the part of the City of Charles Town or any officer or employee
thereof for any flood damages that may result from reliance on this article or
any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (f)   Administration. The provisions of this article shall be administered
by the Charles Town Planning Commission. With enactment of this article, the
City Council shall designate a Floodplain Administrator to act on the Planning
Commission's behalf. The duly appointed Floodplain Administrator, hereinafter
referred to as the Floodplain Administrator, shall be the authorized
representative of the Planning Commission and shall have the power to
administer the provisions of this article notwithstanding the ultimate
authority vested in the Planning Commission to supervise the City's overall
floodplain program, to set policies, to establish filing fees, to establish and
adopt forms, and to act upon permit applications made directly to it as
delineated in this article or as otherwise may be practicable in certain cases
or circumstances. Accordingly, when used in this article, the "Charles Town
Planning Commission" and abbreviations thereof shall be deemed to include
reference to its Floodplain Administrator except where powers are reserved to
the Commission. Any denial of a permit by the Floodplain Administrator or duly
authorized representative pursuant hereto, shall constitute denial by the
Planning Commission and be subject to appeal as herein provided.
   (g)   Jurisdictional Boundary Changes.
      (1)   The Jefferson County Floodplain Ordinance in effect on the date of
annexation shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the Municipality for
all annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which
meets the requirements for participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program (NFIP).
      (2)   Charles Town City Council shall pass a resolution acknowledging and
accepting responsibility for enforcing floodplain ordinance standards prior to
annexation of any area containing identified flood hazards.
      (3)   The City of Charles Town must notify the Federal Insurance
Administration and the West Virginia State NFIP Administrator in writing
whenever the boundaries of the community have been modified by annexation or
the community has otherwise assumed or no longer has authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that
all FIRMs accurately represent the community's boundaries, a copy of a map of
the community suitable for reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate
limits or new area for which the community has assumed or relinquished flood
plain management regulatory authority must be included with the notification.
(Passed 9-19-16.)
1741.02 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Identification. The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of
the City of Charles Town which are subject to the One Hundred (100) Year Flood
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Charles Town by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated December 18, 2009, or the most recent
revision thereof.
   (b)   Descriptions of Floodplain Areas. The identified floodplain shall
consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway area (F1) shall be those areas identified as such in
the FIS and as shown on the FIRM.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway (F3) shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-
year flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The approximated area (F4) shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no 100 year
flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and floodway
information from other Federal, State, or other acceptable source shall be used
when available. Where other acceptable information is not available the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to determine the elevation
with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering or other techniques. When hydrologic
and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a
registered professional engineer who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified floodplain area may be revised by
the City of Charles Town where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or
more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, the Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin or other
qualified agency or individual document the necessity for such changes.
However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the Federal
Insurance Administration (FIA).
      (2)   A community's base flood elevations may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable but, not later than six (6) months after the date such information
becomes available, the Charles Town Floodplain Administrator, or designee,
shall notify the West Virginia State NFIP Administrator of the changes by
submitting the appropriate technical or scientific data.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the Base Flood Elevation
specified in the FIS, the structure shall not be required to conform to the
flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-related development
codes in Section 1741.06. Topographic data certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
The applicant is advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the Special Flood Hazard Area designation removed from the parcel
or structure.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation specified in the FIS, the site shall be
considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure shall be
required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this article.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Charles
Town. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
(Passed 9-19-16.)
1741.03 UTILIZATION OF FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Floodway (F1).
      (1)   Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment will not result in any increase in the Base Flood
Elevation.
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters, the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (3)   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (4)   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (5)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4).
      (1)   In the Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4), any
development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses,
activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the
flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      (2)   In the Approximated Floodplain (F4) the Floodplain Administrator
shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed, all proposed development not
covered below to determine the amount being invested and the specific flood
risk at the building site and assign a "minimal, moderate or significant" risk
level.
         A.   Development determined to represent a minimal risk and costing
less than $10,000 on the enactment date of this article and thereafter adjusted
for inflation shall be required to provide "Point on Boundary" elevation data
and, when available, historic flood heights. The Charles Town City Engineer,
hereinafter referred to as the City Engineer, shall attempt to determine a
height that will be reasonably safe from flooding using this elevation data. If
after review the data is found satisfactory, the Floodplain Administrator shall
enter the flood height in Section "G" of the Elevation Certificate. Any new or
substantially improved structures permitted using this method (other than
appurtenant structures) shall be required to have the lowest floor elevated at
least three (3) feet above the highest adjacent grade even if the "point on
boundary" or historic flood height data would indicate a lower flood elevation.
Elevating three feet above the HAG will result in more affordable flood
insurance rates and added safety. If this method is not adequate to allow the
City Engineer to confidently determine the flood height or if the applicant is
not satisfied with the height determined by the City Engineer, the applicant
shall then be required to utilize one of the alternate methods set forth in
subsections b below.
         B.   Development determined to represent a low to moderate risk and/or
costing less than $50,000 on the enactment date of this article and thereafter
as adjusted for inflation shall either:
            1.   Provide the results from the most current version of a Quick-
2 engineering analysis, or
            2.   Attempt to obtain a Base Flood Elevation by submitting a
Letter of Map Amendment request to FEMA, or
            3.   Obtain flood height data by using the USGS methodology set
forth in the USGS Water Resources Investigations Report 87-4111.
The semi-detailed method used will be reviewed by the City Engineer to
determine a "Community Flood Elevation". The City Engineer shall enter the
"Community Flood Elevation" in Section "G" of the Elevation Certificate.
         C.   Development determined to represent a high risk and/or costing
more than $50,000 shall develop a Base Flood Elevation using a detailed
engineering study method such as HEC-ras. This data shall be prepared and
certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms and a completed
Elevation Certificate including Base Flood Elevation. In addition, studies,
analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator. If Developer submits
this Detailed Study Base Flood Elevation as a map amendment significant savings
on flood insurance can be realized.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.
         A.   This data may be available from an authoritative source, such as
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, USDA Natural Resource
Conservation Service or state and local water resource department.
         B.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a FIS. This data shall be prepared and
certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   (c)   AE Area Without Floodway (F3). Within any AE area without floodway, no
new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that
the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway area where determined.
   (d)    Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the Floodplain Area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail,
the City of Charles Town Floodplain Administrator, The WV State NFIP
Coordinator, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners of all
such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream.
Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Insurance
Administration. In addition prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain
Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those
governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval.
Contact information for State and Federal permitting authorities as well as
addresses for required notification of appropriate County, State and Federal
government agencies are contained in the City of Charles Town Stream Alteration
administrative procedures.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Charles Town in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by professional engineers, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator and City Engineer.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The applicant is required to provide the community a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalty provisions set forth in Section
1741.07 (c).
      (6)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by FEMA to revise the FIS and/or FIRM, when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.
(Passed 9-19-16.)
1741.04 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING PERMIT AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   Building Permit Required.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for any person, partnership, business, or
corporation to undertake or cause to be undertaken, any development or the new
construction, substantial improvement, the placement or relocation of any
structure (including manufactured home) within the Floodplain Area, unless a
building permit has been obtained from the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   A Building Permit application submitted to and approved by the
Floodplain Administrator is required to determine whether all new construction
or substantial improvements are:
         A.   Located in an identified Floodplain, Floodway or other flood
hazard area.
         B.   Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent

Regulations or the most recent revision thereof.
      (4)   A description of site location sufficient to locate the project
including tax map and parcel number and most recent deed book and page number.
      (5)   The site plan shall also show the size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow, the
lowest adjacent grade to the proposed foundation and/or toe of fill, the Base
Flood Elevation and the location of the floodway boundary when applicable.
      (6)   An acknowledgement that the applicant agrees to pay any and all
fees associated with the permitting process according to Charles Town's adopted
Fee Schedule.
      (7)   An acknowledgement that the applicant agrees to allow authorized
representatives of floodplain management programs access to the development to
inspect for compliance.
      (8)   The contract required by WV Code of State Regulations, Title 28,
Series 4, and all addendums to the contract(s) shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator for review within five (5) business days of contract
signing.
The community does not require and will not keep copies of the contracts or
addendums. Failure to present contract or addendums for review shall void the
permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is of an
aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including materials and
labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (c)   Site Plan Criteria. The owner or developer of any proposed development
meeting the definition of a Minor or Major Subdivision as defined under Article
1331  of the City of Charles Town Subdivision and Land Development Ordinance,
shall submit a Site Plan to the Floodplain Administrator that includes the
required site plan elements as prescribed under Article
1331  as well as the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to floodplain areas, proposed lot sites, and fills. In
addition, it is required that all subdivision proposals and other proposed new
developments which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within
the approximated floodplain (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or
two (2) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data
and shall delineate a floodway. If FEMA has completed a Flood Insurance Study
(FIS), that data must be used to substantiate the base flood. Otherwise, the
developer may submit data provided by an authoritative source, such as U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resources Conservation
Service, state and local water resource departments, or technical data
developed using detailed methodologies comparable to those contained in a Flood
Insurance Study. This data shall be prepared and certified by a registered
professional engineer, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (3)   Where the subdivision and/or development lies partially or
completely in the floodplain areas, the site plan shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the floodplain areas.
      (4)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the floodplain area and all proposed development including fill will take place
on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the floodplain boundary
depicted on the map, development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not
be necessary. In these cases the site plan for the proposed development must
show contours at intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet and clearly delineate
the area to be developed and the location of the floodplain areas as depicted
on the FEMA map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (d)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Floodplain Areas. Subdivision
of land in the floodplain area must result in lots that include a buildable
portion outside of the identified flood hazard area and be served by streets
within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower than one (1) foot
below the elevation of the line defining the floodplain limits. All new
structures must be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot that is located
outside of the identified flood hazard area.
   (e)   Approval of Building Permits and Site Plans. All building permits and
Site Plans shall be duly approved by the Floodplain Administrator and City
Planning Commission only after it has been determined that the proposed work to
be undertaken will be in conformance with the requirements of the City of
Charles Town and all other applicable codes and ordinances. The City of Charles
Town shall require copies of all necessary permits from those governmental
agencies from which approval is required by Federal and State Law. The
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed, all
permit applications and plans in order to determine whether proposed building
sites are reasonably safe from flooding.
   (f)   Inspection and Revocation. During the construction period, the
Floodplain Administrator or other authorized official may inspect the premises
to determine that the work is progressing in compliance with the information
provided on the permit application and with all applicable laws and ordinances.
In the event that the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not
comply with the permit application or any applicable laws and ordinances or
that there has been a false statement or misrepresentation by any applicant,
the Floodplain Administrator shall revoke the building permit and report such
fact to the City Manager and Charles Town Planning Commission for whatever
action it considers necessary.
   (g)   Fees. Application for a building permit shall be accompanied by a fee
according to the City's Fee Schedule.
(Passed 9-19-16.)
1741.05 ELEVATION AND FLOOD PROOFING CRITERIA.
   (a)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the elevation of the lowest floor above the
freeboard height required by this article.
   (b)   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information
shall also be included in the application for work within the Floodplain Area:
   (c)   For structures to be elevated above the Base Flood Elevation:
      (1)   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its relation
to the lot where it is to be constructed.
      (2)   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
      (3)   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,

the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it is
highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
      (6)   A Nonconversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant whenever
the Floodplain Administrator determines that the area below the first floor
could be converted to a non-conforming use [generally applies to enclosed areas
below base flood elevation that are five (5) ft. high or more] This agreement
shall state:
         A.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
         B.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalty provisions set forth in Section
1741.07 (c).
   (d)   For structures to be flood proofed to two (2) feet above the Base
Flood Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
      (1)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this article. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by a
registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
      (3)   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
      (4)   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA, shall
be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the plans in
(d)(2) above, stating the structure in question, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
         A.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable
to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
   (e)   For structures constructed of flood resistant materials used solely
for parking of vehicles or storage (Appurtenant Structures only):
      (1)   A Site Plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others
of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground, proposed
finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of proposed
flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the floodway
boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present on the
site.
      (2)   An elevation report or certificate, based on finished construction,
must be prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
         A.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
   (f)   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-conversion Agreement and
notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-conversion Agreement to any
new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the transferred
Non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalty provisions set forth in
Section
1741.07 (c).
(Passed 9-19-16.)
1741.06 DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS.
   In order to prevent excessive damage to buildings, structures, and related
utilities and facilities, the following restrictions apply to all development,
subdivision proposals, manufactured home parks, new construction and to
construction of substantial improvements, and the repair of substantial damage,
to existing structures occurring in the Floodplain Area.
   (a)   Basements and Lowest Floors.
      (1)   Residential Structures- All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
residential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement, ductwork
and utilities, elevated to the Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Non-residential Structures -All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
nonresidential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement,
ductwork and utilities, elevated to or above the Base Flood Elevation; or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that
the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water from the lowest structural element to two feet above the Base
Flood Elevation.
      (3)   Openings- For all new construction, relocation, substantial
improvements, and repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         B.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
         C.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (4)   A Non-conversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant on all
flood-proofed structures and any elevated structures when the community
determines that the area below the first floor could be converted to a non-
conforming use [generally applies to enclosed areas below base flood elevation
that are five (5) feet high or more]. This agreement shall state:
         A.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
         B.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the nonconversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized
signature. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalty
provisions set forth in Section
1741.07 (c).
   (b)   Manufactured Home Placement.
      (1)   Certain unique characteristics of manufactured homes installed in
flood hazard areas pose an elevated risk of substantial damage to property.
Thus, all manufactured homes to be sited within the identified flood hazard
areas of the City of Charles Town shall be installed by a contractor possessing
a valid West Virginia Manufactured Home Installer's license. The installer
shall use an installation design engineered to withstand flood hazards specific
to the particular home site. Manufactured homes to be placed or substantially
improved within the flood hazard areas shall be installed in accordance with
the following standards:
         A.   The lowest floor, ductwork and utilities including HVAC/heat pump
shall be elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Elevation shall be on reinforced piers on a permanent foundation,
or shall use foundation elements of at least equivalent strength engineered for
use in a flood hazard area. Installation designs incorporating dry stacked
block piers shall not be used in flood hazard areas.
      (2)   All manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42 West
Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10b as
authorized by West Virginia Code § 21-9-4. The anchoring shall be adequate to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include but are not limited to the over-the-top and frame ties, attached to
permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not be adequate to satisfy
flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement is in addition to
applicable State and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
      (3)   Permanently attached rigid skirts and perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block must have openings; this type of skirting can collapse during
floods and compromise supporting piers. The openings must be designed to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces by allowing for entry and exit
of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a Registered Professional Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria:
         A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         B.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
         C.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (4)   Any additions to a manufactured home shall be similarly anchored
and vented.
      (5)   The licensed West Virginia Manufactured Home Installer placing the
unit shall perform a site inspection and certify in writing that the
manufactured home has been installed to the standards set forth in this
article.
   (c)   Appurtenant Structures.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) below, appurtenant
structures shall be located out of the floodplain area or elevated to two feet
above the Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
         A.   Structures shall be no more than 600 square feet in size and
valued at less than $10,000.00.
         B.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
         C.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to minimize
flood damage.
         D.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         E.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         F.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         G.   The venting requirements contained in subsection (b)(3) above are
applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   A Nonconversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance with this
Ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence
of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a copy of
all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalty provisions set forth in
Section
1741.07 (c).
   (d)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any floodplain area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions. Or,
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
   (e)   Fill.
      (1)   The City of Charles Town officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Placement of fill in the floodplain area is discouraged and should be
minimized.
      (2)   In the floodway, no fill shall be permitted unless it meets the
requirements above.
      (3)   All fill placed in the floodplain area shall meet or exceed the
following standards:
      (4)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The City of Charles Town may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers who shall
certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted
technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed
and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings
in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the City
of Charles Town. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall
consider the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact
to adjacent properties:
         A.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
         B.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
         C.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
         D.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating erosion
problems.
         E.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when determining
whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property including, but not
limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream blockages, and steep
topography adjacent to the channel.
      (5)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
      (6)   Filled site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding).
      (7)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of
the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
      (8)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted. No trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
      (9)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary stability
and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction standards must
be appropriate to proposed post fill use. Particular attention is necessary
when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
      (10)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (11)   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
      (12)   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less must be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
      (13)   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
must be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
      (14)   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area must
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant must convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map Revision
based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
      (15)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development.
      (1)   All structures and other development shall be constructed or placed
on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and
shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height
of floodwater.
      (2)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
      (3)   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback.
      (1)   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles "fill" material
shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazard.
   (l)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
floodplain.

1741.07 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals. Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provision of this article, it is
the right of that person to appeal to the Charles Town Planning Commission,
which shall be known as the Appeals Authority. Such appeal must be filed, in
writing, within thirty (30) days after the determination by the Floodplain
Administrator. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Appeals Authority shall set a
time and place not less than ten (10) nor more than thirty (30) days for the
purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of the time and place of the hearing
shall be given to all parties at which time they may appear and be heard. The
determination by the Appeals Authority shall be final in all cases.
   (b)   Appeal and Review Criteria. All appeals contesting only the permit fee
established by the Floodplain Administrator may be handled at the discretion of
the Appeals Authority. All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this
article shall adhere to the following criteria:
      (1)   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Authority
upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the appeal would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         C.   A determination that the granting of an appeal will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (2)   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (3)   An affirmative decision may not be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   The Appeals Authority shall notify the applicant in writing over
the signature of a community official that:
         A.   The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a structure
below the Base Flood Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance;
         B.   Such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk
to life and property. Such notifications shall be maintained with a record of
all decisions as required in subsection (b)(5) hereof; and
      (5)   The Appeals Authority shall:
         A.   Maintain a record of all decisions including justification for
the issuance, and
         B.   Report such decisions issued in its biennial report submitted to
the Federal Insurance Administration.
      (6)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any construction,
development, use or activity within any floodway area that would cause any
increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
      (7)   No variance shall be granted for any construction, development,

one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30,

specifically listed or otherwise described in this article.
   (v)   START OF CONSTRUCTION- For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act, Pub Law 97-348, includes

alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   (w)   STRUCTURE- A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   (x)   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE- Damage of any origin sustained by a structure

10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event
equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
   (y)   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT- Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage (or "repetitive loss" when a repetitive loss
provision is used) regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
that have been identified by the City's code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
      (2)   Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
      (3)   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all
ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from the requirements of this article will be the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
   (z)   VIOLATION- The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all the requirements of this article. Any structure or other
development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate or other evidence of compliance required by this article is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

   (a)   Registry.  There shall be established and maintained a Vacant
Buildings Registry, in which all Vacant Buildings in the City shall be
registered.
   
   (b)   Notice of Requirement to Register.  Prior to the last day of April in
each year, the Vacant Buildings Official shall cause a Notice of Requirement to
Register to be published as a Class II legal advertisement (as defined in W.
Va. Code § 59-3-2) and mailed by regular U.S. mail to: the name and address of
the Owner, as appearing in the Vacant Buildings Registry, of each Vacant
Building then registered in such registry; and the name and last known address

register that Vacant Building in the Vacant Buildings Registry by submission of
a completed Vacant Building Registration no later than the first day of July in
the subject year; (ii) upon the initial registration of a Vacant Building in
such registry, or in the event of re-registration of a Vacant Building that
previously was registered but later removed from the registry, payment of a
registry fee in the specified applicable amount must accompany submission of
the Vacant Building Registration; (iii) in the event that a Vacant Building
Registration is not timely submitted with respect to a Building then or
subsequently determined to be a Vacant Building pursuant to Section
1759.03(e), such Vacant Building shall be involuntary registered pursuant to
Section
1759.03(e) and the Owner of the Vacant Building shall be charged a registry fee
in the specified applicable amount whether or not the subject Vacant Building
is then registered in the Vacant Buildings Registry pursuant to registration in
a prior year; (iv) if any applicable registry fee is not timely paid, the City
may bring a civil action against the Owner to collect such registry fee and/or
file a lien against the subject real property for the amount of such registry
fee; and (v) a Non-resident Owner of a Vacant Building is required to designate
a Local Agent to accept service of process and certain notices on behalf of the
Non-Resident Owner. Publication of the Notice of Requirement to Register shall
state where a person may obtain a blank Vacant Building Registration, and a
blank Vacant Building Registration shall be sent with any mailed Notice of
Requirement to Register.
      (1)   Neither the failure of the Vacant Buildings Official to mail a
Notice of Requirement to Register to any Owner of a Vacant Building nor the
non-receipt of a Notice of Requirement to Register by any Owner of a Vacant
Building will relieve the Owner of the requirements under this Article.
   
   (c)   Non-resident Owners. Each Non-resident Owner is required to provide to
the Vacant Buildings Official signed and notarized document designating the
name and address of a person who resides within the State of West Virginia and
who the Non-resident Owner authorizes to accept service of process and notices
of fees due under this section on behalf of the Non-resident Owner and who is
designated as the Non-resident Owner's responsible agent for the purposes of
receipt of notification in the event of an emergency affecting the public
health, safety, or welfare (a "Local Agent"). Once provided, such document
shall remain in effect until cancelled in writing by the Owner; provided that,
the Owner shall be responsible for notifying the Vacant Buildings Official of
any changes in the name or address of a Local Agent. Failure to provide such
document by July 1 of the first year following enactment of this Article in
which a Non-resident Owner owns a Vacant Building is a violation of this
Ordinance subject to the General Penalty fine specified in Section
101.99 of the Codified Ordinances. Any provision herein requiring notice to or
service upon an Owner shall be satisfied by notice to or service upon the
Owner's designated Local Agent.
   (d)   Voluntary Registration. By July 1 of each year, the Owner of any
Vacant Building within the City is required to register the Vacant Building in
the Vacant Building Registry by submitting a completed Vacant Building
Registration to the Vacant Buildings Official. A Vacant Building Registration
will not be considered effective unless and until any registry fees required
under Section
1759.03(g) are received by the Vacant Buildings Official.
   (e)   Involuntary Registration. Staff shall investigate any Building that is
suspected to be a Vacant Building and determine whether it shall be considered
a Vacant Building. Upon Staff's determination that a Building is a Vacant
Building, Staff shall: (i) set forth in a written statement its findings
supporting the determination; (ii) place the Owner of such Vacant Building on
the list of persons to receive Notice of Requirement to Register pursuant to
Section
 1759.03(b); (iii) notify the Owner of the Vacant Building in writing by
Certified Mail or Alternative Means of Service of Staff's determination that
the Building is a Vacant Building that the Owner must register in the City's
Vacant Buildings Registry by submission of a completed Vacant Building
Registration by the following July 1, after which the City will involuntarily
register the Vacant Building, with all applicable fees due; and (iv) in the
event the Owner fails to register the Vacant Building by timely submitting a
completed Vacant Building Registration, involuntarily register the Vacant
Building in the Vacant Building Registry and assess against the Owner any
registry fees required under Section
 1759.03(g) whether or not the subject Vacant Building is then registered in
the Vacant Buildings Registry pursuant to voluntary or involuntary registration
in a prior year.
   (f)   Exemption from Registration.  The Owner of a Vacant Building may
submit in writing to the Vacant Buildings Official, for presentation to and
consideration by City Council, a request for exemption from registration of
such Vacant Building in the Vacant Buildings Registry due to inability to
occupy the Building for a period stated and for reasons stated in the request.
Upon a finding of good cause shown, City Council may exempt the Building from
registration for a time specified in City Council's decision. Examples of
circumstances when good cause for an exemption may exist include when the
Vacant Building is being actively marketed for sale following the Owner's move
to other property, or when the Vacant Building is being offered for lease
following a prior tenant's vacation of the property.
   (g)   Registry Fees.  
      (1)   The voluntary registry fee set forth in Section
1759.06(a) for the applicable type of Building shall be assessed to the Owner
of a Vacant Building upon its initial voluntary registration by the Owner and
also in the instance that the Vacant Building is voluntarily re-registered in
the Vacant Buildings Registry after previously having been registered and later
removed from such registry. Thereafter, the voluntary registry fee shall not be
further assessed for so long as the Owner continues to voluntarily register the
Vacant Building annually. The voluntary registry fee shall be submitted with
the Owner's submission of the Vacant Building Registration by which the Vacant
Building is first registered (or first re-registered in the case of a prior
registration and removal from the registry) and due at that time.
      (2)   The involuntary registry fee set forth in Section
1759.06(b) for the applicable type of Building shall be assessed to the Owner
of a Vacant Building in each year that it is involuntarily registered pursuant
to Section
1759.03(e). In addition to the involuntary registry fee, the Owner shall
reimburse the City for all its costs incurred in notifying the Owner of Staff's
determination of Vacant Building status and of the registry fee due. The Owner
shall be notified in writing of the involuntary registry fee due, together with
all costs reimbursable to the City hereunder, by Certified Mail or Alternative
Means of Service, which amounts are due when service of the notice is deemed
made under Section
1759.02(a) or Section
1759.02(d), as the case may be.
      (3)   The City may take the following actions in order to collect any
registry fees and costs reimbursable to the City that are not paid in full
within thirty (30) days of when due:
         A.   After providing the Owner the notice specified below, file in the
Office of the Clerk of the County Commission of Jefferson County a lien against
the Vacant Building for the full amount of the delinquent registry fees and
reimbursable costs, plus filing fees. Prior to filing such lien, the Vacant
Buildings Official shall notify the Owner of the Vacant Building in writing by
Certified Mail or Alternative Means of Service that the City may file said lien
unless all delinquent amounts are paid by a date stated in the notice, which
stated date shall be no less than thirty (30) days following the date on which
service of the notice is deemed made under Section
 1759.02(a) or Section
1759.02(d), as the case may be.
         B.   Institute a civil action in the Circuit Court of Jefferson County
against the Owner for the delinquent registry fees, reimbursable costs, and
reasonable attorney fees and court costs incurred relative to the civil action.
      (4)   A registry fee paid shall be refunded if, on timely appeal, Staff's
determination requiring registration as a Vacant Building is reversed.
   (h)   Removal from Registry. In the event a Building in the Vacant Buildings
Registry becomes lawfully occupied or is removed from the subject real
property, the Owner of the Building is required to provide to the Vacant
Buildings Official a written notice explaining the situation, together with
evidence thereof (such as a copy of a lease of the property, photographs of
demolition, etc.), and requesting removal of the Building from the Vacant
Buildings Registry. Upon Staff's verification of lawful occupation or removal
of the Building, the Building shall be removed from the Vacant Buildings
Registry. In the event Staff is unable to verify lawful occupation or removal
of the Building, the Vacant Buildings Official shall notify the Owner of the
Building in writing by Certified Mail or Alternative Means that Staff has
determined that it is unable to verify lawful occupation or removal of the
Building and that the Building shall continue to be considered a Vacant
Building and remain registered in the Vacant Buildings Registry.

   1759.04 MAINTENANCE OF VACANT BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Required Maintenance. The Owner of a Vacant Building is required to
maintain the Vacant Building in accordance with all applicable provisions of
the Building Code and so as not to constitute a public nuisance prohibited by
Article
1101 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (b)   Enforcement. In the event an Owner fails to maintain a Vacant Building
as required by Section
1759.04(a) as determined by the Vacant Buildings Official, the Vacant Buildings
Official may notify the Owner of the Vacant Building in writing by Certified
Mail or Alternative Means of Service of such determination and the specifics of
the identified failure and that the City may elect to take specified actions,
which may include repairs, maintenance, and/or demolition, at the Owner's cost
to bring the Vacant Building into compliance with the Building Code and/or
eliminate the public nuisance, as the case may be, if the Owner does not take
and complete the specified actions within a specified number of days following
the date on which service of the notice is deemed made under Section
1759.02(a) or Section
1759.02(d), as the case may be, which number of days shall be determined by the
Vacant Buildings Official considering the urgency for the action in light of
the potential harm to public health, safety, and welfare due to the condition
of the Vacant Building. If the Owner fails to take and complete the specified
actions within the number of days specified in such notice, the City may, in
its discretion and notwithstanding any provision of Article
1101 or Article
1705 of the Codified Ordinances to the contrary, thereafter take such actions
and the Owner shall be responsible for the costs of such actions, as well as
all related legal and administrative costs incurred by the City. The City may
bring a civil action against the Owner to collect all such costs.
   (c)   Alternative Enforcement.  Nothing in this Section
 1759.04 shall be considered to affect or limit the City's authority or actions
to enforce any other provisions of the Codified Ordinances pertaining to a
Vacant Building or its condition, including without limitation provisions of
Articles
1101 and
1705.
