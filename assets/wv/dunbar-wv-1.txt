EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

the purpose of passing upon and deciding such tie, and for such purpose only;

the Council shall by ordinance provide a penalty for the violation of such
orders. Council may by ordinance regulate the location, construction, repair,
use, emptying and cleaning of all water closets, privies, cesspools, sinks,
plumbing drains, yards, lots, areaways, pens, stables and other places, where
offensive, unsightly, unwholesome, objectionable or dangerous substances or

assignees, occupants, or tenants of any premises or structure where such
violation may occur. It shall be the duty of all police officers to report to
the Manager the facts as to the existence of any nuisance known to them.
   If the owner, agent, tenant, assignee or occupant of any such premises, lot,
property, building, or structure, as is mentioned herein, shall fail or refuse
to abate or remove any such nuisance, as mentioned herein, or comply with the
provisions of any such ordinance and the regulations herein contained, the
Manager may have said nuisance abated or the provisions of said ordinance or
ordinances carried out, after reasonable notice to said owner, occupant,
tenant, agent or assignee of his intention so to do, and collect the expenses
thereof, with one per centum per month interest added from the date of said
notice, from the said owner, occupant, tenant, agent or assignee by distress or
sale, in the same manner in which taxes levied upon real estate for the benefit
of said City are herein authorized to be collected, and the expense shall
remain a lien upon said lot, or part of lot, the same as taxes levied upon real
estate in said City; which lien may be enforced by a suit in equity before any
court having jurisdiction, as other liens against real estate are enforced. In
case of nonresident owners of real estate notice may be served upon any tenant,
occupant, assignee, or rental agent, or by publication thereof once a week for

and remove any nuisance under the provisions of this section or comply with the
provisions of any such ordinance as is mentioned therein, the expense thereof
may be deducted out of the accruing or accrued rent of said property or amount
due said owner from said agent, and such tenant, occupant, or agent may recover
the amount so paid from the owner, unless otherwise specifically agreed upon.
   Any expense incurred by the Manager as herein provided in the manner
aforesaid, may be collected in the manner herein provided notwithstanding the
imposition of any other penalties upon any of the persons named herein, under
any of the provisions of this Charter. The abatement or removal of any such
nuisance by the City at the expense of said City, as herein provided, shall be
prima facie proof that the said notice to the owner, occupant, agent or
assignee was given as herein prescribed.
SECTION 48. CONTENTS OF PRIVIES, ETC., TO EMPTY INTO DRAINAGE SYSTEM.
   The Manager may require all owners, tenants or occupants of improved
property which may be located upon or near any street or alley along which may

portion thereof, and to order the construction, relaying, and repair of
sidewalks and gutters of such material and width, and in such manner as the
Council may reasonably prescribe by the owners or occupiers of the lots or
parts of lots facing upon said streets, alleys and public squares; and in case
of failure or refusal of any such owner or occupier of the lots or parts of
lots to construct, relay, or repair such sidewalks and gutters, when required,
it shall be lawful for the Council to have such sidewalks and gutters
constructed, relaid, or repaired and levy and collect the expense thereof, with
one per centum per month interest added after a demand of thirty (30) days has
been made by the Treasurer of the City from the said owner, owners, occupier,
occupiers, or any of them; and in all cases of such assessment, whether for the
construction, relaying or repairing of sidewalks or gutters, payment thereof
shall be made to the Treasurer within thirty (30) days after the completion of
the work and demand made, and if not so paid the City is hereby authorized to
collect or cause to be collected the expense thereof, with one per centum per
month interest added after the work has been completed and a demand of thirty
(30) days, and they shall have the power to collect, or cause to be collected,
the same from said owner, owners, occupier or occupiers or any of them by
distress and sale, in the same manner in which taxes levied upon real estate
for the benefit of the said City are herein authorized to be collected, and in
addition there shall be a lien upon the real estate against which such
assessment has been levied for the construction, relaying and repairing of
sidewalks and gutters as herein provided, which lien may be enforced by a suit
in equity before any court having jurisdiction, as other liens against real
estate are enforced, and it shall be the duty of the City Clerk to cause to be
certified to the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County the order laying
an assessment authorized by this section. The clerk of the county of Kanawha
County is hereby required to record and index such assessments in the proper
trust deed book in the name of persons against whose property assessments
appear therein. Provided, however, that a reasonable notice shall first be
given to said owners or occupiers or their agents, that they are required to
construct, relay, or repair such sidewalks or gutters. In case of nonresidents
who have no known agents in said City, such notice may be given by publication
for a period of not less than once a week for two consecutive weeks in any
newspaper printed in said City; and in all cases where a tenant shall be
required to construct, relay or repair sidewalks or gutters in front of the
property of his or her occupancy, the expense of such construction or relaying
or repairing may be deducted out of the accruing rent of said property, and he
may recover the amount so paid from the owner, unless otherwise specially
agreed upon. The laying or construction of any sidewalk by said City shall be
prima facie proof that the said notice to the owner (resident or nonresident)
or their agent, was given as herein required.
SECTION 50. TAXATION; DUTIES OF COUNCIL GENERALLY.
   The Council shall ascertain the total expense of the City to be provided for

itemized estimate of the sum of money necessary to pay interest accruing on the
bonded indebtedness of said City, the amount required for the several sinking
funds for the reduction of the principal thereof, the amounts necessary for the
support of the various departments of the City and for the improvements of its
streets, alleys, avenues, and public grounds, real and personal property,
contingent expenses and other expenses, together with an itemized statement of
the estimated receipts other than that to be derived by the annual levy; and
after receiving such estimates, and before making the levy, it shall apportion
the rate thereof, including the estimated receipts, from licenses and all other
sources among the several funds so ascertained and provided for, which
apportionment shall be spread upon the records of this City, and in making said
estimate, providing for the revenue for the fiscal years, etc., it shall be the
duty of the Council to strictly observe all the provisions of chapter nine of
the acts of the legislature, one thousand nine hundred and eight, entitled "An
act to regulate the rate and manner of laying levies for taxation in counties,
magisterial and school and independent school districts, and municipal
corporations, and to provide penalties for the illegal expenditure of public
moneys, incurring of illegal obligations and the laying of illegal levies by
any tax levying body, and for the distribution of a portion of the school
fund," and all amendments thereto, except where last the named act shall be
inconsistent with this Charter as to limit of taxation.
SECTION 51. AUTHORITY TO TAX PROPERTY, VEHICLES FOR HIRE, DOGS, ETC.
   The Council shall have the authority to levy and collect an annual tax on
real estate and personal property in said City, and to impose a license and
assess a tax thereon on wheeled vehicles for public hire and for all dogs kept
within said City and to impose a tax upon all other subjects of taxation under
the several laws of the State which shall be uniform with respect to persons
and property within the jurisdiction of said City, and shall only be levied on
such property, real, personal and mixed, on which the State imposes a tax;
provided, that no greater levy shall be laid by said Council on the taxable
property of said City than fifty cents upon each one hundred dollars of the
assessed valuation of the property of the Municipality, unless such greater
levy shall be authorized by a vote of the people at an election held pursuant
to said chapter nine of the acts of the legislature of the year one thousand
nine hundred eight; and provided, further, that the Council shall, in making
such levy, be subject to all the provisions of chapter nine of the acts of the
legislature of one thousand nine hundred eight and any and all amendments
thereto, except as herein provided. There shall be a tax of two dollars ($2.00)
annually assessed on each and every inhabitant of said City over the age of
twenty-one (21) years, who is subject to a capitation tax under the laws of the
State of West Virginia. The same shall be set out and included in the personal
property book against every such inhabitant, and shall be collected under the
authority of the City at the time of collecting other levies and taxes.
SECTION 52. METHOD OF COLLECTION.
   The City taxes levied annually by the Council shall be collected as follows:
Immediately after the annual levy for City taxes is laid the Council shall
direct the proper officer of the City to extend the same on the property books
made out by him, including therein the proper capitation tax; he shall make out
therefrom proper tax tickets in the following manner: That is to say, instead
of a single ticket for the whole amount charged to any person, firm or
corporation, there shall be two tickets each for one-half of said amount; these
half tickets shall be severally numbered or designated "first" and "second" and
the same, after being examined and compared by the Council and found to be
correct, shall be turned over to the Treasurer of the City on the first day of
October following the levy and the Treasurer's receipt for the gross amount
thereof shall be returned, entered upon its record and the Treasurer charged
therewith. The Treasurer shall give notice by publication for twenty (20) days
in some newspaper of general circulation in said City, that said tax tickets
are in his hands for collection, stating the penalty for nonpayment thereof and
the time and place where the same may be paid; provided, however, that
taxpayers shall have the right to anticipate the payment of the whole or any
part of the taxes assessed against them.
   The one-half ticket designated "first" may be paid to the Treasurer of the
City any time before the first day of November next succeeding said levy the-
one-half ticket designated "second" may be paid to the Treasurer of the City at
any time before the first day of May next succeeding said levy. To all the half
tickets designated "first" remaining unpaid in the Treasurer's hands on the
said first day of November succeeding said levy, a penalty of ten percent shall
be added and collected from the taxpayers. To all half tickets designated
"second" remaining unpaid in the Treasurer's hands on the first day of May
succeeding said levy a penalty of ten percent shall be added and shall be
collected from the taxpayers. On said first day of November succeeding said
levy, all such half tickets designated "first", and on said first day of May
succeeding said levy all such half tickets designated "second" remaining unpaid
in the Treasurer's hands shall be taken up by the Council and settlement had
with said Treasurer on said days, respectively, or on the next succeeding days,
respectively, if said days shall fall upon Sunday, and thereupon the Council
shall place said tickets in the hands of the City Collector for collection and
shall take his receipt therefor; provided, however, that the Council shall have
the power any year, by resolution, to extend the time within which the tickets
may remain in the Treasurer's hands and be paid to him without adding the
penalty, for a period named therein not exceeding, however, a total of fifteen
days.
   The City Collector shall have the power to collect said tickets so placed in
his hands, together with the penalties thereon hereinafter provided, to be
added thereto, and the compensation of such City Collector for making such
collection of the taxes aforesaid shall be fixed by the Council.
   The City Collector shall be charged with the gross amount of said tax
tickets so delivered to him for collection, including the penalties allowed,
unless on or before the first day of August of each year he makes out and
returns to the Council a delinquent list of taxes uncollected list of taxes
uncollected for such year, with his oath attached thereto, stating that such
list is correct and just and that he has received no part of the taxes
mentioned therein, and that he has used due diligence to find property liable
to distress for taxes, has found none, and that he could not collect the same.
   Neither the Treasurer nor the City Collector shall take or collect anything
but money for payment of taxes.
SECTION 53. POWER OF CITY COLLECTOR.
   The City Collector shall have the power to collect the City Taxes except as
otherwise provided in this Charter, and he shall also have power to collect the
City claims which may be placed in his hands by the Council for collection,
except that fines imposed by the police Judge shall not be collected by him.
SECTION 54. PROPERTY WHICH IS LIABLE FOR TAX; DISTRAINT.
   All goods and chattels belonging to a person, firm, corporation or estate,
assessed with any taxes, whether the same be capitation tax or a tax upon real
estate or personal property, or an assessment on personal property, or an
assessment for paving or other improvements, shall be liable for said tax, and
may be distrained therefor in whoever's possession they may be found and the
City Collector shall have the same power to collect said tax or assessment from
any person owing a debt to or having in his possession any estate belonging to
a person assessed with any tax or assessment of any kind that the sheriff has
to collect State taxes in such cases. The City Collector may distrain and sell
for all City taxes and assessments and in all respects have the same power to
enforce the collection thereof as the sheriff has to enforce the collection of
State taxes.
SECTION 55. LIEN UPON PROPERTY FOR CITY TAXES.
   There shall be a lien upon all real estate within said City for the City
taxes assessed thereon, including such penalties added thereto for nonpayment
thereof as are prescribed by this act, from the first day of April of the year
in which said taxes are assessed. Said liens may be enforced by appropriate
suit in any court of record in Kanawha County; provided, such suit be
instituted within five years from the time the said liens attached as herein
provided, and such suit may either be instituted by and in the name of the City
of Dunbar as plaintiff, or said City may intervene by petition in any suit
pending to sell or enforce liens against any real estate which is subject to
such lien for said taxes. The liens herein created shall have the priority over
all other liens, except those for taxes due this State.
SECTION 56. CERTIFICATION OF LIENS TO STATE AUDITOR.
   Said liens for City taxes and attendant penalties may also be enforced by
certifying the same to the Clerk of the county court of Kanawha County for
certification to the State Auditor, and the same may be certified down by said
Auditor, and sold for taxes, interest, penalties and commissions thereon, in
the same manner, at the same time, and by the same officer as real estate is
sold for taxes, interest, damages, cost and commissions due the State thereon,
which officer shall account therefor on settlement with the City and pay over
the same to the Treasurer of the City.
SECTION 57. TAXES FOR ROADS, SUPPORT OF POOR; JURISDICTION OVER ROADS, BRIDGES,
FERRIES, ETC.
   No taxes or levies shall be assessed upon or collected from the taxable
persons or property within the corporate limits of said City, for the
construction, improvement or keeping in repair of roads, for the support of the
poor of Kanawha County, outside of corporate limits, for any year in which it
shall appear that said City shall at its own expense provide for its own poor
and keep its own roads, streets, and bridges in good order. And neither the
county court of Kanawha County nor the authorities of the district in which
said City is situated, shall have or exercise jurisdiction within the corporate
limits with relation to the roads, streets, alleys, bridges, wharves, docks or
ferries, but the same shall be and remain under the exclusive jurisdiction and
control of the Municipal authorities of said City; and said City shall be
liable only for the construction, improvement, repair and good order of the
roads, streets, alleys, wharves and bridges in its corporate limits, except
that the County of Kanawha may become the joint owner and controller with the
City of Dunbar in a bridge or bridges across Kanawha River; provided, that
nothing in this Charter contained shall be so construed as to interfere with
the construction by the county court through said City of the hard road for the
construction of which and other roads, an issue of bonds in the amount of one
hundred and sixty thousand dollars ($160,000) has heretofore been authorized by
the voters of Union district; and the said county court shall construct the
said hard road along the route originally laid out through said City, in all
respects as if the said City were not yet incorporated; and all the property
within said City shall continue to be liable for its proportionate part of the
levies laid by the county court from year to year for the purpose of paying the
said bonds and the interest thereon, as well as any other district bonds now
outstanding against the said district of Union.
SECTION 58. DEPOSITING CITY FUNDS.
   It shall be the duty of the City Treasurer to keep all funds of the City in
some bank or banks, within said City, which shall pay interest on such deposits
and which shall pay interest on the average daily balance of such funds in all
accounts of the per cent equal to that paid by state depositories on all funds
of the State of West Virginia and in the same manner and at the same time. If
no bank within the City is willing at any time to receive deposits of the
Treasurer and to pay such interest thereon, the Treasurer shall report this
fact to the Council, who shall thereupon designate a bank or banks in which he
shall deposit said funds for the time being and until some bank in said City
will receive such deposits on such terms. Before receiving such deposits such
bank or banks shall give bond in such penalty as the Council shall prescribe,
and with sureties to be approved by said Council, conditioned for the prompt
payment, whenever lawfully required, of all the City moneys or parts thereof
which may be deposited with them, which bond shal1 be renewed at such time as
the Council may require.
SECTION 59. AUTHORITY TO ISSUE BONDS; PUBLIC UTILITIES, MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS,
ETC.
   The City of Dunbar is hereby authorized to issue and sell bonds of said City
for the purpose of buying and building electric light plants, water works, gas
lines and fields and other public utilities, and for buying and building
Municipal buildings, jails, and fire stations; and such bonds shall be sold for
not less than par, and be payable within a period not to exceed thirty-four
years, and shall bear interest, not to exceed six per centum per annum; and in
the issuance and sale of said bonds the City shall be governed by all the
restrictions of the Constitution of this State and the statutes of this State,
with respect to the issuance and sale of other bonds, provided, that said City
shall not, by the sale or issue of bonds for the purposes above mentioned,
cause the aggregate of its indebtedness, of every kind whatever, to exceed five
per centum of the value of the taxable property therein, but may for the above
purpose issue bonds to the maximum limit of said five per cent; nor shall said
City make such issue and sale of bonds without, at the same time, providing for
the collection of a direct annual tax sufficient to pay annually the interest
on the same, and to create a sinking fund to pay the principal within the time
for which said bonds shall be issued.
SECTION 60. STREETS AND ALLEYS; SEWERS.
   The City of Dunbar is hereby authorized to issue and sell the bonds of the
said City for the purpose of providing for grading, paving and otherwise
improving the streets and alleys of said City, of constructing sewers for the
proper draining of same in anticipation of special assessments to be made upon
the property abutting upon the streets and alleys so improved, or property so
sewered or drained, and such bonds may be in such an amount as shall be
sufficient to pay the entire estimated cost and expense of said improvements
for which such special assessments are levied; provided, that the price for
which said bonds are sold shall not be below par value thereof; said bonds may
be payable in groups of one-fifth of the whole issue payable in two, four, six,
eight, and ten years, respectively, and all payable in not to exceed ten years
from the date of issue thereof, and shall bear interest at a rate not exceeding
six per centum per annum, payable annually; and in the issuance and sale of
said bonds, the City shall be governed by all the restrictions and limitations
of the Constitution of this State with respect to the issuance and sale of
other bonds, and the assessments as paid and provided for in this Charter shall
be applied to the liquidation of said bonds and the interest thereon; and if by
reason of the penalties collected with the delinquent assessments, there be a
balance, after the payment of said bonds and all accrued interest and costs,
the said balance shall be turned in to the City Treasury to the credit of the
interest and sinking fund of the City.
   Provided, that the City shall not by the sale or issue of such bonds cause
the aggregate of its debt of every kind whatsoever to exceed five per centum of
the value of the taxable property therein; and provided, further, that nothing
contained shall be construed as authorizing said City to become indebted in any
other manner or for any other purpose, to an amount including the existing
indebtedness in the aggregate exceeding two and one-half per centum on the
value of the taxable property therein (as provided in chapter fifty-one of the
acts of one thousand nine hundred and five) except for the purpose of grading,
paving, sewering and otherwise improving the streets and alleys of said City
and as provided for in this Charter, and except for the purpose of buying or
building electric light plants, water works, gas lines and fields, and other
public utilities and municipal buildings, nor shall they make such issue and
sale of bonds for grading, paving, sewering and improving the streets and
alleys of said City without, at the same time, providing for the collection of
a direct annual tax sufficient to pay annually the interest on such debt and
principal thereof within a period not exceeding ten years.
   All assessments, interest and penalties thereon, collected from the abutting
property owners, on account of grading, paving, sewering or otherwise improving
the streets and alleys of such City under the provisions of this Charter, shall
annually be applied to the annual tax required to pay the interest on such debt
and such principal within and not exceeding said period of ten years; and in
the event that the assessments, interest and penalties so collected do not
amount to a sum sufficient to pay annually the interest on such debt and the
principal thereof within and not exceeding ten years, the City shall collect so
much of said levy as will pay annually the interest on such debt, and the
principal thereof within and not exceeding ten years.
SECTION 61. IMPROVEMENT OF STREETS AND ALLEYS; ASSESSMENTS ON ABUTTING OWNERS.
   Whenever the Council of said City shall deem it expedient to cause any
street or alley in said City or portion thereof to be paved, curbed, or
macadamized, or otherwise improved in a permanent manner, it shall order the
work done in the following manner and upon the following terms: The contract
for such paving or other improvements shall, after due advertisement in which
Council shall reserve the right to reject any and all bids, be let to the
lowest responsible bidder. The contractor shall look only to the City for the
payment of the work, and in no sense to the abutting land owners, except as
hereinafter provided. The total cost of grading and paving or otherwise
improving any such street or alley (with the exception that where a street is
occupied by the street car tracks or other railways, such cost of opening or
otherwise improving the distance between the rails and two additional feet
outside of each rail, shall be borne and paid entirely by the street car or
other railway company operating such street or other railway, unless otherwise
provided by the franchise of such street car or other railway company granted
previously to the passage of this act) shall be borne by the owners of the land
abutting upon said street, alley or portion thereof, according to the following
plan, that is to say: Payment is to be made by all land owners on either side
of such portion of a street or block so paved or improved in such proportion of
the total cost, less the portion, if any, chargeable to such street or other
railway company, as the frontage in feet on his land so abutting bears to the
total frontage of all lands so abutting on such street, alley or portion
thereof so paved or improved as aforesaid. The cost of such paving or
improvement chargeable to the abutting owners under this section is not to
include any portion of the amount paid for paving of squares at intersection of
streets, which shall be borne and paid by the City, except as otherwise herein
provided.
   When the paving of any street, alley or portion thereof shall have been let
to contract and the work done as hereinbefore provided, it shall be the duty of
the Engineer of said City to cause the several frontages abutting thereon to be
measured, and to calculate the assessment upon each and every land owner so
abutting and to certify the same to the Council showing the proper amount to be
determined, as provided in the foregoing plan. It shall be the duty of the
Council to examine and compare such assessment, amounts and names so certified
to it, and thereupon give notice by publication once a week for two consecutive
weeks in some newspaper of general circulation in said City, that an assessment
under this Charter is about to be laid against the abutting property for paving
or improvements done on said streets or alleys, describing the location of such
paving or improvements, and any owner or owners thereof shall have the right to
appear before said Council, within two weeks from the first publication
thereof, and move to correct an apportionment or assessment excessive or
improperly made as charged, which correction said Council shall have the power
to make according to the intent of this Charter, and if found to be correct or
when corrected by the Council as aforesaid, it shall enter the same, together
with a description of the lots of land as to location, frontage, depth, and
ownership so far as the same may be ascertained, upon its records and shall
enter in its records that such owners and lots be assessed and chargeable with
the amount so ascertained to be borne by them respectively; and when so
approved, certified and entered on record the same shall be and constitute an
assessment against said owners and lots for such respective amounts. And it
shall be the duty of the Council to immediately certify such assessment to the
Treasurer for collection as herein provided, and a copy of said order shall be
certified by the City Clerk to the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County,
who shall record and index the same in the proper trust deed book in the name
of each person against whose property assessments appear therein. The amount so
assessed against said abutting land owners shall be paid in ten payments, as
follows: That is to say, one-tenth of said amount, together with interest on
the whole assessment, shall be paid into the City Treasury, before the first
day of May next after said work is completed, and said assessments have been
certified to the county clerk. And a like one-tenth, together with interest for
one year upon the whole amount remaining unpaid on or before the first day of
May in each succeeding year thereafter until all has been paid, and each of
said installments of one-tenth beginning with the first shall bear interest on
the amount of said installments at six per centum per annum from the date of
record of same in the county clerk's office until paid; provided, however, that
any abutting property owner so liable for any portion of the cost of such
paving shall have the right at any time after the same is certified as aforesid
to the Treasurer for collection to anticipate the payment of any or all of said
assessments and shall be allowed to pay the face of said assessment with
interest at six per cent per annum only from the time of recordation to the
time of payment. To each of such installments of assessments remaining unpaid
in the Treasurer's hands on the day herein specified for the payment thereof, a
penalty of ten per centum on the principal sum shall be added and any
assessment so remaining unpaid in the Treasurer's hands on such date, shall be
taken up on such settlements had with the Treasurer on such dates, and
thereupon such assessments shall be placed with the penalty added thereto, in
the hands of the City Collector to be treated and considered, and payment
thereof enforced in all respects as hereinbefore provided for the collection of
taxes due the City, and they shall be a lien upon the property liable therefor
the same as taxes, which lien may be enforced in the same manner as provided
for taxes. The lien hereinafter provided for shall have priority over all other
liens except those for taxes due the State and shall be a parity with taxes and
assessments due the City. Whenever all such assessments for paving, sewerage,
macadamizing or other improvements shall be paid in full to the Treasurer, he
shall deliver to the party paying the same a release of the lien therefor,
which may be recorded in the office of the clerk of the county court of Kanawha
County as other releases of liens, and whenever any such assessment shall not
be in the hands of the Treasurer for collection, but the same shall be shown to
the satisfaction of the City Auditor or other official performing the duties of
Auditor, to have been paid in full to any officer entitled to receive the same,
such Auditor or the Mayor may in like manner execute such release.
SECTION 62. CONSTRUCTION OF PUBLIC SEWERS; ASSESSMENTS ON ABUTTING OWNERS;
REQUIREMENT TO CONNECT TO SEWER; PRIORITY OF CERTAIN LIENS; COST OF DRAINS
INCLUDED IN ASSESSMENT.
   Whenever the Council shall order the construction of any public sewer in
said City, the owners of the property abutting upon any street in which such
sewer shall be constructed shall be charged with and liable for sewerage
assessments as follows: When said sewer is completed the Engineer of said City
shal1 report to the Council in writing, the total cost of such sewer, and a
description of the lots and lands as to location, frontage, depth and ownership
liable for such sewer assessment, so far as the same may be ascertained,
together with the amount chargeable against each lot and owner, calculated in
the following manner: The total cost of constructing and laying the sewer shall
be borne by the owners of the land abutting upon the streets, alleys, rights of
way or easements or portions thereof, in which the sewer is laid, according to
the following plan: Payment is to be made by each land owner on either side of
such portion of a street, alley, right of way or easement in which such sewer
is laid, in such proportions as such frontage of his land upon said street,
alley, right of way or easement bears to the total frontage of all lands so
abutting on such streets, alleys, rights of way or easements in which said
sewer is laid; provided, that the charge laid against any owner or property
shall not exceed two dollars per linear foot of frontage on each side of the
portion of such street, alley, right of way or easement in which any such sewer
is laid. In case of a corner lot, frontage is to be measured along the longest
dimension thereof abutting on such street, alley, right of way or easement in
which such sewer is laid. Any lot having a depth of two hundred feet or more
and fronting on two streets, alleys, rights of way or easements, one in the
front and one in the rear of said lot shall be assessed on both of said
streets, alleys, rights of way or easements, if a sewer is constructed in both
such streets, alleys, rights of way or easements. Where a corner lot has been
assessed on the end it shall not be assessed on the side, and where it has been
assessed on the side, it shall not be assessed on the end. Thereupon said
Council shall give like notice by publication as is required in case of street
paving assessments, and the same rights shall exist as to the persons and
property affected and the same duty as to corrections by said Council as are
prescribed with reference to paving, which report shall in like manner be
examined by the Council, and if found to be correct, or corrected as aforesaid,
and such estimated assessments to be a fair and equitable apportionment of the
cost of such sewer upon the basis hereinbefore described, it shall enter an
order upon the records, setting forth such location, depth, ownership and said
amount of such sewer assessments, against each respectively, calculated as
aforesaid, and the entry of such order shall constitute and be an assessment
for such proportion and amount so fixed therein against such respective owners
and lots, and if after such advertisements, notice and hearings, said Council
shall find that such apportionment at such rate is unjust or inequitable, and
contrary to the intent of this Charter, it shall ascertain, fix and assess the
cost thereof among and upon the abutting owners respectively, justly and
equitably and according to the intent hereof, and in like manner, assess and
enter the amount so fixed respectively upon its records, and the Council shall,
in either event, thereupon certify the same to the Treasurer for collection,
and certify a copy of such order to the clerk of the county court of Kanawha
County, who shall record the same in the proper trust deed book, and index the
same in the name of each owner of any such lot so charged with such assessment,
and such assessment so made shall constitute and be a lien upon said lots
respectively, which shall have priority over all other liens, except those for
taxes due the State, and shall be on a parity with other taxes and assessments
due the City, or other person for that improvement. Said amounts so assessed
against the said several land owners shall be paid by the parties liable
therefor to the said Treasurer at all times, in the manner and with the
attendant penalties for failure to pay promptly at the time prescribed in all
respects as hereinbefore provided in the case of assessments for paving streets
and alleys in a permanent manner, and the parties liable therefor shall, in the
same manner, and to the same extent, have the right and be entitled to
anticipate any or all of such installments thereon as in such case provided.
The owners of, or tenants, occupants, or agents in control of any lot abutting
on or near or adjacent to any street, avenue, alley, right of way or easement
in said City, in which a public sewer is or may hereafter be laid and
constructed, upon which lot any business or residence building is or may
hereafter be erected, or upon which any water stands connected with a public
sewer, may be required and compelled to connect any such building or lot with
such sewer. Notice to so connect may be given to the owner, lessee, or occupant
of such building. Each day's failure to comply with such notice and connect
with such sewer by such owner or owners, ten days after such notice is given,
shall be a misdemeanor and a separate and new offense under this section, and
every such offense shall be punishable by fine of not less than five dollars
($5.00) nor more than twenty-five dollars ($25.00). The expense incurred by any
tenant, occupant, or agent in complying with the order of said Council to make
such sewer connection may be deducted out of the accruing rents as provided for
in section forty-seven relating to the abatement of nuisances. Jurisdiction to
hear, try, determine and sentence for violation of this section is vested in
the Police Court of such City.
   The liens herein and hereinbefore provided for street paving, macadamizing
and sewerage assessments and assessments for other improvements shall
constitute liens upon the real estate upon which they are assessed as against
creditors of the owners thereof, or purchasers for value, and without actual
notice of such liens, only from and after the date that the contract is made
for such work and shall have priority over all liens placed on said real estate
after said contract is made by the City for said work.
   In the paving, curbing, macadamizing or otherwise improving streets and
alleys and providing for the assessment of the cost thereof under section
sixty-one or section eighty-eight of the Charter of the City of Dunbar there
may be included in any such assessment the cost of constructing the necessary
drains for the disposal of surface water.
SECTION 62a. AUTHORITY TO CONSTRUCT SEWERS; DEFINITIONS; ASSESSMENT OF COSTS;
REQUIREMENT TO CONNECT TO SEWER; PRIORITY OF CERTAIN LIENS.
   The Council is authorized and empowered to order and cause to be
constructed, in said City, or part within and part outside of the limits of
said City, public, common, lateral, branch, trunk, and combined sewers or
public sewer systems, or both, by contract or direct by the City, for the
benefit of said City or any part thereof, and to purchase lands or easements
therein or to condemn lands or easements therein in the manner provided by law,
for such sewers or sewer systems, and when the Council shall order and complete
the construction of any such sewer or sewer system or any part thereof in said
City, the owners of the property abutting on such sewer or abutting upon an
avenue, street, alley, right of way or easement in which such sewer shall be
constructed, or abutting on any avenue, street, alley, right of way, or
easement in which any common sewer, part of a sewer system, is constructed and
laid, may be charged with all or any part of the cost thereof, including the
cost of such sewer or sewer system at and across intersections at avenues,
streets, roads and alleys adjacent thereto. If said work is let to contract,
the provisions of the Charter of the City of Dunbar relating to street paving
contracts shall apply.
   A sewer system shall be deemed to include all the common sewers, whether
they be lateral, branch, trunk or combined sewers, and the outlet therefor,
which serve to drain a definite drainage area as specified in the order of the
Council directing the work to be done.
   A common sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer in which all abuttors have
equal rights of entrance and use.
   A lateral sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer which does not receive the
sewage from any other common sewer.
   A branch sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer into which the sewage from two
or more lateral sewers is discharged, including storm and surface water sewers.
   A trunk sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer into which the sewage from two
or more branch sewers is discharged.
   A combined sewer shall be deemed to be a sewer intended to receive domestic
sewage and industrial wastes.
   When said sewer or sewer system is completed the engineer of said City shall
report to the Council in writing, the total cost of such sewer or sewer system,
and a description of the lots and lands as to the location, frontage, depth and
ownership liable for such sewer assessment, so far as the same may be
ascertained, together with the amount chargeable against each lot and owner,
calculated in the following manner: The total cost of constructing and laying
the sewer or sewer system, including the portions thereof laid in the
intersections of streets and alleys, shall be borne by the owners of the land
abutting upon the streets, avenues, alleys, rights of way or easements or
portions thereof in which the sewer or some part of the sewer system is
constructed and laid; payment is to be made by each land owner on either side
of such portion of a street, alley, right of way or easement in which a common
sewer is laid, in the proportion that the frontage of his land upon such
portion of said street, alley, right of way or easement in which such sewer or
sewer system is laid bears to the total frontage of all lands so abutting on
such street, alley, right of way or easement in which the sewer or some part of
the sewer system is laid; provided, that the charge laid against any such owner
of property shall not exceed two dollars ($2.00) per linear foot of frontage on
each side of such street, alley, right of way or easement in which any such
sewer or part of a sewer system is laid. In case of a corner lot, frontage is
to be measured along the longest dimension thereof abutting on such streets,
alleys, rights of way or easements in which such sewer is laid, if sewered on
the long side only, but if sewered on both sides then such corner lot is to be
charged only with the side first sewered. Any lot having a depth of two hundred
feet or more and fronting on two streets, alleys, rights of way or easements,
one in the front and one in the rear of said lot, shall be assessed on both of
said streets, alleys, rights of way or easements. Where a corner lot has been
assessed on either or both ends, it shall not be assessed on the side, and
where it has been assessed on the side, it shall not be assessed on the end.
   In the case of corner lots where the cost of sewering along one dimension is
not assessed against the owner thereof, in the case of lots less than two
hundred feet deep abutting at both ends on a street, alley, right of way or
easement in which a sewer is laid, the cost of sewering along the dimension or
end not assessed against the property owner shall in every case be borne by the
City of Dunbar.
   Thereupon said Council shall give like notice by publication as is required
in case of street paving assessments, and the same rights shall exist as to the
persons and property affected and the same duty as to corrections by said
Council as are prescribed with reference to paving. The report of the City
Engineer shall in like manner be examined by the Council, and if found to be
correct or corrected as aforesaid and such estimated assessments to be a fair
and equitable apportionment of the cost of such sewer or sewer system upon the
basis hereinbefore described, it shall enter an order upon its records, setting
forth such location, depth, ownership and said amount of such sewer
assessments, against each, respectively, calculated as aforesaid, and the entry
of such order shall constitute and be an assessment for such proportion and
amount so fixed therein against such respective owners and lots; and, if after
such advertisement, notice and hearing, said Council shall find that such
apportionment at such rate is unjust or inequitable, and contrary to the intent
of this Charter, it shall ascertain, fix and assess the cost thereof among and
upon the abutting owner, respectively, justly and equitably and according to
the intent thereof, and in like manner, assess and enter the amount so fixed,
respectively, upon its records; and, the Council shall, in either event,
thereupon certify the same to the Treasurer for collection and certify a copy
of such order to the clerk of the county court of Kanawha County, who shall
record the same in the proper trust deed book, and index the same in the name
of each owner of any such lot so charged with such assessment, and such
assessment so made shall constitute and be a lien upon said lots, respectively,
which shall have priority over all other liens, except those for taxes due the
State, and shall be on a parity with other taxes and assessments due the City.
Said amounts so assessed against the said several land owners shall be paid by
the parties liable therefor to the said Treasurer at all times, in the manner
and with the attendant penalties for failure to pay promptly at the time
prescribed in all respects as hereinbefore provided in the case of assessments
for paving streets and alleys in a permanent manner, and the parties liable
therefor shall, in the same manner, and to the extent, having the right and be
entitled to anticipate any or all of such installments thereon as in such case
provided. The owners of, or the tenants, occupants or agents in control of any
lot abutting on or near adjacent to any street, avenue, alley, right of way or
easement in said City, in which a public sewer is or may hereafter be laid and
constructed, upon which lot any business or residence building is or may
hereafter be erected, or upon which any water stands not connected with any
public sewer, may be required and compelled to connect any such building or lot
with such sewer. Notice to so connect may be given to the owner, lessee, or
occupant of such building. Each day's failure to comply with such notice and
connect with such sewer by such owner or owners, ten days after such notice is
given, shall be a misdemeanor and a separate and new offense under this
section, and every such offense shall be punishable by a fine of not less than
five dollars ($5.00) nor more than twenty-five dollars ($25.00). The expense
incurred by any tenant, occupant, or agent in complying with the order of said
Council to make such sewer connection may be deducted out of the accruing rents
as provided for in section forty- seven relating to the abatement of nuisances.
Jurisdiction to hear, try, determine and sentence for violation of this section
is vested in the Municipal court of such City.
   The liens herein and hereinbefore provided for street paving, macadamizing
and sewerage assessments and assessments for other improvements shall
constitute liens upon the real estate upon which they are assessed, as against
creditors of the owners thereof, or purchasers for value, and without actual
notice of such liens, only from and after the date the contract is made for
such work, and shall have priority over all liens placed on said property after
said contract is made by the City for said work.
SECTION 63. RESOLUTION RELATING TO STREET IMPROVEMENTS.

contractor doing the paving, or other permanent improvement, a certificate for
each installment of the amount of the assessment to be paid by the owner of any
lot or fractional part thereof fronting on such street, avenue or alley, and

aforesaid in the hands of the holder thereof upon the lot or part of a lot
fronting on such street, avenue or alley and such certificate shall draw
interest from the date of said assessment and the payment may be enforced in
the name of the holder of said certificate by proper suit in equity in any

fix the amount of such assessment, advertise for bids and do all things in
connection therewith as is provided for paving or permanently improving any
street or alley or portion thereof in Section sixty-one except that in fixing
the amount of assessments the cost of paving the street intersections shall be
included and the proportionate part thereof shall be assessed against each lot
owner; provided, that the cost of not more than one intersection shall be
assessed against the lots situated between any two cross streets; and such
certificates shall be issued in the same number of installments and payable at
the same time as other paving or permanent improvements are provided to be paid
for and shall be a lien in the hands of the holder thereof upon the particular
lot against which they are assessed in the same way and manner as provided for
assessments made under Section sixty-one of said Charter; and nothing contained
in this Charter or in any general law shall be construed as imposing a time
limit upon the enforcement by appropriate suit of a lien for public
improvements made hereunder; and, provided, further, that no error in the
publication of any notice required hereunder shall in any way affect the
validity of the certificates herein provided for.
   Such certificates as may be issued pursuant to the foregoing section shall

SECTION 86. PROCEDURE WHEN ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN MADE AGAINST WRONG PERSON.
   In case of the construction of any pavement, sewer, sidewalk or other
permanent improvement under the provisions of this Charter, when an assessment
shall be void or voidable by reason of errors, irregularities or defects in
case proceedings under which such improvements shall have been made, or in case
such assessment shall have been made against the wrong person, it shall be the
duty of the Council, within two years after any court shall have declared such
assessment invalid, to cause notice to be given to any person against whom the
cost of such improvement might properly have been assessed under this Charter,
of its intention to lay such assessment against him, and fixing a time and
place at which he may appear and show cause, if any, why such assessment should
not be laid. Said notice shall be served as provided in this Charter for the
giving of notices in assessments proceedings, or in any other manner provided
by law, including by publication, if the person is a non-resident of the City
or cannot be found.
   At the time and place fixed for a hearing under the notice aforesaid, the
Council shall proceed to lay and levy an assessment for the cost of such
permanent improvement in such manner as would have been lawful under proper
proceedings at the time said improvement was made, unless the person so
notified shall show good cause why the same should not be laid, and no further
notice of such assessment shall be necessary. The assessment so laid shall be a
lien upon the property liable therefor, as of the date of the original void, or
voidable, assessment, and shall be recorded in the same manner as is
hereinafter provided. This section shall apply to assessments made and
certificates issued under Section eighty-five of this Charter, as well as to
other assessments and liens for public improvements.
SECTION 87. ADDITIONAL METHOD FOR CONSTRUCTION, ETC., OF SIDEWALKS.
   In addition to the method of securing the laying of sidewalks set out in

sidewalk to be constructed, laid, re-laid, or otherwise permanently improved in
the City of Dunbar in the following manner and upon the following terms: Notice
shall first be given the abutting property owners by publication in some
newspaper of general circulation in the City, giving location, estimated
frontage and depth, but no error in said publication shall in any way affect
the validity of the certificates hereinafter provided for, or any of them. The
contract for same shall, after due advertisement in which Council shall reserve
the right to reject any and all bids, be let to the lowest responsible bidder
and upon completion and acceptance of the work, Council shall order the Mayor
and City Clerk to issue to the contractor doing the work a certificate for the
amount of the assessment to be paid by the owner of any lot or fractional part
thereof fronting on such sidewalk, and the amount specified in said assessment
certificate shall be a lien in the hands of the holder thereof upon the lot or
part of a lot fronting on such sidewalk and such certificate shall draw
interest from the date of said assessment, and the payment may be enforced in
the name of the holder of such certificate by a proper suit in equity in any
court having proper jurisdiction to enforce such liens, and Council shall fix
the amount of such assessments and do all things in connection therewith
necessary to make them valid and do all other things in connection therewith as
is provided for paving or improving streets and alleys and such certificates
shall be issued for each abutting lot or portion thereof payable six months
from the date of the completion and acceptance of the work and shall be a lien
in the hands of the holder thereof upon the particular lot against which they
are assessed in the same way and manner as assessments for street paving liens
under the other provisions of this Charter; provided, however, that Council
shall not order any but concrete sidewalks; and provided, further, that Council
shall not advertise for bids for anyone letting of less than five thousand
(5,000) square feet; and further provided, that Council shall not receive any
bids or let any sidewalk contract between the first day of October and the
first day of March of any years. Nothing in this section shall be so construed
as to prevent any abutting lot owner from having his own sidewalk put in if
done before the advertising hereinbefore mentioned, and provided same is done
according to the lines, grades and specifications of the City Engineer, for
which no charge shall be made. The total cost of construction, laying, re-
laying or otherwise permanently improving any sidewalk or walks shall be borne
by the owners of the land abutting upon said sidewalk or sidewalks according to
the following plan, that is to say, payment is to be made according to the
proportion which the number of square feet in front of any lot or portion
thereof bears to the whole letting. The contract for sidewalks referred to in
this section need not be for one continuous sidewalk, but the five thousand
square feet required for a letting, as aforesaid, may be made up of or composed
of any number of sidewalks in any part of the City.
SECTION 88. ADDITIONAL METHOD OF IMPROVING STREETS AND ALLEYS.
   In addition to the method provided for paving street, by Section sixty-one
of the Charter of the City Dunbar, the Council may order any street, avenue,
public alley, or portion thereof, to be graded and paved, repaved, or otherwise
permanently improved, and the Council may order the Mayor and City Clerk to
issue a certificate for each installment of the amount of the assessment to be
paid by the owner of any lot or fractional part thereof fronting on such
street, avenue or alley. The amount specified in said assessment certificate
shall be a lien as aforesaid in the hands of the holder thereof upon the lot or
part of a lot fronting on such street, avenue, or alley, and such certificate
shall draw interest from the date of said assessment and the payment may be
enforced in the name of the holder of said certificate by proper suit in equity
in any court having jurisdiction to enforce such lien; the Council shall fix
the amount of such assessment, advertise for bids and do all other things in
connection therewith as is provided for paving or permanently improving any
street or alley or any portion thereof in Section sixty-one, except that such
assessment laid under this section shall include the whole cost of such
improvement, including the cost of grading and paving squares at intersections
of streets and curbing, the cost of which intersections shall be apportioned
against the several properties fronting upon thereof so improved; and such
certificates shall be issued in the same number of installments and payable at
the same time as other paving or permanent improvements are provided to be paid
for, and shall be a lien in the hands of the holder thereof upon the particular
lot against which they are assessed in the same way and manner that assessments
are liens under Section sixty-one of said Charter. And nothing contained in
this Charter of the City of Dunbar shall be construed as imposing a time limit
upon the enforcement by appropriate suit of any lien for public improvements,
heretofore or hereafter created.
   Certificates authorized by this section may be issued, sold or negotiated to
the contractor doing the work, or to any other person if the Council deems it
expedient: Provided, that the City in issuing such certificates shall not be
held as guarantor or in any way liable for payment thereof, except upon the
direct action of the Council expressed by resolution of record before sale.
   Certificates so issued shall contain a provision to the effect that in the
event of default in the payment of any one of said certificates, when due, and
said default continuing for a period of sixty days, then all unpaid
certificates shall become due and payable and the holder of said certificates
may proceed to collect all such unpaid certificates in the manner hereinbefore
provided.
SECTION 88b. ADDITIONAL METHOD FOR CONSTRUCTION OF SEWERS.
   In addition to the method for the payment of the cost of construction of
sewers and sewer systems provided by Sections sixty-two and sixty-two-a of the
Charter of the City of Dunbar, the Council may order any sewer or sewer system
so constructed and laid, in any block, street, avenue, alley or in any right of
way or easement, or portion thereof, and the Council may order the Mayor and
City Clerk to issue a certificate for each installment of the amount of the
assessment to be paid by the owner of any lot or fractional part thereof
fronting on such streets, avenues, alleys, rights of way or easements in which
such sewer system is constructed and laid, and the amount specified in said
assessment certificates shall be a lien as aforesaid in the hands of the holder
thereof upon the lot or part of lot fronting on such street, avenue, alley,
right of way or easement, and such certificate shall draw interest from the
date of said assessment and the payment may be enforced in the name of the
holder of said certificate by proper suit in equity in any court having proper
jurisdiction to enforce such lien; the Council shall fix the amount of such
assessment, advertise for bids and do all other things in connection therewith
as is provided in Section sixty-one of said Charter for paving or permanently
improving any street or alley or any portion thereof, the costs of which shall
be apportioned against the several properties fronting upon the street, avenue,
alley, right of way or easement or portion thereof in which the sewer or sewer
system is laid according to the provisions of Section sixty-two or section
sixty-two-a, as the case may be. Such certificates shall be issued in the
following number of installments.
   When the assessment shall not exceed fifty dollars ($50.00) the assessment
and certificates issued thereon shall be in five equal amounts or installments,
due and payable on the first day of May succeeding after completion and
acceptance of said work, and one on the first day of May of each year
thereafter for the next four succeeding years. If more than fifty dollars
($50.00), the assessment and certificates issued thereon shall be in ten equal
amounts or installments, the first of which will be due on the first day of May
next after the completion and acceptance of said work, and one on the first day
of May of each year thereafter for the next nine years; and the term "equal
amounts" herein shall mean as nearly equal as practicable, that is, four
certificates being expressed in terms of dollars each, and, when practical, in
multiples of five, the cents and odd amounts being covered by the first
certificate.
   Every such certificate shall be a lien in the hands of the holder thereof
upon the particular lot against which it is assessed in the same way and manner
that assessments are liens under Sections sixty-two and sixty-two-a of this
Charter. And nothing in the Charter of the City of Dunbar shall be construed as
imposing a time limit upon the enforcement by appropriate suit of any lien for
public improvements heretofore or hereafter created.
   Certificates authorized by this section may be issued, sold or negotiated to
the contractor during the work, or to any other person if the Council deems it
expedient; provided, the City in issuing such certificate shall not be held as
guarantor or in any way liable for the payment thereof, except upon the direct
action of the Council, expressed by resolution of record before sale.
Certificates so issued shall contain a provision to the effect that in the
event of default in the payment of any one of said certificates, when due, said
default continuing for a period of sixty days, then all unpaid certificates
shall become due and payable and the holder of said certificates may proceed to
collect all of such unpaid certificates in the manner hereinbefore provided;
provided, that no sewer or sewer system shall be constructed or laid pursuant
to this section except and unless two-thirds of the members elected to the
Council shall concur in the passage of the ordinance providing therefor, and
the vote thereon shall be taken by ayes and noes, and duly entered upon the
record.
SECTION 88c. SUBDIVISION OF LAND FOR PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENT FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
   If the abutting land on any avenue, street, road or alley sought to be
graded, paved, re- paved or otherwise improved, or on any avenue, street, road,
alley, right-of-way or easement in which a sewer or sewer system is ordered
laid, under any of the provisions of the Charter of the City of Dunbar, is not
subdivided or laid off in lots by a map or deed of record, the Council may, for
the purpose of making the assessments provided for in this section and other
sections herein, subdivide said land into lots of such size as the Council
deems advisable for the purpose of laying the proper assessment against such
land.

detailed report to the Manager and Council, at least once every month. He shall
be appointed in the way and manner provided by this Charter and shall receive
such salary as Council may by ordinance prescribe. Nothing herein, however,
shall be construed as in any way affecting the police officers of the City
relative to their powers and duties in regard to City sanitation contained and
set forth elsewhere in this Charter.
SECTION 92. POLICE MATRON.
   The Mayor may appoint a reputable woman who shall be known as police matron;

properly printed and securely bound in a permanent book. The Council may by
ordinance adopt the code to be prepared as a whole and when said ordinance
adopting said code shall have been passed by the Council the said code shall be

the tenor and effect thereof, and when printed in a book, the same shall be
received as evidence as the ordinances of said City, unless errors or omissions
be affirmatively shown therein, and no other publication thereof shall be made
or required under the Charter, and the Council shall cause all the ordinances
of said City, by printing a supplement thereof, or otherwise, to be brought up
to date within a reasonable time after the printing of such ordinances, and in
any event such supplement shall be printed, or, if necessary, a new copy of the
ordinances shall be printed, at least once every four years; and the Council
shall cause such number of said books of the ordinances to be printed and sell
such number thereof at such prices as may be reasonable, and the number of
books printed shall be fixed by the Council.
SECTION 94. CEMETERIES.

places for the burial of the dead, which places may be in or out of the
corporate limits of the City. The City shall cause such places to be laid off
into cemetery lots in a reasonable and proper way and shall sell said lots for
a reasonable price; but it may take into consideration the location of each of
said lots in fixing the prices therefor. The City Council shall have all the
powers and rights of condemnation of any real estate that it may wish for such

ordinances providing suitable penalties to carry out the powers here given said
City.
   No moneys received from the sale of lots in any cemetery so owned, or
hereafter owned, by said City shall be used for any other purpose than the
proper care and preparation of the ground, upkeep and expenses of said
cemetery, the roads and ways to and through the same and for the purpose of
additional property for cemetery purposes. Provided, however, that nothing
herein contained shall in any wise affect any person, firm or corporation now
lawfully engaged in the sale of cemetery lots, unless such property be acquired
by the City through purchase or condemnation.

   When reference is made to any section or group of sections of the Codified

appear in a state of gross intoxication in a public place; such police officer
may, without warrant or other process, or further proof, arrest such offender
or offending person, and if upon hearing the testimony of such officer and
other witnesses, if any are then there produced, the court be convinced that
such offense be proved, it shall require the offender to give bond or

prescribed for the charge. (1978 Code Sec. 22-1.)

summon to his assistance, either orally or in writing, any person, or so many
of the male inhabitants of the City of the age of eighteen or more to assist
him as shall be deemed sufficient for the necessities of the occasion; and any
such officer, and those assisting him, may use such force as shall be necessary
or proper to overcome any resistance made to the executive of any warrant,
order, summons, or other process; and any such officer or persons assisting him
may seize and arrest and confine such persons making resistance, their aiders
and abettors. (1978 Code Sec. 22-2.)

safety or welfare. The City Council further finds that these properties are

impair existing remedies of the City of Dunbar or its officers of agencies
relating to the maintenance of property in a safe and sanitary condition, nor
shall any portion of this Article be read to require, or preclude, the use of
the Property Board when another remedy is available to the City.
   (b)    Authority Under State Law. The City of Dunbar is authorized under
State Law to create and establish the Property Board, established hereby, and
to endow the same with the powers and authority set forth in this article.
(W.Va. Code §§ 8-12-5(23), (44), (45) and W.Va. Code §8-12-16).
   (c)    Authorization. The City Council of the City of Dunbar hereby finds
that the following ordinances have been enacted by the City Council and that
they have been enacted consistent with the authority granted to the City by

Council hereby authorizes the Property Board to act, in conformity with the
terms and conditions of this Article and with State law, to enforce the
following substantive ordinances of the City of Dunbar:

other potential hazard located thereon, upon reasonable suspicion or
observation, for the purpose of investigating whether the same may constitute a

virtue of said conviction in connection with violating a municipal ordinance of
the City. The Fee shall be used exclusively to offset the cost to the City of
housing such person in a Regional Jail.
   (b)    Fee Imposed. The Fee shall be in an amount not to exceed the daily
rate charged to the City by the Regional Jail for the incarceration of the
person convicted, as such rates may be set from time to time by the West

171.10 , a hearing shall be held to determine the person's ability to pay. A
person shall not be sentenced to pay the Fee permitted to be charged to the
person under this Section

the Fee. In determining the amount and method of payment, the person's
financial resources and the nature of the burden that payment will impose shall
be taken into account. At the discretion of the Municipal Judge, the Fee may be
modified or waived in whole or in part provided that the Fee may not exceed the

assessed the Fee under this Section
171.10  who is not in willful default in the payment thereof may, at any time,
petition the Municipal Court for a reduction or remission of the payment of
costs or of any unpaid portion of the costs. If it appears to the satisfaction
of the Municipal Court that the payment of the amount due will impose manifest
hardship on the convicted person or the convicted person's family or
dependents, the Municipal Court may excuse payment of all or part of the amount
due in costs, or modify the method of payment. (W.Va. Code § 7-8-14).
   (e)    Regional Jail. Regional Jail shall mean any facility operated by the

not be limited to the South Central Regional Jail. (Ord. 682. Passed 10-15-12.)

of court, however, when the Municipal Judge is sitting in the capacity as a
magistrate, either party shall be entitled to a continuance of the cause for

police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged

though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.

313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02 , may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07 ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter,
deface, injure, knock down or remove any official traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
other part thereof.
(WVaC 17C-3-9)

to the speed limit and any other traffic restrictions.
   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this
section.

applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No

(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described
under subsection (f) or (g) of this section, is or has been legally entitled to
use alcohol, a controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense

of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:

a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b
to persons adjudicated thereunder. An order for home detention by the court
pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B-1 et seq. may be used
as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation

motor vehicle can be reinstated and his or her driving privileges restored.
   (p)   For any offense for which an alternative revocation period is
permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the

333.011 PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM.
   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,
without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, shall
defer further proceedings and impose probation, when:
         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:
      (1)    In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision

333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5 has been charged;

commercial motor vehicles;
      (3)    If the person has previously had his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle revoked for any offense under a municipal ordinance of this state
or any other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state
which has the same elements as an offense described in this article; or
      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

   (f)   Any person whose vehicle properly displays a valid, unexpired special
registration plate or removable windshield placard may park the vehicle for
unlimited periods of time in parking zones unrestricted as to length of parking
time permitted: Provided, that this privilege does not mean that the vehicle
may park in any zone where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited or which
creates parking zones for special types of vehicles or which prohibits parking
during heavy traffic periods during specified rush hours or where parking would
clearly present a traffic hazard. To the extent any provision of any ordinance
of any political subdivision of this State is contrary to the provisions of
this section, the provisions of this section take precedence and apply.
   The parking privileges provided for in this subsection apply only during
those times when the vehicle is being used for the loading or unloading of a
person with a mobility impairment. Any person who knowingly exercises, or
attempts to exercise, these privileges at a time when the vehicle is not being

otherwise incur, shall be fined two hundred dollars ($200.00); upon second
conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty, he or she may otherwise

either by itself or with explanatory text. The signs may be mounted on a post
or a wall in front of the accessible parking space and instructions may appear
on the ground or pavement, but use of both methods is preferred. Accessible
parking spaces for vans having an eight-foot adjacent access aisle should be
designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.
   Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).

the international symbol of access shall also include the words “Up to $500
fine”.
   (i)   No person may stop, stand or park a motor vehicle in an area
designated or marked off as an access aisle adjacent to a van-accessible
parking space or regular accessible parking space. Any person, including a
driver of a vehicle displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special
registration plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).

may issue citations for violations of this section and shall reference the
number on the vehicle’s license plate, since the driver normally will not be
present.
   (k)   Law-enforcement agencies may establish a program to use trained
volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or
otherwise shall go into the local authorities’ General Revenue Fund. Otherwise,
any moneys collected as fines shall be collected for and remitted to the state.

519.01 STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   (a)   Council recognizes and declares that abandoned motor vehicles, junked
motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative
household appliances are and constitute a public nuisance and hazard to both
adults and children, and therefore are dangerous and constitute a clear and
present danger; that such abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old
vehicles tires and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances serve
as harborage and breeding places for rodents, mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, mice,
rats and other insects, pests and flies injurious to the public health, safety
and general welfare; that abandoned motor vehicles and junked motor vehicles
serve frequently as temporary or permanent places of human residence
unconducive to the public health, safety and welfare; and that the accumulation
and storage of any of such items or parts thereof on private or public
property, including but not limited to highways, is hereby found to create a
condition tending to reduce the value of private property and to promote blight
and deterioration which, if permitted to remain, will continue to destroy the
natural beauty of this City and have adverse economic and social effects; that
such abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and
certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances constitute an attractive
nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors; that such items
are nearly always located on public highways, rights of way or within sight of
such highway, rights of way and on private property within a reasonable
proximity thereto, and when so located the cost of controlling or abating such
visual pollution is a detriment to economic development; and that is in the
public interest and welfare to provide for a program to eliminate the unsightly
practice of abandoning motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned
or inoperative household appliances.
   (b)   In view of these findings Council declares it to be the public policy
of this City to eliminate the present danger resulting from abandoned motor
vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or
inoperative household appliances and to eliminate the visual pollution
resulting from these items, and that in order to provide for the public health,
safety, welfare and quality of life, to enact legislation to that and by
providing expeditious means and methods for effecting the disposal of abandoned
motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires, and certain abandoned
household appliances. Council further finds and declares that the presence of
an abandoned motor vehicle, junked motor vehicle, old vehicle tire, or an
abandoned or inoperative household appliance, or any part thereof, on private
or public property, including but not limited to highways, except as expressly
hereinafter permitted, is a public nuisance injurious to the public health,
safety and general welfare of the residents of the City which shall be abated
as such by the methods provided in this article.

such motor vehicle shall take title to such motor vehicle free and clear of all
liens and claims of ownership, and shall receive a sales receipt from the
enforcement agency which disposed of such motor vehicle. The sales receipt at
such sale shall be sufficient title only for purposes of transferring such

account designated as the “abandoned vehicle disposal account”, and any money
so collected and deposited shall be used solely by the Police Department for
the payment of auction, towing, preserving, storage and all notice and
publication costs which result from placing other abandoned vehicles in
custody, whenever the proceeds from a sale of those abandoned vehicles are
insufficient to meet these expenses and costs. The abandoned vehicle disposal
account shall be under the direction and control of the City Treasurer, who

guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99  and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child

necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and

assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that

   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

705.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used herein the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below:
   (a)   “Alarm system” means equipment designed to signal illegal entry or
other activity for which the Police Department is requested to respond to a
silent or audible alarm, but does not include an automatic alarm.
   (b)   “Alarm user” means any person, company, or other entity, whose
business premises or residence is protected by an alarm system within the City.
   (c)   “False alarm” means an alarm not resulting from an unauthorized entry,
robbery or where no other crime was committed or attempted at the premises. An
alarm caused by power failure shall not be deemed a false alarm unless the
power outage lasts longer than the alarm system’s battery backup. A false alarm
does not include an alarm that activates during violent weather.
      (Ord. 590. Passed 1-21-03.)
705.02 ALARM SYSTEM REGISTRATION.
   An alarm user shall register its alarm system with the City by completing a
registration application prepared by the Dunbar Police Department for such
purpose in accordance with this section, and by filing such application with
the Dunbar Police Department.
   Registration shall be free and must be renewed on or by July 1st of each
year. Notwithstanding general penalties set forth in this article, an alarm
user who fails to register an alarm system or renew a registration after
receipt of three written notices from the Dunbar Police Department of the
obligation to do so may thereafter be subjected to a fine of $100.00 on each
occasion on which such alarm system records a false alarm and remains
unregistered or has not been renewed.
   The registration application shall provide the Dunbar Police Department with
a record of the company or firm that installed the alarm system, the names and
telephone numbers of contact people or key holder to call when an alarm is
activated, and information concerning the maintenance and inspection of the
alarm system. The registration application shall also confirm whether the alarm
system includes an audible alarm or siren, and, if so, whether such alarm
system has an automatic 15-minute shutoff switch. The alarm user shall notify
the Dunbar Police Department of any changes in any information set forth in its
application within 30 days of each such change.
   Notwithstanding the general penalties set forth in this article, each such
failure to notify the Dunbar Police Department of such changes may result in a
$100.00 fine.

709.01 CREATION OF BOARD; COMPOSITION; APPOINTMENT; TERMS; MEETINGS.
   (a)    For the purpose of authorizing, regulating, restricting and
controlling the public begging or soliciting of money, subscriptions, and or
contributions for any charitable, religious, educational and/or benevolent
purpose as herein set forth, there is hereby created a nonpartisan Board of
Supervisors of Public Solicitation of Funds consisting of five members who
shall be over the age of twenty-one years, residents of the City, who shall be
appointed by the Mayor and one of whom shall hold office for a term of one
year, one for a term of two years, one for a term of three years, one for a
term of four years and one for a term of five years, all of whom are to serve
without salary or until their successors are appointed and qualified.
   (b)    The chairman of the Board shall be elected by the Board from its
membership and the Board shall have power to prescribe rules and regulations
for the carrying out of the purpose expressed in this article. The Board shall
meet in regular session at least once a month at a time to be fixed by the
Board, and shall meet more often if necessary to perform the duties imposed on
the Board by this article. The Board shall have authority to issue placards or
notices for the use of all persons in giving the public notice that no
contributions are made for the purpose set forth in this chapter except to
solicitors authorized by the Board.
(1978 Code Sec. 24-1.)
709.02 UNAUTHORIZED SOLICITING PROHIBITED.
   (a)    The unauthorized, unrestricted and regulated public begging or
solicitation in the City of money, subscriptions or contributions for any
charitable, educational or benevolent purpose, upon the street, in public
places, buildings, and from house to house, or by the use of the telephone or
otherwise, is unlawful.
   (b)    Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent or forbid any pastor,
priest, rabbi, rector, or minister of the gospel or the governing body of any
church, from soliciting funds within their membership exclusively for religious
and church purpose.
   (c)    The offering for sale of tickets for any dance, show or other
performance represented as being for the benefit of a charitable purpose shall
be deemed to be the solicitation of money within the prohibition of this
section. (1978 Code Sec. 24-2.)
709.03 APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO SOLICIT FUNDS.
   Any person desiring to solicit money, subscriptions and/or contributions as

forth, shall file with the Board of Supervisors of Public Solicitation and
shall answer, under oath, all of the questions contained in the form and
furnish to the Board all such information with reference to public solicitation
of funds as may be of assistance to the Board in determining whether permission
shall be given to such person for the purpose of soliciting funds for the
aforementioned purposes. The failure or refusal to file such application and
furnish such information shall constitute sufficient grounds for the Board or
the secretary of the Board to decline the application of the applicant for
permission to solicit funds for the purpose herein set forth. The Board may
impose such conditions and terms precedent to the issuance of the permit
hereinafter provided for as it may deem reasonable. (1978 Code Sec. 24-3.)
709.04 ISSUANCE OF PERMITS; APPEALS.
   (a)    The Board of Supervisors of Public Solicitation shall designate one
of their members to be secretary of the Board, who shall be a member of the
Board and the Board shall have authority to fix his salary if any funds are
available for this purpose. The secretary shall investigate all applications of
persons desiring to solicit funds for charitable, religious, educational and/or
benevolent purposes, determine that the purpose of such solicitation is a bona
fide charitable, religious, educational and/or benevolent purpose, and that the
applicant for permit will solicit in good faith and in the manner authorized
for such bona fide charitable, religious, educational and/or benevolent purpose
and that the proper proportion of the money subscribed and or contributed will
be used for the purpose for which the subscription and/or contribution is made.
The Secretary shall, if he is satisfied that these conditions are met, issue to
such applicant or applicants a card giving the name of the person so authorized
to solicit; the purpose for which the funds are being solicited; the time
within which solicitations of money, contributions and or subscriptions are
permitted; the manner in which such solicitation is authorized; and whether the
person soliciting funds is being paid for his or her services as such
solicitor. It shall not be necessary for each solicitor to apply to the Board
where more than one person is soliciting for the same purpose, but a general
application for such person may be made by any one of them and cards for all
such solicitors may be issued upon one application therefor.
   (b)    If the secretary after investigation of any application for a permit
to solicit funds as herein provided decides that such permit should not be
issued, the secretary shall decline to issue such permit, and the person whose
application has been declined by the secretary shall have the right of appeal
to the Board, and the Board shall hear and determine the application and appeal
at an open meeting after notice thereof to the applicant and appellant, and the
decision of a majority of the members of the Board, after such hearing, shall
be binding on all of the parties thereto.
   (c)    An appeal from the decision of the Board may be taken before Council,
who shall, in such instance, have the power to sustain or reverse the decision
of the Board. No appeal to Council shall be recognized as such until after
notice of such appeal has been published in at least one newspaper in the City
for two consecutive weeks and at the time of such hearing the secretary or some
other member of the Board shall be present to furnish Council with full
information in support of its decision.
(1978 Code Sec. 24-4.)

all times when soliciting such funds a permit or certificate from the Board of
Supervisors of Public Solicitation authorizing such person to solicit money,

such solicitation or fund is made. Any person soliciting funds, subscriptions
and/or contributions without such permit or certificate duly issued by the
Board or in any manner not authorized by the Board shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor. (1978 Code Sec. 24-5.)
709.06 HEARING BY BOARD AS TO VIOLATIONS.
   In the event of violation of the condition, limitation. or restriction
imposed in the granting of any permit provided for in this article or in the
event of the misapplication of any funds collected thereunder, the Board of
Supervisors of Public Solicitation may suspend the effectiveness of the permit
pending a hearing before it as to whether or not any condition, limitation or
restriction imposed by the Board in the granting of such permit has been
violated. Such suspension of the permit shall be in effect only until the
hearing before the Board, upon reasonable notice, at which hearing the person,
in person or by counsel, may produce evidence. The Board is hereby authorized
to hear testimony, swear witnesses, and it may require the production of paper
and documents by subpoena to be served by any lawful police officer of the
City. If upon hearing the Board shall determine that this article has been
violated, or any condition, limitation or restriction imposed in any permit has
been violated, the Board may cancel the permit or may suspend the effectiveness

of the consideration of the matter by the finance committee and may hear the
facts and circumstances of the matter in executive session pursuant to W.Va.
Code § 29B-l-4(5) pertaining to information that is specifically exempted from
disclosure by statute. (See W.Va. Code § 11-10-5d).
   (i)    Forms for Claim for Refund or a Credit. The City Clerk may issue
forms for the submission of any information necessary for a taxpayer to claim a
refund or credit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where the taxpayer has
overpaid the tax imposed by a return, signed by the taxpayer, which shows on
its face that an overpayment of tax has been made, the form itself shall
constitute a claim for refund or credit.
   (j)    Applicability of this Section. The provisions of this Section apply
to refunds or credits of any tax or fee, additions to tax or fee, penalties or
interest imposed by the City of Dunbar.
   (k)    Erroneous Refund or Credit. If the City Clerk believes that an
erroneous refund has been made or an erroneous credit has been established, he
or she may proceed to investigate and make an assessment or institute civil
action to recover the amount of the refund or credit, within two years from the
date the erroneous refund was paid or the erroneous credit was established,
except that the assessment may be issued or civil action brought within five
years from the date if it appears that any portion of the refund or credit was
induced by fraud or misrepresentation of a material fact.
   (l)   Limitation on Claims for Refund or Credit. 
      (1)   General rule. Whenever a taxpayer claims to be entitled to a refund
or credit of any tax (or fee), additions to tax, penalties or interest imposed
by the City of Dunbar, the taxpayer shall file a claim for refund, or credit,
within three years after the due date of the return in respect of which the tax
(or fee) was imposed, determined by including any extension of time for filing
the return authorized in writing by the City Clerk, and not thereafter.
      (2)   Extensions of time for filing claim by agreement. The City Clerk
and the taxpayer may enter into a written agreement to extend the period within
which the taxpayer may file a claim for refund or credit, which period shall
not exceed two years. The period agreed upon may be extended for additional
periods not in excess of two years each by subsequent agreements in writing
made before expiration of the period previously agreed upon.
   (m)    Overpayments. Interest shall be allowed and paid at the annual rate
established under section West Virginia Code §11-10-17a, from the date the
claim for refund or credit is filed. The interest shall be allowed and paid for
the period commencing with the date of the filing by the taxpayer of a claim
for refund or credit with the City Clerk and ending with the date of a final
determination of overpayment. The City Clerk shall, within thirty days after
the determination of entitlement to refund, issue his or her requisition or
establish a credit as requested by the taxpayer.

or if the City Clerk/Treasurer has reasonable grounds to believe that any
return made is so deficient as not to form the basis of a satisfactory
assessment of -the tax, he may proceed as he deems best to obtain information
on which to base the assessment of the tax. The City Clerk/Treasurer may by
himself or his duly appointed agent, make examination of the books, records and
papers, and audit the accounts of any such person, and may take evidence,
administered by himself or his agent, on oath, of any person who he may believe
shall be in possession of any relevant information. As soon as possible after
procuring such information as he may be able to obtain as to any person failing
or refusing to make a return, the City Clerk/Treasurer shall proceed to assess
the tax and shall notify the person assessed of the amount of the tax. The
assessment of the tax by the City Clerk/Treasurer shall be final as to any
person who refused to make a return.

such hearing. After such hearing, Council may make such order in the matter as
may appear to it just and lawful and shall furnish a copy of such order to the
petitioner. Any person improperly charged with any tax and required to pay the

at the time of such sales, such tax shall not, for purposes of this article, be
regarded as having accrued until the date on which it is either received by the
hotel operator or upon the expiration of the thirty-day payment period set
forth in Section
738.05, whichever shall first occur. The hotel operator shall, on or before the
fifteenth day of each month, prepare and deliver to the City a return for the

official of the City charged with the responsiblity of collecting taxes due to

SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED IN THE CASES OF USERS PRODUCING
UNUSUAL WASTE
The charge for the treatment of unusual waste will be calculated on the basis
of the following formula:
Ci = VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
   Ci   =   Charge to unusual users per year.
   Vo   =   Average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume,
in dollars per gallon.
   Vi   =   Volume of wastewater from unusual users in gallons per year.
   Bo   =   Average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen
Demand ("BOD") in dollars per pound.
   Bi   =   Weight of BOD from unusual users in pounds per year.
   So   =   Average unit cost of treatment (including sludge treatment)
chargeable to total solids in dollars per pound.
   Si   =   Weight of total solids from unusual users in pounds per year.
When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and
the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made. Waste containing
materials which, in the judgment of the City of Dunbar Sanitary Board, should
not be introduced into the sewer system need not be handled by it. The results
of this preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of the
proposed sewer service and the charge therefore, based upon the formula set out
above.
Thereafter, unusual sewage service will be monitored on a regular basis and at
the conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and
audit of the City of Dunbar Sanitary Board's records, new cost figures will be
calculated for use in the above formula. The cost of establishing the
monitoring facilities shall be paid by the unusual user. Based on these audited
figures, additional billings covering the past fiscal year will be made for
payment by each unusual user, or refund given by the City of Dunbar Sanitary
Board, as the case may be. Such audited figures will then be used for the
preliminary billing for the next fiscal year, at the end of which an adjustment
will be made as aforesaid.
SCHEDULE NO. 4
FORMULA FOR CERTAIN NON-METERED INDUSTRIAL PLANTS
Applicable inside and outside of the corporate limits of the City of Dunbar
Sanitary Board.
Where the amount of sanitary sewage discharged into the City of Dunbar's waste
treatment system by certain industrial plant or plants cannot be accurately
determined by the use of the plant's water meter or meters, and said plant
cannot install a flow meter to measure such waste, a special formula will be
used whereby such plant or plants will pay to the Sanitary Board a sewer charge
calculated at fifty (50) gallons of water per each employee at the plant each
working day.
SCHEDULE NO. 5
LEAK ADJUSTMENT
$0.78 per 1,000 gallons shall be charged for usage if the leak is eligible
under the (i) Public Service Commission's rules for leaks on the customer's
side of the meter, and (ii) the utility's leak adjustment policy.
SCHEDULE NO. 6

District: $1.67 per bill.
SCHEDULE NO. 8

connected to the utility's sewer system, and such customer has failed to take
appropriate action within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand by the
utility in accordance with the Rules of the Public Service Commission to
eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the customer

preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed
sewer service and the charge therefore, based upon the formula set out above.
   (d)   Thereafter, industrial sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and
at the conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and
audit of Sanitary Board records, new cost figures will be calculated for use in
the above formula. The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities shall be
paid by the industrial user. Based on these audited figures, additional
billings covering the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each
industrial user, or refund given by the Sanitary Board, as the case may be.
Such audited figures will then be used for preliminary billing for the next
fiscal year, at the end of which an adjustment will be made as aforesaid. (Ord.

dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to sodium chloride and sodium
sulfate).
         B.    Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works.
         C.    Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions).
         D.    Unusual volume or flow or concentration of wastes constituting
"slugs" as defined herein.
      (10)    Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.
   (e)    If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the substances or possess
the characteristics enumerated in subsection (d) hereof, and which in the
judgment of the Sanitary Board may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage
works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Sanitary Board may:
      (1)    Reject the wastes;
      (2)    Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewer;
      (3)    Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; or
      (4)    Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes not covered by existing taxes or sewer charges.
   If the Sanitary Board permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste
flows, the design and installation of the plants and equipment shall be subject
to the review and approval of the Sanitary Board, and subject to the
requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws.
   (f)    Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Sanitary Board, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes,
sand or other harmful ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be
required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors of the
Sanitary Board shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Sanitary Board
and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection.
   (g)    Where preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities are
provided for any waters or wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense.
   (h)    When required by the Sanitary Board, the owner of any property
serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall install a
suitable control manhole together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and
measurement of the wastes. Such manhole, when required, shall be accessible and
safely located, and shall be construed in accordance with plans approved by the
Sanitary Board. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and
shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times.
   (i)    All measurements, tests and analyses of the characteristics of waters
and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in
accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examination of
Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples
taken at the control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream
manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is
connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular analyses
involved will determine whether a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls of
a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids and analyses are obtained
from a twenty-four hour composite of all outfalls whereas pH is determined from
periodic grab samples.
   (j)    No statement contained in this article shall be construed as
preventing any special agreement or arrangement between the City and any
industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character
may be accepted by the City or the Sanitary Board for treatment, subject to
payment therefor, by the industrial concern.
   (k)    No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully or negligently
break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface or tamper with any structure,
appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the sewage works. Any person
violating this provision shall be subject to immediate arrest under charge of
disorderly conduct.
(Ord. 375. Passed 8-16-76.)

properties through which the City or the Sanitary Board holds a duly negotiated
easement for the purpose of, but not limited to, inspection, observation,
measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the sewage
works lying within such easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on the
easement, shall be done in full accordance with the terms of the duly
negotiated easement pertaining to the private property involved.
(Ord. 375. Passed 8-16-76.)
925.99 PENALTY.
   (a)    Any person found to be violating any provision of this article except
Section
925.05(k) shall be served by the Sanitary Board or the City with written notice
stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for
the satisfactory correction thereof. The offender shall, within the period of
time stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations.

926.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Findings of Fact. It is hereby determined that land development
projects and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic
response of local watersheds and increase storm water runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; this
storm water runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne
pollutants, and; stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution
can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development sites. Therefore, the City of Dunbar establishes this set of
water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide
reasonable guidance for the regulation of storm water runoff for the purpose of
protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the
regulation of storm water runoff discharges from land development projects and
other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in
storm water runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public
interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety.
   (b)   Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within
this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet
that purpose through the following objectives:
      (1)   Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in
order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and
streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream channels.
      (2)   Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by storm
water runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water
quality.
      (3)   Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which
flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the
pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable.
      (4)   Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management
controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained
and pose no threat to public safety.
   (c)   Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all subdivision or
site plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by
the City of Dunbar under the specifications of Section
926.04 . The article also applies to land development activities that are
smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of
a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability
criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development
activities may take place at different times on different schedules. In
addition, all plans must also be reviewed by local environmental protection
officials to ensure that established water quality standards will be maintained
during and after development of the site and that post construction runoff
levels are consistent with any local and regional watershed plans.
   To prevent the adverse impacts of stormwater runoff, the City of Dunbar has
developed a set of performance standards that must be met at new development
sites. These standards apply to any construction activity disturbing 2500 or
more square feet of land. The following activities may be exempt from these
stormwater performance criteria:
      (1)   Any logging and agricultural activity which is consistent with an
approved soil conservation plan or a timber management plan prepared or
approved by the WVDEP as applicable.
      (2)   Additions or modifications to existing single family structures.
      (3)   Developments that do not disturb more than 2500 square feet of
land, provided they are not part of a larger common development plan; and do
not create more than 1000 square feet of impervious cover.
      (4)   Repairs to any stormwater treatment practice deemed necessary by
the City of Dunbar. When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as
a redevelopment project as defined in Section
926.02 , decisions on permitting and on-site storm water requirements shall be
governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the current storm water
design manual. This criteria is dependent on the amount of impervious area
created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final
authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review
by the City of Dunbar.
   Construction activities that disturb less than 2500 square feet of land do
not have to file a stormwater management plan, but must comply with established
erosion and sediment control measures. Such standards will be issued with a
City of Dunbar building permit.
   (d)   Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements. This
article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law. The
requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and
where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those
imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law,
whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards
for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence.
   (e)   Severability. If the provisions of any section, subsection, paragraph,
subdivision or clause of this article shall be judged invalid by a court of
competent jurisdiction, such order of judgment shall not affect or invalidate
the remainder of any article, section, subsection, paragraph, subdivision or
clause of this article.
   (f)   Development of a Stormwater Design Manual.
      (1)   The City of Dunbar may furnish additional policy, criteria and
information including specifications and standards, for the proper
implementation of the requirements of this article and may provide such
information in the form of a Stormwater Design Manual.
      (2)   This manual will include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment
practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance
requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated and
expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the local review authority,
based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance
experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in
accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the
minimum water quality performance standards.

(Ord. 654. Passed 7-6-10.)
926.04 WAIVERS TO STORMWATER MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Waivers for Providing Stormwater Management. Every applicant shall
provide for stormwater management as required by this article, unless a written
request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the storm water
management plan requirements shall be submitted to the City of Dunbar for
approval. The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in
whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least
one of the following conditions applies:
      (1)   It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely
to impair attainment of the objectives of this article.
      (2)   Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of
stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan
that has been approved by the City of Dunbar and the implementation of the plan
is required by local ordinance.
      (3)   Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility.
The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately
sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than
that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally
obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the
storm water practice.
      (4)   The City of Dunbar finds that meeting the minimum on-site
management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical
characteristics of a site.
      (5)   Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce the
generation of storm water from the site, the size and cost of storm water
storage and the pollutants generated at the site. These non-structural
practices are explained in detail in the current design manual and the amount
of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the City of
Dunbar.
         A.   In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the City
of Dunbar may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater
management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided.
         B.   However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City of Dunbar that the variance will
not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways:
            1.   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures;
            2.   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
            3.   Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation;
            4.   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life,
property.
         C.   Furthermore, where compliance with minimum requirements for
stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum
requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the
jurisdictional stormwater authority. Mitigation measures may include, but are
not limited to, the following:
            1.   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the
grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation.
These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to
provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat.
            2.   The creation of a storm water management facility or other
drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private,
that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed
in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article.
            3.   Monetary contributions (Fee-in-Lieu) to fund stormwater
management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland
delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and
macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species
studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices.
   (b)   Fee in Lieu of Stormwater Management Practices.
      (1)   Where the City of Dunbar waives all or part of the minimum
stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the
provision of adequate storm water facilities provided downstream of the
proposed development, the applicant shall be required to pay a fee in an amount
as determined by the City of Dunbar.
      (2)   When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater
management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a
fee schedule (unless the developer and the stormwater authority agree on a
greater alternate contribution) established by the City of Dunbar and based on
the cubic feet of storage required for storm water management of the
development in question. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to
an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the
developer prior to the issuance of any building permit for the development.
   (c)   Dedication of Land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant
may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management by entering into an
agreement with the City of Dunbar for the granting of an easement or the
dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-
site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the
applicant and the City of Dunbar prior to the recording of plats or, if no
record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the building permit.
(Ord. 654. Passed 7-6-10.)
926.05 GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   Unless judged by the City of Dunbar to be exempt or granted a waiver, the
following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at
all sites:
   (a)   All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to
control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified
design storms and reduce the generation of storm water. These practices should
seek to utilize pervious areas for storm water treatment and to infiltrate
storm water runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and
landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both
water quality and quantity.
   (b)   All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not
discharge untreated storm water directly into a jurisdictional wetland or local
water body without adequate treatment. Where such discharges are proposed, the
impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a
method acceptable to the City of Dunbar. In no case shall the impact on
functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACE)
or the WVDEP responsible for natural resources.
   (c)   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained, by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods. At a
minimum, annual recharge from the post development site shall mimic the annual
recharge from pre-development site conditions.
   (d)   For new development, structural stormwater treatment practices shall
be designed to remove 80 % of the average annual post development total
suspended solids load (TSS). It is presumed that a STP complies with this
performance standard if it is:
      (1)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQv).
      (2)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in
the local stormwater design manual, constructed properly, and maintained
regularly.
   (e)   To protect stream channels from degradation, a specific channel
protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the current stormwater
manual.
   (f)   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., cold water fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas,
water supply reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or
may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
   (g)   Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a
stormwater pollution prevention plan, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI)
under the provisions of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement
applies to both existing and new industrial sites.
   (h)   Storm water discharges from land uses or activities with higher
potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of
specific structural STPs and pollution prevention practices.
   (i)   Prior to design, applicants are required to consult with the City of
Dunbar to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design
requirements.
   (j)   The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the Stormwater
Design Manual shall be used for sizing all stormwater management practices.
      (Ord. 654. Passed 7-6-10.)
926.06 BASIC STORMWATER MANAGEMENT DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Minimum Control Requirements.
      (1)   All stormwater management practices will be designed so that the
specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water quality,
channel protection, 10 year, 100 year) as identified in the current stormwater
design manual are met, unless the City of Dunbar grants the applicant a waiver
or the applicant is exempt from such requirements.
      (2)   In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant
greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the
City of Dunbar reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements
deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
   (b)   Site Design Feasibility.
      (1)   Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on
the physical conditions of the site. Among the factors that should be
considered:
         Topography
         Maximum Drainage Area
         Depth to Water Table
         Soils
         Slopes
         Terrain
         Head
      (2)   Location in relation to environmentally sensitive features or
ultra-urban areas. Applicants shall consult the Stormwater Design Manual for
guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a
stormwater management practice.
   (c)   Conveyance Issues. All stormwater management practices shall be
designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants
and reduction in flow velocities. This shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Maximizing of flowpaths from inflow points to outflow points.
      (2)   Protection of inlet and outfall structures.
      (3)   Elimination of erosive flow velocities.
      (4)   Providing of underdrain systems, where applicable.
      (5)   The Stormwater Design Manual shall provide detailed guidance on the
requirements for conveyance for each of the approved storm water management
practices.
   (d)   Pretreatment Requirements. Every stormwater treatment practice shall
have an acceptable form of water quality pretreatment, in accordance with the
pretreatment requirements found in the current stormwater design manual.
Certain stormwater treatment practices, as specified in the Stormwater Design
Manual, are prohibited even with pretreatment in the following circumstances:
      (1)   Stormwater is generated from highly contaminated source areas known
as "hotspots".
      (2)   Stormwater is carried in a conveyance system that also carries
contaminated, nonstormwater discharges.
      (3)   Storm water is being managed in a designated groundwater recharge
area.
      (4)   Certain geologic conditions exist (e.g., karst) that prohibit the
proper pretreatment of storm water.
   (e)   Treatment/Geometry Conditions. All stormwater management practices
shall be designed to capture and treat stormwater runoff according to the
specifications outlined in the Storm Water Design Manual. These specifications
will designate the water quantity and quality treatment criteria that apply to
an approved stormwater management practice.
   (f)   Landscaping Plans Required. All stormwater management practices must
have a landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and
how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. This plan must be
prepared by a registered landscape architect or soil conservation district.
   (g)   Maintenance Agreements. All storm water treatment practices shall have
an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system
functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance
easements required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices,
and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of
the storm water treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant
specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater
treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land
disturbance activities.
   (h)   Non-Structural Stormwater Practices. The use of non-structural storm
water treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on
structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount of storm
water that must be managed can be earned through the use of nonstructural
practices that reduce the generation of stormwater from the site. These
nonstructural practices are explained in detail in the current design manual
and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of non-structural practices
must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered by
subsequent property owners.
(Ord. 654. Passed 7-6-10.)
926.07 REQUIREMENTS FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   Stormwater Management Plan Required for All Developments.

attention should be paid to environmentally sensitive features that provide
particular opportunities or constraints for development.
         D.   A written description of the required maintenance burden for any
proposed storm water management facility.
      (2)   The City of Dunbar may also require a concept plan to consider the
maximum development potential of a site under existing zoning, regardless of
whether the applicant presently intends to develop the site to its maximum
potential.
      (3)   For development or redevelopment occurring on a previously
developed site, an applicant shall be required to include within the stormwater
concept plan measures for controlling existing stormwater runoff discharges
from the site in accordance with the standards of this article to the maximum

         I.   Documentation of sources for all computation methods and field
test results.
      (4)   Soils Information. If a storm water management control measure
depends on the hydrologic properties of soils (e.g., infiltration basins), then
a soils report shall be submitted. The soils report shall be based on on-site
boring logs or soil pit profiles. The number and location of required soil
borings or soil pits shall be determined based on what is needed to determine
the suitability and distribution of soil types present at the location of the
control measure.
      (5)   Maintenance and Repair Plan. The design and planning of all storm
water management facilities shall include detailed maintenance and repair
procedures to ensure their continued function. These plans will identify the
parts or components of a storm water management facility that need to be
maintained and the equipment and skills or training necessary. Provisions for
the periodic review and evaluation of the effectiveness of the maintenance
program and the need for revisions or additional maintenance procedures shall
be included in the plan.
      (6)   Landscaping Plan. The applicant must present a detailed plan for
management of vegetation at the site after construction is finished, including
who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what
practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is
preserved. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect or by
the soil conservation district.
      (7)   Maintenance Easements. The applicant must ensure access to all
stormwater treatment practices at the site for the purpose of inspection and
repair by securing all the maintenance easements needed on a permanent basis.
These easements will be recorded with the plan and will remain in effect even
with transfer of title to the property.
      (8)    Maintenance Agreement. The applicant must execute an easement and
an inspection and maintenance agreement binding on all subsequent owners of
land served by an on-site storm water management measure in accordance with the
specifications of this article.

approval of the final storm water design plan.
   (d)   Performance Bond/Security.
      (1)   The City of Dunbar may, at its discretion, require the submittal of
a performance security or bond prior to issuance of a permit in order to insure
that the stormwater practices are installed by the permit holder as required by
the approved stormwater management plan.
      (2)   The amount of the installation performance security shall be the
total estimated construction cost of the stormwater management practices
approved under the permit, plus 25%. The performance security shall contain
forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified in the stormwater
management plan.
      (3)   The installation performance security shall be released in full
only upon submission of "as built plans" and written certification by a
registered professional engineer that the stormwater practice has been
installed in accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions
of this article. The City of Dunbar will make a final inspection of the
stormwater practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan
and the provisions of this article. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release
of the performance security based on the completion of various development
stages can be done at the discretion of the City of Dunbar.
         (Ord. 654. Passed 7-6-10.)
926.08 CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION.
   (a)   Notice of Construction Commencement. The applicant must notify the
City of Dunbar in advance before the commencement of construction. Regular
inspections of the storm water management system construction shall be
conducted by the staff of the City of Dunbar or certified by a professional
engineer or their designee who has been approved by the jurisdictional storm
water authority. All inspections shall be documented and written reports
prepared that contain the following information:
      (1)   The date and location of the inspection;
      (2)   Whether construction is in compliance with the approved stormwater
management plan.
      (3)   Variations from the approved construction specifications.
      (4)   Any violations that exist.
      (5)   If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified
in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions.
No added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work
previously completed has received approval by the City of Dunbar.
   (b)   As Built Plans. All applicants are required to submit actual "as
built"plans for any stormwater management practices located on-site after final
construction is completed. The plan must show the final design specifications
for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a
professional engineer. A final inspection by the City of Dunbar is required
before the release of any performance securities can occur.
   (c)   Landscaping and Stabilization Requirements. Any area of land from
which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared
or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within ten (10) days
from the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The
following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts:
      (1)    Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop
accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient
coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established
over ninety percent (90%) of the seeded area. Replanting with native woody and
herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its
equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are
established and are capable of controlling erosion.
      (2)   Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of
seventy-five percent (75%) of the cover crop throughout the year immediately
following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until
the minimum seventy-five percent (75%) survival for one (1) year is achieved.
   In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be submitted
with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management
techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed. This plan will
explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who
will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what
practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is
preserved. This plan must be prepared by a registered landscape architect or by
the soil conservation district, and must be approved prior to receiving a
permit.
         (Ord. 654. Passed 7-6-10.)
926.09  MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF STORMWATER FACILITIES.
   (a)   Maintenance Easement. Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a
storm water management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the
applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement
that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater
management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at
reasonable times for periodic inspection by the City of Dunbar, or their
contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners
to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet
design standards and any other provisions established by this article. The
easement agreement shall be recorded by the City of Dunbar in the land records.
   (b)   Maintenance Covenants.
      (1)   Maintenance of all storm water management facilities shall be
ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be
approved by the City of Dunbar and recorded into the land record prior to final
plan approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when
and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the
stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for
periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between
scheduled cleanouts.
      (2)   The City of Dunbar, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may accept
dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for
maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this article
and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or
otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance.
   (c)   Requirements for Maintenance Covenants. All stormwater management
facilities must undergo, at the minimum, an annual inspection to document
maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of
this article and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include:
removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and
drainage pipes, grass cutting and vegetation removal, and necessary replacement
of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a
timely manner, as determined by the City of Dunbar, and the inspection and
maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper
functioning of the storm water management facility.
   (d)   Inspection of Stormwater Facilities. Inspection programs may be
established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine
inspections; random inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other
notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas
identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or
pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with
higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges
of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations
of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the NPDES storm
water permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to:
reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water,
groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and
evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater
treatment practices.
   (e)   Right-of-Entry for Inspection. When any new drainage control facility
is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between
private property and a public drainage control system, sanitary sewer or
combined sewer, the property owner shall grant to the City of Dunbar the right
to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the

   (a)   The code enforcement agency may order the repair, alteration,

dangerous or detrimental to the public safety or welfare in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Article.

appropriate remedy for any such structure, code officials shall be entitled to
make inspections, perform investigations, issue notices, require corrective
measures, obtain search warrants from and/or present complaints to the
municipal judge, and exercise all other powers and duties authorized by West
Virginia Code Section 8-12-16, as it may be amended. (Ord. 771. Passed 4-2-18.)
1135.04 INSPECTION.
   For purposes of inspections performed pursuant to this Article, the
following rules shall apply:
   (a)   When a code official lawfully enters the premises of the property or

structure, dwelling, or building, the investigation shall be conducted in a way
that minimizes the inconvenience to the owner or person(s) in possession.
   (b)   Except in exigent circumstances and as may be permitted by law, the
code enforcement agency shall provide reasonable notice of the inspection to
the owner and request permission from the owner to enter the structure,
dwelling, or building.
   (c)   If the owner cannot be located after reasonable inquiry by the code
enforcement agency, or if the owner refuses entry, the code enforcement agency
may obtain an administrative search warrant from either the municipal court or
the Kanawha County Magistrate Court. Before issuance of an administrative
search warrant, a code enforcement agency official shall be required to make a
sworn statement and prima facie case showing that the code enforcement agency
was unable to gain access to the structure, dwelling, or building after
reasonable and good faith efforts, and that there is a legitimate and
substantial safety concern involving the structure, dwelling, or building that
supports the requested entry.
   (d)   If the administrative search warrant is granted by the court, and if
the owner can be located by a code official, the code enforcement agency shall
provide the owner a copy of the administrative search warrant five days before
entering the structure, dwelling, or building. If there is a tenant or other
person in possession of the structure who is not the owner, and if such person
(s) can be located, the code enforcement agency shall also provide such person
(s) a copy of the administrative search warrant five days before entering the
structure, dwelling, or building.
   (e)   Any entry pursuant to this section shall be made for the sole purpose
of inspection of the structure, dwelling, or building for unsafe or unsanitary
conditions and not for the purpose of gathering evidence for use in any
criminal charge or proceeding unrelated to the unsafe or unsanitary condition
of the structure, dwelling, or building. (Ord. 771. Passed 4-2-18.)
1135.05 CORRECTION OF UNSAFE CONDITIONS.
   Upon a determination by the code enforcement agency that a structure,
dwelling, or building is unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental to the
public safety or welfare, the City may take corrective action by causing it to
be vacated, closed, removed, or demolished, either directly or through a third-
party agent, in the absence of owner agreement or a court order, provided the
following conditions are met:
   (a)   The code enforcement agency undertakes reasonable efforts to locate
and seek agreement from the owner prior to taking the corrective action.
   (b)   The corrective action may only be taken as to a structure, dwelling,
or building that is either:
      (1)   Defined in Section
1135.02 (d)(3), (5), or (8); or
      (2)   Defined in Section
1135.02 (d)(6), (7), (9), or (11): provided, that the structure, dwelling, or
building is vacant, abandoned, or has been lawfully declared unfit for human
habitation; and the reasonable estimated cost of repair, rehabilitation, or
corrective action exceeds the reasonable estimate of the fair market value of
the structure, dwelling, or building.
   (c)   Prior to undertaking the corrective action, the City will complete the
following procedural requirements:
      (1)   The Code enforcement agency shall produce a written notice
containing:
         A.   A description of the property and the structure, dwelling, or
building sufficient for identification;
         B.   The date of the last inspection;
         C.   The name of the inspector;
         D.   A reasonable description of the unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous, or
detrimental condition(s);
         E.   A reasonable description of the corrective measures required;
         F.   The allotted time to correct the substandard condition(s); and
         G.   A statement that the owner has the right to apply to the circuit
court for a temporary injunction or other similar relief restraining action by
the enforcement agency.
      (2)   The notice shall be served on the owner or landowner by
conspicuously posting and attaching a copy of the notice to the subject
property or structure, dwelling, or building, and by serving the notice on the
owner or landowner in the same manner as service of a complaint as set forth in
Section
1135.09(b).
      (3)   If the code enforcement agency cannot effect personal service on
the owner, a code enforcement agency official shall subscribe a written
affidavit, to be maintained by the code enforcement agency for a minimum of two
years, that demonstrates the structure, dwelling or building falls within one
of the categories set forth in Section
1135.05 (b)(1) or (2), sets forth the basis in reasonable detail including
documentation of same, and memorializes the code enforcement agency official's
efforts to contact or get permission for entry and corrective action from the
owner; and the code enforcement agency shall publish notice of its intent to
enter the property or structure, dwelling, or building for the purpose of
demolition or correction, along with the address of the property, the name of
the owner's and the date of the proposed action, as a Class II legal
advertisement, the first of which shall run at least thirty days before the
date of the proposed action by the enforcement agency, and the last being no
later than twenty days before the date of the proposed action by the
enforcement agency.
      (4)   If there is no response to the notice by the owner or landowner in
the time specified in the notice, then the municipality shall have the
authority to proceed with correction or demolition of the subject structure,
dwelling, or building. (Ord. 771. Passed 4-2-18.)
1135.06  RELIEF FROM ORDER FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   (a)   Pursuant to W. Va. Code Section 8-12-16, the owner of property subject
to corrective action shall be given notice of the right to apply to the Circuit
Court of Kanawha County for a temporary injunction or other similar relief
restraining correction or demolition by the City. Such notice shall be provided
in the written notice produced pursuant to Section
 1135.05(c)(1).
   (b)   Pursuant to W. Va. Code Section 8-12-16, if such an application is
made by the owner to the Circuit Court, a hearing shall be held within twenty
days of the application, or as soon as reasonably possible.
   (c)   Pursuant to W. Va. Code Section 8-12-16, continuances of the hearing
provided for in this section may be made for cause only. If a continuance is
granted upon request by the owner, the owner is required to pay into court, in
the form of a bond, any reasonable and necessary costs related to the
structure, dwelling, or building likely to be incurred by the municipality
during the continuance. This requirement is in addition to any other bond
required or authorized by the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure or other
applicable law.
   (d)   Pursuant to W. Va. Code Section 8-12-16, at the conclusion of a
hearing held under this subdivision, if the Court finds that the structure,
dwelling, or building is unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous, or detrimental to the
public safety or welfare, the court shall make and enter an order granting the
relief as requested by the City.
(Ord. 771. Passed 4-2-18.)
1135.07 OWNER RESPONSIBILITY FOR COSTS.
   (a)   The owner of any structure, dwelling, or building under order of the
Code Enforcement Agency of the City of Dunbar, shall be required to pay for the
costs incurred by the City for repairing, altering, improving, vacating,
closing, removing, or demolishing any structure, dwelling, or building.
   (b)   In addition to any other rights provided by law, the City may file a
lien against the real property in question for an amount that reflects all
costs incurred by the City for repairing, altering, improving, vacating,
closing, removing, or demolishing any structure, dwelling, or building. Any
such lien shall be filed and notices in accordance with applicable West
Virginia law and City Code. (Ord. 771. Passed 4-2-18.)
1135.08  CIVIL ACTION FOR CORRECTIVE ACTION AND RECOVERY OF COSTS.
   (a)   In addition to any other rights provided in this Article and by law,
the City may, in its discretion, institute a civil action in circuit court
against the landowner or other responsible party to obtain an order to take
corrective action up to and including demolition of any structure, dwelling, or
building that is unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous, or detrimental to the public
safety or welfare; and to recover all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by
the City with respect to the property or structure, dwelling, or building and
for reasonable attorney fees and court costs incurred in the prosecution of the
action.
   (b)   No fewer than ten days before instituting a civil action as provided
in this section, the City shall send notice to the landowner by certified mail,
return receipt requested, advising the landowner of the governing body's
intention to institute such action.
   (c)   The notice shall be sent to the most recent address of the landowner
of record in the office of the Kanawha County Assessor and to any other address
for the landowner as may exist on record with the City. If, for any reason,
such certified mail is returned without evidence of proper receipt, the City
shall resend the notice(s) by first class mail, postage prepaid, and shall also
post notice on the front door or other conspicuous location on the subject
property or structure, dwelling, or building.
(Ord. 771. Passed 4-2-18.)
1135.09  NOTICES.
   (a)   To the extent not otherwise authorized by state law, all notices of
violation or correction for violations that fall within one of the categories
defined in Section

set forth in the state building code.
   (b)   Any violation of this Article may be prosecuted by the City consistent
with state and local laws. Unless otherwise authorized by state law,
prosecution of a violation shall be initiated by a complaint presented to and
sworn or affirmed before municipal judge or other municipal official with
lawful authority to hear and determine violations of municipal code. Unless
otherwise provided by statute, the presentation and oath or affirmation shall
be made by a Code Enforcement Official or City Attorney showing reason to have
reliable information and belief. If from the facts stated in the complaint the
municipal judge or other municipal official with lawful authority to hear and
determine violations of municipal code finds probable cause, the complaint
becomes the charging instrument initiating a criminal proceeding. A complaint
lawfully authorized by this subsection along with a summons setting forth the
date, time and place of appearance before a municipal judge and or other
municipal official with lawful authority to hear and determine violations of
municipal code shall be served in accordance with the law of the State of West
Virginia concerning the service of process in civil actions, except that
personal service of a summons and complaint may be made by a code enforcement
agency official. If service is made by certified mail under Rule 4(d)(1)(D) of
the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure and delivery of the summons and
complain is refused, the code enforcement agency official, promptly upon the
receipt of the notice of the refusal, shall mail to the person or entity being
noticed, by first class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the summons and
complaint. If the first-class mailing is not returned as undeliverable by the
U.S. Postal Service, service of the summons and complaint is presumed to have
been effectuated. Upon service of the summons and complaint consistent with
this subsection, the violation may be prosecuted consistent with state and
local law.
(Ord. 771. Passed 4-2-18.)
1135.10  ABSOLUTE DEFENSE.
   It shall be an absolute defense to any civil action by an owner, landowner,
or tenant for damages resulting from the closure, demolition, or other
corrective action taken by the City under this Article that the City followed
the procedures set forth herein; provided, that the City acted in good faith,
can demonstrate that the structure, dwelling or building falls within one of
the categories set forth in Section
1135.05 (b)(1) or (2), followed the procedures set forth in this Article, and
had adopted the State Building Code at the time the closure, demolition or
other corrective action occurred.

   It is not the intent of this chapter to exclude any economic, racial,
religious, or ethnic group from enjoyment of residence, land ownership, or
tenancy within Dunbar; nor is it the intent of this chapter to use public
powers in any way to promote the separation within Dunbar of economic, racial,
religious, or ethnic groups, except as may be an incidental result of meeting

1315.01 ESTABLISHMENT OF DISTRICTS. 
   In order to apply the provisions of this code, the City is hereby divided
into the following classes of districts for the purpose of zoning:
   (a)   Single Family Residence (R-1)
   (b)   Special Residential (R-1A)
   (c)   Multi-Family (R-2)
   (d)   Recreation (REC)
   (e)   General Commercial (B-1)
   (f)   Industrial (I-1)
      (Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1315.03 MAP AND BOUNDARIES.
   (a)   The boundaries of all zoning districts are shown on the Official
Zoning Map, which is the official zoning map for the City of Dunbar. The map is
part of this code and is included in Appendix A.
   (b)   The district boundaries on the City of Dunbar Zoning Map are intended
to follow property lines; centerlines of roads, water courses, or railroads;
other identifiable physical features; or measured distances from property
lines, centerlines, or identifiable physical features. When the zoning officer
cannot determine the location of a zoning district boundary by reference to the
zoning district map, the zoning officer shall refuse action; and the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall interpret the location of the district boundary with
reference to the scale of the map, the comprehensive plan, and the purposes set
forth in all relevant provisions of this code, provided that no boundary shall
be changed by the Board of Zoning Appeals. When a district boundary line
divides a lot held in single or separate ownership at the effective date of
this code, the permitted use on the lot is limited to those uses permitted in
the zoning district in which the largest part of the lot is located, and the
smaller part of the lot located in a another zoning district will be subject to
the provisions where the largest portion of the lot is located.
   (c)   Unless a use is allowed as a "permitted use by right," "use permitted
with supplemental regulations," "conditional use," "conditional use with
supplemental regulations," "nonconforming use," "temporary use" then such use
is prohibited.
   (d)   Separate garage apartments are not permitted in R-1, R-1A, and R-
2 zoned areas.
   (e)   A chart of the uses permitted by right and conditional uses are
included in Appendix B.

Single Family Residence District (R-1)
1317.01   Purpose.
1317.03   Permitted uses in the Single Family Residence District (R-1).
1317.05   Single Family Residence District (R-1) for requirements.
1317.01 PURPOSE. 
   The purpose of the Single-Family Residential District is to provide single-
family neighborhoods and residential uses for residents who prefer a smaller
lot size. The district preserves the character of a smaller community by
discouraging business, commercial, and industrial uses within the district. The
district is designed to encourage a sense of community by making neighbors
close to one another, allowing religious institutions, as well as parks. This
district also promotes the character of single-family residential areas from
much change that may cause the deterioration of the quality of the district.

traffic and more business to the residential area. Like the Single-Family
Residential district, the Special Residential District permits parks and

1335.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT; INTERPRETATION. 
   (a)   Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses
for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The
purpose of this article is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement,
materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on private
property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property
values; preservation of the character of the various neighborhoods; creation of
a convenient, attractive, and harmonious community; protection against
destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas; and the safety and welfare
of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and
encouraging economic development. This article allows adequate communication
through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location,
and size of all signs. This article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent
with the First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this
article is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
finding shall not affect the validity of other provisions of this article which
can be given effect without the invalid provision. These regulations do not
entirely eliminate all of the harms that may be created by the installation and
display of signs. Rather, the provisions strike an appropriate balance that
preserves ample channels of communication by means of visual display while
still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by signs.
   (b)   Signs not expressly permitted are prohibited.
   (c)   A sign placed on land or on a building for the purpose of
identification, protection, or directing persons to a use conducted therein
shall be deemed to be an integral but accessory and subordinate part of the
principal use of the land or building. Therefore, the intent of this article is
to establish limitations on signs in order to ensure they are appropriate to
the land, building, or use to which they are appurtenant and are adequate for
their intended purpose while balancing the individual and community interests
identified in this article.
   (d)   These regulations are intended to promote signs that are compatible
with the use of the property to which they are appurtenant and landscape and
architecture of surrounding buildings, legible and appropriate to the activity
to which they pertain, not overly distracting to motorists, and constructed and
maintained in a structurally sound and attractive condition.
   (e)   These regulations distinguish between portions of the City designed
for primarily vehicular access and portions of the City designed for primarily
pedestrian access.
   (f)   These regulations do not regulate every form and instance of visual
speech that may be displayed anywhere within the jurisdictional limits of the
City. Rather, the provisions are intended to regulate those forms and instances
that are most likely to meaningfully affect one or more of the purposes set
forth above.
(Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1335.03 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   (a)   In General. Except as provided in this code, a permit is required
prior to the display and erection of any sign.
   (b)   Application for Permit.
      (1)   An application for a permit shall be filed with the Zoning Officer
on forms furnished by the City. The applicant shall provide sufficient
information to determine if the proposed sign is permitted under this code and
other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances. An application for a
temporary sign shall state the dates intended for the erection and removal of
the sign. An application for an electronic message display shall include the
manufacturer's statement that the sign has been pre-programmed, to the extent
possible, to conform to the requirements of this code. Such manufacturer's
statement shall include, where applicable, the pre-stacked sign settings
relating to text and graphic features, message change features, message change
time intervals, day and night lighting requirements, and any other settings
capable of limiting the electronic message display such that it conforms to
this code.
      (2)   The Zoning Officer shall promptly process the permit application
and approve the application, reject the application, or notify the applicant of
deficiencies in the application within twenty (20) business days after receipt.
Any application that complies with all provisions of this code, the building
code, and other applicable laws, regulations, and ordinances shall be approved.
      (3)   If the application is rejected, the Zoning Officer shall provide a
list of the reasons for the rejection in writing.
   (c)   Permit Fee. A nonrefundable fee shall accompany all permit
applications. The permit fee shall be set under Article
1725 of the Code of the City of Dunbar. The fee will be set by the value of the
work being performed. If the permit is to resurface an existing sign structure
the permit fee will follow the fee schedule in Article
1725 based on total value of the project with an additional fifty dollar
($50.00) fee for each sign being resurfaced.
   (d)   Duration and Revocation of Permit. If a sign is not installed within
six (6) months following the issuance of a permit or the time period stated
within the permit, or within thirty (30) days for a temporary permit, the
permit shall be void. The permit for a temporary sign shall state its duration,
not to exceed thirty (30) days unless otherwise provided in this code. The
Zoning Officer shall revoke a permit under any of the following circumstances:
      (1)   The information in the application was materially false or
misleading.
      (2)   The sign as installed does not conform to the permit application;
or
      (3)   The sign violates this code, building code, or other applicable
law, regulation, or ordinance.
   (e)   Appeals. Appeals from the denial or granting of a permit shall be made
to the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to the process set out in this code for
appeals to the Board of Zoning Appeals. (Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1335.05 PERMIT NOT REQUIRED. 
   The purpose of not requiring a permit for some signage is to exempt certain
signs that are frequently used, often by private citizens, and which typically
have less of an impact on the public safety and aesthetic concerns of the
community from the permitting process. Signs permitted under this section count
towards the maximum sign area and maximum number of signs allowed per use. A
permit is not required for:
   (a)   Signs erected by a governmental body or required by law.
   (b)   Flags up to sixteen (16) square feet in size not containing a
commercial message.
   (c)   The changing of messages on marquees and the repair of an existing
permitted sign, except that repair of a nonconforming sign must comply with
this code.
   (d)   Temporary signs as follows:
      (1)   One (1) sign, no illumination, no more than twelve (12) square feet
in area, located on property where a building permit is active.
      (2)   On any property for sale or rent, one (1) sign with a total area of
up to twelve (12) square feet and a maximum height of six (6) feet.
      (3)   Signs posted or displayed by or under the direction of any public
or court officer in the performance of official or directed duties, provided
that all such signs including their frames, bases, and supports shall be
removed no more than ten (10) days after their purpose has been accomplished.
      (4)   No more than four (4) temporary signs with a total area of no more
than twelve (12) square feet, and which are removed within ninety (30) days
after being erected.
      (5)   Window signs.
      (6)   On any property where a new use began activity within the last six
(6) months, banners displayed for not more than fifteen (15) days in one
calendar year for a particular use at a particular location.
   (e)   Two (2) minor signs per use.
   (f)   A-frame signs more than fifty (50) feet from the nearest public right
of way.
   (g)   Pavement markings. Any sign applied directly and entirely to and flush
with an asphalt, concrete, or similar paved surface.
   (h)   A permanent window sign, provided that the aggregate area of all
window signs on each window or door does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%)
of the total area of the window or door.
   (i)   Signs permitted under this section count towards the allowable maximum
sign square footage for a particular use or property.
      (Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1335.07 PROHIBITED SIGNS. 
   The purpose of prohibiting the following signage is to address the
community's substantial public safety and welfare concerns, including aesthetic
concerns and protecting property values, associated with certain types of
signage. In addition to signs prohibited elsewhere in this code or by
applicable state or federal law, the following signs are prohibited:
   (a)   General Prohibitions.
      (1)   Signs that violate state or federal relating to outdoor advertising
or in violation of this code.
      (2)   Signs attached to natural vegetation.
      (3)   Signs simulating, or which are likely to be confused with, a
traffic control sign or any other sign displayed by a public authority. Any
such sign is subject to immediate removal and disposal by an authorized City
official as a nuisance.
      (4)   Vehicle or trailer signs.
      (5)   Freestanding sign more than twenty-five (25) feet in height.
      (6)   Signs hanging from supports, except against the face of a building.
      (7)   Animated signs, except where animated sign features as part of an
electronic message display are expressly permitted.
      (8)   Flashing signs or other signs displaying flashing, scrolling, or
intermittent lights or lights of changing degrees of intensity, except where

   (c)   Prohibitions Based on Location.
      (1)   Off-premises signs, unless specifically permitted by this chapter.
      (2)   Signs erected on public land other than those approved by the
Zoning Officer in writing, required by law without such approval, or permitted
under West Virginia law. Any sign not so authorized is subject to immediate
removal by the City, with the costs charged to the owner or person having
control of such sign, with payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of
charges. Removal of the sign under this provision does not preclude prosecution
of the person responsible for the sign.
      (3)   Roof signs. Signs on the roof surface or extending above the
roofline of a building or its parapet wall.
      (4)   Any sign located in the vision triangle formed by any two (2)
intersecting streets and alley.
      (5)   Window signs with an aggregate area on a window or door in excess
of twenty-five percent (25%) of the total area of the window or door or located
above the first floor unless the related use is only on the floor where the
window sign is displayed.
         (Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
  
1335.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Setback and Placement. Except as otherwise permitted, all freestanding
signs and flagpoles shall be set back from any public right-of-way at least the
height of the sign or flagpole. Electronic message displays shall be placed
perpendicular to residential structures where possible and shall comply with
Federal Communications Commission regulations, including the avoidance of
harmful interference with radio frequencies.
   (b)   Illumination.
      (1)   Definitions.
         A.   "Candela" means the basic unit of measurement of light in SI
(metric) units.
         B.   "Candela per square meter (cd/m²)" means the SI (metric) unit
used to describe the luminance of a light source or of an illuminated surface
that reflects light. Also referred to as Nits.
         C.   "Nit" means a photometric unit of measurement referring to
luminance. One nit is equal to one cd/m².
         D.   "SI (International System of Units)" means the modern metric
system of measurement, abbreviated SI for the French term "Le Systeme
International d'Unites."
      (2)   A sign in any district may be illuminated at night. Signs that are
illuminated at night may not exceed a maximum luminance level of seven hundred
and fifty (750) cd/m² or Nits, regardless of the method of illumination, at
least one-half hour before Apparent Sunset, as determined by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), US Department of Commerce, for
the specific geographic location and date. All illuminated signs must comply
with this maximum luminance level throughout the night, if the sign is
energized, until Apparent Sunrise, as determined by the NOAA, at which time the
sign may resume luminance levels appropriate for daylight conditions.
      (3)   The maximum luminance during daylight conditions, between Apparent
Sunrise and one-half hour before Apparent Sunset, shall be ten thousand
(10,000) cd/m² or Nits.
      (4)   All permitted and conditional use signs may be backlit, internally
lighted, or indirectly lighted, subject to lighting limitations in this code.
All external sign lighting shall have lighting fixtures or luminaires that are
fully shielded.
      (5)   Temporary signs shall not be lighted.
   (c)   Maximum Height Measurements. Wall signs and other signs with sign
structures not affixed to the ground are measured from the lowest attached
component of the sign to the highest attached component of the sign. The
maximum height for signs with sign structures affixed to the ground is measured
as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign, subject to limitations in this article.
Normal grade is the lower of:
      (1)   Existing grade prior to construction; or
      (2)   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating primarily for the purpose of mounting
or elevating the sign.
   (d)   Measurement of Sign Area. Sign area is calculated under the following
principles:
      (1)   With signs that are regular polygons or circles, the area can be
calculated by the mathematical formula for that polygon or circle. With signs
that are not regular polygons or circles, the sign area is calculated using all
that area within a maximum of three abutting or overlapping rectangles that
enclose the sign face.
      (2)   The permitted area of a double-faced a-frame sign shall be
considered to be the area on one side only. If one face contains a larger sign
area than the other, the larger face shall be used in calculating the sign
area.
      (3)   For projecting signs, the sign area also includes the area of the
visible sides of the sign, calculated as a rectangle enclosing each entire side
view.
      (4)   Supports, uprights, or structures on which any sign is supported
shall not be included in determining the sign area unless such supports,
uprights, or structure are designed in such a way as to form an integral
background of the display; except, however, when a sign is placed on a fence,
wall, planter, or other similar structure that is designed to serve a separate
purpose other than to support the sign, the entire area of such structure shall
not be computed.
      (5)   In instances where there are multiple tenants or users on a
property or in a building, allowable sign area for all parties shall not exceed
the maximum sign area computed based upon the number of tenants multiplied by
forty (40) square feet per tenant. In no case shall any tenant sign exceed
forty (40) square feet.
   (e)   Wall Signs. Wall signs shall provide as part of permit application:
      (1)   Written permission from the operator and/or owner of the building.
      (2)   The name and address of the person applying the wall sign; and
      (3)   A clear drawing of the proposed wall sign including dimensions and
location.
         (Ord 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1335.10 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)   Signs lawfully existing on the effective date of this code which do
not conform to the provisions of this code, and signs which are accessory to a
nonconforming use shall be deemed nonconforming signs and may remain except as
qualified below.
      (1)   No nonconforming sign shall be enlarged nor shall any feature of a
nonconforming sign, such as illumination, be increased.
      (2)   Nonconforming signs shall not be extended, structurally
reconstructed, altered in any manner, or replaced with another nonconforming
sign, except as permitted in this code.
      (3)   Nonconforming signs shall not be moved for any distance on the same
lot or to any other lot unless such change in location will make the sign
conform in all respects to the provisions of this article.
      (4)   A nonconforming sign that is destroyed or damaged by any casualty
to an extent not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of its area may be restored
within six (6) months after such destruction or damage but shall not be
enlarged. If such sign is so destroyed or damaged to an extent exceeding fifty
percent (50%) of its area, the sign shall not be reconstructed but may be
replaced with a sign that is in full accordance with this code.
      (5)   Nonconforming sign structures shall be removed if the use to which
it is accessory has not been in operation for a period of one (1) year or more,
except as provided in Section
1335.11(h). Such sign structure shall be removed or made conforming by the
owner or lessee of the property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove or make
conforming the sign structure within thirty (30) days of notice by the Zoning
Officer, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be made conforming or removed
and the cost of such removal or modification shall be charged to the owner,
person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with payment
due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.
      (6)   If a nonconforming sign is altered such that the sign is conforming
or is replaced by a conforming sign, such sign shall thereafter be kept in
accordance with the provisions of this code.
   (b)   The burden of establishing nonconforming status of signs and the
physical characteristics and location of such signs shall be with the owner of
the property. Upon notice from the Zoning Officer, a property owner shall
submit verification that sign(s) were lawfully erected. Failure to provide such
verification shall be cause the sign to be deemed an illegal sign.
   (c)   Nothing in this section prevents keeping a nonconforming sign in good
repair.
(Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1335.11 MAINTENANCE AND REMOVAL. 
   (a)   All signs shall be constructed and mounted in compliance with the West
Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code. All signs and components thereof
shall be maintained in good repair and in a safe, neat, and clean condition.
   (b)   Safety Hazard. The Zoning Officer may cause to have removed or
repaired immediately without written notice any sign which has become insecure,
in danger of falling, or otherwise unsafe, and, as such, presents an immediate
threat to the safety of the public. If such action is necessary to render a
sign safe, the cost of such emergency removal or repair shall be charged to the
owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with
payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.
   (c)   Nuisance. Any sign which constitutes a nuisance shall be abated by the
owner within thirty (30) days of notice by the Zoning Officer. At any time, the
Zoning Officer may cause the nuisance to be abated with the costs charged to
the owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign,
with payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.
   (d)   Illegal Sign and Disrepair. Any sign which is illegal or in disrepair
shall be made conforming or repaired within thirty (30) days of notice from the
Zoning Officer. Signs of disrepair include chipped paint, missing or
significantly faded letters or other aspects of the sign, cracked portions of
the sign face, broken lighting, graffiti, and unleveled portions of the sign
structure or face. If an illegal sign or a sign in disrepair is not made
conforming or repaired, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be removed or
repaired and the cost of such removal or repair shall be charged to the owner,
person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with payment
due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.
   (e)   Expired Permit. Any sign for which a permit has expired shall be
removed within five (5) days of the permit expiration. If the sign is not
removed, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be removed and the cost of
such removal shall be charged to the owner, person having control, or person
receiving benefit from such sign, with payment due within thirty (30) days of
notice of charges.
   (f)   Signs located within ten (10) feet of any public right-of-way and in
violation of this code may be impounded at any time.
   (g)   The owner of any commercial sign, whether conforming or nonconforming,
other than a permitted off-premise sign, located on commercial property where
the use or business has ceased operating shall, within sixty (60) days of the
cessation of the use or business operation, remove temporary signs and all
aspects of any permanent commercial sign. Property owner may request, in
writing, a waiver of such requirement if the commercial use is temporarily or
seasonally operational, is remodeling, or otherwise has the bona fide intention
of opening the commercial use back up within one (1) year of time of cessation.
(Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1335.13 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   Temporary signs pose distinct concerns with visual clutter, safety in
erection and display, and clean-up when the time for display has concluded.
Temporary signs also pose distinct concerns with materials quality. The
following provisions and individual zoning of temporary signs per district
serve to address these concerns.
   (a)   Temporary signs require a permit, except as provided in this article,
and may be permitted up to thirty (30) days each calendar year.
   (b)   Temporary signs may be erected in any district in the following forms:
banner, chalkboard sign, window sign, wall sign, and wicket signs. In the
General Commercial and Industrial districts, the following additional temporary
signs may be erected or utilized: feather sign, inflatable sign, and person
assisted sign.
   (c)   A use may erect one (1) temporary, off-premises sign on property in
any district, except residential districts, with the consent of the persons in
charge of such properties, no more than two (2) times in one (1) calendar year.
Each sign shall be no more than eight (8) feet in height and sixteen (16)
square feet in area, which area counts against the maximum sign area permitted
on that lot.
   (d)   No more than ten (10) permitted temporary signs may be displayed per
lot in non-residential districts.
   (e)   Temporary signs that use thin wire frame (wicket style double "H" wire
frame) are prohibited on public property and public right of ways. Temporary
signs on public property and public right of ways shall be constructed of heavy
metal angle iron frames or PVC bases.
   (f)   Person assisted signs shall not be located more than ten (10) feet
from the entrance to a building or within ten (10) feet of a right-of-way.
      (Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1335.15 SIGNS FOR SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL, SPECIAL RESIDENTIAL, MULTI-FAMILY,
AND RECREATION DISTRICTS.
   Signage in residential and recreation districts poses a heightened risk of
visual blight and unsightly clutter, as residential neighborhoods typically
contain markedly less signage than other districts in order to maintain the
residential character of the neighborhood. At the same time, communicating from
one's residence is a distinct and impactful form of speech that should be
protected, and nonresidential uses should be afforded adequate signage
incidental to the primary use, i.e. on-premises signs. Signs permitted in these
districts are smaller, fewer in number, and limited in sign type in order to
limit visual clutter and distraction, while affording ample speech.
   (a)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings: wall sign, window sign,
minor sign, temporary sign, wicket sign, sign affixed to mailbox.
   (b)   Permitted sign use as accessory to non-dwellings: changeable message
sign, freestanding sign, monument sign, wall sign, window sign, static
electronic message display, static electronic message display with transition
features, and partially animated electronic message display. Only one (1) of
each is permitted per use, except wall signs and window signs.
   (c)   No more than one (1) flag as accessory to a dwelling and no more than
two (2) flags as accessory to a non-dwelling are permitted.
   (d)   Dimension Specifications Chart. All maximum sign area requirements
include the sum total sign area of all signs per use. No signs in these
districts may extend over a right-of-way or sidewalk.

                            standalone signs
(Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1335.17 SIGNS FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL DISTRICT.
   On-premises signage in commercial areas is essential for the operation of a
variety of uses. However, in lighter commercial developments, particularly
those near residential development and neighboring residential districts,
signage that is less intrusive by being smaller, shorter in height, and more
uniform in sign type improves the aesthetic qualities of these and neighboring
districts and limits the visual distraction of signage.
   (a)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as for
Section
1335.15.
   (b)   Permitted sign use as accessory to non-dwellings: a-frame sign, awning
or canopy sign, banner, chalkboard sign, changeable copy sign, feather sign,
freestanding sign, marquee sign, monument sign, wall sign, wicket sign, window
sign, static electronic message display, static electronic message display with
transition features, and partially animated electronic message display. Only
one of each is permitted per use, except wall signs and window signs.
   (c)   No more than one (1) flag as accessory to a dwelling and no more than
two (2) flags as accessory to a non-dwelling are permitted.
   (d)   Dimension Specifications Chart. All maximum sign area requirements
include the sum total sign area of all signs per use.

                               way or sidewalk
(Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1335.19 SIGNS FOR INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
   Signage in industrial areas is allowed to a greater extent, in size, number,
and sign type, in order to maintain proportion to the size and scope of uses
typically present within these districts. However, even the most intensive use
districts in smaller communities are still limited in signage to some degree in
order to maintain the small town character of smaller communities and to limit
visual distraction by signage.
   (a)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as for
Section
1335.15.

ARTICLE 1337
Nonconforming Uses, Lots, and Structures
1337.01   Purpose and general provisions.
1337.03   Nonconforming uses.
1337.05   Nonconforming structures.
1337.07   Nonconforming lots.
1337.09   Nonconforming accessory uses and structures.
     
1337.01 PURPOSE AND GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of this Chapter is to set forth
standards and regulations regarding the continued existence of uses,
structures, and lots established prior to the effective date of this code (or
any amendment subsequent thereto) that do not conform to this code. These
standards shall apply to all nonconforming uses, structures, and lots, as
defined by this code.
   (b)   General Provisions.
      (1)   Nonconforming lots, structures, or uses may continue to exist, be
bought or sold, altered, restored, or extended only in accordance with the
provisions of this code.
      (2)   Nothing in this code shall prevent the strengthening or restoring
to a safe condition of any portion of a nonconforming structure declared unsafe
by a proper authority.
      (3)   Nothing in this code shall be interpreted as authorization for or
approval of the continuance of the illegal use of a structure or premises in
violation of zoning controls in existence at the time of the effective date of
legal enactment of this code.
      (4)   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed such that an
area is transferred from one district to another district of a different
classification, the foregoing provisions shall apply to any nonconformities
created by the transfer.
      (5)   Nothing in this section prohibits alterations or additions to or
replacement of buildings or structures owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer, or the use of land presently owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer but not used for agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing
purposes, or the use or acquisition of additional land which may be required
for the protection, continuing development, or expansion of any agricultural,
industrial, or manufacturing operation of any present or future satellite
agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing use.
         (Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1337.03 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (a)   Where, at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this code, a
lawful use of a lot or structure exists that is made no longer permissible
under the terms of this code as enacted or amended, such use may be sold or
otherwise transferred to other owners and may be continued as long as it
remains otherwise lawful in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter.
   (b)   No nonconforming use of a lot or nonconforming use of a structure
shall be enlarged or increased or extended to occupy a greater area of the lot
or structure than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this code, unless the Board of Zoning Appeals, after public hearing,
interprets that the enlargement or extension is necessitated by the natural
expansion and growth of the nonconforming use. Any such enlargement or
expansion shall conform to the area, height, and yard requirements of the
zoning district in which it is located.
   (c)   Upon authorization by the Board of Zoning Appeals, a non-conforming
use may be changed to another equal or less intense non-conforming use.
   (d)   Once a nonconforming use has been changed or converted to a conforming
use, the nonconforming use shall not be re-established.
   (e)   When a nonconforming use is discontinued for twelve (12) months,
abandonment is presumed, and the nonconforming use shall not be re-established.
Any future use of the land, buildings, or structures shall conform and be in
accordance with all applicable rules, regulations, and requirements of the
particular zoning district wherein the property is located. Abandonment of a
nonconforming use shall be presumed if one (1) or more of the following
conditions exists, indicating intent on the part of the property owner to
abandon the nonconforming use:
      (1)   When the intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent.
      (2)   Utilities, such as water, gas, and electricity to the property have
been disconnected.
      (3)   The property, buildings, and grounds have fallen into disrepair as
evidenced by proper code violation documentation.
      (4)   When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming use.
      (5)   When the nonconforming use has been changed to a use permitted by
conditional use by the Board of Zoning Appeals; or
      (6)   The business license issued by the City of Dunbar has expired and
has not been renewed.
   (f)   The Zoning Officer shall be responsible for preparing a list of all
nonconforming uses existing at the time of the legal enactment of this code and
such list shall be maintained for public use and information.
(Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1337.05 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (a)   Any legal, pre-existing nonconforming structure damaged by fire,
flood, explosion, or other disaster event may be reconstructed and used as
before, so long as the structure is damaged no more than fifty percent (50%) of
appraisal value prior to incurring damage, exclusive of foundations, determined
at owner's expense. The appraisal value shall not be determined by tax
assessment. An application to the Board of Zoning Appeals for permission to
reconstruct a damaged or destroyed structure must be filed prior to undertaking
the repairs, otherwise any structure shall conform to and be in accordance with
all applicable rules, regulations, and requirements of the particular district
as provided in this code.
      (1)   The reconstructed structure shall not exceed the height, area, or
volume of the original structure; and
      (2)   Reconstruction shall be commenced within one (1) year from the date
the structure was destroyed or condemned and shall be carried on without
interruption.
   (b)   If any building occupied by a nonconforming use is damaged more than
fifty percent (50%) of its appraisal value exclusive of foundations, such
building must conform to this code upon reconstruction.
   (c)   The extension of a lawful use to any portion of a nonconforming
structure shall not be deemed the extension of a nonconforming use.
(Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1337.07 NONCONFORMING LOTS. 
   (a)   Except as provided below, a nonconforming vacant lot existing and of
official record as of the effective date of this code may be developed for any
of the uses permitted by these regulations in the zoning district in which it
is located, provided that the use meets all applicable yard and setback
requirements for the zoning district in which the lot is located.
   (b)   A nonconforming vacant lot shall not be developed as described in
subsection (a) if it could be combined with an adjoining lot owned by the same
owner, and any or all future assigns, on or after the effective date of these
regulations in order to create a single lot. Where an owner owns adjoining
property, construction may occur across the lot lines if doing so is the only
way the yard requirements may be met without a variance. If said combination,
however, results in the creation of a single lot that is more than one and one-
half (1.5) times the minimum lot width or area required in the zoning district,
then the single lot may be divided into two lots of equal width and area
without being further classified as non-conforming. For the purposes of this
Section, "adjoining" shall be deemed to mean the sharing of one or more common
lot lines and access to both lots can be provided by the same street without
crossing that street.
(Ord. 785. Passed 9-16-19.)
1337.09 NONCONFORMING ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES.
   No nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure shall continue after
the principal use or structure is terminated by abandonment, damage, or
destruction unless such accessory use or accessory structure thereafter is made
to conform to the standards for the zoning district in which it is located. No
nonconforming accessory use or structure shall become or replace any terminated
principal nonconforming use or structure.

   Chapter Five of this Part Thirteen - Planning and Zoning Code shall be known
and may be cited as the "City of Dunbar Subdivision Regulations".
(Ord. 208. Passed 6-7-61.)
1351.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purposes of these Subdivision Regulations, the following words and
phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section:
   (a)    "Alley" means a minor right of way providing secondary vehicular
access to the side or rear of two or more properties.
   (b)    "Building line" means the line within the property defining the
required minimum distance between any enclosed structure and the adjacent
street right of way.
   (c)    "Cartway" means that portion of the street right of way surfaced for
vehicular use.
   (d)    "Commission" means the Municipal Planning Commission of the City of
Dunbar.
   (e)    "Council" means the Council of the City of Dunbar.
   (f)    "Easement" means a grant by a property owner of the use, for a
specific purpose or purposes, of a strip of land by the general public, a
corporation or a certain person or persons.
   (g)    "Improvements" means those physical changes to the land necessary to
produce usable and desirable lots from raw acreage including, but not limited
to: grading, paving, curb, gutter, storm sewers and drains, improvements to
existing water courses, sidewalks, crosswalks, street signs, monuments, water
supply facilities, and sewage disposal facilities.
   (h)    "Lot" means a tract or parcel of land intended for the transfer of
ownership, use or improvement, whether immediate or future.
   (i)    "Plan, final" means a complete and exact subdivision plan, prepared
for official recording as required by statute, to defined proposed streets and
other improvements.
   (j)    "Right of way" means land reserved for use as a street, alley,
interior walk, or for other public use.
   (k)    "Subdivision" means the division of a single lot, tract or parcel of

   (l)    "Subdivider" means the owner, or authorized agent of the owner, of
the subdivision.
   (m)    "Streets":
      (1)   "Collector streets" means streets, which, in addition to giving
access to abutting properties, intercept minor streets and provide routes,
carrying considerable volumes of local traffic to community facilities and to
local highways as designated on the comprehensive plan map.
      (2)    "Minor streets" means streets used primarily to provide access to
abutting properties.
      (3)    "Marginal access streets" means minor streets parallel and
adjacent to local highways, providing access to adjoining properties and
control of intersection with local highways.
   (n)    "Variance" means an instance where the subdivider can show that a
provision of these regulations would cause an unnecessary hardship if strictly
adhered to and where, because of topographical or other conditions peculiar to
the site, in the opinion of the Planning Commission a departure may be made
without destroying the intent of such provisions, the Planning Commission may
authorize a variance. Any variance thus authorized is required to be entered in
the minutes of Council and the reasoning on which the departure was justified.
      (Ord. 208. Passed 6-7-61.)
1351.03 PURPOSE.
   Chapter Five is enacted for the purpose of assuring sites suitable for
building purposes and human habitation; coordination of subdivision streets
with existing and planned streets or highways; coordination and extension of
facilities included in the comprehensive plan; establishment of minimum width,
depth and area of lots within the projected subdivision; distribution of
population and traffic in a manner tending to create conditions favorable to
health, safety, convenience, and the harmonious development of the City; fair
allocations of areas for streets, parks, schools, public and semi-public
buildings, homes, utilities, business and industry.
(Ord. 208. Passed 6-7-61.)
1351.04 APPROVAL BY PLANNING COMMISSION.
   After a comprehensive plan and an ordinance containing provisions for
subdivision control and the approval of plats and replats have been adopted and
a certified copy of the ordinance has been filed with the county clerk, the
Planning Commission shall have exclusive control over the approval of all plats
involving incorporated land covered by the comprehensive plan and ordinance.
(Ord. 208. Passed 6-7-61.)
1351.05 RECORDING OF PLAT.
   After a comprehensive plan and an ordinance, containing provisions for
subdivision control and the approval of plats and replats, have been adopted
and a certified copy of the ordinance has been filed with the county clerk, a
plat of a subdivision shall not be recorded by the county clerk unless it has
first been approved by the Planning Commission having jurisdiction over the
area. The filing and recording of a plat involving the subdivision of lands
covered by such comprehensive plan and ordinance shall be without legal effect
unless approved by the Commission; provided, that failure to comply with this
section shall not invalidate or affect title to any land within the area of
such plat; and provided further, that if such plat shall bear the seal of the
Commission, it shall be presumed to have been approved thereby.

damage existing or proposed buildings.
      (11)   Start of Construction: The date the permit was issued, including
permits for substantial improvement or substantial damage, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a permit must be
obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms,
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For an alteration, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
      (12)   State Coordinating Office: The West Virginia Division of Homeland
Security and Emergency Management.
      (13)   Stream: As defined in WV State Code 7-1-3U, any watercourse,
whether natural or man-made, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of
their size, through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless
of its volume.
      (14)   Structure: A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (15)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event equals or
exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."
      (16)   Substantial Improvement:
         A.   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the Start of Construction of the
improvement.
         B.   This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         C.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with
all Ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific Ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
      (17)   Top of Bank: The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the water’s edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (18)   Violation: The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this article.
         (Ord. 623. Passed 11-19-07.)
1749.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Identification.   
      (1)   The identified floodplain area shall be those areas of the City of
Dunbar which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood Insurance Study
(FIS) prepared for the City of Dunbar by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) dated February 6, 2008 or the most recent revision thereof.
      (2)   The identified floodplain area shall also be those areas of the
City of Dunbar which have been identified as flood hazard areas by the City of
Dunbar by use of historic or other technical data and shown on the City of
Dunbar "Local Flood Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as
appropriate with the level of technical data described below and shall be
managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Floodplain Areas. The identified floodplain shall
consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway area (F1) shall be those areas identified as such in
the FIS and as shown on the floodway map or FIRM. The term shall also include
floodway areas identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed
in subsection (4) below.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe area (F2) shall be those areas for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway (F3) shall be those areas identified
as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-
year flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated area (F4) shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM or floodway map included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for
which no one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided. For these
areas, elevation and floodway information from other Federal, State, or other
acceptable source shall be used when available. Where other acceptable
information is not available the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to determine the elevation with hydrologic and hydraulic engineering
or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they
shall only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer, who shall
certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc, shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.  
      (1)   The delineation of the identified floodplain area may be revised by
the City of Dunbar where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or more
detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, a
River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual document the
necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
      (2)   The City of Dunbar may identify and regulate new flood hazard or
pending areas. These areas may be delineated using locally derived technical
information such as flood of record, historic high water marks and/or
topographic data.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development within
an identified flood hazard area is at or above the Base Flood Elevation
specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the structure shall not be required to
conform to the flood prevention design and construction standards or flood-
related development codes in Section
1749.06. Topographic data certified by a registered professional engineer or
surveyor shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by
the Floodplain Administrator. The applicant is advised to apply for a Letter of
Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA to have the Special Flood Hazard Area
designation removed from the parcel or structure.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation specified in the Flood Insurance Study, the site
shall be considered to be within the floodplain area and the proposed structure
shall be required to conform to all appropriate provisions of this article.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Dunbar. The
burden of proof shall be on the appellant/applicant. (Ord. 623. Passed 11-19-
07.)
1749.04 UTILIZATION OF THE FLOODPLAIN AREA.
   (a)   Floodway (F1).   
      (1)   Within any floodway area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, repair of substantial damage, or
other development shall be permitted unless it has been demonstrated through
hydrologic and hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard
engineering practice that the proposed encroachment will not result in any
increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (3)   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (4)   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (5)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4).  
      (1)   In the Floodway Fringe (F2) and Approximated Floodplain (F4), any
development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses,
activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the
floodproofing and related provisions contained herein and in all other
applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
         A.   In the Approximated Floodplain (F4) the Floodplain Manager shall
review, or shall cause to be reviewed, proposed development less than ten (10)
lots or two (2) acres to ascertain the specific flood risk at the building site
and assign a "minimal, moderate or significant” risk level.
            1.   Development determined to represent a minimal risk and costing
less than $10,000 shall be required to provide "Point on Boundary" elevation
data and historic flood heights. The Floodplain Manager shall attempt to
determine a height that will be reasonably safe from flooding using this
elevation data. The Floodplain Manager shall enter the flood height in Section
"G" of the Elevation Certificate. Any new or substantially improved structures
using the "point on boundary" method (other than appurtenant structures) shall
be required to have the lowest floor elevated at least three (3) feet above the
highest adjacent grade even if the collected elevation data would indicate a
lower flood elevation. If this method is not adequate to allow the Floodplain
Manager to confidently determine the flood height the applicant shall be
required to utilize one of the methods set forth below.
            2.   Development determined to represent a low to moderate risk
and/or costing less than $30,000 shall provide Quick-2 engineering data
prepared by a registered professional engineer or obtain free LOMA data from
FEMA. This semi- detailed method will be used by the Floodplain Manager to
determine a "Community Flood Elevation". The Floodplain Manager shall enter the
"Community Flood Elevation" in Section "G" of the Elevation Certificate.
            3.   Development determined to represent a high risk and/or costing
more than $30,000 shall be required to develop a Base Flood elevation using a
detailed method such as HEC- ras. This data shall be prepared and certified by
a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms and a completed Elevation Certificate.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Manager. Base Flood Elevations determined using this method can be used to rate
flood insurance, typically resulting in a reduced premium.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data.
         A.   This data may be available from an authoritative source, such as
the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource
Conservation Service or state and local water resource department.
         B.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
   (c)   AE area without floodway (F3). Within any AE area without floodway, no
new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated
through a hydrologic and hydraulic study that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood more than
one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be satisfied by utilization of
the floodway area where determined.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.  
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the Floodplain Area the developer shall notify in writing, by certified mail,
the City of Dunbar, Floodplain Administrator, The State Coordinating Office,
and any adjacent communities of all such intended activities prior to the
alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all required notifications
must be submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration. In addition prior to
issuing the local permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of
all necessary permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or
State Law requires approval. Contact information for State and Federal
permitting authorities as well as addresses for required notification of
appropriate County, State and Federal government agencies are contained in the
City of Dunbar Stream Alteration administrative procedures.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Dunbar in writing that
the carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of stream will be
maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the applicant to
demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will provide equal
or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered
professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
"best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or stream
crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized flooding
caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited to, wing
walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to pass
debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the community a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement when the land associated with the watercourse alteration is
transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1749.08 (c).
      (6)   The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose.
         (Ord. 623. Passed 11-19-07.)
1749.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   General. Permits are required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified Floodplain, Floodway or other flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (3)   Constructed with material and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage as outlined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) or the most
recent revision thereof.
      (4)   Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (5)   Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
   (b)   Basic Format. The basic format of the permit shall include the
following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant.
      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed construction is
to occur.
      (3)   Names, addresses, and valid WV license numbers of all contractors
working at the building site, or affidavits stating that work is being
performed by individuals exempt from contractor licensing as set forth in Title
28, Series 2, Section 3.9 (b) of the West Virginia Code of State Regulations or
the most recent revision thereof.
      (4)   A description of Site location sufficient to locate the project
including tax map and parcel number.
      (5)   A standard site plan showing size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show ail adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow.
      (6)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to pay any and all fees
associated with the permitting process as set forth in Section
1749.07 (i).
      (7)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to allow community
officials access to the development to inspect for compliance.
      (8)   The contract required by WV Code of State Regulations, Title 28,
Series 4, and all addendums to the contract(s) shall be presented to the
Floodplain Administrator for review. Any amendments or addendums to this
contract shall be presented within five (5) business days of signing. The
community does not require and will not keep copies of the contracts. Failure
to present a contract or an amendment or addendum for review shall void the
permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is of an
aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including materials and
labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article. Depending on
the type of structure involved, the following information shall also be
included in the application for work within the Floodplain Area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer, Surveyor, or Architect.
         C.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, etc. When required by the Floodplain
Administrator, a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall prepare
these plans.
         D.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant obtain elevation data completed by a
Licensed Surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor.
         F.   A Nonconversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the community determines that the area below the first floor could be
converted to a nonconforming use (generally areas below base flood elevation
with ceilings higher than 5 feet). This agreement shall state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section 
1749.08 (c).
      (2)   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this Ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a Registered Professional Engineer, Surveyor, or Architect.
         C.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the
plans in A. above, stating the structure in question, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   Appurtenant Structures. Structures constructed of flood resistant
materials and used solely for parking of vehicles, or storage.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures and showing
the size of the proposed structure and its relation to the lot where it is to
be constructed.
         B.   A completed Elevation Certificate showing elevation of existing
ground, proposed finished ground, and lowest floor.
         C.   The Floodplain Manager shall prepare, or shall cause to be
prepared, certification confirming that the appurtenant structure, together
with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings maybe equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
      The applicant shall sign a Non-conversion Agreement and notify
prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-conversion Agreement to any
new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the transferred
Non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1749.08 (c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria. The owner or developer of any proposed
development, including Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks, shall submit a
preliminary site plan to the Floodplain Administrator that includes the
following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, surveyor, or other
qualified person responsible for providing the information required in this
section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to the City's floodplain areas, proposed lot sites,
and fills. In addition, it is required that all subdivision proposals and other
proposed new developments which are proposed to take place either fully or
partially within the approximated floodplain (F4) and which are greater that
ten (10) lots or two (2) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base
flood elevation data. If FEMA has completed a Flood Insurance Study (FIS), that
data must be used to substantiate the base flood. Otherwise, the developer may
submit data provided by an authoritative source, such as U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural
   Resources Conservation Service, state and local water resource departments,
or technical data developed using detailed methodologies comparable to those
contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be prepared and certified
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (3)   Where the subdivision and/or development lies partially or
completely in the floodplain areas, the plan map shall include detailed
information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads, public
utilities and building sites, All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the floodplain areas.
      (4)   Where the subdivision lies partially in the floodplain area and all
proposed development will take place on natural grade a significant vertical
distance above the floodplain area, development of detailed Base Flood
Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan for the
proposed development must clearly delineate the area to be developed and the
location of the floodplain areas as depicted on the FEMA map. A registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify the site
plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Floodplain Areas. Subdivision
of land in the floodplain area must result in lots that include a buildable
portion outside of the identified flood hazard area and be served by streets
within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower than 1 foot below the
elevation of the line defining the floodplain limits. Ail new structures must
be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot that is located outside of the
identified flood hazard area.
(Ord. 623. Passed 11-19-07.)
1749.06 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Design and Construction Standards. In order to prevent excessive
damage to buildings, structures, and related utilities and facilities, the
following restrictions apply to all development, subdivision proposals,
manufactured home parks, new construction and to construction of substantial
improvements, and the repair of substantial damage to existing structures
occurring in the Floodplain Area.
      (1)   Basements and Lowest Floors.
         A.   All new construction, relocation and substantial improvements,
including repair of substantial damage, of residential structures must have the
lowest floor, including basement, ductwork and utilities, elevated to two feet
above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   All new construction, relocation, substantial improvements,
including repair of substantial damage, of nonresidential structures must have
the lowest floor, including basement, ductwork and utilities, elevated to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation; or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, be designed so that the structure is water tight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         C.   For all new construction, relocation, substantial improvements,
and repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas below the lowest
floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or
storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding
shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
      (2)   Manufactured Home Placement. All manufactured homes to be installed
or substantially improved within the identified flood hazard areas of City of
Dunbar shall be installed by a contractor possessing a valid West Virginia
Manufactured Home Installer's license. Contractors shall install in accordance
with the following standards:
         A.   The lowest floor, ductwork and utilities including HVAC/heat pump
shall be elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Elevation shall be on reinforced piers on a permanent foundation
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength engineered for use

foundation in compliance with the requirements of 42 West Virginia Code of
State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10.1, 10.2, and 10b as authorized by
West Virginia Code § 21-9-4. The anchoring shall be adequate to resist
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include but
are not limited to the over- the-top and frame ties, attached to permanent
foundation elements. Ground anchors are not adequate to satisfy flood specific
anchoring requirements. This requirement is in addition to applicable State and
local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
         D.   Any additions to a manufactured home shall be similarly anchored.
         E.   A contractor possessing a valid WV Manufactured Home Installer's
license shall certify in writing that the manufactured home has been installed
to the standards set forth above.
      (3)   Appurtenant Structures.
         A.   Except as provided in subsection (a)(3)B. below, appurtenant
structures shall be located out of the floodplain area or elevated to two feet
above the Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
            1.   Structures shall be no more than 600 square feet in size and
valued at less than $10,000.00.
            2.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
            3.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
            4.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
            5.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            6.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            7.   The venting requirements contained in Section
1749.06 (a)(1) are applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
         C.   A Nonconversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached
garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the
structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance
premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance
with this Ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature. A
copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator.
Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1749.08 (c).
      (4)   Recreational Vehicle Placement.
         A.   Recreational vehicles to be placed within any floodplain area
shall either:
            1.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and/or,
            2.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
            3.   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home
Placement requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in
this Ordinance.
      (5)   Fill.
         A.   The City of Dunbar officially recognizes the beneficial functions
the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during floods. The
City of Dunbar also finds that placement of fill in floodplains can have
undesirable and detrimental affects on velocity, erosion and sedimentation
rates causing increased flooding.
         B.   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
         C.   Placement of fill in other floodplain areas is restricted to
functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Placement of fill to dispose
of spoil from excavation or to elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not
generally be considered a functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the developer to provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
All fill placed in the floodplain area shall meet or exceed the following
standards:
            1.    Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The City of Dunbar may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by a registered professional
engineer who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City of Dunbar. During permit review the community
shall consider the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse
impact to adjacent properties:
               a.    Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
               b.    Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
               c.    Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing
structures.
               d.    Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
               e.    Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
            2.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
            3.    Filled site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid
ponding).
            4.    Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient
distance to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall
extend laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points
before the start of sloping required in following subsection. For
nonresidential structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable
for intended use. At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15)
feet beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five
percent (25%) of the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
            5.    Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted. No trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
            6.    Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use. Particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
            7.    Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two
(2) horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are
submitted to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
            8.    Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
               a.    Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or
less must be protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds,
or similar vegetative undergrowth.
               b.    Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected
velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet
per second must be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock
slope protection.
            9.    The applicant must submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of Structures. All buildings and structures shall be
constructed and placed on the lot so as to offer the minimum obstruction to the
flow of water and shall be designed to have a minimum obstruction effect upon
the flow and height of floodwaters.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures shall be constructed with the
longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow and,
         B.   So far as practicable, structures shall be placed approximately
on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining structures.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All buildings and structures including stream crossings shall be
firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to prevent
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to life and
property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge openings and
other restricted sections of the watercourse.
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, and storage tanks located at or below
the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist flotation.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.    All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.    All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.    All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.    Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazard.
      (12)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enciosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
floodplain.

Authority.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this Ordinance
shall adhere to the following criteria;
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals
Authority upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause,
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the appeal would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
            3.   A determination that the granting of an appeal will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed

   (c)   Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this article or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator or any other authorized employee of the community shall be
unlawful and shall be referred to the municipal attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Dunbar of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. In default
of such payment such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed 10
days. Each day during which any violation of this article continues shall
constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other
actions are hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this article. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or non-compliance with, this article shall not excuse the
violation or non-compliance with the article or permit it to continue; and all
such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-
compliance within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, altered or relocated in non- compliance with this article may be
declared by the City of Dunbar to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.

or phrase of this Ordinance shall be declared invalid for any reason whatever,
such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this Ordinance which
shall remain in full force and effect and for this purpose the provisions of
this Ordinance are hereby declared to be severable.
   (b)   Liability. The granting of a permit or approval of a subdivision or
development plan in an identified flood-prone area, shall not constitute a
representation, guarantee, or warranty of any kind by the City of Dunbar, or by
any official or employee thereof of the practicability or safety of the
proposed use, and shall create no liability upon the City of Dunbar. All

to show cause why the owner cannot or ought not comply with the order within

appear before the Housing Official and show cause why he cannot or ought not
comply therewith; and any owner who fails to do so shall, upon the expiration
of the time allotted, be deemed to be maintaining a nuisance, which shall
constitute a violation of the provisions of this article. Every owner of a
dwelling containing two or more dwelling units shall be responsible for
maintaining in a clean and sanitary condition the shared or public areas of
such dwelling and the premises thereof; shall maintain such dwelling in a rat
proof and a reasonable insect proof condition and he shall be responsible for

with the following words: "This building is unfit for human habitation, and its
use or occupation for that purpose is unlawful", dated and signed by the
Housing Officer or his authorized representative. Any building or structure so
ordered to be vacated shall not again be occupied until a written statement
shall have been secured from the Housing Officer that the dwelling has been
made to comply with the provisions of the order. Any building, so vacated shall
be immediately closed, by locking, and by boarding and barricading, if
necessary, by the owner thereof at his expense until such written statement
shall have been secured. Occupying or continuing to occupy, or authorizing or
permitting to occupy, or failing to close any such vacated building or
structure shall constitute a violation of the provisions of this article.
   (f)    Demolition. If any building or structure shall continue to be a
nuisance as defined herein for a period of six months after the date of the
order to vacate as set forth in subsection (c) thereof, the Housing Officer may
cause such building to be removed or demolished, and the amount of the cost of
such removal or demolition shall, after sale of all salvaged materials, if any,
is credited to the account, be a lien against the real property upon which such
cost was incurred, which lien shall be superior to all liens thereon except
those for taxes and paving assessments, and which may, if necessary, be
enforced through any court of competent jurisdiction.
   (g)    Hearing Before Housing Commission. Any property owner who receives a
notice from the Housing Officer which orders anything to be done under the

Housing Commission upon written application thereto setting forth the grounds
for such hearing; provided that such application be made prior to the end of
the time for corrective action set forth in the notice or within thirty days

article, and the proceedings including a copy of all pertinent notices and
orders, shall be reduced to writing and entered as a matter of public record in
the office of the Housing Officer.

before the Housing Commission during the course of any hearing held pursuant to
this section and he shall not exercise any of the powers of a member of the

   (a)    Whenever the Building Inspector has evidence that there exists in any

Department governing the installation or repair of any plumbing or drainage, he
shall have power to restrain, correct or remove such violation, prevent further
work upon the building or structure, require its removal and prevent the
occupation or use of the building or structure. He may, in his discretion,
authorize the City Attorney to institute any appropriate action, suits and
proceedings, at law or in equity, to accomplish such purposes.
   (b)    Notices of violation of any provision of this article or of any rule
or regulation of the Building Department governing the installation or repair
of any plumbing or drainage may be issued by the Building Inspector and shall
have his name affixed thereto. A notice of violation shall be served upon the
person charged with the violation or upon the person as designated in Section
1761.10 by any person authorized by the Building Inspector. Such notice shall
contain a brief statement of the nature of the violation charged and the
penalty that may be incurred, a brief description of the building or structure
and premises to which the notice refers including its location and a direction
to the owner requiring that the violations be removed forthwith. A copy of
Section

the person designated in Section

made by affixing the notice in a conspicuous place on the property as to which
a violation is alleged to exist, or to which such notice may refer, and by
depositing in a post office in the City, a copy thereof in a securely closed
postpaid wrapper, addressed to him at his last known place of residence or his
last known place of business. If his place of residence or business is not
known, and the Building Inspector cannot with reasonable diligence ascertain
either, or a place where he would probably receive matter transmitted through
