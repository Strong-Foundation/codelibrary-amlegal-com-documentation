to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council; now therefore,
      
   BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF PRINCETON, WEST VIRGINIA:
   Section 1.  That the ordinances of the City of Princeton, West Virginia, of
a general and permanent nature, as revised, recodified, rearranged and
consolidated into component codes, chapters, articles and sections are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Princeton, West

   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification.  Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number.  For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06.  The code and article numbers appear left of the
decimal, with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the
decimal, and the article number being all digits left of the decimal.  The
section number appears right of the decimal.  As another example, 113.10
indicates the code number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article
within code 1), and the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99.  Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections.  For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

107.01  PURCHASING OF SUPPLIES, MATERIALS, EQUIPMENT AND SERVICES.
   (a)    The City Manager for the City shall make all purchases of supplies,
materials, equipment and services as authorized by Council in the manner
prescribed by this article and subject to the limitations imposed by the City
Charter and general law.
   (b)    All purchases of supplies, materials, equipment and services shall be
pursuant to a written requisition from the head of the office, department or
agency whose appropriation will be charged therewith, and such supplies,
materials, equipment and services shall conform with specifications approved,
established and enforced by the City Manager.
   (c)    No purchase order shall be issued or contract executed nor shall any
other agreement purporting to obligate the City be entered into without a
written approval signed by the City Manager and/or Finance Director, that there
is sufficient unencumbered appropriation and allotment balance to cover the
obligation.
   (d)    Pursuant to the City Charter, before the City Manager shall make any
purchase of, or contract for supplies, materials or equipment, he shall give
ample opportunity for competitive bidding under the general rules and
regulations herein prescribed and with such further regulations and exceptions
as Council may hereafter prescribe; nothing herein contained shall be construed
as excepting individual contracts, purchases or sales from the requirement of
competitive bidding, as required by the Charter. All such purchases, or the
contracts for such purchases, shall be awarded to the lowest and best
responsible bidder; providing, however, that any or all bids may be rejected in
the manner and form prescribed in this article. 
   (e)    Split bidding is prohibited. The practice of "split bidding" is
hereby defined to be the device of submitting multiple requisitions for the
same supplies, materials, equipment or services where the sum of the cost of
the several requisitions is equal to fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or
more, and splitting the department's requirements into several requisitions
would thereby avoid the necessity for the City to require competitive sealed
bids. The practice of "split bidding" is hereby declared to be improper,
illegal and against the public interest, and head of the office, department or
agency shall state on each requisition that such requisition represents the
entire quantity presently known to be required and that the requisition is not
a part of a device or scheme to avoid the purchasing procedure of the City.
   (f)    The City may withhold payment on any vendor or contractor who is in
default on the payment of any taxes, licenses, fees or other moneys of whatever
nature that may be due the City by such vendor or contractor.
   (g)    Pursuant to the provision of the City Charter, any capital
improvements or repairs costing fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000) or more, or
any series of capital improvements or repairs constituting essentially a single
project and costing in the aggregate more than fifteen thousand dollars
($15,000) shall be executed by contract except where such improvement is
authorized by Council to be executed directly by the City Manager in conformity
with detailed plans, specifications and estimates. All such contracts shall be
awarded to the lowest responsible bidder after such public notice and
competitive bidding as prescribed herein, and after a public opening of bids,
as likewise provided herein. Alterations in any contract may be made when
authorized by Council upon the written recommendation of the City Manager.
   (h)    Notice inviting bids shall be published as a Class I legal
advertisement. Such notice shall include a general description of the article
to be purchased, shall state where bid blanks and written specifications may be
secured, and the time and place for opening bids. Additional notice of such
invitation to bid shall be posted on public bulletin boards in the Municipal
building.
   (i)    Bids shall be submitted sealed to the City Clerk and shall be
identified as bids on the envelope. Such bids shall be opened in public and in
the presence of at least three persons, including a representative from the
City Manager and City Clerk's office and at the time and place stated in the
public notices. A tabulation of all bids so received shall be posted on
bulletin boards in the Municipal building for public inspection.
   (j)    Pursuant to the guidelines herein set out, City Council shall have
and hereby is granted the authority to reject any or all bids, parts of all
bids or all bids for any one or more supplies or contractual services included
in the proposed contract.
   (k)    The Finance Director shall establish procedures for purchases of
goods involving the estimated expenditure of less than fifteen thousand dollars
($15,000) of public money.  These procedures shall require that competition be
sought and written records adequate to document the competition be maintained
in order to properly account for the funds expended, and facilitate an audit of
the small purchases made.
   (l)    The City Manager shall require evidence of payment and performance 
bonds secured by a surety company authorized to do business in the State before
entering a contract. The bonds shall be such amount as the Manager shall find
reasonably necessary to protect the best interests of the City.
   (m)    Notwithstanding the procedures as are set out in this article, the
City Manager is hereby authorized with prior approval of the Department of
Finance and Administration of the State to purchase supplies and equipment for
the City pursuant to West Virginia Code 8-12-10 or 8-12- 10(a), when it was
deemed that such purchase will result in a substantial savings to the City.
(Passed 10-9-07.)
   (n)   Procurement of Architect-Engineer Services. 
      (1)   In the procurement of architectural and engineering services for
projects with an estimated cost of construction of $250,000 or more,
competition shall be sought by the City Manager through a solicitation of
interest which shall include information regarding project ownership, intended
use, project scope, schedule, quality, budget, funding sources, known proposed
contract terms, and firm selection procedures.  The solicitation of interest
shall be advertised by the City Manager once a week for two successive weeks in
a newspaper of general circulation published in the City.  The City Manager
shall appoint and chair a committee of no less than three persons to evaluate
the statements of qualifications and other information solicited and/or
submitted by interested firms.  The committees shall short list and then
interview a maximum of five firms, and then shall develop the scope of
services, solicit price, and negotiate a contract to recommend to Council for
final approval in the manner it deems most expedient given the project, the
circumstances, and the best interest of the City.
      (2)   If in the judgment of the City Manager the project has an estimated
construction cost of under $250,000, or an emergency exists and seeking
competition is not practical or in the best interest of the City given the
project, the City Manager may select and contract with a firm based upon known
or submitted qualifications acquired within the last 36 months from a public
solicitation.
      (3)   No contract may be authorized to any business or individual that is
delinquent in any financial obligation to the City or is not operating with all
required licenses and permits.  (Passed 1-11-16.)

defendant may be required to pay in installments or upon such other terms and
conditions or within such period of time as may enable the defendant to pay
such fine and costs. 
   (b)    In determining whether a defendant is unable to pay a fine forthwith,
the Court may require such defendant to file a petition, under oath, with the
Court, upon a form provided by the Court, setting forth the financial condition
of the defendant.
   (c)    Such form shall be a questionnaire, and shall include, but shall not
be limited to: The name and residence of the defendants; occupation, if any;
whether or not dependents are employed and, if so, their approximate monthly
income; bank accounts, if any; real estate owned by the defendant, or any
interest the defendant may have in real estate; income produced therefrom; any
independent income accruing to the defendant; tangible and intangible personal
property owned by the defendant, or in which he may have an interest and a
statement listing the approximate indebtedness of the defendant to other
persons. Such form shall also include a payment plan of the defendant, if the
Court should exercise its discretion in permitting the payment of such fine and
costs in installments or other conditions to be fixed by the Court. At the end
of such form there shall be printed in boldface type, in a distinctive color

MATERIAL FACT TO ANY QUESTION CONTAINED HEREIN SUCH CONSTITUTE FALSE SWEARING
AND SHALL BE AN OFFENSE AGAINST THIS SECTION. THE MAXIMUM PENALTY IS $100 FINE
OR THIRTY DAYS IN JAIL, OR BOTH." A copy of the petition shall be retained by
the defendant.
   (d)    If the defendant is unable to read or write, the Court or the clerk
may assist the defendant in completing the petition and require the defendant
to affix his mark thereto. The consequences of the making of a false statement
shall be explained to such defendant.
   (e)    If a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine and payment of the fine or
fine and costs is order to be made on an installment basis or on other
conditions under the provisions of subsection (a) hereof and if the defendant
is also placed on probation or imposition of the execution of sentence is
suspended, the Court may make payment of the fine a condition of probation or
suspension of sentence.

installment basis, or under such other conditions as the Court shall fix under
the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, the Court may require as a condition
that the defendant keep the peace and be of good behavior until the fine and
costs are paid.
   (g)    When any person sentenced to pay a fine defaults in the payment of
any such fine or of any installment thereof, the Court may issue a summons for
such person to appear before the Court for a hearing on the question of whether
such person's failure to pay the fine or any installment was attributable to
intentional refusal to comply with the prior order of the Court or to a lack of
a good faith effort to comply therewith. The Court may, after hearing, order
that the person in default be allowed additional time for payment, may reduce
or remit the amount of the fine or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in
part, or upon a finding that the default was intentional or due to the lack of
good faith effort to comply with the prior order of the Court, may order such
person confined for such period up to thirty days as the Court in its
discretion shall determine. (1975 Code Sec. 13-8 to 13-12)

525.01  CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section.  A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit.  The court may cause
a citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that
they appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the
issuance of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered
for the penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the
principal and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. 
The money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to
the treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the
offender was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

custody or control of any minor child, shall willfully abandon or neglect the
minor child.
   In addition to any penalty provided under this section and any restitution
which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment of the victim, the need for
which results from the act or acts for which the person is convicted, whether
or not the victim is considered to have sustained bodily injury.

and remedy granted herein shall be in addition to and not exclusive of any

         (WVaC 61-3A-1)
   (c)   Breach of Peace; Detention.  An act of shoplifting as defined herein,
is hereby declared to constitute a breach of peace and any owner of
merchandise, his agent or employee, or any law enforcement officer who has
reasonable ground to believe that a person has committed shoplifting, may
detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting.  Such reasonable

authorized by this section.  However, a merchant who has recovered the penalty
prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment.  The fact that a mercantile establishment

damages or penalty prior to the commencement of any legal action.  (WVaC 61-3A-

club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (b)   "Gravity knife" means any knife that has a blade released from the

other locking or catching device.
   (c)   "Knife" means an instrument, intended to be used or readily adaptable
to be used as a weapon, consisting of a sharp-edged or sharp-pointed blade,
usually made of steel, attached to a handle, which is capable of inflicting
cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds.  "Knife" includes, but is not limited to,
any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and one-half
inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any other
instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds.  A pocket
knife with a blade three and one-half inches or less in length, a hunting or
fishing knife carried for hunting, fishing, sports or other recreational uses,
or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement shall not be
included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless such knife is
knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury or
death.
   (d)   "Switchblade knife" means any knife having a spring-operated blade
which opens automatically upon pressure being applied to a button, catch or

instrument, without reference to the metal or other substance or substances
from which the metallic or false knuckles are made.

713.01  BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OF PUBLIC SOLICITATION OF FUNDS.
   (a)    For the purpose of authorizing, regulating, restricting and
controlling the public begging or soliciting of money, subscriptions or
contributing for any charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purpose
as herein set forth, there is hereby created a nonpartisan Board of Supervisors
of Public Solicitation of Funds, consisting of five members, who shall be over
the age of twenty-one and residents of the City. Members shall be appointed by
the Mayor. One original member shall hold office for a term of one year, one
for a term of two years, one for a term of three years and two for a term of
four years. The appointees at the end of such terms shall each hold office for
a term of four years or until their successors are appointed and qualified.
   (b)    "Board" as used in this article, means the Board of Supervisors of
Public Solicitation of Funds.
   (c)    All members of the Board shall serve without salary. The Chairman of
the Board shall be elected by the Board from its membership and the Board shall
have the power to prescribe rules and regulations for the carrying out of the
purposes herein expressed. The Board shall meet as often as necessary to
perform the duties imposed on the Board by this article.
   (d)    The Board shall have authority to issue placards or notices for the
use of all persons in giving the public notice that no contributions are made
for the purposes set forth in this article except to solicitors authorized by
the Board.
(1975 Code Sec. 16-1 to 16-3)
713.02  UNAUTHORIZED SOLICITATIONS PROHIBITED.
   (a)    The unauthorized, unrestricted and unregulated public begging or
solicitation in the City of money, subscriptions or contributions for any
charitable, educational or benevolent purposes, upon the streets, in public
places, buildings, from house-to-house, or by the use of the telephone or
otherwise, is contrary to the promotion of economic integrity, is detrimental
to the morals, comfort and welfare of the inhabitants of the City and is hereby
forbidden. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent or forbid any
clergyman, pastor, rabbi, priest, rector or minister of the gospel or governing
body of any church, from soliciting funds within their membership exclusively
for religious and church purposes.
   (b)    The offering for sale of tickets for any dance, show or other
performance represented as being for the benefit of a charitable purpose shall
be deemed to be the solicitation of money within the prohibition of this
section.

713.03  PERMIT TO SOLICIT.
   Any person desiring to solicit money, subscriptions or contributions for any
charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purposes as set forth in this
article, shall file with the Board an application on a form approved by the
Board and shall answer, under oath, all of the questions contained in such form
and furnish to the Board all such information with reference to the public
solicitation of funds as may be of assistance to the Board in determining
whether permission shall be given to such person for the purpose of soliciting
funds for the aforementioned purposes. The failure or refusal to file the
application and furnish the information shall constitute sufficient grounds for
the Board, or the Secretary of the Board, to decline the application of the
applicant for permission to solicit funds for the purposes set forth in this
article. The Board may impose such conditions and terms precedent to the
issuance of the permit hereinafter provided for as it may deem reasonable.
(1975 Code Sec. 16-5)
713.04  SECRETARY OF THE BOARD.
   (a)    The Board shall designate one of its members to be Secretary of the
Board and may fix his salary if any funds are available for this purpose.
   (b)    The Secretary of the Board shall investigate all applications of
persons, organizations or associations desiring to solicit funds for
charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purposes. If the Secretary,
after such investigation, is satisfied that the purpose for such solicitation
is a bona fide charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purpose; and
that the proper proportion of the money subscribed or contributed will be used
for the purpose for which the subscription or contribution is made, the
Secretary shall issue to such applicant a card giving the name of the person so
authorized to solicit, the purpose for which the funds are being solicited, the
time within which solicitations of money, contributions or subscriptions are
permitted, the manner in which such solicitation is authorized and whether the
person soliciting funds is being paid for his services as such solicitor.
However, it shall not be necessary for each solicitor to apply to the Board
where more than one person is soliciting for the same purpose, but a general
application for such persons may be made by any one of them and cards for all
such solicitors may be issued upon one application therefor.
   (c)    If the Secretary of the Board, after investigation of any application
for a permit to solicit funds as provided in this article, decides that such
permit should not be issued, he shall decline to issue such permit, and the
person whose application has been declined by the Secretary shall have the
right to appeal to the Board. The Board shall hear and determine the
application and appeal at an open meeting, after notice thereof to the
applicant and appellant, and the decision of a majority of the members of the
Board after such hearing, shall be binding on all of the parties thereto. (1975
Code Sec. 16-6)
713.05  APPEALS.
   An appeal from the decision of the Board may be taken before City Council
which shall, in such instances, have the power to sustain or reverse the
decision of the Board, but no appeal to Council shall be recognized as such
until after notice of such appeal has been published in at least one newspaper
in the City for one week. At the time of such hearing the Secretary or some
other member of the Board shall be present to furnish Council with full
information in support of its decision. (1975 Code Sec. 16-7)
713.06  DUTY TO EXHIBIT PERMIT CARD.
   Any person conducting a campaign or soliciting money, subscriptions or
contributions for any charitable, religious, educational or benevolent purposes
upon the streets, in public places, buildings and from house-to-house, or by
the use of the telephone, or otherwise in the City, shall have and exhibit at
all times when soliciting such funds a card or certificate from the Board
authorizing such person to solicit money, subscriptions or contributions for
such purposes in the manner and at the time such solicitation of funds is made.
Any person soliciting funds, subscriptions or contributions without such permit
or certificate duly issued by the Board or in any manner not authorized by the
Board, shall be guilty of an offense against this section.
(1975 Code Sec. 16-8)
713.07  SUSPENSION OF PERMIT.
   (a)    In the event of violation of the condition, limitation, or
restriction imposed in the granting of any permit herein provided for, or in
the event of the misapplication of any funds collected thereunder, the Board
may suspend the effectiveness of the permit pending a hearing before it as to
whether or not any condition, limitation or restriction imposed by the Board in
the granting of such permit has been violated.
   (b)    Such suspension of the permit shall be in effect only until the
hearing before the Board, upon reasonable notice, at which hearing the holder
of the permit may appear before the Board in person or by counsel, and may
produce evidence. The Board is authorized to hear testimony, swear witnesses
and may require the production of papers and documents by any lawful process to
be served by any police officer of the City.
   (c)    If upon the hearing, the Board determines that this article has been
violated, or any condition, limitation or restriction imposed in any permit has
been violated, the Board may cancel the permit or may suspend the effectiveness
thereof for such time as the Board may deem advisable. The Board shall make a
written finding of the facts, based upon the testimony heard by it, and its
findings as to the facts shall be conclusive. (1975 Code Sec. 16-9)

or commercial use, and shall be required to make returns on account of the
production of the business showing the gross proceeds or equivalent in

assessment of the tax, he may proceed as he deems best to obtain information on
which to base the assessment of the tax. The City Clerk may by himself or his
duly appointed agent, make an examination of the books, records and papers, and
audit the accounts of any such person, including back accounts, and may take

the tax. The assessment of the tax by the Clerk shall be final as to any person
who refused to make a return.

reasons why such hearings should be granted and the amount of such tax should
be reduced. Council shall promptly consider such petition, and may grant such
hearing or deny the same. If denied, the petitioner shall be forthwith notified
thereof; if granted, Council shall notify the petitioner of the time and place
fixed for such hearing. After such hearing, Council may make such order in the
matter as may appear to it just and lawful, and shall furnish a copy of such
order to the petitioner.
   (b)    Any person improperly charged with any tax and required to pay the
tax may recover the amount paid, together with interest, in any proper action
or suit against the City. It shall not be necessary for the taxpayer to protest
against the payment of the tax or to make any demand to have the same refunded
in order to maintain such suit.
(1975 Code Sec. 10-83)
767.20  TAX CUMULATIVE.

   (d)   If no payment is received within the thirty day period, the account
shall be turned over to the City of Princeton, City Attorney for legal action.
   (e)   It shall be the policy of the City of Princeton that no further
forbearance of the B&O tax obligation shall be granted without the approval of
the City Manager and/or the advice and consent of City Council.
   (f)   It shall be the policy and practice of the City of Princeton that no
license to do business within the City of Princeton shall be granted to any

   (g)   It shall be the policy of the City of Princeton that no license to do
business within the City of Princeton shall be granted to any person or entity
who has unlawfully failed to file a B&O tax return in a previous year, unless
that person or entity subsequently filed the B&O tax return and paid any
amounts owing in full.

notification activities by City employees.

after January 1, 2016, either commences its initial operations within the City
limits of the City of Princeton or relocates from outside the City limits of
Princeton to within the City limits of Princeton, shall be eligible to apply to
the City Council of Princeton for a tax exemption for business and occupation
tax such that if Council in its discretion grants the application, then for the
first year the business exists, it shall be entitled to a one hundred percent
(100%) exemption from Business and Occupation Tax. Any business that is
eligible for the exemption set forth in the present section shall make
application to the City Council of Princeton to obtain the benefit of the
exemption set forth herein and the City Council shall have full authority and
complete discretion to grant or deny any application made pursuant to the
provisions of the present section.
(Passed 12-14-15.)
   (b)    In evaluating applications for the tax incentive provided in
subsection (a) hereof the following criteria shall be considered:
      (1)   The size of the business. A factor that is beneficial in
determining the size of a business is the number of employees. There shall be a
preference for businesses with a total of twenty (20) employees or less for the
entire entity with respect to the Business and Occupation Tax Incentive.
         (Passed 10-12-99.)
      (2)   The gross revenue of the business shall also be considered. There

entity of a larger business or corporation, the total number of employees and
total gross revenue of the entire entity must be disclosed so that it may be
considered with respect to the Business and Occupation Tax Incentive.
      (4)   The nature of the business shall also be considered when evaluating
an application for the Business and Occupation Tax Incentive. Businesses that
require  extraordinary uses of City services or are otherwise unduly burdensome
on the City services may be disqualified to receive the Business and Occupation
Tax Incentive based on the nature of the business, such as businesses that
involve the use of hazardous material, hazardous activities or deal with other
activities that require an unusually high demand of fire  or police services of
the City. 
         (Passed 10-12-99.)
      (5)   It is the intent of the present Business and Occupation Tax
Incentive that a business, person, corporation, associated entity or other
entity shall only  be allowed the Business and Occupation Tax Incentive once
and the termination of any business and subsequent opening thereof under
another name shall not be deemed to be an entity that is eligible to receive
the present Business and Occupation Tax Incentive if the business is owned by
the same person or persons or persons residing in said person’s or person’s
household.  (Passed 4-9-12.)
      (6)   In the event any business, person or other entity that has applied
for and received the Business and Occupation Tax Incentive that is the subject
of the present policy moves or otherwise relocates outside the City limits of
Princeton, West Virginia within six (6) months after the most recent Business
and Occupation Tax Incentive that was approved for the tax obligor, the tax
obligor shall reimburse the City for the total amount of Business and
Occupation Tax that was subject to the Business and Occupation  Tax Incentive.
         (Passed 12-14-15)
   (c)    Any business, even those exceeding the gross revenue discussed in
subsection (b)(2) hereof, voluntarily entering the City of Princeton by
annexation by minor boundary adjustment shall also qualify for the Tax
Incentive contained in this section provided that providing the tax incentive
would not place an undue hardship on the resources of the City of Princeton.

third notice of such delinquent taxes provided to the tax obligor and in
addition to the lien against such tax obligor provided by law, be denied all

whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee,

feet of the property line.
   (c)    Where a public sanitary or combined sewer is not available under the
provisions of subsection (b) hereof, the building sewer shall be connected to a
private sewage disposal system complying with the provisions of this article.
(1975 Code Sec. 15-25, 15-26)
921.15  PRIVATE SEWER SYSTEMS.
   (a)    Permit Required; Fee.  Before commencement of construction of a
private sewage disposal system, the owner shall first obtain a written permit
signed by the Manager. The application for such permit shall be made on a form
furnished by the Sanitary Board, which the applicant shall supplement with any
plans, specifications and other information as are deemed necessary by the
Manager. A permit and inspection fee of fifteen dollars ($15.00) shall be paid
to the Manager of the Sanitary Board at the time the application is filed.
   (b)    Conditions Precedent to Operation of Private System; Inspections.  A
permit to operate a private sewage disposal system shall not become effective
until the installation is completed to the satisfaction of the Manager. He
shall be allowed to inspect the work at any stage of construction and, in any
event, the applicant for the permit shall notify the Manager when the work is
ready for final inspection, and before any underground portions are covered.
The inspection shall, when practicable, be made within forty-eight hours of the
receipt of notice by the Manager.
   (c)    Installation.  The type, capacities, location, layout and
installation of a private sewage disposal system shall comply with all
recommendations of the State Health Department. No permit shall be issued for
any private sewage disposal system employing subsurface soil absorption
facilities where the area of the lot is less than 15,000 square feet. No septic
tank or cesspool shall be permitted to discharge into any public sewer or
natural outlet.
   (d)    Connection to Public Sewer When Available.  At such time as a public

imposed by the City health officer.
   (g)   Compliance Required.  Except as herein provided, no person shall
construct or maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool, or other
facility intended or used for the disposal of sewage.
(1975 Code Sec. 15-27 to 15-33)
921.16  SEWER CONNECTIONS AND TAP-INS.
   (a)    Special Schedule of Tap-in Fees.  The Sanitary Board may, by order
duly entered on its records, determine that the proposed construction of an
extension or lateral line of the public sewers of the City, whether within or
without the corporate limits, will entail a cost beyond the revenues to be
derived from fees, and in such case the Sanitary Board may determine a special
schedule of fees for tap-ins to be made along such extension or lateral line by
order entered of record. After such special schedule of fees is determined, if
a majority of the owners of buildings or other improvements to be served
thereby nevertheless file a written petition with such Sanitary Board
containing the special schedule of fees, and petition the Board to make such
extension and charge the schedule of fees, then the Sanitary Board may make
such extension, and all tap-in permits to such extension or lateral line issued
in accordance with subsection (b) hereof shall, as a prerequisite to the
issuance thereof, require the payment of the tap-in fee in accordance with such
special schedule.
   (b)    Tap-in Permit for Each Connection.
      (1)    The Sanitary Board shall, upon application and upon the payment in
cash of the proper tap-in fee, issue to such applicant a written permit to tap
or connect, either directly or indirectly, to the public sewers of the City, a
private drain or sewer from any building or other improvement. A  separate
written permit shall be issued and a separate fee shall be paid for each
building or other improvement as defined herein, so connected directly or
indirectly with such public sewer.
      (2)    Any building or improvement not constituting an integral part of
another building or improvement although appurtenant thereto, whether located
on the same or another lot, shall be considered a separate building or
improvement for the purposes of this article, and require a separate permit and
the payment of a separate fee. A garage apartment shall be considered such a
separate building or improvement.
   (c)    Time Limit of Tap-in Permits.  The tap-in permit, after being
properly issued, unless revoked as herein provided for, shall be an
authorization to the holder thereof to make the connection therein described
within one year from the date of the issuance thereof, but after the end of
such year all rights of the holder to make such connection shall cease and
terminate.
   (d)    Disconnection of Unauthorized Tap.  If any person shall, without
first obtaining a permit as provided in this article, tap or connect a private
drain, sewer or building, either directly or indirectly, as set forth, or
violate any section hereof, the Sanitary Board may in addition to the other
penalties or remedies provided for, disconnect such drain, sewer or building.
   (e)    Instructions; Inspections.  The holder of a tap-in permit shall,
before making any such tap-in or connection, apply to the Manager or the
Engineer of the Sanitary Board, or any other authorized employee of the
Sanitary Board, for instructions as to the manner of making such connection. In
making such connection he shall follow faithfully such instructions, and after
such connection has been made and before covering or concealing such
connection, apply to the Manager, Engineer or employee of the Sanitary Board to
have an inspection made of the connection, and shall cause the connection to
remain uncovered and unconcealed until such inspection is made. The Manager,
Engineer or employee of the Sanitary Board may require, in giving such
instructions, that the private sewer or drain from such building or other
structure to the point of connection shall be uncovered or exposed until
inspection has been made and the holder shall, if required, relay or improve
such private line between such points to the end that no surface water may
enter therein.
   (f)    Advancement of Moneys for New Construction.  If any person desires
that a lateral or extension be made of a public sewer line belonging to the
City, located in or out of the corporate limits, and if the Sanitary Board is
of the opinion that funds cannot be spared for building or extension of such
line, the Sanitary Board is authorized and empowered in its discretion to enter
into a written contract on behalf of the City with such person, whereby a part
or all of the cost of constructing such extension or lateral line shall be
advanced to the City without interest by such person, with the understanding
and agreement that such funds advanced shall be repaid without  interest from
time to time to such person out of tap-in fees in accordance with the special
schedule of fees for tapping in such extension, received from tap-ins or
connections with such extension or lateral line from time to time, until the
advancement is repaid in full, but without interest. Such agreement to be
effective shall be in writing, shall be submitted to and approved by the
authorized attorney and the Sanitary Board, and spread upon the minute book of
the Board at the time of such approval; and upon such approval being given, the
Manager shall execute the agreement on behalf of the Sanitary Board. When the
agreement is made, the Sanitary Board shall enter an account upon a ledger book
of the Board, which account shall show the persons making such an advance and
shall describe the extension or lateral line constructed with reasonable
accuracy; and the amount advanced, together with the repayments thereon, from
time to time, shall be entered on such account. The ledger accounts shall be
kept in a separate ledger book maintained for that purpose.
   (g)    Line from Property to Main Sewer.
(1)    A building sewer or service from the public sewer to property line shall
be constructed by the Sanitary Board, after issuance of a tap-in permit, when
required by the Sanitary Board.
      (2)    At the time of issuance of a permit, the applicant shall be
required to deposit with the Sanitary Board sufficient money to cover the
estimated cost. Cost shall be defined as cost to the Sanitary Board of
materials, labor and transportation, plus fifteen percent (15%) to cover
overhead. The applicant shall agree to pay any overrun within reason and the
Sanitary Board will, after computation of actual cost, refund to the applicant
such money as remains, if the cost is less than the deposit for construction.
The applicant will be given a statement of the cost in sufficient detail and
the Sanitary Board will keep a ledger or card file in which a detail of the
cost of each building sewer is entered.
      (3)    Building sewers or service lines from the property line to the
main sewer outside the corporation line will be constructed by the Sanitary
Board at the discretion of the Board and only upon payment of an additional
twenty percent (20%) over and above the costs mentioned in this section.
      (4)    Schedule of fees for tap-in permits outside of the City will also
be twenty percent (20%) higher than charged within the corporate limits.
         (1975 Code Sec. 15-34 to 15-40)
921.17  BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS.
   (a)    Permit Required to Use Sewer.  No unauthorized person shall uncover,
make any connections with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public
sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the
Manager.
   (b)    Building Sewer Permits and Fees.
      (1)    There shall be two classes of building sewer permits: one for
residential and commercial service, and the other for service to establishments
producing industrial wastes. In either case, the owner or his agent shall make
application on a special form furnished by the Sanitary Board.
      (2)    The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
specifications, or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of
the Manager. A permit and inspection fee of ten dollars ($10.00) for a
residential or commercial building sewer permit and twenty-five dollars
($25.00) for an industrial building sewer permit shall be paid to the Manager
of the Sanitary Board at the time the application is filed.
   (c)    Property Owner Responsible for Costs.  All costs and expenses
incident to the installation and connection of the building sewer shall be
borne by the property owner, who shall indemnify the Sanitary Board for any
loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the
installation of the building sewer.
   (d)    Use of Old Building Sewers.  Old building sewers may be used in
connection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test
by the Manager, to meet all requirements of this chapter.
   (e)    Pipes and Joints.  The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe,
ASTM specification A74-42 or equal; vitrified clay sewer pipe, ASTM
specification C13-44T or equal; or other suitable material approved by the
Manager. Joints shall be tight and waterproof. Any part of the building sewer
that is located within ten feet of a water service pipe shall be constructed of
cast iron soil pipe with leaded joints. Cast iron pipe with leaded joints may
be required by the Manager where the building sewer is exposed to damage by
tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall
be of cast iron soil pipe, except that nonmetallic material may be accepted if
laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the Manager.
   (f)    Size and Slope of Sewer.  The size and slope of the building sewer
shall be subject to the approval of the Manager, but in no event shall the
diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall be
not less than three-sixteenths inch per foot.
   (g)    Pipe Laying Regulations.  Whenever possible the building sewer shall
be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No
building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing
wall, which might thereby be weakened. The depth shall be sufficient to afford
protection from frost. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in
straight alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made with
properly curved pipe and fittings.
   (h)    Where Gravity Flow Not Possible.  In all buildings in which any
building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary
sewage carried by such drain shall be lifted by approved artificial means and
discharged to the building sewer.
   (i)    Excavation Regulations.  All excavations required for the
installation of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise
approved by the Manager. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in
accordance with ASTM specification C12-19 except that no backfill shall be
placed until the work has been inspected.
   (j)    Joints and Connections.
      (1)    All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight.
      (2)    Cast iron pipe joints shall be firmly packed with oakum or hemp
and filled with molten lead, Federal Specification QQ-1-156, not less than one
inch deep. Lead shall be run in one pouring and calked tight. No paint, varnish
or other coatings shall be permitted on the jointing material until after the
joint has been tested and approved.
      (3)    All joints in vitrified clay pipe or between such pipe and metals
shall be made with approved hot-poured jointing material or cement mortar as
specified herein.
      (4)    Material for hot-poured joints shall not soften sufficiently to
destroy the effectiveness of the joint when subjected to a temperature of 160
degrees Fahrenheit, nor be soluble in any of the wastes carried by the drainage
system. The joint shall first be calked tight with jute, hemp or similar
approved material.
      (5)    Cement joints shall be made by packing a closely twisted jute or
oakum gasket of suitable size to fill partly the annular space between the
pipes. The remaining space shall be filled and firmly compacted with mortar
composed of one part Portland cement and three parts mortar sand. The material
shall be mixed dry; only sufficient water shall be added to make the mixture
workable. Mortar which has begun to set shall not be used or retempered. Lime
putty or hydrated lime may be substituted to the extent of not more than
twenty-five percent (25%) of the volume of the Portland cement that may be
added.
      (6)    Other jointing materials and methods may be used only by approval
of the Manager. 
   (k)    Connection to Public Sewer.  The connection of the building sewer
into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such branch is
available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is twelve inches in
diameter or less, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, the property
owner shall at his expense install a "Y" branch in the public sewer at the
location specified by the Manager. Where the public sewer is greater than
twelve inches in diameter, and no properly located "Y" branch is available, a
neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building sewer, with
entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about  forty-five degrees. A
forty-five degree ell may be used to make the connection, with the spigot end
cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert
of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at the same or at a
higher elevation than the invert of the public sewer. A smooth, neat joint
shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in
concrete. Special fittings may be used for the connection only when approved by
the Manager.
   (l)    Notification When Ready to Connect.  The applicant for the building
sewer permit shall notify the Manager when the building sewer is ready for
inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made
under the supervision of the Manager or his representative.
   (m)    Excavations; Precautions and Restoration.  All excavations for
building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades and
lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways
and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored
in a manner satisfactory to the Sanitary Board.

   SCHEDULE II
SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED IN CASES WHERE SURFACE DRAINAGE IS CONNECTED TO
THE UTILITY’S SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM.
Where the Utility has discovered that a customer’s roof drain, downspouts,
storm sewer or other similar facilities conducting surface water have been
connected to the Utility’s sewer system, and such customer has failed to take
appropriate action, within thirty (30) days of receipt of a demand by the
Utility in accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service
Commission, to eliminate such connection, a surcharge will be imposed upon the
customer calculated on the basis of the following formula:
   
   S = A x R x .0006233 x C
   S   -   The surcharge in dollars
   A   -   The area under roof and/or the area of any other water collection
surface connected to the sanitary sewer, in square feet
   R   -   The measured monthly rainfall, in inches
   .0006233   A conversion factor to change inches of rain x square feet of
surface to thousands of gallons of water
   C   -   The Utility’s approved rate per thousand gallons of metered water
usage
The Utility shall not impose the surcharge unless and until the customer has
been notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by hand delivery,
that it has been established  by smoke testing, dye testing, or on-site
inspection that rain or other surface water is being introduced into the
sanitary sewer system at the customer’s location, and that the customer has not
acted within thirty (30) days from receipt of such notice to divert the water
from the sanitary sewer system.
Said surcharge shall be calculated and imposed for each month that said
condition continues to exist.  Failure to pay the surcharge and/or correct the
situation shall give rise to the possible termination of water service in
accordance with the Rules and Regulations of the Public Service Commission of
West Virginia.
SCHEDULE III
SURCHARGE FORMULA TO BE APPLIED IN THE CASE OF USERS PRODUCING UNUSUAL WASTE
The charge for the treatment of unusual waste will be calculated on the basis
of the following formula:
Ci = VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
   Ci   =   charge to unusual users per year
   Vo   =   average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to volume,
in dollars per gallon
   Vi   =   volume of waste water from unusual users in gallons per year
   Bo   =   average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD) in dollars per year
   Bi   =   weight of BOD from unusual users, in pounds per year
   So   =   average unit costs of treatment (including sludge treatment
chargeable to total solids, in dollars per pound
   Si   =   weight of total solids from unusual users, in pounds per year
   When an unusual user is to be served, a preliminary study of its wastes, and
the cost of transport and treatment thereof, will be made.  Waste containing
material which, in the judgment of the Utility, should not be introduced into
the sewer system need not be handled by it.  The results of this preliminary
study will be used to determine the feasibility of the proposed sewer service
and the charge thereof, based upon the formula set out above.
   Thereafter, unusual sewage will be monitored on a regular basis and at the
conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation aforesaid and audit
of the Utility records, new cost figures will be calculated for use in the
above formula.  The cost of establishing the monitoring facilities shall be
paid by the unusual user.  Based on these audited figures, additional billings
covering the past fiscal year will be made for payment by each unusual user, or
refund given by the Utility, as the case may be.  Such audited figures will
then be used for the preliminary billing for the next fiscal year, at the end
of which an adjustment will be made as aforesaid.
   SCHEDULE IV
APPLICABLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE OF THE LIMITS OF THE UTILITY.
Where the amount of sanitary sewage discharged into the Utility’s wastewater
collection and/or transmission and/or treatment system by certain industrial
plant or plants cannot be accurately determined by the use of the plant’s water
meter or meters, and said plant cannot install a flow meter to measure such
waste, a special formula will be used whereby such plant or plants will pay to
the Utility a sewer charge calculated at fifty (50) gallons of water per each
employee at the plant each working day.
   SCHEDULE V   
APPLICABILITY.  Applicable within the entire territory served.
   AVAILABILITY.  Available for wastewater and leachate haulers.
RATES.  Commodity Charge.  Each customer shall pay a commodity charge of $50.00
per 1,000 gallons per load.  Load will be the actual capacity of the truck or
other transport method delivering wastewater and leachate.  Actual capacity
shall be determined, or verified solely, by the Utility.
DELAYED PAYMENT PENALTY.  The above schedule is net.  On all current usage
billings not paid in full when due, ten percent (10%) will be added to the net
current amount unpaid.  This delayed payment penalty is not interest and is to
be collected only once for each bill where it is appropriate.
RETURNED CHECK CHARGE.  A service charge equal to actual bank charges will be
imposed upon any customer whose check is returned by the bank for any reason.
   SCHEDULE VI

parcel of real estate or building connected with, served by, or using such
sewer system, and the amount of all such rates or charges, if not paid when

1151.01  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   Council recognizes and declares that abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor
vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative household
appliances are and constitute a public nuisance and hazard to both adults and
children and therefore are dangerous and constitute a clear and present danger;
that such abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires
and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances serve as harborage
and breeding places for rodents, mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, mice, rats and other
insects, pests and flies injurious to the public health, safety and general
welfare; that abandoned motor vehicles and junked motor vehicles serve
frequently as temporary or permanent places of human residence unconducive to
public health, safety and welfare; that the accumulation and storage of any of
such items or parts thereof on private or public property, including but not
limited to highways, is hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce
the value of private property and to promote blight and deterioration which if
permitted to remain will continue to destroy the natural beauty of this City
and have adverse economic and social effects; that such abandoned motor
vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or
inoperative household appliances constitute an attractive nuisance creating a
hazard to the health and safety of minors; that such items are nearly always
located on public highways, rights of way, or within sight of such highway
rights of way and on private property within a reasonable proximity thereto;
that all such visual pollution is a deterrent to economic development; and that
it is in the public interest and welfare to provide for a program to eliminate
the unsightly practice of abandoning motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and
certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances.
In view of these findings, Council declares it to be the public policy of the
City to eliminate the present danger resulting from abandoned motor vehicles,
junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative
household appliances and to eliminate the visual pollution resulting from these
items, and that in order to provide for the public health, safety and welfare,
and quality of life, to enact legislation to that end by providing expeditious
means and methods for effecting the disposal of abandoned motor vehicles,
junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned household
appliances. Council further finds and declares that the presence of an
abandoned motor vehicle, junked motor vehicle, old vehicle tires or an
abandoned or inoperative household appliance, or any part thereof, on private
or public property, including but not limited to highways, except as expressly
hereinafter permitted, is a public nuisance injurious to the public health,
safety and general welfare of the residents of this City which shall be abated
as such by the methods provided in this article.

designated as the "abandoned and junked property fund"; provided, that any
remainder from the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle or junked
motor vehicle after payment of such expenses shall be held for the last
registered owner of such motor vehicle or any lienholder for ninety days, after
which time, if no owner or lienholder claims the remainder, it shall be
deposited in such special fund.

City Manager, ten copies of a preliminary plan meeting the requirements of
these Subdivision Regulations not less than seven days prior to the regular
meeting of the Planning Commission.
   (d)    Referrals.  The City Manager shall immediately send one copy of the
plan to the Planning Commission, one copy to the County Planning Commission,
one copy to the West Virginia Department of Highways District Office, if the
subdivision will enter any existing or proposed State Highway, one copy to the
City Engineer and one copy to the City Building Official.
   (e)    Action.  The Planning Commission shall review at its regular meeting,

conditionally approve the Preliminary Plan as submitted or modified, or to
disapprove the Plan.
      (2)    The Planning Commission shall notify the subdivider and Council of
its actions, in writing, not later than five days after the subsequent meeting.
   (f)    Effect of Approval.  Approval of the Preliminary Plan shall
constitute conditional approval of the subdivision as to the character and
intensity of development, general layout and approximate dimensions of streets
and lots. The approval binds the subdivider to the general scheme of the
subdivision shown; permits the subdivider to proceed with the installation of
site improvements, subject to obtaining necessary work permits from the City;
and permits preparation of the Final Plan. Approval of the Preliminary Plan
does not authorize the sale of lots nor the recording of the Preliminary Plan.
(Ord. 1-79. Passed 6-18-79.)
1309.02  FINAL PLAN PROCEDURE. 
   (a)    Final Plan Submission.  Within one year after approval of the
Preliminary Plan, the subdivider must submit a Final Plan covering at least
fifty percent (50%) of the land area of the Preliminary Plan. If the subdivider
does not submit a Final Plan within the one year period, the approval of the
Preliminary Plan may be voided and the Plan resubmitted as a Preliminary Plan.
The subdivider shall submit ten copies of the Final Plan and one copy of
required data to the City Manager at least seven days prior to a regular
meeting of the Planning Commission.
   (b)    Plan May Be Submitted in Sections.  The Planning Commission may
permit submission of the Final Plan in sections, each governing a portion of
the proposed subdivision as shown on the Preliminary Plan.
   (c)    Conformance with Preliminary Plan.  The Final Plan shall conform in
all important respects with the approved Preliminary Plans. Otherwise the Plan
submitted shall be considered as a revised Preliminary Plan.
   (d)    Improvements.  No Final Plan shall be approved unless the subdivider
shall have installed all improvements required in these Regulations or filed
with the City Manager, a performance guarantee to ensure installation and
construction of all required improvements at the standards required.
   (e)    Fees.  The Preliminary Plan shall be accompanied by a deposit of one
hundred dollars ($100.00) with the City, to defray the cost of advertising,
conducting the public hearing, reviewing the Plan, and drawing the Plan on the
official City map. The developer shall be responsible to pay for all cost
incurred by the City in the review of the Subdivision Plan submitted.
   (f)   Public Hearing.  Before acting on any subdivision plan, the Planning
Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon after giving due public notice.
At least thirty days prior to the date set for hearing, the Commission shall
publish a notice of the date, time and place of the hearing, as a Class 1 legal
advertisement.
   (g)    Action.  Within ninety days from the submission of a Final Plan the
Planning Commission shall act on the Plan and notify the subdivider of their
action in writing. A Final Plan may be disapproved if the subdivider refuses to
furnish information or documents as required pursuant to these Regulations, or
to comply with improvements required to be installed.
   (h)   Approval of Final Plan.  When the Planning Commission has approved the
Final Plan, the Commission Secretary shall seal and endorse two copies of the
Final Plan to that effect. One copy of the endorsed Final Plan shall be kept in
the Commission files and the other returned to the subdivider. 
   The Planning Commission shall endorse an approved Final Plan as follows:
"Approved         (Date)        by the Princeton Planning Commission.
                                  , Chairman;

   (i)   Recording.  An approved duplicate copy of the Final Plan shall be
recorded by the owner in the Office of the County Recorder of Deeds within
ninety days after the date of approval. (Ord. 1-79. Passed 6-18-79.)

is to be subdivided. Land subject to periodic flooding or other hazards of
life, health, or property, shall not be subdivided for residential purposes
unless adequate safeguards against such hazards are provided by the Plan.
   (b)   Community Facilities and Comprehensive Plan Requirements.  The
Commission will consider the adequacy of the existing or proposed community
facilities to serve the uses proposed in the subdivision. Where a proposed
park, playground, school, or other public use shown in the Comprehensive Plan
is located in whole, or in part in a subdivision, the Commission may require
the provision or reservation of such area as may be deemed reasonable;
provided, that such provision or reservation is acceptable to the Municipality.

conformity with the features or developments proposed in the Comprehensive
Plan.
   (c)    On Lot Sewage and Water Supply.  Where evidence indicates that the
minimum lot size requirements specified in other sections of the Subdivision
Regulations or in the Zoning Ordinance is not adequate to permit the
installation of individual on-lot water supply and/or sewage disposal
facilities, the Commission shall request the Mercer County Health Department to
make such tests as are necessary to determine the adequacy of the proposed lot
size, existing grade and soil conditions. The Planning Commission shall review
the findings of the County Health Department and of any other competent
registered engineer or authority on this matter, and shall make a final
determination on the adequacy of the proposed facility.
   (d)    Easements.
      (1)    Easements with a minimum width of fifteen feet plus the width of
any required pipe or other improvements shall be provided as necessary for
utilities.

      (8)    Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing street of
inadequate right-of- way width, additional right-of-way width in conformance
with Table 1, will be required.
      (9)    Where the grade of any street at the approach to an intersection
exceeds seven percent (7%), a leveling area shall be provided having not
greater than four percent (4%) grades for a distance of twenty-five feet
measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting street.
   (j)    Uses Fronting on Arterial Streets.
      (1)    Local streets. Where a subdivision fronts or abuts an Arterial
Street the Commission may require any of the following measures:

1339.01  GENERAL PROCEDURE.
   (a)    General Sequence of Steps.  All persons desiring to undertake any new
construction, structural alteration or change in the use of a building or lot
shall apply to the Zoning Official for a Zoning Permit by filling out the
appropriate application form and by submitting the required fee, as designated
by Council. The Zoning Official will then either issue or refuse the Zoning
Permit, or refer the application to the Board of Zoning Appeals. After the
Zoning Permit has been received by the applicant, he may proceed to undertake
the action permitted by the Zoning Permit and upon completion of such action
shall apply to the Zoning Official for an Occupancy Permit. If the Zoning
Official finds that the action of the applicant has been taken in accordance
with the Zoning Permit, he will then issue an Occupancy Permit allowing the
premises to be occupied.
   (b)    Zoning Permit Types.  Under the terms of the Zoning Ordinance, the
following classes of Zoning Permits may be issued:
      (1)    Permitted uses.  A Zoning Permit for a Permitted Use may be issued
by the Zoning Official on his own authority.
      (2)    Special uses.  A Zoning Permit for a Special Use may be issued by
the Zoning Official upon the order of the Board of Zoning Appeals and after a
public hearing held by the Board for the purpose of deciding such special use.
      (3)    Zoning Permit after an appeal or a request for a variance.  A
Zoning Permit may be issued by the Zoning Official upon the order of the Board
and after a public hearing held by the Board of Zoning Appeals for the purpose
of deciding upon an appeal or a request for a variance.
      (4)    Temporary Permits.  Temporary permits may be authorized by the
Board of Zoning Appeals for a period not to exceed one year, for temporary
nonconforming uses incidental to housing and construction projects, including
such structures and uses as storage of building materials and machinery, the
processing of building materials or a real estate office located on the tract
being offered for sale; provided that such permits are issued upon agreement by
the owner to remove the structure or structures or the use upon expiration of
the permit. Such permits may be renewed annually for a period not exceeding
three years.
         (12-17-79)
1339.02  ZONING AND OCCUPANCY PERMITS AND CERTIFICATES.
   (a)    Zoning Permits.  The purpose of the Zoning Permit is to ensure
compliance with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, and no person shall
erect, alter, or convert any structure, building or part thereof, nor alter the
use of any land, subsequent to the adoption of the Zoning Ordinance, until a
Zoning Permit has been issued by the Zoning Official. All applications for
Zoning Permits shall be in writing on forms to be furnished by the Zoning
Official.
      (1)    Remodeling or improvement of existing buildings which does not
alter the basic structure, create additional lot area coverage or change the
use of the parcel or building is exempt from this specific requirement;
provided, that the estimated cost of such activities does not exceed one
hundred percent (100%) of the fair market value.
      (2)    There shall be submitted with all applications for Zoning Permits,
two copies of a layout or plot plan drawn to scale, showing the actual
dimensions of the lot to be built upon, the exact size and location of the
building on the lot and accessory buildings to be erected, and such other
information as may be deemed necessary by the Zoning Officer to determine and
provide for the enforcement of these standards.
      (3)    One copy of such layout or plot plan shall be returned when
approved by the Zoning Officer, together with the Permit, to applicant, upon
the payment of the fee set forth in Section
1339.08 .
      (4)    Zoning Permits shall be issued in duplicate and one copy shall be
kept conspicuously on the premises, and no person shall perform building
operations of any kind unless a Zoning Permit is displayed as required by the
Zoning Ordinance. The Zoning Official may revoke a Permit at any time if it
appears that the application is in any material respect false or misleading, or
that work being done upon the premises differs materially from that called for
in the application.
      (5)    The action covered by the Zoning Permit shall be initiated within
six months from the date of issue, and such action must be completed within a
reasonable time period, not to exceed two years unless an extension is granted
by the Board of Zoning Appeals. 
   (b)    Occupancy Permits.
      (1)    The purpose of an Occupancy Permit is to certify that the premises
comply with the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance and may be used for the
purposes set forth in the Occupancy Permit. Prior to the use or occupancy of
any land or building for which a Zoning Permit is required, or for any change
of use of land, an Occupancy Permit shall be secured from the Zoning Official.
A copy of the Occupancy Permit shall be kept upon the premises, and shall be
displayed upon request made by any officer of the City. All applications for
Occupancy Permits shall be in writing, on forms furnished by the Zoning
Official. Written request to the Zoning Official will be processed within one
week of receipt of the request of the proposed Occupancy Permit, if the use is
in conformity with the provisions of these standards and other effective and
applicable ordinances. The Zoning Official's refusal to issue an Occupancy
Permit shall include a written statement to the applicant containing reasons
for such denial.
      (2)    Occupancy Permits shall state that the building or the proposed
use of a building or land complies with all provisions of law and of these
standards and other ordinances of the Municipality; and an Occupancy Permit is
deemed to authorize, and is required for both initial and continued occupancy
and use of the building and land so long as such building and use is in full
conformity with the provisions of these standards.
   (c)    Registration of Nonconforming Structures and Nonconforming Uses.  The
Zoning Official shall identify and register all nonconforming structures and
nonconforming uses.
   (d)    Certificate of Nonconforming Use.  The owner of the premises occupied
by a lawful nonconforming use or building may secure a Certificate of
Nonconforming Use from the Zoning Official. Such certificate shall be
authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals and shall be for the purpose of
insuring to the owner the right to continue such nonconforming use.

   (c)    Officers; Quorum; Secretary and Employees.
      (1)    At its first meeting of each year, the Board of Zoning Appeals

      (2)    A majority of the members of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall
constitute a quorum. No action of a Board shall be official, however, unless
authorized by a majority of all of the members of the Board.
      (3)    The Board of Zoning Appeals may appoint and fix the compensation

compensation theretofore fixed by the Municipality.
   (d)    Offices; Appropriation for Expenses.  Council shall provide the Board

   (e)    Rules and Regulations; Procedures; Minutes and Records.
      (1)    In addition to the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, the Board
of Zoning Appeals shall adopt such rules and regulations concerning the filing
of appeals, applications for variances and exceptions, the giving of notice and
the conduct of hearings as shall be necessary to carry out its duties under the
terms of this article.
      (2)    The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings, keep records of

regulations in the classes of cases or in particular situations specified in
the Zoning Ordinance;
      (3)    Hear and decide special exceptions to the terms of the Zoning
Ordinance upon which the Board is required to act under the Zoning Ordinance;
and
      (4)    Authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variances from the
terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest,
where owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the
spirit of the Zoning Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.
      (5)    In exercising its powers and authority, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may reverse or affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from, as in its opinion ought
to be done in the premises, and to this end shall have all the powers and
authority of the Official or the Board from whom or which the appeal is taken.
(12-17-79)
1339.05  VARIANCES AND SPECIAL USES.
   (a)    Board May Authorize Variance.  Upon appeal, and after a public
hearing, the Board of Zoning Appeals may vary the strict application of any of
the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, provided that such variance shall be
in the case of exceptional physical conditions, whereby such strict application
would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship that would deprive
the owner of the reasonable use of the land or building involved, but in no
other case. The purpose of any variance shall be to prevent discrimination, and
no variance shall be granted which would have the effect of granting a special
privilege not shared by other property in the same vicinity and zone.
   (b)    Required Showing for Variance.  No variance in strict application of
any provision of the Zoning Ordinance shall be granted by the Board unless it
finds special circumstances or conditions applying to the land or buildings
that do not apply generally to land or buildings in the neighborhood; that such
circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance would deprive the applicant of the
reasonable use of the land or building; that the variance granted by the Board
is the minimum variance that will accomplish relief and that the granting of
such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to the property or improvement in that vicinity and district in which
the property is located.
      (1)    The Board may grant a variance provided the following findings are
made where relevant in a given case:
         A.    That there are unique physical circumstances or conditions
including irregularity, narrowness, or shallowness of lot size or exceptional
topographical or other physical conditions peculiar to the particular property,
and that the unnecessary hardship is due to such conditions, and not
circumstances or conditions generally created by the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance in the neighborhood or district in which the property is located;
         B.    That because of such physical circumstances or conditions, there
is no possibility that the property can be developed in strict conformity with
the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance, and that the authorization of a
variance is therefore necessary to allow the reasonable use of the property;
         C.    That such unnecessary hardship has not been created by the
appellant;
         D.    That the variance, if authorized, will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood or district in which the property is located, nor
substantially or permanently impair the appropriate use or development of
adjacent property, nor be detrimental to the public welfare; and
         E.    That the variance, if authorized, will represent the minimum
variance that will afford relief and will represent the least modification
possible of the regulation at issue.
      (2)    In granting any variance, the Board may attach such reasonable
conditions and safeguards as it may deem necessary to implement the purposes of
the  Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)    Board May Decide on Requests for Special Uses.  Special Uses, also
known as Special Exceptions, or Conditional Uses, shall require individual
consideration in each case and shall be permitted only upon authorization of
the Board of Zoning Appeals, after a public hearing and determination that the
proposed special use is in keeping with the intent of the Zoning Ordinance and
special regulations contained herein which are applicable to the proposed
special use. (12-17-79)
   (d)   An individual property owner may make application for a special use
permit for a specific property.  Continuing, if approved by the Board of Zoning
Appeals, to a specific property owner for a special use, for a specific parcel
of property, neither the property owner nor the subsequent tenant will be
required to obtain additional, special use permits upon change of tenant.
      (1)   Regardless of the provisions made in this section, a property owner
and/or tenant shall be required to obtain a new special use permit if any of
the following occur:
         A.   If the use previously granted by a permit changes to a different
use; or
         B.   If the premises or property granted the special use remains
vacant for more than one year or the premises or property ceases to be used
pursuant to the special use for more than one year; or
         C.   If the building or premises is changed to accommodate a different
use.  However, should the property operating under a special use come under new
ownership and the use of the premises is to remain the same, the Zoning
Official may waive the hearing before the Zoning Board of Appeals and transfer
the special use permit to the new owner.  (Passed 10-10-17.)
      (2)   Regardless of the provisions made in this article, no special use
shall be granted for a period exceeding five years.
      (3)   Any property owner seeking to utilize this article shall notify the
City each time there is a change of occupancy and shall notify the City of the
name and address of the new tenant.  Such notice shall be in writing and shall
take place ten (10) days prior to any change and include a certification from
both owner and new tenant that the property will continue to be used pursuant
to the previously approved special use.  All new tenants shall be required to
obtain a City business license and occupancy permit before occupying the
premises.  (Passed 1-12-09.)

occupant of every lot on the same street within 300 feet of the lot or building
in question and of every lot not on the same street within 100 feet of the lot
or building; however, failure to give such notice as specified in this
subsection shall not invalidate any action by the Board. (Passed 10-10-17.)
      (2)    The Board of Zoning Appeals may require the party taking the
Appeal to assure the cost of public notice and due notice to interested
parties.
      (3)    At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent or by an
attorney at law admitted to practice in this State. The Board shall decide each

   (d)    Staying of Work on Premises When Appeal Taken; Exception.  When an
appeal has been taken and filed with the Board of Zoning Appeals, all
proceedings and work on the premises in question shall be stayed unless the
Zoning Official from whom the appeal is taken shall certify to the Board of
Zoning Appeals that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would
cause imminent peril to life or property. If such certificate be filed,
proceedings or work on the premises shall not be stayed, except by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Circuit Court of Mercer County
upon application therefor, on notice to the Zoning Official from whom the
appeal is taken and the owner of the premises affected and on due cause shown.

      (1)    Every decision or order of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be
subject to review by certiorari.
      (2)    Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any

upon the adverse party or parties if any, as shown by the record of the appeal
in the office of the Board of Zoning Appeals, and upon the Chairman or
Secretary of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (1)    The adverse party or parties shall be a property owner whom the
record of the Board of Zoning Appeals shows to have appeared at the hearing
before the Board in opposition to the petitioner. If the record shows a written
remonstrance or other document opposing the request of petitioner containing
the names of more than three property owners, the petitioner shall be required
to cause notice to be issued and served upon the three property owners whose
names first appear upon the remonstrance or document. Notice to the other
parties named in the remonstrance or document shall not be required.
      (2)    The notice shall state that a petition for a writ of certiorari

decision or order of the Board of Zoning Appeals; shall designate the premises
affected, and shall specify the date of the decision or order complained of.
      (3)    Service of the notice by the Sheriff on the Chairman or Secretary

filing of such petition shall be necessary.

petition for a writ of certiorari, the Circuit Court of the County in which the
premises affected are located, or a judge thereof in violation, shall direct
the Board of Zoning Appeals to show cause within twenty days from the date of
such citation why a writ of certiorari should not be issued. If such Board
fails to show to the satisfaction of the court or judge that a writ should not
be issued, then the court or judge may allow a writ of certiorari directed to
the Board of Zoning Appeals. The writ shall prescribe the time in which a
return shall be made to it. This time shall not be less than ten days from the
date of issuance of the writ and may be extended by the court or judge thereof.
   (h)    Stay of Work on Allowance of Writ.
      (1)    The allowance of the writ of certiorari shall not stay proceedings
or work on the premises affected by the decision or order to be brought up for
review. The court or judge may, however, upon application and on notice to all
parties to the decision or order and on due cause shown, grant such relief as
the circumstances of the case may require, including an order staying the
proceedings or work until final determination of the case by the court or judge
thereof.
      (2)    Such staying order may be issued by the court or judge without
requiring the petitioner to enter a written undertaking with the adverse party
or parties affected thereby for the payment of damages by reason of such

petition and return to the writ of certiorari.
      (1)    If it shall appear to the court or judge that testimony is
necessary for the proper disposition of the matter, the court or judge may take
evidence to supplement the evidence and facts disclosed by the petition and
return to the writ of certiorari, but no such review shall be by trial de novo.
      (2)    In passing upon the legality of the decision or order of the Board
of Zoning Appeals, the court or judge may reverse or affirm, in whole or in
part, or may modify such decision or order.

1365.05  GENERAL INFORMATION.
   (a)    The information contained in this section shall apply in all other
sections of this article. However, if the information contained in this section
conflicts or contradicts the information in other chapters, articles or
sections then the information in other chapters, articles or sections shall
control with respect to those chapters, articles or sections.
   (b)    The Building Inspector and Zoning Official of the City of Princeton
are charged with the issuance of permits and enforcement of this article. Areas
of conflict and interpretation may be addressed through the City Clerk for
resolution, in coordination with the Zoning Board of Appeals, the Princeton
Planning Commission and/or the Princeton City Council.
   (c)    Computations.  The following principles shall control the computation
of sign area and sign height.
      (1)   Computation of area of individual signs.  The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one face)
shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle,
or other combination thereof, that will encompass the extreme limits of the
writing, representation, emblem, color, or other display together with any
material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or
used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it
is placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative
fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets the City Building Code
requirements and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
      (2)   Computation of area of multi-faced signs.  The sign area for a sign
with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the area of all
sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical sign faces are placed
back to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any point at the same
time, and when such sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not
more than 42 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement
of one of the faces.

computed by applying the formula in the appropriate section of this article.
   (d)    Removal of Certain Signs.  In the event a business ceases operation
for a period of time in excess of thirty (30) days, the sign owner, property
owner, or any lessee shall immediately remove any sign identifying or
advertising said business or any product sold thereby; provided, however, this
requirement shall not apply where under the provisions of this Ordinance an
existing conforming sign may be altered to advertise a new business or product
sold thereby, and there is evidence that a new business will be in operation on
the premises within six (6) months. For the purpose of this Section, the word
"remove" shall mean:
      (1)   The sign face, along with posts, columns, or supports of
freestanding signs shall be taken down and removed from the property.
      (2)   The sign face and supporting structures of "projecting," "roof," or
"wall signs" shall be taken down and removed from the property, and the
building repaired or returned to its original condition prior to the
installation of the sign.
      (3)   The sign face of painted wall signs shall be removed by painting
over the wall sign in such a manner as to completely cover up and hide from
sight the sign in question.
   (e)    Non-Conforming Signs.  For the purpose of this section, a
nonconforming sign shall be defined as a sign existing at the effective date of
this article which could not be built under the terms of this article. All on-
site, non-conforming signs not otherwise prohibited by the provisions of this
article shall be removed or shall be altered to conform to the provisions of
this article:

and the sign is changed or modified either in shape, size, or legend or

structure as regulated by this Ordinance shall be erected at or near any street
or any public right-of-way in such a manner as to obstruct free and clear
vision; or at any location where, by reason of the position, shape, or color,
the sign may interfere, obstruct the view, or be confused with any authorized
traffic control device.
   (g)    Placing Signs on Public Property.  No signs other than signs approved
by the Princeton City Council or its authorized representative shall be erected
on any public property.
   (h)    Placing Signs on Trees and Rocks.  No signs shall be placed or
painted on any tree or rock.

trailer as a sign in circumvention of this article.

jointly, or where a parcel or building is being developed adjacent to another
parcel used or suitable for nonresidential development, the Plan shall insure
compliance with the following criteria:

their joint use by adjoining parcels, so as to minimize the number of
intersections with the street or highway from which they derive their access.

emissions from Telecommunications Facilities; and
      (2)   The regulation of radio signal interference among uses of the RF
spectrum.
   (b)   The City's regulation of Towers and Telecommunications Facilities of
the City will not have the effect of prohibiting any person from providing
wireless telecommunications services in violation of the Act.

1389.02  PURPOSES.
   The general purpose of this article is to regulate the placement,
construction, and modification of Towers and Telecommunications Facilities in
order to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public, while at the
same time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the competitive
wireless telecommunications marketplace in the City.
   Specifically, the purposes of this article are:
   (a)    To regulate the location of Towers and Telecommunications Facilities
in the City;
   (b)    To protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impact of Towers and Telecommunications Facilities;
   (c)    To minimize adverse visual impact of Towers and Telecommunications
Facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping and innovative
camouflaging techniques;
   (d)    To promote and encourage shared use/co-location of Towers and Antenna
Support Structures as a primary option rather than construction of additional
single-use Towers;
   (e)    To promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new Tower structures
to support antennas and Telecommunications Facilities;
   (f)    To avoid potential damage to property caused by Towers and
Telecommunications Facilities by ensuring such structures are soundly and
carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained, and removed when no
longer used or are determined to be structurally unsound; and
   (g)    To ensure that Towers and Telecommunications Facilities are
compatible with surrounding land uses.

1775.03  ESTABLISHMENT OF THE FLOOD PLAIN AREA.
   (a)    Identification.  The identified floodplain area shall be those areas
of the City, which are subject to the 100 year flood, as shown on the Floodway
Map or Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Princeton by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) and dated February 1, 1984, or the most recent
revision thereof.
   (b)    Description of Floodplain Areas. The identified floodplain area shall
consist of the following three specific areas:
      (1)    The Floodway area shall be those areas identified as such in the
FIS and as shown on the Floodway Map or FIRM. The term shall also include
floodway areas identified in other studies for the approximated area discussed
in subsection (b)(3) hereof.
      (2)    The Floodway Fringe area shall be those areas for which specific
100 year flood elevation have been provided in the FIS but which lie beyond the
Floodway area. These areas are shown on the Floodway Map or FIRM.
      (3)    The Approximated area shall be those areas identified as an A Zone
on the Floodway Map or FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which
no 100 year flood elevations have been provided. For these areas, elevation and
floodway information from other Federal, State or other acceptable source shall
be used when available. Where other acceptable information is not available,
the elevation shall be determined by using the elevation of a point on the
boundary of the identified floodplain area which is nearest the construction
site. The City may require the applicant to determine the elevation with
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering techniques. Hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses shall be undertaken only by professional engineers or others of
demonstrated qualifications, who shall certify that the technical methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. Studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City.
   (c)    Changes in Designation of Area.  The delineation of the identified
flood plain area may be revised by the City where natural or man-made changes
have occurred and/or changes are indicated by studies by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
documents the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA).
   (d)    Boundary Disputes.  Should a dispute concerning any district boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Building Inspector, and
any part aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the Appeals Authority. The
burden of proof shall be on the appellant.  (Passed 5-7-90)

provided that all such uses, activities, and/or development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the floodproofing and related provisions contained
herein and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   (b)    Within any floodway area, no encroachment, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment will not result in any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)    Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a watercourse
within the Floodplain Area, the developer shall notify in writing by certified
mail all adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Office of all such
notification to the Federal Insurance Administrator. The developer shall also
assure the City in writing that the flood carrying capacity within the altered
or relocated portion of the watercourse in question will be maintained.

1795.01 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City has determined that uninspected and unmonitored vacant
buildings:
      (1)   Present a fire hazard;
      (2)   Are often utilized by vagrants and transients (including drug
abusers and traffickers) as dangerous and unsafe temporary shelters;
      (3)   Detract from private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or
maintain surrounding buildings; and
      (4)   Require additional regulation and services to protect the health,
safety and welfare of the public.
   (b)   Owners of vacant buildings shall register such vacant buildings with
the City, make payment of a fee as set forth herein, and otherwise conform to
the requirements of this Vacant Structure Code.
   (c)   It is the intent of this article that, through a registration,
inspection, and monitoring process, and other improved public safety efforts,
vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from trespassers, will
provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in times of emergency,
will not impede private and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain
surrounding properties, and will not otherwise present a public hazard.
   (d)   It is the City’s further intent for the provisions of this article to
streamline and consolidate the existing procedure (that is, complaint,
research, notification, inspection, orders, fines, liens, appeals and lien
enforcement) by placing the responsibility to register and maintain a vacant
structure on the owner of a building before a condition of the building falls
into disrepair or otherwise necessarily warrants a complaint. (Passed 10-11-

bills evidencing utility service for the relevant period.
      (3)   A new building under construction or a building that has been
granted a waiver under Section
1795.07 is not deemed a vacant building.
         (Passed 10-11-16.)

was originally registered.
   Registration shall be required for all vacant buildings, whether vacant and
secure, vacant and open or vacant and boarded, and shall be required whenever
any building has remained vacant for 30 consecutive days or more.  In no

1795.03 is shown at an address within the State, the registration statement

of square footage charged to the owner shall not be less than 1,200 square feet
or greater than 15,000 square feet on any one structure.
   The duration of the vacancy for the purpose of determining the fee runs with
the property and will not be affected by a change in ownership.  A change in
ownership of a vacant structure shall not remove the vacant structure from the
vacant properties registry.  All waivers granted under Section
1795.07 shall expire upon change of ownership.
(Passed 10-11-16.)
1795.05 INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Maintenance Provisions: All vacant structures shall also comply with

glazing or boarding the windows, provided that in the Business District, plain,
unsurfaced plywood may not be used.
      (2)   All vacant structures and premises thereof shall be maintained in a
clean, safe, secure and sanitary condition.  The structure is to be cleared of
all contents, not including building materials or components to be used in the
future renovation at that structure.  All exterior property and premises, and
the interior of every structure, shall be free from any accumulation of rubbish

and compliant with the maintenance requirements listed in this Section.
      (3)   If an internal inspection is deemed necessary, the owner will be
notified of the same and arrangements made for the same.  If the owner fails or
refuses to consent to and arrange for an inspection, the City will seek an

premises for the purpose of determining the structural integrity of the
building, the repairs necessary to insure its structural integrity and that it
will be safe for entry by fire fighters and police officers in time of
emergency, and that the building and its contents do not present a hazard to
the public during the time that the building remains vacant.

corrective action deemed necessary for life, safety and Building Code matters
by City officials, the applicable code provisions or regulations, and will be
afforded a reasonable time to the corrective action.
   If correction action is taken by the owner within a reasonable time, in
addition to imposition of the penalties listed in Section
1795.99, the City may, if deemed necessary for the safety of the public, act to
bring the vacant building or property into compliance or otherwise eliminate
the public nuisance caused by any noncompliant conditions. The costs of any
repairs, demolition, and/or maintenance, along with any related legal and
administrative costs incurred by the City are to be paid by the owner. 
Collection of these costs may be enforced in civil proceedings against the
owner. (Passed 10-11-16.)
