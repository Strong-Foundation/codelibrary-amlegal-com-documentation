      (1)   (a)   Any single-family house sold or rented by an owner; provided,
that such private individual owner does not own more than three such single-
family houses at any one time; provided, however, that in the case of the sale
of any such single-family house by a private individual owner not residing in
such house at the time of such sale or who was not the most recent resident of

in, nor is there owned or reserved on his behalf, under any express or
voluntary agreement, title to or any right to all or a portion of the proceeds
from the sale or rental or, more than three such single-family houses at any
one time; and provided further, that the sale or rental of any such single-
family house shall be excepted from the application of this article only if
such house is sold or rented:
            1.   Without the use in any manner of the sales or rental
facilities or the sales or rental services of any real estate broker, agent, or
salesman, or of such facilities or services of any person in the business of
selling or renting dwellings, or of any employee or agent of any such broker,
agent, salesman, or person; and
            2.   Without the publication, position or mailing, after notice of
any advertisement or written notice in violation of subdivision (7)(c) of
division (A) of this section.

escrow agents, abstractors, title companies, and other such professional

deemed to be in the business of selling or renting dwellings if:
      (1)   He has, within the preceding 12 months, participated as principal
in three or more transactions involving the sale or rental of any dwelling or
any interest therein;
      (2)   He has, within the preceding 12 months, participated as agent,
other than in the sale of his own personal residence, in providing sales or
rental facilities or sale or rental services in two or more transactions
involving the sale or rental of any dwelling or any interest therein; or
      (3)   He is the owner of any dwelling designed or intended for occupancy
by, or occupied by, five or more families.
   (D)   (1)   Nothing in this article limits the applicability of any
reasonable local, state or federal restrictions regarding the maximum number of
occupants permitted to occupy a dwelling. Nor does any provision in this
article regarding familial status apply with respect to housing for older
persons.
      (2)   As used in this section, HOUSING FOR OLDER PERSONS means housing:
         (a)   Provided under any state or federal program that is specifically
designed and operated to assist elderly persons (as defined in the state or
federal program);
         (b)   Intended for, and solely occupied by, persons 62 years of age or
older;
         (c)   Intended and operated for occupancy by at least one person 55
years of age or older per unit. In determining whether housing qualifies as
HOUSING FOR OLDER PERSONS under this subdivision, the Commission shall develop
regulations which require at least the following factors:
            1.   The existence of significant facilities and services
specifically designed to meat the physical or social needs of older persons, or
if the provision of such facilities and services is not practicable, that such
housing is necessary to provide important housing opportunities for older
persons;
            2.   That at least 8% of the units are occupied by at least one
person 55 years of age or older per unit; and
            3.   The publication of and adherence to policies and procedures
which demonstrate an intent by the owner or manager to provide housing for
persons 55 years of age or older.
      (3)   Housing shall not fail to meet the requirements for housing for
older persons by reason of:
         (a)   Persons residing in such housing as of July 1, 1993, who do not
meet the age requirements of subdivisions (b) or (c) of subdivision (2) of this
division; provided, that new occupants of such housing meet the age
requirements of subdivisions (b) or (c) of subdivision (2) of this division; or
         (b)   Unoccupied units; provided, that such units are reserved for
occupancy by persons who meet the age requirements of subdivisions (b) or (c)
of subdivision (2) of this division.

ORDERS.
   (A)   Any person claiming to be aggrieved by an alleged unlawful
discriminatory practice shall make, sign and file with the Commission a
verified complaint, which shall state the name and address of the person,
employer, labor organization, employment agency, owner, real estate broker,
real estate salesman or financial institution alleged to have committed the
unlawful discriminatory practice complained of, and which shall set forth the
particulars thereof and contain such other information as may be required by
the Commissioner's rules and regulations. The Commission, upon its own
initiative, shall, in like manner, make, sign and file such complaint. Any
employer, whose employees, or some of them, hinder or threaten to hinder
compliance with the provisions of this article, shall file with the Commission
a verified complaint, asking for assistance by conciliation or other remedial
action. During such conciliation period no hearings, orders or other actions
shall be held, made or taken by the Commission against such employer. Any
complaint filed pursuant to this article must be filed within 365 days after
the alleged act of discrimination.
   (B)   After the filing of any complaint, or whenever there is reason to
believe that an unlawful discriminatory practice has been committed, the
Commission shall make a prompt investigation in connection therewith. In
connection with such investigation the Commission's legal staff shall have
authority to request the Commission, or the Chair acting in the name of the
Commission, to apply to the Circuit Court of Hancock or Brooke County, West
Virginia to issue subpoenas or subpoenas duces tecum upon the concurrence of at
least five members of the Commission. If it is determined after such
investigation that no probable cause exists for substantiating the allegations
of the complaint, the Commission shall, within 10 days from such determination,
cause to be issued and served upon the complainant written notice of such
determination; and the complainant or his attorney may, within 10 days after
such service, file with the Commission a written request for a meeting with the
Commission to show probable cause for substantiating the allegations of the
complaint. If it is determined after such investigation or meeting that
probable cause exists for substantiating the allegations of the complaint, the
Commission shall immediately endeavor to eliminate the unlawful discriminatory
practices complained of by conference, conciliation and persuasion. The members
of the Commission and its staff shall not disclose what has transpired in the
course of such endeavors. Provided, that the Commission may publish or release
the terms of settlement or conciliation when the complaint has been conciliated
or settled.
   (C)   In case of failure so to eliminate such practice or in advance
thereof, if in the judgment of the Commission circumstances so warrant, the
Commission shall cause to be issued and served a written notice, together with
a copy of such complaint as the same may have been amended in the manner
provided by law for the service of summons in civil actions, requiring the
person, employer, labor organization, employment agency, owner, real estate
broker, real estate salesman or financial institution named in such complaint,
hereinafter referred to as respondent, to answer the charges of such complaint
at a public or private hearing before the Commission in the county where the
respondent resides or transacts business at a time and place so specified in
such notice; provided, however, that such written notice shall be served at
least 30 days prior to the time set for the hearing. The Commission or its
Chair shall delegate the power and authority to conduct the hearing to a
hearing examiner(s) who may be an individual Commissioner, a panel of
Commissioners, a hearing examiner who shall be an attorney duly licensed to
practice law in West Virginia, a panel of hearing examiners, or a panel
composed of any combination of Commissioners and hearing examiners. The case in
support of the complaint shall be presented before the Commission by one of its
attorneys or agents, but no one presenting the case in support of the complaint
shall counsel or advise the Commission, Commissioner or hearing examiner who
hears the case. The respondent may file a written, verified answer to the
complaint and appear at such hearing in person or otherwise, with or without
counsel, and submit testimony and evidence. Except as provided in this article,
all of the pertinent provisions of W. V. Code Article 29A-5 shall apply to and
govern the hearing and administrative procedures in connection with and
following such hearing, with like effect as if the provisions of such W. V.
Code Article 29A-5 were set forth in full in this section.
   (D)   If, after such hearing and consideration of all of the testimony,
evidence and record in the case, the Commission finds that a respondent has
engaged in or is engaging in any unlawful discriminatory practice as defined in
this article, the Commission shall issue and cause to be served on such
respondent an order to cease and desist from such unlawful discriminatory
practice and to take such affirmative action, including but not limited to,
hiring, reinstatement or upgrading of employees, with or without back pay,
admission or restoration to membership in any respondent labor organization, or
the admission to full and equal enjoyment of the services, goods, facilities,
or accommodations offered by any respondent place of public accommodation, and
the sales, purchase, lease, rental or financial assistance to any complainant
otherwise qualified for the housing accommodation or real property denied in
violation of this article, as in the judgment of the Commission, will
effectuate the purposes of this article, and including a requirement for report
of the manner of compliance, payment of expenses and lost wages of any witness
called by the complainant or Commission, payment to the complainant of
reasonable attorney fees, expert witness fees, and legal costs, and payment to
the Commission of its costs in conducting the hearing; and other legal or
equitable relief as the Commission deems appropriate. Such order shall be
accompanied by findings of fact and conclusions of law as specified in W. V.

Such proceeding shall be initiated by the filing of a petition in such court,

selection on the "outstanding accomplishment" aspect of the nominees. Clearly,
there will be years when only one or two nominees are made in a category and
this should not necessarily mean they are automatically selected to the Hall.

operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcoholic beverages and/
or a controlled substance there is a greater likelihood of personal injury and
property damage. As a result of these determinations, a greater operational
and/or financial burden is placed upon the city police, fire fighting and
rescue services by persons who are operating a motor vehicle while under the
influence of alcoholic beverages and/or a controlled substance.

ARTICLE 195: MUNICIPAL SERVICE FEES
§ 195.01 TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the Weirton Municipal
Service Fee Ordinance of 2004.
(Ord. 1417, passed 3-8-04)
§ 195.02 POLICY.
   (A)   The City Council finds that the city provides to all individuals
within its borders certain services, whether they are residents employed within
the city, or individuals living outside the city and employed within the
corporate boundaries of the city.
   (B)   The City Council finds that such services include public works, street
department functions, street maintenance, capital projects and public health
and safety.
   (C)   The City Council finds that such services are within the authority and
are the responsibility of the municipal government of the city as provided
under the general laws of the State of West Virginia.
   (D)   The City Council finds that since such services are essential to the
creation and maintenance of those jobs which provide livelihood to all
individuals employed within the city, as well as to the property interests of
residents and visitors to the city, it is therefore reasonable to derive a
portion of the cost of providing and maintaining such services from said
individuals.
   (E)   The City Council finds that W. V. Code § 8-13-13 provides that every
municipality has the plenary power and authority to provide by ordinance for
the installation, continuance, maintenance or improvement of such services, to
make reasonable regulations with respect thereto, and to impose by ordinance
upon the users of such services reasonable rates, fees and charges to be
collected in the manner prescribed by ordinance.
   (F)   The City Council finds that all of those individuals who use, enjoy
and benefit from these services should bear an equitable share of the costs
thereof. Council acknowledges that the Supreme Court of Appeals of West
Virginia has recognized that no system of assessing the costs will be
absolutely perfect and that municipalities are only required to install a
reasonable system of distributing the costs of all of the users that it can
reach through reasonable and prudent means and legislation.
   (G)   The City Council finds that the imposition of the Weirton Municipal
Service Fee established herein is a reasonable system for distributing the
costs to all users that the city can reach through reasonable and prudent means
and legislation.
(Ord. 1417, passed 3-8-04)

§ 195.04 DECLARATION AS TO CONDUCT EVIDENCING THE USE OF A MUNICIPAL SERVICE.
   Council finds that holding employment with an employer with a place of
business located within the city for at least 30 days during a calendar year is
legal and valid proof of the use of one or more municipal services sufficient
to assess and collect a city service fee from the person engaging in the
activity stated. However, a transient employee whose principal office is out of
the city and either pays an employee user's fee or makes remuneration to
another municipality for services based upon employment shall be exempt. For
the purposes of this article, EMPLOYER shall include all for-profit and not-
for-profit entities and all local, county, state and federal governmental
entities.

   (D)   Alternative procedure for declaring a dog dangerous or vicious.
      (1)   An Animal Control Officer or any adult person may request under
oath that a dog be classified as dangerous or vicious as defined by submitting
a sworn, written complaint. Upon receipt of such complaint, the City Manager,
or his/her designee, shall notify the owner of the dog that a complaint has
been filed and that an investigation into the allegations as set forth in the
complaint will be conducted.
      (2)   Criteria to be considered during the above investigation shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:
         (a)   Provocation;
         (b)   Severity of attack or injury to a person or domestic animal;
         (c)   Previous aggressive behavior of the dog;
         (d)   Site and circumstances of the incident; and
         (e)   Statements from interested parties.
      (3)   At the conclusion of an investigation, the City Manager may:
         (a)   Determine that the dog is not dangerous or vicious and, if the
dog is impounded, may waive any impoundment fees incurred and order the release
of the dog to its owner; or
         (b)   Determine that the dog is dangerous or vicious and order the
owner to comply with the requirements for keeping dangerous or vicious dogs set
forth in division (G) and, if the dog is impounded, release the dog to its
owner after the owner has paid all fees incurred for the impoundment.
   (E)   Notification of dangerous or vicious dog declaration.
      (1)   Within five business day after declaring a dog dangerous or
vicious, the City Manager or his/her designee shall notify the owner by
certified mail of the dog's designation as a dangerous or vicious dog and any
specific restrictions and conditions for keeping the dog, as set forth in
division (G). The City Manager also shall notify the Police Department and the
city's Animal Control Officer of the designation of any dog as a dangerous or
vicious dog. Such notification shall describe the dog and specify any
particular requirements or conditions placed upon the dog owner.
      (2)   If the City Manager or his/her designee cannot, with due diligence,
locate the owner of a dog that has been seized pursuant to this article, the
City Manager shall cause the dog to be impounded for not less than five
business days. If after five days, the owner fails to claim the dog, the City
Manager may cause the dog to be humanely destroyed by offering satisfactory
proof before a circuit or magistrate court that such dog is vicious, dangerous,
or in the habit of biting or attacking other persons or other dogs or animals,
thereafter, the judge may authorize the Humane Officer to cause such dog to be
killed.
   (F)   Appeal from dangerous or vicious dog declaration. If the City Manager
or a designee determines a dog is dangerous or vicious at the conclusion of the
investigation conducted under division (D) above, that determination shall be
final unless the dog owner applies to a court of competent jurisdiction for any
remedies that may be available within 30 days after receiving notice that the
dog has been finally declared dangerous. The appeal shall be a proceeding in
the circuit or magistrate court for the purpose of affirming or reversing the
City Manager's determination of dangerousness.
   (G)   Keeping of dangerous and vicious dogs. No owner, keeper, or harborer
of a dangerous or vicious dog shall fail to comply with the following
requirements:
      (1)   Leash. No person having charge, custody, control or possession of a
dangerous or vicious dog shall allow the dog to exit its kennel, pen or other
proper enclosure unless such dog is securely attached to a leash no more than
six feet in length. No such person shall permit a dangerous dog to be kept on a
chain, rope or other type of leash outside its kennel or pen unless a person
capable of controlling the dog is in physical control of the leash. The leash
or tether must be controlled by a person who is of suitable age and discretion,
or has securely attached, tied or affixed the leash or tether to the ground or
a stationary object or fixture so that the dog is adequately restrained and
station such a person in close enough proximity to that dog so as to prevent it
from causing injury to any person.
      (2)   Muzzle. It shall be unlawful for any owner or keeper of a dangerous
or vicious dog to allow the dog to be outside of its proper enclosure, unless
the dog wears a properly fitted muzzle to prevent it from biting humans or
other animals. Such muzzle shall not interfere with the dog's breathing or
vision. A muzzle is mandatory; however, it is unlawful for any person to own,
keep or harbor any dog known by him to be vicious and/or dangerous or in the
habit of biting or attacking other persons, whether or not such dog wears a
muzzle or a tag.
      (3)   Confinement. Except when leashed and muzzled as provided in this
section, a dangerous or vicious dog shall be securely confined indoors or
confined in a locked pen or other secure enclosure that is suitable to prevent
the entry of children and is designed to prevent the dog from escaping. The
enclosure shall include shelter and protection from the elements and shall
provide adequate exercise room, light and ventilation. The enclosed structure
shall be kept in a clean and sanitary condition and shall meet the following
requirements:
         (a)   The structure must have secure sides and a secure top, or all
sides must be at least six feet high;
         (b)   The structure must have a bottom permanently attached to the
sides or the sides must be imbedded not less than one foot into the ground; and
         (c)   The structure must be of such material and closed in such a
manner that the dog cannot exit the enclosure on its own.
      (4)   Indoor confinement. No dangerous or vicious dog shall be kept on a
porch, patio, or in any part of a house or structure that would allow the dog
to exit such building on its own volition. In addition, no such dog shall be
kept in a house or structure when the windows or screen doors are the only
obstacle preventing the dog from exiting the structure.
      (5)   Signs. All owners, keepers, or harborers of dangerous or vicious
dogs shall display in prominent places on their premises signs easily readable
by the public using the words "Beware of Dog." They are to be placed primarily
at points of egress and ingress.
      (6)   Liability insurance; surety bond. The owner of a dangerous and/or
vicious dog shall present to the City Manager proof that he or she has procured
liability insurance with an insurer authorized to write liability insurance in
this state providing coverage in each occurrence, subject to a limit, exclusive
of interest and costs, of not less than $100,000 because of damage or bodily
injury to or death of a person caused by the vicious dog, covering as well any
damage or injury whatsoever that may be caused by the dangerous or vicious dog.
The policy shall contain a provision requiring that the city be notified
immediately by the agent issuing the policy in the event that the insurance
policy is canceled, terminated or expires. The liability insurance or surety
bond shall be obtained prior to the issuing of a permit to keep a dangerous or
vicious dog and a copy of the certificate must be given to the license office
and kept on file. The dog owner shall sign a statement attesting that he or she
shall maintain and not voluntarily cancel the liability insurance policy during
the 12 month period for which a permit is sought, unless he ceases to own or
keep the dog prior to the expiration date of the permit period. The owner shall
provide the City Manager with notice of any cancellation on the liability
insurance policy. In the event that the owner proves to the satisfaction of the
City Manager that insurance is not available at any cost, the owner may post
with the City Manager a surety bond, of an equivalent amount, payable to any
person injured by the dangerous or vicious dog. The decision as to whether a
surety bond will be accepted is within the sole discretion of the City Manager.
      (7)   Mandatory spaying or neutering. Within 30 days of the City
Manager's determination that a particular dog is dangerous or vicious, the
owner of said dog shall have it spayed or neutered and provide the City Manager
with a written statement from the veterinarian who performed the operation
verifying the same.
      (8)   Notification of escape. The owner or keeper of a dangerous or
vicious dog shall notify the County Animal Control Officer, the City of Weirton
Police Department and the City Manager immediately if such dog escapes from its
enclosure or restraint and is at large. Such immediate notification shall also
be required if the dog bites or attacks a person or domestic animal.
      (9)   Failure to comply. It shall be unlawful and a misdemeanor for any
owner of a dangerous or vicious dog registered with the City Manager to fail to
comply with the requirements and conditions set forth in this section. An owner
or keeper of a dangerous or vicious dog who fails to register the dog shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and fined $500. Each day that the dangerous or vicious
dog is not registered shall be a separate offense. The fine for any other
violation of this section, for which a specific fine amount has not been set
forth, shall be $250, with each day that the offense continues being a separate
citable offense. Any dog found to be in violation of this division (G) shall be
subject to immediate seizure and impoundment. In addition, failure to comply
with the requirements and conditions set forth in this division (G) may result
in the City Manager revoking the permit providing for the keeping of such
animal. Other ordinances pertaining to penalties for injuries inflicted by dogs
shall be in addition to the penalties set forth herein.
      (10)   All owners of dangerous or vicious dogs at the date of adoption of
this section shall be given 60 days after such adoption to comply with the
regulations contained within this section.
      (11)   Request for exemption. Any owner, keeper or harborer of a
dangerous or vicious dog may make application to the City Manager to receive
exemption from certain provisions of this section if the canine has actual
certification for such purposes as therapeutic use, if an owner is a certified
breeder, and the like. The decision to grant an exemption is at the sole
discretion of the City Manager and exemption from one area of this section does
not exempt such person from complying with all other provisions of this
section, such as insurance, leashing, and the like or all other sections of
this article.
      (12)   Non-residents. Any owner, keeper or harborer of a dangerous or
vicious dog who does not reside within the city limits must still, when brought
into the city, obey the above requirements as applicable; however, such non-
residents are exempt from division (G)(6) and (7) above.
   (H)   Permit and tag required for a dangerous or vicious dog.
      (1)   The owner of a dangerous or vicious dog shall, within three
business days after classification of the dog as dangerous or vicious or upon
acquisition of such a dog, obtain an annual permit from the City of Weirton
Animal Control Officer to harbor the dog. Owners at the effective date of this
section shall, within 60 days of such effective date, comply with the
registration of such dogs as identified in this section.
      (2)   If such permit is issued, a tag shall be issued to the owner of the
dangerous or vicious dog. The tag shall be worn at all times by the dog to
identify it clearly and easily as a dangerous or vicious dog. Annual renewal
and tags are required. The owner or keeper of a dangerous or vicious dog who
registers but fails to place the foregoing red tag on said dog shall be guilty
of a misdemeanor and fined $500. Each day shall be a separate citable offense.
Tags shall be available through the Weirton Police Department at a cost of $5
annually.
      (3)   The permit for maintaining a dangerous or vicious dog shall be
presented to an Animal Control Officer or police officer upon demand.
   (I)   Notification of intent to impound/hearing.
      (1)   In the event that the County Animal Control Officer, the City
Manager, the City Animal Control Officer, or law enforcement agent has probable
cause to believe that a vicious or dangerous dog is being harbored or cared for
in violation of this chapter, the Animal Control Officer or his designee may
petition a municipal court or a court of competent jurisdiction to order the
seizure and impoundment of the vicious or dangerous dog pending trial.
      (2)   When the City Manager or his or her designee, the Hancock County
Animal Control Officer, the City Animal Control Officer, or law enforcement
agent intends to impound a dog declared to be dangerous or vicious for
violation of division (G) above, he or she shall notify the owner or custodian
of the dog, by certified mail, of the intended impoundment at least five
business days prior to the intended impoundment, except as provided in division
(J).
      (3)   The notice of intent to impound shall inform the owner or custodian

pursuant to division (3) above, a hearing shall be held within ten business
days after the request for a hearing. Notice of the date, time and location of
the hearing shall be provided by certified and regular mail to the dog's owner
or custodian requesting such hearing.

(3) above, no impoundment shall take place until conclusion of the hearing,
except as authorized in division (J).
      (6)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the authority
of the Animal Control Officer or his or her designee from otherwise seizing any
animal maintained in violation of this code which presents an immediate risk of
physical harm to any person or property.
      (7)   The owner shall pay all expenses including shelter, food,
veterinary expenses for identification or certification of the breed of the
animal or boarding of and veterinary expenses necessitated by the seizure of
any dog for the protection of the public, and such other expenses as may be
required for the elimination of any such dog during any legal proceeding or any

continues shall be considered a separate violation.
   (J)   Immediate impoundment.
      (1)   A dog previously declared to be dangerous or vicious may be
immediately impounded without a pre-impoundment hearing when the City Manager
or his designee determines such immediate impoundment is necessary for the
protection of public health or safety. Such immediate impoundment may be
ordered for violation of division (G) or when the dog bites a person or
domestic animal.
      (2)   In the event that the City Manager or his or her designee, the
Hancock County Animal Control Officer, City Animal Control Officer, or law
enforcement agent has probable cause to believe that a vicious or dangerous dog
is running at large, then the Animal Control Officer or his or her designee may
seize and impound the dog without seeking prior court order.

division (1) above shall be notified of the impoundment by certified and

provided in this chapter, if a magistrate or circuit court determines that an
animal is vicious, that on one or more occasions such animal has bitten or
attacked a person without provocation or that the owner of the animal has
habitually permitted such animal to run at large or violate provisions of this

in order to protect the health, welfare, safety and property of the residents
of the city, order that such animal be removed from the city or be humanely

this section results in the order to humanely destroy a dangerous or vicious
dog, that decision shall be final unless the dog owner applies to a court of

the peaceful enjoyment of their premises or cause damage to their premises and
which generates a written notice of violation and/or written citation because
of said activity.
      (2)   When the City Manager determines that the person or entity has been
involved in disruptive activity resulting in the mobilization and/or
investigation by city officials that result in an official written notice of
violation and/or a written citation on three or more separate occasions within
any 60 day period, the City Manager may declare the activity to be a disruptive
activity and proceed with notice and enforcement procedures set forth in this
section.
      (3)   After an activity has been declared a disruptive activity, if law
enforcement and other governmental personnel are not called upon to respond to
any disruptive activities for a period of 12 consecutive months, then the
activity will no longer be classified as a disruptive activity.
   (C)   Notice.
      (1)   The City Manager shall provide written notice to the person or
entity for which a disruptive activity has been reported.
      (2)   The notice identified in division (C)(1) of this section shall be
deemed to be properly delivered if sent either by first-class mail to the
person or entity's last known address or as may be found in public records, or
if delivered in person to the person or to any officer of the entity. If the
person or entity cannot be located, the notice shall be deemed to be properly

activity, or, if the activity has not yet been declared a disruptive activity,
a statement of the number of subsequent occurrences of disruptive activity
which result in such declaration;
         (d)   If the activity has been declared a disruptive activity, a
statement that the occurrence of a fourth or subsequent disruptive activity by
the person or entity within six months following the date of notice, may result
in the person or entity being charged with the additional costs of the
administrative and law enforcement actions taken by the city in response to the
disruptive activity;
         (e)   Notice of person or entity's rights to appeal pursuant to this
section; and
         (f)   A statement that the person or entity shall within ten days of

Board pursuant to this section. The Board shall conduct a hearing and render a
decision in accordance with city ordinances and regulations governing its
conduct and procedure.
   (E)   Other legal actions not affected. The declaration of a disruptive
activity or the charging or assessment of costs by the city on a person or

law enforcement's right or authority to bring criminal prosecution or other
legal action against any person or entity for violation of city, state or
federal law.

ARTICLE 511: PUBLIC NUISANCES
§ 511.01 PURPOSE; PUBLIC NUISANCE ABATEMENT.
   Council may, by resolution, abate anything which, in the opinion of a
majority of Council, constitutes a public nuisance after due notice to all
parties that could be affected and after such hearings as Council deems
necessary to ascertain a factual and rational basis for the abatement of any
such public nuisance.
(Ord. 1481, passed 4-10-06)
§ 511.02 APPLICATION.
   The provisions of this article shall apply to all nuisances as hereinafter
designated which are now in existence or which may hereafter exist in the city.
(Ord. 1481, passed 4-10-06)
§ 511.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this article, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   CONTINUING NUISANCE. An uninterrupted or periodically recurring nuisance;
not necessarily a constant unceasing injury, but a nuisance which occurs so
often incident to the use of property complained of that it can fairly be said
to be continuing. Such a nuisance may be of such character that its continuance
is necessarily an injury which will continue without change.
   PERMANENT NUISANCE. A permanent nuisance is a nuisance of such a character
that its continuance is likely an injury which will continue without change,
unless Council takes such action to cease any like nuisance from becoming
established and reoccurring at the particular location. It is not enough to
show a slight interference to the public welfare and such will not be
restrained unless the type of business or manner of operation is injurious to
the public health, safety and welfare of the community or has tendency to
promote unlawful behavior or behavior which is found by the City
Administration, including its police, fire, code, health and/or safety
officials, to be a menace to public order and safety.
   PUBLIC NUISANCE. One which affects an indefinite number of persons, or the
residents of a particular locality, or people coming within the extent of its
range or operation, although the extent of the annoyance or damage inflicted
upon individuals may be unequal. Such public nuisance endangers the health,
safety and welfare of the community and/or is dangerous and detrimental to the
public health, may violate the laws of the city and/or state or obstructs the
community or its citizens or any person who comes within the extent of its
range or operations from reasonable and comfortable use of property, whether
public or private. A nuisance may arise from the unreasonable, unwarrantable or
unlawful behavior associated with the property, either real or personal, which
hinders the neighboring community and the general public from enjoying the
common and public rights enjoyed by the general community in like areas where
no such nuisance exists.
(Ord. 1481, passed 4-10-06)
§ 511.04 REPORT, RECOMMENDATIONS TO COUNCIL AND HEARING.
   (A)   Public safety and law enforcement officers, as well as affected
members of the community, shall report findings and recommendations to the City
Manager; and if the City Manager ascertains from the report and findings that
the condition presents a public nuisance, as herein defined, the Manager shall
make his recommendation to Council, a hearing shall be held after at least ten
days’ notice to which notice shall contain a statement or specification of the
charges, grounds or reasons for such proposed contemplated action, and which
shall be served upon the property owner, tenant, business manager and/or
licensee as notices under the West Virginia rules of civil procedure or by
certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall, in addition, be posted in
a conspicuous place on the premises as well as within 100 feet surrounding such
premises affected by the recommendation. The term CAUSE shall include the doing
or omitting of any act or permitting any condition to exist which causes a
public or continuing nuisance as defined in this article. At which time and
place, so designated in the notice, the city administration shall put forth its
evidence in support of the licensee shall have the right to appear and produce
evidence in his behalf, and to be represented by counsel. Provided that the
Council may forthwith suspend any such license when they believe the public
safety will be adversely affected by the continued operation of such nuisance.
   (B)   If, at the request of the property owner, tenant, business manager
and/or licensee or on his motion, the hearing shall be continued and shall not
take place on the day fixed by the Council, the property owner, tenant,
business manager and/or licensee shall not be permitted to continue doing
business pending an appeal as provided by this article.
(Ord. 1481, passed 4-10-06)
§ 511.05 DECLARATION OF PERMANENT NUISANCE.
   If, upon review of information presented to Council, it can be shown that
acts, occupations, types of businesses or structures which are generally not
considered nuisances at all times and under any circumstances are found to have
become nuisances by reason of the circumstances or the location and
surroundings, the Council may declare by majority vote of Council such to be a
nuisance-in-fact. Upon a showing that there has been a continuing nuisance of
similar character and circumstances at a particular location and surrounding
area existing in an uninterrupted or periodically reoccurring fashion, Council
may declare such a permanent nuisance and therefore permanently revoke and
withhold further licensure or approval of similar acts, occupations, types of
businesses or structures at such location. Council may consider primarily
reports of safety and law enforcement officials, as well as public comment and
complaints of the community spanning a period during which behavior has
occurred which is fairly representative of the complaints made against a
specified location or its operators, when considering declaring a particular
permanent nuisance. The Municipality is entitled to seek appropriate judicial
relief against such public nuisances which are believed to be permanent in
nature and judicial proceedings and adjudication by a court of competent
jurisdiction may be sought.
(Ord. 1481, passed 4-10-06)
§ 511.06 ABATEMENT BY MUNICIPALITY.
   After any hearings as defined herein and upon the declaration of the
municipality that a public nuisance exists, an order to abate such nuisance
shall issue, including demolition of the nuisance property, if necessary and
cost effective.The order shall prohibit further use which constitutes a
nuisance.
(Ord. 1481, passed 4-10-06; Am. Ord. 2220, passed 1-8-24)
§ 511.07 RECONSIDERATION OF PERMANENT NUISANCE.
   Should such a location be declared a permanent public nuisance, any further
use of that location for the same purpose is not allowed unless the nuisance
can be proven to have been abated. If the property shall not have begun again
to be used for its former use, without nuisance, within one year of the
declaration of nuisance, it shall lose its nonconforming use status and shall
revert to the land use permitted in accord with the city’s Unified Development
Ordinance. However, reconsideration of a declaration of a permanent nuisance
may occur if such request is filed within 30 days of such order declaring a
permanent nuisance. Another business or nonconforming use may petition City
Council for a hearing to demonstrate that a legitimate business interest or
other nonconforming use is proposed for such location. If such petition is
granted, a bond may be required in an amount not less than $25,000, to extend
for a minimum of one year from the date of occupation of the premises. Such
one-year period shall be considered probationary in that any recurrence of
similar activity which lead to the prior declaration of a nuisance or would
lead to a new nuisance violation shall cause for immediate forfeiture of said
bond to the city and closure of such establishment upon notice by the City
Manager as directed by City Council.
(Ord. 1481, passed 4-10-06)
§ 511.08 APPEALS AND ENFORCEMENT.
   In the event that such property owner, tenant, business manager and/or
licensee may be aggrieved by such declared abatement which may include and not
be limited to revocation or suspension of any licensures and/or the restricted
use of such property having been declared a nuisance, petition for such review
must be filed with the circuit court within a period of 30 days from and after
the date of final action by Council. Any property owner, tenant, business
manager and/or licensee obtaining an order for such review shall be required to
pay the costs and fees incident to transcribing, certifying and transmitting
the records pertaining to such matter to the circuit court. Any person, firm,
corporation, landowner, or licensee so affected has the right to apply to the
circuit court for a temporary injunction pursuant to the provisions of state
law. The municipality is also entitled to any and all appropriate judicial
relief against public nuisances.
(Ord. 1481, passed 4-10-06)
§ 511.99 PENALTY.
   Any person or other entity continuing to carry on activity which has been
ordered to be abated by City Council under §
511.06 shall be fined not more than $500 and/or confined to jail for not more
than 30 days for each offense thereof.

duration shall be the "all clear" signal. Each person in the permit area, and
each person who resides or regularly works within one-half mile of the permit
area shall be notified of the meaning of these signals;
      (2)   All approaches to the blast area shall be guarded against
unauthorized entry prior to and immediately after blasting; and shall remain
guarded until the blaster signals the all clear." The certified blaster shall
be accompanied by at least one other person at the time of firing of the blast.
      (3)   Access to the blast area shall be controlled against the entrance
of livestock or unauthorized
personnel during blasting and for a period thereafter until an authorized
person has reasonably determined:

         (b)   That access to and travel in or through the area can be safely
resumed.
   (C)   Blast design.
      (1)   An anticipated blast design shall be submitted if blasting
operations will be conducted within:
         (a)   1,000 feet of any building used as a dwelling, public building,
school, church, or community or institutional building outside the permit area;
or
         (b)   500 feet of an active or abandoned underground mine.
      (2)   The blast design may be presented as part of a permit application
or at a time before the blast as approved by the Fire Chief or neutral
consultant, as necessary.
      (3)   The blast design shall indicate the type and amount of explosives
to be used, critical dimensions, and the location and general description of
structures, including protected structures, to be protected, as well as a

with another person, knowingly:

reasonable ground to believe that a person has committed shoplifting, may
detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed 30 minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not such

authorized by this section. However, a merchant who has recovered the penalty
prescribed by division (E) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not

damages or penalty prior to the commencement of any legal action.

imposed by this section, in all cases of conviction for the offense of

substances to be placed, deposited, dumped, or thrown in such location that
high water or normal drainage conditions will cause any such materials or
substances to wash into any river, stream, creek, branch, brook, lake, or pond,
it is prima facie evidence that the owner, renter, or lessee intended to
violate the provisions of this division (C), provided that if a landowner,
renter, or lessee, private or otherwise, reports any such placing, depositing,
dumping, or throwing of any such substances or materials upon his or her
property to the City Attorney, Mayor, or City Council, then the landowner,

or road pursuant to the number assignment formula contained herein.
   CITY-STYLE ADDRESS. A unique address for a structure using a building number
and street name. CITY-STYLE ADDRESSES are based on an address system, which
means that they usually appear in a consistent numeric sequence along a street
and reflect parity conventions (that is, odd numbers all appear on one side of
the street and even numbers on the other). If number assignment is based on a
standard number interval, then the CITY-STYLE ADDRESS will also logically
provide a distance location from the beginning point of the road.
   DISPLAY. The manner the numbers are affixed to a structure or otherwise
displayed when affixed to a structure.
   EMERGENCY SERVICE PURPOSES. Use for 9-1-1 or Enhanced 9-1-1 dispatch and

including, but not limited to, by ways of example, a number out of sequence,
odd or even numbers on the wrong side of the street, rural box numbers in a 9-
1-1 address area, numbers improperly affixed, numbers illegible, numbers
unclear, numbers obstructed, numbers not visible, numbers not present, numbers
of improper size, numbers not in contrast with immediate background,
weatherworn numbers, wrong numbers and non-approved numbers.
   NUMBER ASSIGNMENT FORMULA. Beginning from the point of origin a house number
shall be assigned for each interval, with each interval on the right side of
the roadway as one leaves the point of origin being assigned an even number,
and each interval on the left side as one leaves the point of origin being
assigned an odd number. Left and right shall be determined from the prospective
of a traveler moving away from the road point of origin in forward motion.
   OCCUPANT. Any person, firm, entity, partnership, trust, corporation,
association or other organization that is occupying or leasing a building or
other property for a period exceeding 30 days.
   OWNER. Any and all persons, firms, entities, partnerships, trusts,
corporation, associations, or other organizations that own the fee title to, or
have undivided interest in, any building or property, which is subject to the
provisions of this subchapter.
   POINT OF ORIGIN. The end point of a road, which is the starting point for a
numbering sequence.
   PRIMARY STRUCTURE. Means, but is not limited to, residential building,
mobile home, commercial building, industrial building, office building, public
building, utility, communications tower.
   ROAD or STREET. Any public or private thoroughfare, used for vehicular
traffic and/or any easement or right-of-way that provides sole access to three
primary structures. This term shall be defined as the STREET SUFFIX and shall
include, but is not limited to: avenue, drive, way, boulevard, highway, lane,
pike, manor or similar street type.
   WEST VIRGINIA STATEWIDE ADDRESSING AND MAPPING PROJECT. The project for the

of city-style addressing and mapping systems essential to the prompt and
accurate dispatch of emergency service providers. The terms STATEWIDE
ADDRESSING AND MAPPING SYSTEM and THE SYSTEM: also include any local

(Ord. 1670, passed 2-8-10)
§ 912.03 STRUCTURE AND LOCATION NUMBERING AND DISPLAY.
   (A)   Wherever any house, building or structure is erected or located after
initial establishment of the uniform numbering system as provided herein, the
owner shall file an application for an address assignment with the city or such
duly authorized agent. It also shall be the duty of the property owners to
procure the correct number or numbers for the property and affix these numbers
to the building in accordance with this subchapter. The owner shall place or
cause to be placed upon each house or building controlled by him or her the
number or numbers assigned under the uniform number system within 30 days of

ARTICLE 941: SEWER REGULATIONS
§ 941.01 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Description of system. The wastewater system of the city consists of
trunk, interceptors and collection sewers laid in streets, alleys, rights-of-
way and easements, and a wastewater treatment plant, the location of which is
shown upon plans and drawings filed in the Office of the Sanitary Board, and
all other appurtenances which are used in whole or in part in connection with
the collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater; and all other extensions,
additions and improvements which may be made to such system. Its purpose is to
provide for the collection and treatment of domestic wastewater and such
industrial wastewaters as are permitted by this article, in order to protect
the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city.
   (B)   Purpose and policy.
      (1)   This article sets forth uniform requirements for direct and
indirect contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system of
the city, and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal
laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment
Regulations (40 CFR 403).
      (2)   The objectives of this article are:
         (a)   To require use of public sanitary sewers where available, and as
per the conditions specified herein;
         (b)   To establish guidelines for the construction and operation of
private “on-site” disposal systems;
         (c)   To establish requirements for the design and construction of
private sanitary sewers and building sewers;
         (d)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
         (e)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately treated,
into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible with the
system;
         (f)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewaters
and sludges from the system.
      (3)   This article provides for the regulation of direct and indirect
contributions to the municipal wastewater system through the issuance of
permits to certain nondomestic users and through enforcement of general
requirements for the other users, authorizes monitoring and enforcement
activities, requires user reporting, assumes that existing customer's capacity
will not be preempted, and provides for the setting of fees for the equitable
distribution of costs resulting from the program established herein.
      (4)   This article shall apply to the city and to persons outside the
city within the facilities planning area or service area who are, by contract
or agreement with the city, users of the Weirton POTW. Except as otherwise
provided herein, the Sanitary Board, acting through its Superintendent, shall
administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article.

§ 941.05 BUILDING SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Control of sewer system. The sewer system of the city or in any area
under the jurisdiction of the city, shall be under the charge and control of
the Sanitary Board under whose supervision the sewer system shall be used by
property owners. No unauthorized person shall uncover, make any connections
with or opening into, use, alter or disturb any public sewer or appurtenance
thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the Board.
   (B)   Classes of permits.
      (1)   There shall be one class of building sewer permit for all users.
The owner or his agent shall make application on a special form furnished by
the Sanitary Board. The permit application shall be supplemented by any plans,
specifications or other information considered pertinent in the judgment of the
Superintendent.
      (2)   In addition to the building sewer permit, all significant
industrial users, as defined in §
941.02, shall obtain a wastewater discharge permit as specified in §
941.08(B).
   (C)   Permit limitations. Permits granted under this article shall be for a
specific wastewater, and such permits shall be granted only after approval of
plans as set forth herein. Subsequent wastewaters of different quantity,
quality or characteristics shall be covered by separate permits.
   (D)   Permit refusal. The Sanitary Board may refuse to issue a permit for a
new connection to the sanitary sewer system unless there is available capacity
in all downstream facilities, including treatment plant capacity for BOD and
suspended solids removal. Capacity shall be determined on the basis of design
criteria previously approved or established by the West Virginia Department of
Health.
   (E)   Cost of building sewer. All costs and expenses incidental to the
installation and connection of the building sewer to the public sewer or to an
available service connection shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall
indemnify the Sanitary Board from any loss or damage that may directly or
indirectly be occasioned by the installation of the building sewer.
   (F)   Building sewer limitations. Every building which is the source of the
heretofore described acceptable wastewater shall be provided with a separate
and independent building sewer. Where one building stands at the rear of
another on an interior lot and no private sewer is available or can be
constructed to the rear building through an adjoining alley, court, yard or
driveway, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the
rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer. In the case of
industry, several buildings may be served by one building sewer, provided the
sewer is adequately sized, and provided it is approved by the Sanitary Board.
   (G)   Old building sewers. Old building sewers may be used in connection
with new buildings only when they are found, on examination and test by the
Superintendent or his representative, to meet all requirements of this article.
   (H)   Combined sewers. The construction of or extension to combined sewers
is hereby prohibited, unless approved by the West Virginia Department of
Health.
   (I)   Private sanitary sewers. Private, as opposed to public, sanitary
sewers shall continue to be owned by the private owners now owning same until
such time as the owner and the Sanitary Board mutually agree to a transfer of
ownership to the city. Such sewers shall be controlled by the Sanitary Board,
but shall be operated and maintained by their owners, unless the Sanitary Board
agrees in writing to provide this service, in which case a proper easement
shall be dedicated to the city. The design and construction of private sanitary
sewers shall conform to the same requirements as specified by the State
Department of Health for public sanitary sewers.
   (J)   Design and construction of building sewers.
      (1)   The minimum size and slope, alignment and materials of construction
of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of the
pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to the
requirements of the building and plumbing codes or other applicable rules and
regulations of the Sanitary Board or its designated representative, and
approved by the Superintendent. In the absence of code provisions or in
amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in appropriate
specifications of the American Society of Testing Materials and the Water
Pollution Control Federation Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply.
      (2)   Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. In all buildings in which
any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer,
wastewater carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means
and discharged to the building sewer.
   (K)   Licensing of persons or firms who install and maintain building sewers
and connections. All parties engaged in the installation and/or maintenance of
building sewers and connections shall be licensed, and shall pay an annual
licensing fee to the Sanitary Board. The Board shall adopt rules and
regulations for performing such work, and shall establish a set of guidelines
for handling customer-related service problems.
   (L)   Illegal connections. No person shall make connections of roof
downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, driveway drains or
other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building
drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary
sewer.
   (M) Building sewer connections. The connection of the building sewer into
the public sanitary sewer shall conform to the same requirements as specified
in division (J) hereof. All such connections shall be made gas-tight and water-
tight. Any deviations from the prescribed procedures and materials must be
approved by the Superintendent before installation.
   (N)   Inspection. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify
the Superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and
connection to the public sanitary sewer. The connection shall be made under the
supervision of the Superintendent or his authorized representative. The
connection to the public sanitary sewer and the connection between the building
drain and the building sewer, as well as the full length of the building sewer,
shall remain uncovered until approved by the Superintendent or his
representative.
   (O)   Safety and restoration. All excavations for building sewer
installations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to
protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public
property disturbed in the course of construction shall be restored in a manner
satisfactory to the Sanitary Board and in accordance with city standards.

§ 941.06 USE OF PUBLIC SEWERS.
   (A)   Prohibition of unpolluted water.
      (1)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged, either
directly or indirectly, any storm water, surface water, groundwater, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted
industrial process waters to any sanitary sewer. Any such connections shall be
subject to immediate removal by the owner of the premises so connected and at
the owner's expense.
      (2)   Subfoundation building drains connected to sanitary sewers before
the effective date of this section will not be required to be removed unless it
is established by the Sanitary Board that such connection is detrimental to the
satisfactory operation of the POTW and that such removal is cost-effective in
accordance with guidelines established by the United States EPA. Any such
connections made after the effective date of this section shall be prohibited
and shall be removed.
      (3)   Should the owner of such an illegally connected premises fail to
remove the connection within 90 days after the date of official notice to do
so, the Sanitary Board shall cause the connection to be removed and the cost
thereof shall be billed to the owner of the premises. If such cost is not paid
within 60 days, Council shall certify that such cost shall constitute a lien
upon the property.
   (B)   Illegal discharges to natural outlet or storm sewer. No person shall
discharge or cause to be discharged to any natural outlet or storm sewer any
sanitary or industrial wastewater, unless treatment is provided in accordance
with the requirements of this article and/or the owner's NPDES permit.
   (C)   Allowable discharge of unpolluted water. Storm water and all other
unpolluted drainage, such as from air conditioning, swimming pools, and the
like, shall be discharged into such sewers as are specifically designed and
designated as storm sewers or to a combined sewer or a natural outlet approved
by the Sanitary Board. Industrial uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted
wastewater may be discharged, on approval of the Sanitary Board, to a storm
sewer, combined sewer or natural outlet. If such waters are polluted with
insoluble oils or grease or suspended solids, they shall be treated for removal
of the pollutants, and the clear water discharged as specified.
   (D)   Protection of sanitary and building sewers during construction. No
person constructing a sanitary sewer, building or house connection shall leave
same open, unsealed or incomplete in such fashion as to permit storm, surface
or subsurface water or animals to enter such sewers.
   (E)   Obstructions in sewers. No unshredded garbage or obstruction of any
kind shall be placed or thrown in any receiving basin or sewer, and persons so
offending shall be subject to penalty for each offense.
   (F)   General discharge prohibitions.
      (1)   No user shall contribute or cause to be contributed, directly or
indirectly, any pollutant or wastewater which will interfere with the operation
or performance of the POTW. These general prohibitions apply to all such users
of the POTW whether or not the user is subject to National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards or any other national, state or local pretreatment
standards or requirements. A user may not contribute the following substances
to the POTW:
         (a)   Any liquids, solids or gases which by reason of their nature or
quantity are, or may be, sufficient either alone or by interaction with other
substances to cause fire or explosion or be injurious in any other way to the
POTW or to the operation of the POTW. At no time shall two successive readings
on an explosion hazard meter, at the point of discharge into the system (or at
any point in the system) be more than 5% nor any single reading over 10% of the
lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. Prohibited materials include, but are
not limited to, gasoline, kerosene, naphtha, benzene, toluene, xylene, ethers,
alcohols, ketones, aldehydes, peroxides, chlorates, perchlorates, bromates,
carbides, hydrides and sulfides and any other substances which the Sanitary
Board, the state or EPA has notified the user is a fire hazard or a hazard to
the system.
         (b)   Solid or viscous substances which may cause obstruction to the
flow in a sewer, or other interference with the operation of the wastewater
treatment facilities such as, but not limited to, grease, garbage with
particles greater than one-half inch in any dimension, animal guts or tissues,
paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or fleshings, entrails, whole blood,
feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime, stone or marble dust, metal, glass,
straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags, spent grains, spent hops, waste paper,
wood, plastics, gas, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining or
processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing
wastes.
         (c)   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 9.5,
unless the POTW is specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater, or
wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or
hazard to structures, equipment and/or personnel of the POTW.
         (d)   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient
quantity, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or
interfere with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans
or animals, create a toxic effect in the receiving waters of the POTW, or to
exceed the limitation set forth in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard. A toxic
pollutant shall include, but not be limited to, any pollutant identified
pursuant to § 307(a) of the Act.
         (e)   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases or solids which either
singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public
nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the sewers
for maintenance and repair.
         (f)   Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW such as residues, sludges or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case
shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under
§ 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting sludge use
or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the Clean Air
Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or state criteria applicable to the
sludge management method being used.
         (g)   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES
and/or state disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards.
         (h)   Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions.
         (i)   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit
biological activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but
in no case wastewater with a temperature at the introduction into the POTW
which exceeds 40°C (104°F) unless the POTW treatment plant is designed to
accommodate such temperature.
         (j)   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD and
the like), released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user
knows or has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case
shall a slug load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or qualities of
pollutants that exceed for any time period longer than 15 minutes more than
five times the average 24 hour concentration, quantities or flow during normal
operation.
         (k)   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the
Sanitary Board in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
      (2)   When the Board determines that a user is contributing to the POTW
any of the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, the Board shall advise the user of the impact of the
contribution on the POTW; and develop effluent limitations for such user to
correct the interference with the POTW. In this regard, the Board shall:
         (a)   Reject the wastes;
         (b)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to
the public sewers, as hereinafter outlined;
         (c)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/
or
         (d)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes under the extra strength surcharge provisions of Article 945.
   (G)   Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. Upon the promulgation of
the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards for a particular industrial
subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed
under this article for sources in that subcategory, shall immediately supersede
the limitations imposed under this article. The Superintendent shall notify all
affected users of the applicable reporting requirements under 40 CFR 403.12.
   (H)   Modification of Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards. If the
city's wastewater treatment system achieves consistent removal of pollutants
limited by Federal Pretreatment Standards, the Sanitary Board may apply to the
approval authority for modification of specific limits in the Federal
Pretreatment Standards. CONSISTENT REMOVAL means reduction in the amount of a
pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the wastewater
treatment system to a less toxic or harmless state in the effluent which is
achieved by the system in 95% of the samples taken when measured according to
the procedures set forth in 40 CFR 403.7(c)(2), promulgated pursuant to the
Act. The Board may then modify pollutant discharge limits in the Federal
Pretreatment Standards if the requirements contained in 40 CFR 403.7, are
fulfilled and prior approval from the approval authority is obtained.
   (I)   Specific pollutant limitations. No person shall discharge wastewater
containing in excess of:
Substance or Material                             Allowable Discharge (mg/l)

Oil or grease (freon soluble)                     100
   (J)   State requirements. State requirements and limitations on discharges
shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal requirements
and limitations or those in this article.
   (K)   City's right of revision. The city, upon recommendation of the
Sanitary Board, reserves the right to establish, by ordinance, more stringent
limitations or requirements on discharges to the wastewater disposal system if
deemed necessary to comply with the objective presented in §
941.01(B).
   (L)   Excessive discharge. No user shall increase the use of process water
or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete substitute
for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations contained in
the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in any other pollutant-
specific limitation developed by the Sanitary Board or state. Upon approval of
the Sanitary Board, dilution may be an acceptable means of complying with some
of the prohibitions set forth in division (F) hereof, such as pH and
temperature prohibition.
   (M)   Accidental discharges. Each industrial user shall provide protection
from the accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances
regulated by this article. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner's and user's
own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating
procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Sanitary Board
for review, and shall be approved by the Board before construction of the
facility. All existing users shall complete such a plan by July 1, 1988. No
user who commences contribution to the POTW after the effective date of this
section shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into the system until
accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the Board. Review and
approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility to modify the user's facility as
necessary to meet the requirements of this article. In the case of an
accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of the user to immediately
telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include
location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective
actions.
      (1)   Written notice. Within five days following an accidental discharge,
the user shall submit to the Superintendent a detailed written report
describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user
to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a
result of damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, civil
penalties or other liability which may be imposed by this article or other
applicable law.
      (2)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call
in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.

   (C)   Reporting requirements for permittee.
      (1)   Compliance date report. Within 90 days following the date for final
compliance with applicable pretreatment standards or, in the case of a new
source, following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW,
any user subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Superintendent a report indicating the nature and concentration of all
pollutants in the discharge from the regulated process which are limited by
pretreatment standards and requirements and the average and maximum daily flow
for these process units in the user facility which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or requirements. The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and, if not, what additional O & M and/or pretreatment is necessary to
bring the user into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user, and certified by a qualified professional.
      (2)   Periodic compliance reports.
         (a)   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, after the
compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in the case of a new source,
after commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the
Superintendent during the months of June and December, unless required more
frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the Superintendent, a report
indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are
limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this report shall include
a record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the
average daily flow specified in the discharge permit. At the discretion of the
Superintendent and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow
rates, holidays, budget cycles, and the like, the Superintendent may agree to
alter the months during which the above reports are to be submitted.
         (b)   The Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users which
are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements,
or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In
such cases, the report required by subdivision (C)(2)(a) hereof above shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the
effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration,
or production and mass where requested by the Superintendent, of pollutants
contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment standard.
The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable pretreatment
standard. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with procedures
established by the EPA Administrator pursuant to § 304(g) of the Act and
contained in 40 CFR 136, and amendments thereto (“EPA Methods”), or with any
other test procedures approved by the Administrator such as “Standard Methods.”
Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the
Administrator. Where 40 CFR 136 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication,
Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the Administrator.
   (D)   Monitoring facilities. The Board shall require to be provided and
operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection,
sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage
systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's
premises, but the Board may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample room in or near such
sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense
of the user. Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling
and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the Sanitary
Board's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Plans and specifications for the installation of such
facilities shall be approved by the Board prior to the beginning of
construction, and construction shall be completed within 90 days following
written approval by the Board.
   (E)   Wastewater volume determination.
      (1)   The volume of flow used for computing industrial wastewater charges
shall be the volume of flow measured by the monitoring facilities, or, upon
approval of the Board, the metered water consumption of the industrial user as
shown in the records of water meter readings maintained by the city, except as
herein provided in the following paragraph.
      (2)   If the person discharging industrial wastewater into the public
sewers procures any part, or all, of this water from sources other than the
city water system, all or part of which is discharged into the public sewers,
the person shall install and maintain at his own expense water meters of a type
approved by the Superintendent for the purpose of determining the volume of
water obtained from those other sources.
   (F)   Inspection and sampling.
      (1)   The Board shall inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain
whether the purpose of this article is being met and all requirements are being
complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is created or
discharged shall allow the Superintendent or his representative ready access at
all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination or in the performance of his duties.
The Board, approval authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the
user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling, inspection,
compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements
with his security guards so that upon presentation of suitable identification,
personnel from the Board, approval authority and EPA will be permitted to
enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.
      (2)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative
of the composition of the wastewater. The sampling shall be accomplished by the
use of automatic sampling equipment capable of collecting composite samples, or
by other approved means.
   (G)   Analysis.
      (1)   Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial
wastewaters shall be as specified in subdivision (C)(2) hereof.
      (2)   Determination of the character and concentration of the industrial
wastewaters shall be made by the industrial user responsible for the discharge,
or the industrial user's qualified agent as approved by the Sanitary Board. The
results of the analyses shall be reported to the Board on a semi-annual basis
on forms provided by the Board. The Board may make its own analyses on the
wastewaters and these determinations, when made, shall be binding as a basis
for compliance and for establishing charges, except under circumstances in the
following paragraph.
      (3)   In case the analyses performed by the industry and the Board result
in substantially different values, an effort shall be made by the industry to
collect samples at the same time the Board collects its own samples. The
results of the analyses on the samples collected by the Board and the industry
shall be compared using the same testing procedures as previously outlined
herein.
   (H)   Pretreatment.
      (1)   Significant users shall provide necessary wastewater pretreatment
as required to comply with this article and shall achieve compliance with all
Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as
specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the Sanitary Board shall be
provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing
the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the
Board for review, and shall be acceptable to the Board before construction of
the facility. The review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to produce an effluent acceptable to the Board under the provisions of this
article. Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of
operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the Board prior to the
user's initiation of the changes.
      (2)   The Board shall annually publish in the local newspaper a list of
the users which were not in compliance with any pretreatment requirements or
standards at least once during the 12 previous months. The notification shall
also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the users during the same
months.
      (3)   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards
shall be made available to the Board and to officials of the EPA or approved
authority upon request.
   (I)   Grease and oil interceptors. For grease, oil and inorganic material
such as sand, grit, and the like, interceptors shall be provided when, in the
opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of
liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, as specified in
§
941.06(I), or any flammable wastes, sand and other harmful ingredients; except
that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by
the Superintendent, and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible
for cleaning and inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors the user
shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means
of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates, and means of
disposal which are subject to review by the Superintendent. Any removal and
hauling of the collected materials not performed by the user's personnel must
be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
   (J)   Confidential information.
      (1)   Information and data on a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental agency
without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Sanitary Board that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes or methods of production
entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
      (2)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this article, the
national pollutant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit, state disposal
system permit and/or the pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such
portions of a report shall be available for use by the state or any state
agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be
recognized as confidential information.
      (3)   Information accepted by the Board as confidential shall not be
transmitted by any governmental agency or to the general public by the Board
until and unless a 10-day notification is given to the user.

is not the owner of the premises shall not affect or impair the lien of the
amount of such bill on such premises, nor shall such rendition affect or impair
the right of the city to foreclose such lien in the event any such bill becomes
delinquent as he hereinbefore provided.

§ 947.05 RATES, FEES AND CHARGES.
   The following schedule of rates, fees and charges are hereby fixed and
determined as the rates, fees and charged to customers of the sewerage system
of the city though the entire territory served and such rates, fees and charges
shall be adopted and placed into effect in lieu of the city’s Sewer Tariff No.
9 currently on file with the Public Service Commission of West Virginia:
   (A)   Step 1 rates (to become effective 45 days after the enactment hereof).
      (1)   Applicability. Applicable in entire territory served inside and
outside of the corporate limits of the city.
      (2)   Availability of service. Available for sanitary sewer service.
      (3)   Rate (based on metered amount of water supplied. All gallons used:
$6 per 1,000 gallons.
      (4)   Customer charge. Ten dollars monthly.
      (5)   Unmetered customer charge. Thirty-seven dollars (flat rate
equivalent to 4,500 gallons of water usage per month).
      (6)   Minimum charge. No bill will be rendered for less than $12 plus the
customer charge per month.
      (7)   Delayed payment penalty. The above rates are net. On all current
usage billings not paid within 20 days, 5% will be added to the net current
amount unpaid. This delayed payment penalty is not interest and is to be
collected only once for each bill where it is appropriate.
      (8)   Periodic billings. The above rates and charges may be adjusted to a
monthly, bi- monthly or quarterly basis providing no lower charges.
      (9)   Multiple occupancy. In apartment buildings, shopping centers,
mobile homes, mobile home courts, or other multiple occupancy situations, each
unit shall be required to pay not less than the minimum monthly charge provided
above.
      (10)   Sewer connection charge. The charge for an approved sewer
connection to the sanitary system will be $750, or the actual cost of the
connection (solely determined by the Sanitary Board) whichever is greater, for
all new taps to the system.
      (11)   Method of payment. Payment for services rendered may be made by
Visa, Mastercard, Discover, and Telecheck, as well as cash or money order.
      (12)   Returned check charge. A service charge of $25 will be imposed
upon any customer whose check for payment of charges is returned by the bank
due to any reason.
      (13)   EFT, ACH, credit card and drop box payments. A service charge may
be imposed on EFT, ACH, credit card or drop box payments. The amount shall be
equal to the actual charges to the utility from the financial institution for
processing payment. The Sanitary Board of the city may determine if it will
accept other forms of payment.
      (14)   Industrial service.
         (a)   The charge for the treatment of industrial wastes will be
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
   Ci - VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
      Ci    =   Charge to industrial users
      Vo   =   Average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to
volume, in dollars per gallon
      Vi   =   Volume of wastewater from industrial users, in gallons per year
      Bo   =   Average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD), in dollars per pound
      Bi   =   Weight of BOD from industrial users in pounds per year
      So   =   Average unit costs of treatment (including sludge treatment)
chargeable to total solids in dollars per pound
      Si   =   Weight of total solids from unusual users in pounds per year
         (b)   When an industrial user is to be served, a preliminary study of
its wastes, and the cost of transport and treatment thereof will be made. Waste
containing materials which, in the judgment of the Sanitary Board, should not
be introduced in the sewer system need not be handled by it. The results of
this preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of the
proposed sewer service and the charge therefore, based upon the formula set out
above.
         (c)   Thereafter, industrial sewage will be monitored on a regular
basis and at the conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation
aforesaid and audit of the Sanitary Board records, new cost figures will be
calculated for use in the above formula. The cost of establishing the
monitoring facilities shall be paid by the industrial user. Based on these
audited figures, additional billings covering the past fiscal year will be made
for payment by each industrial user, or refund given by the Sanitary Board, as
the case may be. Such audited figures will then be used for the preliminary
billing for the next fiscal year, at the end of which an adjustment will be
made as aforesaid.
         (d)   Any industrial user listed on the Sanitary Board’s NPDES permit
as having waste streams containing metals shall be charged $8.50 per 1,000
gallons in addition to other sewer charges.
      (15)   Trucked wastewater haulers. Any person or company hauling approved
domestic waste from septic tanks or holding tanks to the wastewater treatment
plant shall be charged $20 per 1,000 gallons. All bills shall be net 30 days
and subject to the delayed penalty payment of 10% for late payment.
      (16)   Recreation vehicle charge. All recreation vehicles disposing of
waste generated from an RV shall be charged $3 per unit.
      (17)   Applicable inside and outside of the corporate limits of the city.
Where the amount of sanitary sewage discharged into the Weirton treatment
system by an industrial plant or any facility cannot be accurately determined
by the use of the plant’s water meter or meters, a special formula will be used
whereby such plant or facility will pay to the Sanitary Board a monthly sewer
charge calculated at 60 gallons of water per each employee at the plant each
working day.
      (18)   No free services. The city shall not render or cause to be
rendered any free services of any nature by the sewer facilities, nor will any
preferential rates be established for users of the same class; and in the event
the city or any department, agency, instrumentality, officer or employee
thereof shall avail itself or themselves of the facilities or services provided
by the sewer facilities, or any part thereof the same rates, fees, or charges
applicable to other customers receiving like services under similar
circumstances shall be charged the city, and any such department, agency,
instrumentality, officer or employee thereof. Such charges shall be paid as
they accrue, and the city shall transfer from its general funds sufficient sums
to pay such charges incurred by it. The revenues so received shall be deemed to
be revenues derived from the operation of the sewer facilities, and shall be
deposited and accounted for in the same manner as other revenues derived from
such operation of the sewer facilities.
      (19)   No allowance for leaks. No allowance or adjustment in any bill for
use of the sewer facilities shall be made for any leakage occurring on the
customer’s side of any water meter. However, if the leakage is the first
leakage for a domestic customer, the customer’s bill will be adjusted to
eliminate payment for the estimated amount of leakage. The customer will be
requested to make required repairs and will be advised that no further
adjustment will be made for any future leakage.
   (B)   Step 2 rates (To become effective upon substantial completion of
construction of the project or four months prior to initiation of debt service,
whichever event should first occur).
      (1)   Applicability. Applicable in entire territory served inside and
outside of the corporate limits of the city.
      (2)   Availability of service. Available for sanitary sewer service.
      (3)   Rate (based on metered amount of water supplied. All gallons used:
$8 per 1,000 gallons.
      (4)   Customer charge. Fourteen dollars monthly.
      (5)   Unmetered customer charge. Fifty dollars (flat rate equivalent to
4,500 gallons of water usage per month).
      (6)   Minimum charge. No bill will be rendered for less than $16 plus the
customer charge per month.
      (7)   Delayed payment penalty. This section remains the same as Step 1
rates set forth above.
      (8)   Periodic billings. This section remains the same as Step 1 rates
set forth above.
      (9)   Multiple occupancy. This section remains the same as Step 1 rates
set forth above.
      (10)   Sewer connection charge. This section remains the same as Step 1
rates set forth above.

set forth above.
      (12)   Returned check charge. This section remains the same as Step 1
rates set forth above.
      (13)   EFT, ACH, credit card and drop box payments. This section remains
the same as Step 1 rates set forth above.
      (14)   Industrial service.
         (a)   The charge for the treatment of industrial wastes will be
calculated on the basis of the following formula:
   Ci - VoVi + BoBi + SoSi
      Ci    =   Charge to industrial users
      Vo   =   Average unit cost of transport and treatment chargeable to
volume, in dollars per gallon
      Vi   =   Volume of wastewater from industrial users, in gallons per year
      Bo   =   Average unit cost of treatment, chargeable to Biochemical Oxygen
Demand (BOD), in dollars per pound
      Bi   =   Weight of BOD from industrial users in pounds per year
      So   =   Average unit costs of treatment (including sludge treatment)
chargeable to total solids in dollars per pound
      Si   =   Weight of total solids from unusual users in pounds per year
         (b)   When an industrial user is to be served, a preliminary study of
its wastes, and the cost of transport and treatment thereof will be made. Waste
containing materials which, in the judgment of the Sanitary Board, should not
be introduced in the sewer system need not be handled by it. The results of
this preliminary study will be used to determine the feasibility of the
proposed sewer service and the charge therefore, based upon the formula set out
above.
         (c)   Thereafter, industrial sewage will be monitored on a regular
basis and at the conclusion of each fiscal year, based on the investigation
aforesaid and audit of the Sanitary Board records, new cost figures will be
calculated for use in the above formula. The cost of establishing the
monitoring facilities shall be paid by the industrial user. Based on these
audited figures, additional billings covering the past fiscal year will be made
for payment by each industrial user, or refund given by the Sanitary Board, as
the case may be. Such audited figures will then be used for the preliminary
billing for the next fiscal year, at the end of which an adjustment will be
made as aforesaid.
         (d)   Any industrial user listed on the Sanitary Board’s NPDES permit
as having waste streams containing metals shall be charged $10 per 1,000
gallons in addition to other sewer charges.
      (15)   Trucked wastewater haulers. Any person or company hauling approved
domestic waste from septic tanks or holding tanks to the wastewater treatment
plant shall be charged $30 per 1,000 gallons. All bills shall be net 30 days
and subject to the delayed penalty payment of 10% for late payment.
      (16)   Recreation vehicle charge. All recreation vehicles disposing of
waste generated from an RV shall be charged $3 per unit.
      (17)   Applicable inside and outside of the corporate limits of the city.
This section remains the same as Step 1 rates set forth above.
      (18)   No free services. This section remains the same as Step 1 rates
set forth above.
      (19)   No allowance for leaks. This section remains the same as Step 1
rates set forth above.

Statutory reference:
   Municipal waterworks systems, see W. V. Code Article 8-19
§ 949.02 WATER CONSERVATION AND SUPPLY EXTENSION MEASURES.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
   EXCESS USE. The usage of water by a water customer in excess of the water
allotment provided under the Local Water Rationing Plan for that customer, over
any applicable period.
   NONRESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER. Commercial, industrial, institutional, public and
all other users with the exception of hospitals and health care facilities.
   RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER. Any customer who receives water service for a single
or multi-family dwelling unit. The term RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMER does not include
educational or other institutions, hotels, motels or similar commercial
establishments.
   SERVICE INTERRUPTION. The temporary suspension of water supply, or reduction
of pressures below that required for adequate supply, to any customer, portion
of a water supply system, or an entire system.
   WATER CUSTOMER. Any person who is connected to and receives water services
from a water supply system.
   (B)   Purpose. This Local Water Rationing Plan is intended to establish
measures for essential conservation of water resources, and to provide for
equitable distribution of limited water supplies, in order to balance demand
and limit available supplies and to assure that sufficient water is available
to preserve public health and safety within the emergency service area.
   (C)   Scope. This Local Water Rationing Plan shall apply to all water uses
within the service area of all customers and entities served by the city,
(emergency service area) encompassing all or part of municipalities,
associations or public service districts.
   (D)   Objective of the Plan.
      (1)   It is imperative that water customers within the emergency service
area achieve an immediate and further reduction in the water use in order to
extend existing water supplies and, at the same time, assure that sufficient
water is available to preserve the public health and sanitation, and provide
fire protection service.
      (2)   The objective of this Local Water Rationing Plan is to effect an
immediate 25% reduction in water usage.
      (3)   The immediate 25% reduction in water usage is another step along a
continuum of responses to the present water supply crisis. Should conditions
continue, further reductions in usage may be required. It must be emphasized
that the 25% usage reduction in the emergency area is a valid and attainable
figure reflective of the conditions which currently exist.
      (4)   The Plan provides for equitable reductions in water usage, and for
equal sacrifice on the part of each water customer. The success of this Plan
depends on the cooperation of all water customers in the emergency service
area.
   (E)   Measures to implement the Water Rationing Plan. Each water supply
purveyor within the emergency service area will develop and adopt such
implementing measures as are necessary and appropriate to assure compliance
with requirements of this Local Water Rationing Plan.
   (F)   Prohibited non-essential water uses. The following water uses are
declared non-essential and are prohibited within the emergency service area:
      (1)   The watering of lawns;
      (2)   The watering of outdoor gardens, landscaped areas, trees, shrubs,
and other outdoor plants, by means other than a bucket, pail or hand held hose
equipped with an automatic shut-off nozzle between the hours 5:00 p.m. and 9:00
a.m.;
      (3)   The watering of golf course fairways;
      (4)   The non-commercial washing of automobiles and trucks;
      (5)   The washing of streets, driveways, and sidewalks;
      (6)   The serving of water in restaurants, clubs or eating places unless
specifically requested by the individual;
      (7)   Ornamental water use, including, but not limited to, fountains,
artificial waterfalls, and reflecting pools;
      (8)   The use of water for flushing sewers or hydrants by municipalities
or any public or private individual or entity except as deemed necessary and
approved in the interest of public health or safety by the City Water
Department;
      (9)   The use of fire hydrants by fire companies for testing fire
apparatus and for Fire Department drills except as deemed necessary in the
interest of public safety and specifically approved by the municipal governing
body;
      (10)   The use of fire hydrants by municipal road departments,
contractors and all others, except as necessary for fire fighting or protection
purposes;
      (11)   The use of water to fill and top off swimming pools.
   (G)   General requirement for water use reductions. Each and every water
customer, regardless of whether residential, industrial, municipal,
institutional or other type of user, shall achieve the water use reductions set
forth in this Local Water Rationing Plan. In order to achieve the overall
objective of the Plan, the water use restrictions and limitations set forth in
divisions (H) through (J) shall apply.
   (H)   Water use restrictions for residential users.
      (1)   Metered residential water customers and allotments.
         (a)   The number of permanent residents in each dwelling unit
(household) will determine the amount of water that each household will be
allowed.
         (b)   Each dwelling unit (household) shall be allotted 40 gallons per
day for each resident of the household. Households with only one permanent
resident will have a daily allotment of 55 gallons.
         (c)   Residential water customers are required to provide water
purveyor personnel with reasonable access to read meters as necessary to
implement this rationing plan. Where access is not readily available, the
purveyor shall make all reasonable efforts to contact customers in older to
arrange for access to read meters. In the event a water customer does not allow
water purveyor personnel entry to read the meter, after the purveyor has made
reasonable efforts to arrange for such access, the dwelling unit (household)
allotment will be reduced to 55 gallons per day.
         (d)   1.   Where the residential water allotment provided under this
section would create extraordinary hardship, as in the case of special health-
related requirements, the water customer may apply to the water supply purveyor
for an exemption or variance from these requirements. If the purveyor finds
that the allotment provided in this section would impose extraordinary
hardship, the purveyor may establish a revised allotment for the particular
customer.
            2.   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an
exemption or variance rendered by a public utility or municipal corporation
rendering water service beyond its corporate limits may file a complaint with
the Public Service Commission in accordance with the procedures established
under the Public Utility Code.
            3.   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such an
exemption or variance rendered by a water supply purveyor not under the
jurisdiction of the Public Service Commission may file an appeal with the
circuit court in the county where the water service is provided.
      (2)   Non-metered residential water customers and allotments.
         (a)   In order to effectively implement and monitor the residential
water conservation effort, a water allotment shall be established for the
entire water system based on 40 gallons per day per capita served or 75% of the
water used by the entire system during the same quarter of the preceding year,
whichever is greater.
         (b)   The purveyor will establish a communication system with the
customers through public media to inform customers of the requirements of the
city's proclamation and this Local Water Rationing Plan; possible conservation
measures that customers may employ; the system allotment; and a daily report of
whether the usage was within the allotment.
         (c)   Metered and non-metered residential customers of the same water
supply system. Where a water supply system serves both metered and non-metered
residential customers, the allotments and procedures provided under both
subdivisions (1) and (2) of this division shall be applied, as appropriate.
         (d)   Suggested conservation measures. The purveyor will provide
residential water customers with suggested means for reducing water consumption
in order to achieve the established allotment. These suggestions may include:
            1.   Locate and repair all leaks in faucets, toilets, and water-
using appliances.
            2.   Adjust all water-using appliances to use the minimum amount of
water in order to achieve the appliance's purpose.
            3.   Use automatic washing machines and dishwashers only with full
loads; preferably, to wash dishes by hand.
            4.   Take shorter showers and shallower baths.
            5.   Turn off shower while soaping; turn off faucet while brushing
teeth, and the like.
            6.   Install flow restrictors in showerheads and faucets.
            7.   Reduce the number of toilet flushes per day. Each flush uses
about 5 gallons. Reduce water used per flush by installing toilet tank
displacement inserts.
            8.   Use sink and tub stoppers to avoid wasting water.
            9.   Keep bottle of chilled drinking water in refrigerator.
            10.   Read the meter to determine the household's daily water use.
   (I)   Water use restrictions for non-residential water customers.
      (1)   Non-residential customers include commercial, industrial,
institutional public, and all other users, with the exception of hospitals and
health care facilities.
      (2)   Non-residential water customers shall reduce their water usage by a
minimum of 25% of use levels for the same quarter of the preceding year.
      (3)   It is the primary responsibility of each non-residential water
customer to meet its mandated water use reduction goal in whatever manner
possible.
      (4)   The water supply purveyor will establish a water allotment for each
non-residential water customer, based upon a required 25% reduction of water
usage from the rate of water used by the water customer in the same quarter of
the preceding year or the last recorded use level if no meter readings record
the rate of the customer's use in the same quarter of the preceding year.
      (5)   Each non-residential water user shall provide access to water
supply purveyor personnel for purposes of meter reading and monitoring of
compliance with this Plan. The water purveyor shall make all reasonable efforts
to contact customers to arrange for access.
      (6)   (a)   If the mandated 25% reduction in water usage cannot be
obtained without imposing extraordinary hardship threatening health and safety,
the non-residential customer may apply to the water purveyor who provides the
customers' service for a variance. For these purposes, EXTRAORDINARY HARDSHIP
means a permanent damage to the property or economic loss which is
substantially more severe than the sacrifices borne by other water users
subject to this Water Rationing Plan. If the purveyor finds that the 25%
reduction would cause extraordinary hardship or threaten health or safety, the
purveyors may grant a variance and establish a revised water use reduction
requirement for the particular customer.
         (b)   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such a variance
rendered by a public utility or municipal corporation rendering water service
beyond its corporate limits may file a complaint with the Public Service
Commission in accordance with the procedures established in the Public Utility
Code.
         (c)   Any person aggrieved by a decision relating to such a variance
rendered by a water supply purveyor not subject to the jurisdiction of the
Public Service Commission may appeal the decision to the Water Board of the
city.
      (7)   The water purveyor will provide each non-residential customer with
suggested means to reduce usage levels. These suggestions may include:
         (a)   Identify and repair all leaky fixtures and water-using
equipment. Special attention is to be given to equipment connected directly to
the water line, such as processing machines, steam-using machines, washing
machines, water-cooled air conditioners and furnaces.
         (b)   Assure that the valves and solenoids, which control water flows,
are shut off completely when the water-using cycle is not engaged.
         (c)   Adjust water-using equipment to use the minimum amount of water
required to achieve its stated purpose.
         (d)   Shorten rinse cycles for laundry machines as much as possible;
lower water levels should be implemented wherever possible.
         (e)   Temperature settings of hot water for showers should be set down
at least 10° to discourage lengthy shower taking.
         (f)   Where plumbing fixtures can accommodate them, flow restricting
or other water-saving devices should be installed.
         (g)   Review usage patterns to see where other savings can be made.
         (h)   For a processing and cooling and other uses where possible,
either reuse water or use from sources that would not adversely affect public
water supplies.
         (i)   Advise employees, students, patients, customers, and other
users, not to flush toilets after every use. Install toilet tank displacement
inserts; place flow restrictors in shower heads and faucets; close down
automatic flushes overnight.
         (j)   Adjust flush-o-meters and automatic flushing use as little water
as possible or to cycle at greater intervals.
         (k)   Encourage water-consciousness by placing water-saving posters
and literature where employees, students, patients and customers, and the like
will have access to them.
      (8)   Customers should read water meters on a frequent basis to determine
consumption patterns.
   (J)   Water use restrictions for hospitals and health care facilities.
      (1)   Hospitals and health care facilities shall comply with all
restrictions imposed on residential and nonresidential water customers as may
be applicable to each individual institution, to the extent compliance will not
endanger the health of the patients or residents of the institution.
      (2)   Each hospital and health care facility shall survey its water usage
patterns and requirements and implement such additional conservation measures
as may be possible without endangering the health of patients or residents to
achieve a 25% reduction in the institution's water usage.
      (3)   The water purveyor will provide each hospital and health care
facility with suggested means to reduce usage levels. These suggestions may
include:
         (a)   Reduce laundry usage or services by changing bed linen, and the
like, only where necessary to preserve the health of patients or residents.
         (b)   Use disposable food service items.
         (c)   Eliminate, postpone or reduce, as may be appropriate elective
surgical procedures during the period of the emergency.
   (K)   Enforcement of Water Rationing Plan.
      (1)   The water supply purveyor will have lead responsibility for
monitoring of compliance with this Water Rationing Plan.
      (2)   The following provisions shall govern the implementation of
temporary service interruptions:
         (a)   In order to effectuate compliance with this Plan, the water
supply purveyor is hereby authorized and required to plan and implement
temporary service interruptions to all or part of its water supply system, as
the water supply purveyor may deem appropriate, when any and/or all of the
following conditions are determined by each water supply purveyor to exist, as
to its water supply system:
            1.   A 25% reduction in system-wide water usage has not been
achieved;
            2.   The 25% reduction in system-wide water usage has been
achieved, but has failed to have a significant impact in extending limited
water supplies; and/or
            3.   Temporary service interruptions are necessary in order to
further extend limited and/or dwindling water supplies.
         (b)   1.   In the event that the water supply purveyor determines that
temporary service interruptions are necessary, the water supply purveyor shall
notify its customers through the public media (newspapers, telephone and
television) serving the customers of the water supply purveyor in its service
territory, at least one day prior to the temporary service interruptions, that
a planned, temporary service interruption is to be imposed.
            2.   In addition, the water supply purveyor shall notify the West
Virginia Public Service Commission, if the water supply purveyor is subject to
the jurisdiction of the Commission.
            3.   Such notice shall:
               a.   State the day or days when the planned, temporary service
interruptions, will occur;
               b.   State the time(s) when such planned, temporary service
interruptions will commence, and the time(s) such interruptions will cease;
               c.   State whether the planned, temporary service interruptions
are to be imposed on the entire system, or a part thereof, and, if only part(s)
of the system will experience planned, temporary service interruptions,
identify the geographical boundaries within which the planned, temporary
service interruptions will occur; and
               d.   Advise all customers within the areas affected by planned,
temporary service interruptions how to treat any water received from the
system, for human consumption, during the period(s) of planned, temporary
service interruptions and for such additional time as may be necessary until
full pressure is restored to the system.
         (c)   If the water supply purveyor imposes planned, temporary service
interruptions as authorized and required by this Plan, it must provide for the
continued delivery of water to health care facilities within the area(s)
affected by such interruptions, by means of any adequate, alternative delivery
measures that may be necessary.
         (d)   If the water supply purveyor implements planned, temporary
service interruptions, it must make provision, by any means possible, for the
continued delivery of such water, as may be necessary, for the proper operation
of sewage collection, treatment and disposal systems and facilities.
      (3)   Any residential or non-residential water customer who exceeds the
allotments established pursuant to this Water Rationing Plan will be subject to
the provisions of subdivision (4) of this division.
      (4)   Non-compliance with the Water Rationing Plan will result in the
following:
         (a)   For the first excess use, a warning of possible discontinuation
shall be issued to the customer by the water supply purveyor.
         (b)   For the second or subsequent excess use, the water supplier may
interrupt or shut-off service to the customer for a period not to exceed 48
hours, or, if the customer provides access, the water supplier may install a
flow restrictor in the customer's service line for the duration of the
emergency. The cost incurred by the water purveyor to interrupt or shut-off and
reinstate service, or to install and remove a flow restrictor, shall be
assessed to the water customer by the water purveyor.
      (5)   Each water purveyor is authorized to alter meter reading schedules
to assure adequate monitoring of compliance with this Plan.
         (a)   Any person aggrieved by the final decision or action of a public
utility or municipal corporation rendering water service beyond its corporate
limits may file a complaint with the Public Service Commission in accordance
with the procedures established under the Public Utilities Code.
         (b)   Any person aggrieved by the final decision or action of a water
supply purveyor not subject to the Public Service Commission may file an appeal
with the circuit court in the county where the water service is provided.
   (L)   Violations. Any person who violates the provisions of this Plan, who
fails to carry out duties and responsibilities imposed by this Plan, or who
impedes or interferes with any action undertaken or ordered pursuant to this
Plan, shall be subject to the penalties provided by law.

§ 955.06 REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Weirton Area Water Board.
      (1)   On new installments, the Board will provide on-site evaluation and/
or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of backflow preventer, if
any, that will be required, and will perform inspection and testing.
      (2)   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the Board
will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises and inform
the owner by letter of any corrective action deemed necessary, the method of
achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the correction to be made.
Ordinarily, 90 days will be allowed. However, this time period may be shortened
depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the history of the device(s)
in question.
      (3)   The Board will not allow any cross-connection to remain unless it
is protected by an approved backflow preventer which will be regularly tested
to ensure satisfactory operation.
      (4)   The Board shall inform the owner by letter of any failure to comply
by the time of the first reinspection. The Board will allow an additional 15
days for the correction. In the event the owner fails to comply with the
necessary correction by the time of the second reinspection, the Board will
inform the owner by letter that the water service to the owner's premises will
be terminated within a period not to exceed five days. In the event the owner
informs the Board of extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not
been made, a time extension may be granted by the Board, but in no case will
this exceed an additional 30 days.
      (5)   If the Board determines at any time that a serious threat to the
public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately.
      (6)   The Board will begin initial premises inspections to determine the
nature of existing or potential hazards. Initial focus will be on high hazard
industries and commercial premises.
   (B)   Owner.
      (1)   The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of
all cross-connections on his/her premises.
      (2)   The owner after having been informed by a letter from the Board,
shall at his/her expense install, maintain, and test or have tested, any and
all backflow preventers on his/her premises.
      (3)   The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer
which is revealed by periodic testing.
      (4)   The owner shall inform the Board of any proposed or modified cross-
connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the owner is
aware, but have not been found by the Board.
      (5)   The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer
unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass. Owners who
cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply additional
devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
      (6)   The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved by
the Board.
      (7)   The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
Board or the WVBPH.
      (8)   Any owner having a private well or other private water source must
have the approval of the Board and the WVBPH if the well or source is cross-
connected to the Board's system. Permission to cross-connect may be denied. The
owner may be required to install a backflow preventer at the service entrance
if a private water source is maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to
the Board's system.
      (9)   In the event the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Board's side of the backflow preventer,
such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed.
      (10)   The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semi- annual device testing, retesting in the case that the
device fails to operate correctly, and second reinspections for non-compliance
with Board or WVBPH requirements.
(Ord. 1411, passed 1-12-04)
§ 955.07 DEGREE OF HAZARD.
   The Board recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from
cross-connections. All threats will be classified by degree of hazard and will
require the installation of approved backflow prevention device.
(Ord. 1411, passed 1-12-04)
§ 955.08 EXISTING IN-USE BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICES.
   Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the Board to continue in
service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness
of the present backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the
public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a
residential installation converting to a business establishment, any existing
backflow preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or
a reduced pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no
backflow device is present.
(Ord. 1411, passed 1-12-04)
§ 955.09 PERIODIC TESTING.
   (A)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
   (B)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester. This
testing will be done at the owner's expense.
   (C)   Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair
the device will be retested at owner's expense to ensure correct operation.
High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the
backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the test date will
be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools, or a
replacement device. Parallel installation of two devices is an effective means
of the owner ensuring uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of
devices, and is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity.
   (D)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in division (A) above in cases where there is a history of test
failures, and the Board feels that due to the degree of hazard involved
additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be borne by
the owner.
(Ord. 1411, passed 1-12-04)
§ 955.10 RECORDS.
   (A)   The Board will initiate and maintain the following:

impact to the water environment by applying structural and/or non-structural
management practices selected to address site-specific conditions. The minimum
requirement for runoff water quality treatment shall be a reduction of 80% of
the average post-development total suspended solids and a reduction of 40% of
the average post-development phosphorus load.
   (J)   No construction shall be performed in a manner that will negatively
impact the water environment in the vicinity of construction or in other areas,
regardless of whether this impact is manifested by flow restrictions, increased
runoff, diminishing channel or flood plain storage capacity, harm to aquatic
life or any other manifestation of negative impact.
   (K)   New construction or reconstruction shall be permitted only after
temporary or permanent erosion and sediment control management practices have
been placed and are operational to the satisfaction of the Utility. The Utility
may halt construction, void a permit, or take other enforcement actions
consistent with this ordinance upon a finding of inadequate erosion and
sediment control management practices upon a site or property subject to the
provisions of this article.
   (L)   All active construction sites shall be inspected by the owner no less
than weekly and within 24 hours after a 0.25 inch rain event to ensure and
verify effective erosion and sediment control. The owner shall maintain records
of these inspections. The Utility may halt construction on properties that do
not provide satisfactory proof of compliance with this requirement.
   (M)   The owner of a completed new development and/or redevelopment
construction shall submit to the Utility within 30 days of substantial project
completion and "as-built" plans of the stormwater management facilities located
upon the property/site.
   (N)   Waivers for providing stormwater management.
      (1)   Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required
by this article unless a waiver of these requirements is granted by the
Utility. A written request for waiver must be submitted to the Utility in a
prescribed form.
      (2)   The Utility may not waive the minimum requirements for stormwater
management of water quality protection.
      (3)   On-site storm water management requirements may be waived by the
Utility if the Utility finds that meeting the minimum on-site stormwater
management requirements is not feasible due to the unique natural or existing
physical characteristics of a site, or that the property owner would suffer an
undue hardship if required to meet the full requirements of this regulation. To
be eligible for a waiver, the applicant must also demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Utility that the waiver will not result in any of the
following impacts to downstream waterways:
         (a)   Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other
structures:
         (b)   Degradation of biological functions or habitat;
         (c)   Accelerated stream bank or streambed erosion; or
         (d)   Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life and/or
property.
      (4)   Where compliance with the full requirements for on-site stormwater
management is waived, the applicant shall satisfy stormwater management
requirements by accomplishing a mitigation measure approved by the Utility.
Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following:
         (a)   Alternative means for on-site management of stormwater
discharges that have been established in a stormwater management plan that has
been approved by the Utility.
         (b)   The creation of appropriately designed and constructed
stormwater management facility or drainage improvements on other properties,
public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities. This
alternative facility must provide a level of stormwater control that is equal
to or greater than that which would be afforded by the waived on-site practices
and there must be a legally obligated entity responsible for the long-term
operation and maintenance of the off-site practice. The Utility shall, to the
maximum extent practical, ensure that the benefits arising from the off-site
practice shall be realized in the same basin/watershed as the waived management
practice.
         (c)   The purchase and donation of privately owned lands to the City
of Weirton or the grant of an easement to the City of Weirton, to be dedicated
to preservation reforestation and/or the creation of green space, wetlands, or
permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat.
   Any mitigation measure shall provide a level of environmental protection
and/or improvement that is, in the sole discretion of the Utility,
approximately equal to or greater than that which would have been provided by
the waived practice.
   (O)   Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. Where the Utility
waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, and the
applicant does not complete an approved mitigation project, the applicant shall
be required to pay a fee in lieu of stormwater management practices, in an

the person responsible for the violation. The responsible person shall pay in

Utility may institute a civil action in a court of competent jurisdiction to

   (K)   The Utility is authorized to take all steps necessary to immediately
and without prior notice halt any discharge of pollutants which reasonably

the environment of the watershed. A person or entity causing such discharge

immediately eliminate the violation, the Utility may take all steps necessary
to eliminate the discharge.

additional evidence and may revoke, affirm or modify the appealed assessment.
   (N)   An assessment and ancillary costs, unpaid after 30 days following
issue by the Utility and hot otherwise timely appealed, shall be grounds for
termination of water service. In the alternative, and at the discretion of the
Utility, the Utility may apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for a
judgment and seek execution of the judgment, and the court in such proceedings
shall treat the failure to appeal the assessment as a confession of judgment in
the amount of the assessment.
   (O)   (1)   When the Utility finds that a person or entity has violated or
continues to violate any section of this article, the Utility may petition a
court of competent jurisdiction for the issuance of a permanent or temporary

this article and/or an order issued by the Utility. The Utility may also seek
such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement that the person or entity conduct an environmental

established by this article, the Utility has the authority to utilize any of
the remedies or sanctions authorized by West Virginia law and this Code that,
in its judgment, will effectively protect the city watershed and comply with

ARTICLE 973: WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES SITING
§ 973.01 PURPOSE AND LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the city’s authority concerning
the placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications
facilities. The city finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose
significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare, character and
environment of the city and its inhabitants. The city also recognizes that
facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be an economic
development asset to the city and of significant benefit to the city and its
residents. In order to ensure that the placement, construction or modification
of wireless telecommunications facilities is consistent with the city's land
use policies, the city is adopting a single, comprehensive, wireless
telecommunications facilities application and permit process. The intent of
this article is to minimize impact of wireless telecommunications facilities,
establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications,
assure an integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such
facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the city.

the proscribed application thereof, shall be severable, and the remaining
provisions of this article, and all applications thereof, not having been
declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid, shall remain in full force and
effect.
   (B)   Any special use permit issued under this article shall be
comprehensive and not severable. If part of a permit is deemed or ruled to be

ARTICLE 1509: INSURANCE REGULATIONS
§ 1509.01 DISTRIBUTION OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS.
   The city is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in W.V.
Code §§ 33-17-9a and 33-17-9b whereby no insurance company doing business in
the state shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure
located within the city where the refuse, debris, remnants or remains of the
dwelling or structure have not been cleaned up, removed or otherwise disposed
of and should the municipality provide statutory notice and incur the expense
of such clean-up and removal, the insurance company shall pay the proceeds of
such policy to the municipality in accord with the statute.
   (A)   West Virginia Code § 33-17-9a provides notice of claims that the
municipality requires and reads as follows:
      (1)   Upon notice of a claim of an insurance total loss to a structure
located in this state, insurance companies must notify the insured, and the
municipality or county in which the structure is located, of any coverage in
the insurance policy providing cleanup, removal of any refuse, debris, remnants
or remains of the dwelling and appurtenances and securing the structure. The
notification shall be by letter to the insured, mailed within ten days of the
notification of the claim and shall include, but not be limited to:
         (a)   The terms and limits of coverage designated by the insurance
policy for securing cleanup and removal; and
         (b)   Any time limitations imposed on the insured for securing,
cleanup and removal. (See W.V. Code § 33-17-9a.)
   (B)   West Virginia Code § 33-17-9b provides the process which shall be
utilized by the municipality and reads as follows:
      (1)   (a)   No proceeds shall be paid by an insurance company which has
issued a policy which provides coverage for debris removal for cleanup, removal
of refuse, debris, remnants, or remains of a dwelling or structure upon a claim
of total loss unless and until the insurance company receives certification
that the refuse, debris, remnants, or remains of the dwelling or structure have
been cleaned up, removed or otherwise disposed of. In the event the insurance
company receives, within six months of the date of loss, certification that
such cleanup, removal or disposal costs have been incurred by a municipality,
county or other governmental entity, rather than the policyholder, such debris
removal and cleanup proceeds shall be paid to the municipality, county or other
government entity which has incurred such costs.
         (b)   No insurance company subject to this section which complies with
this section may be held liable for any claim that may arise out of the
cleanup, removal or disposal of debris pursuant to this section.
         (c)   An insurance company subject to this section which complies with
this section shall be deemed to have fully satisfied all contractual
obligations to the policyholder regarding debris removal.
         (d)   In no event shall an insurance company be required to pay moneys
in excess of policy limits for debris removal. (See W.V. Code § 33-17-9b.)
      (2)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the
municipal corporation and the named insured or insureds from entering into an
agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds
if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged property has been
negotiated and evidenced by a signed agreement between the insured and the
municipality.
      (3)   The Chief Code Official is designated as the officer authorized to
carry out the duties of this section pertaining to notice as well as any
necessary orders effectuating the cleanup, removal or disposal of dwelling
structures subject to the pertinent sections of state code stated herein.
      (4)   Should the municipality undertake any debris removal or clean-up
removal of refuse, debris, remnants, or remains of a dwelling structure occur,
at any time, and the cost of such remediation either not be recoverable from
the insurance proceeds or be in excess of such proceeds the city shall have the
authority to place an assessment lien upon the property in addition to any and
all other available civil and criminal legal actions. In the event any expense
or costs are incurred pursuant to this section, when any such expense or costs
over and above proceeds of any insurance shall be assessed against the real
estate. Such assessment shall bear interest at 10% per annum and shall be
immediately due and payable. If such assessment is not paid within 30 days
after the same is made, the City Clerk may certify the amount of any such
assessment with a description of the property chargeable therewith, and the
name of the owner thereof, to the Clerk of the County Commission of the county
to be recorded in the trust deed books of such Clerk's office; also such
assessment shall be and constitute a lien against such property.

tract is entirely within city, so long as a portion of said surface tract is
located within city, which shares an immediate and common boundary up or down
stream to the property that is the subject of the application for floodplain
permit. ADJACENT PROPERTY also includes all other property that may be affected
by flooding.
   ADVERSELY AFFECT ADJACENT PROPERTIES. To adversely affect a property the
increase in the elevation of the 100-year base flood elevation must be more
than one foot at any point. Stated conversely, if the effect is that the 100-
year flood base flood elevation rises one foot or less the property is not
“affected.” This standard does not apply to the floodway. If prior permit(s)
has/have been approved in the same area of the floodplain, the above definition
would include the cumulative impact to the base flood elevation.
   ADVISORY FLOOD HEIGHT. The water surface elevation (WSEL), in feet, of the
1% annual chance (100-year) flood at a given location, as determined using
hydrology and hydraulics (H&H) analysis and the best available elevation data.
   APPURTENANT STRUCTURE. A secondary structure on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure, the use of which is incidental and shall not be
habitable but shall be used only for storage in association with the principal
structure on said property. This does not include a gas or liquid storage tank.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE). The water surface elevation of the base flood in
relation to the datum specified on the city’s Flood Insurance Rate Map. For the
purposes of this article, the 100-year flood or 1% or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. (See 100-YEAR FLOOD also.)
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor sub grade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE. A certification that the entire development,
including the elevation of fill or the lowest floor of a structure is in
compliance with all the provisions of this article.
   COMPENSATORY STORAGE. An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent
volume of storage within the special flood hazard area used to balance the loss
of natural flood storage when artificial fill or structures are placed within
the special flood hazard area.

any work which may be considered to be performing contracting work;
         (d)   A pest control operator licensed under the provisions of W. V.
Code § 19-16A-7(a) to engage in the application of pesticides for hire, unless
the operator also performs structural repairs exceeding $1,000 on property
treated for insect pests; or
         (e)   A corporation, limited liability corporation, partnership or
sole proprietorship whose primary purpose is to prepare construction plans and
specifications used by the contractors defined in this section and who employs

possible, to reduce the adverse impact of the non-compliance to the greatest
extent feasible.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. The land in the floodplain area subject to a 1%
or greater chance of flooding in any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood Insurance
Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30, and A99.
The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are specifically
listed or otherwise described in this article.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION.
      (1)   (The definition for START OF CONSTRUCTION is to be used only when
calculating the starting time for expiration of a floodplain permit.)
      (2)   The date the floodplain permit was issued, including floodplain
permit for substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the floodplain permit
date. The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
floodplain permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the ACTUAL
START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or
other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
   STATE COORDINATING OFFICE. The West Virginia Division of Homeland Security
and Emergency Management.
   STREAM. As defined in W. V. Code § 7-l-3u, any watercourse, whether natural
or man-made, distinguishable by banks and a bed, regardless of its size,
through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless of its
volume.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBDIVISION. Development that includes a creation of individual land parcels
for future sale. It does not include development where rights-of-way or
easements are obtained and recorded.
   SUBJECT PROPERTY. Includes the surface tract(s) upon which the proposed
development is planned and for which the floodplain permit application is
submitted.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the fair market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the fair
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement.
      (2)   This term includes structures, which have incurred “substantial
damage,” as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation(s) of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local Code Enforcement
Official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
      (3)   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all
article requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued designation
as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific article requirement will
cause removal of the structure from the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from the Secretary of
the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any exemption from
article requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
      (4)   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not the alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
   TOP OF THE BANK. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side
of a stream indicate the TOP OF THE BANK. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the TOP OF THE BANK. When a
professional is not employed the TOP OF THE BANK will be considered to be the
top of the first significant slope landward of the water’s edge when it is
followed by at least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation.
   VIOLATION. The failure of any structure or development to be fully compliant
with all requirements of this article. A structure or other development without
the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of
compliance required by this article is presumed to be in violation until such
time as the documentation is provided. No future improvements or developments
can be made to structures found to be in violation unless the development is to
bring the structure into compliance with the current article.
('71 Code, § 1735.02) (Ord. 568, passed 9-10-79; Am. Ord. 2156, passed 6-7-21)
§ 1735.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (A)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
city which are subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for city by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) dated April 19, 2010 or the most recent revision thereof
including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas which have been identified as flood hazard areas by
city by use of historic or other technical data and shown on an officially
recognized “FIRM or the West Virginia Flood Hazard Determination Tool
Specifically Advisory Flood Height data”. These areas shall be designated as
appropriate with the level of technical data described below and shall be
managed accordingly.
   (B)   Description of special flood hazard areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   Floodway area. The FLOODWAY AREA shall be those areas of AE Zone
identified as floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall
also include any floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated
floodplain and designated as such by the community.
      (2)   AE area without floodway. The AE AREA WITHOUT FLOODWAY shall be
those areas identified as an AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared
by FEMA for which 100-year flood elevations have been provided but no floodway
has been delineated.
      (3)   Approximated floodplain. The APPROXIMATED FLOODPLAIN shall be those
areas identified as an A Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA
and for which no 100-year flood elevations have been provided.
      (4)   Advisory flood heights. This information is displayed on the WV
Flood Hazard Determination Tool. This data may be used (when available) by the
Floodplain Administrator to determine if a property is in the special flood
hazard area, also to assist to determine the height in which to elevate the
structure as a permitting tool. And is acceptable data to FEMA for a Letter of
Map Amendment (LOMA).
      (5)   AO and AH Zones. The AO and AH FLOODPLAIN are those areas
identified as Zones AO and AH on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are
subject to inundation by 1% annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths
are between one and three feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be
established to guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (C)   Changes in designation of area.
      (1)   Where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more
detailed studies have been completed by a qualified government agency, private
entity, or qualified individual who can sufficiently document the necessity for
such changes; the process to revise the delineation of the identified special
flood hazard area may be recommended by the Floodplain Manager and executed by
city. However, prior to any such change, approval must be obtained from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   A city’s base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting
from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practical but,
not later than six months from the date such information becomes available, the
city shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or scientific
data.
      (3)   The City of Weirton may identify and regulate new flood hazard or
ponding areas. These areas shall be delineated on a “Local Flood Hazard Map”
using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high-water marks and/or approximate study
methodologies.
   (D)   Elevations prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
above the base flood elevation, and the following is provided to the Floodplain
Administrator:
         (a)   Elevation information certified by a licensed professional
surveyor or engineer and a site plan demonstrating that all proposed
development will occur above the base flood elevation, or
         (b)   A Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA removing the site
from the SHFA, then the site shall be considered to be outside the floodplain
area and shall not be required to conform to the provisions of this article at
the discretion of the Floodplain Manager.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the base flood elevation, the site shall be considered to be within the
floodplain area and the proposed structure shall be required to conform to all
appropriate provisions of this article.
   (E)   Boundary disputes. Should a dispute concerning any floodplain boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City Council sitting
as the “Floodplain Appeals Board.” The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant/applicant.
('71 Code, § 1735.03) (Ord. 568, passed 9-10-79; Am. Ord. 2156, passed 6-7-21)
§ 1735.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (A)   Floodway.
      (1)   Within any Floodway Area (F1), no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (2)   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         (a)   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere as determined by Floodplain Manager. In
addition to the requirements below the applicant shall demonstrate that there
are no reasonable alternatives other than the Floodway encroachment before a
permit is issued.
         (b)   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         (c)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable federal and state law, ordinances
and regulations.
         (d)   When small, single lot development (not incorporating
significant amounts of fill) is proposed in a special flood hazard areas for
which no regulatory floodway has been designated, a regulatory floodway may, at
the discretion of the Floodplain Manager, be determined to be a width equal to
the channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half
the width of the special flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank
nearest the site to the upland limit of the 1% annual chance special flood
hazard area boundary.
   (B)   AE Zone without Floodway Area. Within any AE Zone without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one foot at any point.
   (C)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A). Within any Approximated Floodplain
Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from federal, state, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
and adjacent properties including but not limited to existing buildings will be
reasonably safe from flooding using hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other
techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall
only be prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that
the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, and the like shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with this floodplain ordinance and related provisions contained
herein and in all other applicable federal and state laws, ordinances and
regulations.
      (4)   Within any approximated Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one foot at any point.
      (5)   When advisory flood height data is available, this data will be
utilized to assist in permitting and regulating development within the special
flood hazard area.
   (D)   Alteration or relocation of a stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, city’s Floodplain Administrator, the State Coordinating Office,
any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners of all such intended
activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all
required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency. In addition, prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain
Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those
governmental agencies from which federal or state law requires approval.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure city in writing that the flood
carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the stream will be
maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the applicant to
demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will provide equal
or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken by a registered
professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used correctly
reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resulting study shall
include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses and
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the use of certain “best practice” techniques in the construction of
bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream
crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may
include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings
to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in
flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the city a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in §
1735.99(D).
      (6)   When any watercourse alteration has occurred, the applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose.
('71 Code, § 1735.04) (Ord. 568, passed 9-10-79; Am. Ord. 2156, passed 6-7-21)
§ 1735.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (A)   General. A permit is required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified floodplain, floodway or other special
flood hazard area.

“Building or Real Property Improvement Notice.”
      (7)   Approved by County Health Department for well, septic and other
permits to assure facilities are designed and located in compliance with the
flood damage reduction requirements of this article.
   (B)   Basic format. The basic format of the permit shall include the
following:
      (1)   Name and address of applicant.
      (2)   Name and address of owner of land on which proposed development is
to occur.
      (3)   Applicant shall provide names, addresses, and valid West Virginia
license numbers of all contractors working at the building site, or affidavits
stating that work is being performed by individuals exempt from contractor
licensing as set forth in Title 28, Series 2, Section 3.9(b) of the West
Virginia Code of State Regulations or the most recent revision thereof, if
known at the time the permit application is submitted. If not known, applicant
shall provide the information within 14 days of execution of a contract with
its contractor(s) prior to beginning construction.
      (4)   A description of site location sufficient to locate the proposed
development including district, tax map and parcel numbers and most recent deed
book and page number.
      (5)   A standard site plan showing size and location of the proposed
development as well as any existing buildings or structures. The site plan
shall also show all adjacent roads and watercourses with direction of flow, the
lowest adjacent grade to the proposed foundation and/or toe of fill, the base
flood elevation and the location of the floodway boundary when applicable.
      (6)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to pay any and all fees
associated with the permitting process as set forth in §§
1735.07(C) and (I).
      (7)   An acknowledgment that the applicant agrees to allow the Floodplain
Administrator and authorized representatives of floodplain management programs
access to the development to inspect for compliance.
      (8)   The contract required by West Virginia Code of State Regulations,
Title 28, Series 4, and all addendums to the contract(s) shall be presented to
the Floodplain Administrator for review within 14 business days of contract
signing. The Floodplain Administrator shall keep copies of all contracts or
addendums and shall file redacted copies of the contracts and addendums with
the Clerk of the City Court in the applicant’s permit application file. The
Floodplain Administrator shall consult with the applicant to redact proprietary
and confidential information from the contracts and addendums that are not
otherwise public information. Failure to present contract(s) or addendums for
review shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the
work is of an aggregate construction cost value of less than $10,000 including
material and labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the
estimated value will suffice.
   (C)   Elevation and flood proofing information.
      (1)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the elevation of the lowest floor above the
freeboard height required by this article.
      (2)   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following
information shall also be included in the application for work within the
special flood hazard area:
         (a)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two feet above the base flood elevation and:
            1.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
            2.   A determination of elevations of the base flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
            3.   Plans showing the methods of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, and the like. When required by the
Floodplain Administrator, a registered professional engineer or architect shall
prepare the plans.
            4.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, and the like) from flooding to two feet
above the base flood elevation at the building site.
            5.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic
elements of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical
construction, it is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by
obtaining elevation data completed by a registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a
mistake in elevation has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
            6.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared
by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification.
The elevation certificate must confirm the structure in question together with
attendant utilities are elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
            7.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that the area below the first
floor could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed
areas below base flood elevation that are five feet high or more). This
agreement shall state:
               A.   The area below base flood elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
               B.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of
the existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility
of the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the purchaser through
notarized signature, a copy of all new non-conversion agreements shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the non-
conversion agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator
shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in §
1735.99(D).
         (b)   All structures shall be flood proofed to two feet above the base
flood elevation (nonresidential structures only). All applicants shall meet or
exceed the minimum flood proofing requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the level of flood
proofing above the height required by this article. In order to obtain an
“elevation credited” flood insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood
proofing must extend at least one foot above the base flood elevation.
            1.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared
by a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed
structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
            2.   A determination of elevations of the base flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits,
certified by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor.
            3.   A flood proofing certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in division (C)(2)(b)1. above, stating the structure in question,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities are designed so that:
               A.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the base flood elevation.
               B.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the base flood.
         (c)   For appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant
materials used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage (appurtenant
structures only):
            1.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
            2.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must
be prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
               A.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the base flood elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the base flood elevation.
               B.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
                  (i)   A minimum of two openings have a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
                  (ii)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
                  (iii)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters.
            3.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion
agreement and notify prospective purchasers of the existence of the non-
conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
transfer the non-conversion agreement to any purchaser at closing through
notarized signature. A signed copy of the transferred non-conversion agreement
shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the non-
conversion agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator
shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in §
1735.99(D).
   (D)   Site plan criteria.
      (1)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
         (a)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this division (D).
         (b)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to floodplain areas, proposed lot sites, and fill
areas.
         (c)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two or five feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify
accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify the site
plan.
         (d)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments
which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the
Approximated Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten lots or two
acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and
shall delineate the floodway.
            1.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the base flood
elevation.
            2.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
State and Local Water Resource Department.
            3.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
Approximated Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development
of detailed base flood elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the
site plan for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two
or five feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be
developed and the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled from
the FEMA map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan.
   (E)   Restrictions to subdivision of land in special flood hazard areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces at or above
the base flood elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard area
limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot
that is located outside of the special flood hazard area.
('71 Code, § 1735.05) (Ord. 568, passed 9-10-79; Am. Ord. 2156, passed 6-7-21)
Penalty, see § 1735.99
§ 1735.06 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS.
   Design and construction standards. In order to prevent excessive damage to
buildings, structures, and related utilities and facilities, the following
restrictions apply to all development, subdivision proposals, manufactured home
parks, new construction and to construction of substantial improvements, and
the repair of substantial damage, to existing structures occurring in the
special flood hazard area.
   (A)   Basements and lowest floors.
      (1)   Residential structures. All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of
residential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement, ductwork
and utilities, elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Non-residential structures. All new construction, relocation,
substantial improvements, including repair of substantial damage, of non-
residential structures must have the lowest floor, including basement, ductwork
and utilities, elevated to two feet above the base flood elevation; or,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that
the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water from the lowest structural element to two feet above the base
flood elevation.
      (3)   Openings. For all new construction, relocation, substantial
improvements, and repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional
engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding, shall be provided.
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (4)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant on all
flood proofed structures and any elevated structures when the Floodplain
Administrator determines that the area below the first floor could be converted
to a non-conforming use (generally applies to the enclosed areas below base
flood elevation that are five feet high or more). This agreement shall state:
         (a)   The area below the base flood elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
         (b)   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement at closing to the
purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of a non-conversion agreement
shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the non-
conversion agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator
shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in §
1735.99(D).
   (B)   Manufactured home placement.
      (1)   Certain unique characteristics of manufactured homes installed in
special flood hazard areas pose an elevated risk of substantial damage to
property. Therefore, it is required that all manufactured homes to be installed
within the special flood hazard areas of city shall be installed by a
contractor possessing a valid West Virginia manufactured home installer’s
license. The installer shall use an installation design engineered to withstand
flood hazards specific to the particular home site. Manufactured homes to be
installed or substantially improved within the special flood hazard areas shall
be installed in accordance with the following standards:
         (a)   The lowest floor, ductwork and utilities including HVAC/heat
pump shall be elevated two feet above the base flood elevation.
         (b)   Elevation shall be on reinforced piers on a permanent foundation
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength engineered for use
in a flood hazard area. Installation designs incorporating dry stacked block
piers shall not be used in special flood hazard areas.
         (c)   All manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10A and 10B as
authorized by W. V. Code §§ 21-9-1 et seq. The anchoring shall be adequate to
resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include but are not limited to the over-the-top and frame ties, attached to
permanent foundation elements. Ground anchors may not be adequate to satisfy
flood specific anchoring requirements. This requirement is in addition to
applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
         (d)   Permanently attached rigid skirts and perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block must have openings to prevent collapse and damage to supporting
piers. The openings must be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer

article.
   (C)   Appurtenant structures.
      (1)   When possible, appurtenant structures shall be located out of the
special flood hazard area.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the base flood elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
         (a)   Use of the structure shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
            1.   Structures shall be no more than 300 square feet in size and
valued at less than $7,000.
            2.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
            3.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
            4.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
            5.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two feet above the base flood elevation.
            6.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities

         (b)   In addition, a non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the
applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this article. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement at a
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of the non-
conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the non-conversion agreement and provide a signed copy to the
Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth
in §
1735.99(D).
   (D)   Recreational vehicle placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; and
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle

to the site only by quick disconnected utilities, security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions. Or,
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
article.
   (E)   Fill.
      (1)   City officially recognizes the beneficial functions the floodplain
area serves in storage and transportation of water during floods. Placement of
fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged and should be minimized.
      (2)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (3)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with currently accepted technical standards that the proposed fill will not
result in any increase in the base flood elevation.
      (4)   All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or
exceed the following standards:
         (a)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, and the like, shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall consider
the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to the
subject property and adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and
adjacent properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst
topography, stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         (b)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         (c)   A fill site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with pre-construction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
article and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
         (d)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance
to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally 15 feet beyond the building line from all points before the start of
sloping required in division (E)(4)(e) below. For non-residential structures,
fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
         (e)   At grade access, with fill extending laterally 15 feet beyond
the building line shall be provided to a minimum of 25% of the perimeter of a
non-residential structure.
         (f)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         (g)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         (h)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical on two
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         (i)   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         (j)   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance/occupancy
can be issued. The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving said request and executing Form 1, “Overview &
Concurrence Form” or other form as may be required by FEMA.
         (k)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
   (F)   Placement of structures and other development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow,
and
      (2)   In so far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (G)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools, above ground gas and
storage tanks located at or below the base flood elevation shall be firmly
anchored to resist flotation or lateral movement.
   (H)   Flood protection setback.
      (1)   A flood protection setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas wells and
well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100 feet from any
perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or wetland. [See
W. V. Code § 22-6A-12(b)]. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be
maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this division (H) at the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator the flood
protection setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the flood protection setback area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
   (I)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below base flood elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with other state environmental agency(ies)
requirements.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles “fill” material
shall not be considered “storage” material for purposes of this division (I).
   (J)   Utility and facility requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
   (K)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to
flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within Zones AH and
AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures.
   (L)   Backflow preventers. Backflow prevention valves should be used for all
enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the special
flood hazard area floodplain area.

that such person is not subject to licensure as a contractor or subcontractor
as defined in § 21-11-6 shall be filed with the City Clerk, date/time stamped
and filed in the official floodplain permit application file.
         (e)   The Floodplain Administrator shall require and keep on file
copies of any documentation pertaining to the permit from any other
governmental agencies. Whether federal or state or local, that requires site
approval, this shall be submitted to the City Clerk, date/time stamped and
filed in the official floodplain permit application file prior to final
issuance of said permit and prior to the start of construction. This
information shall be maintained for the life span of the development.
         (f)   The Floodplain Administrator shall provide a copy of all permits
to the County Assessor as required by W. V. Code § 11-3-3a and provide a copy
of all floodplain permits for new structures to the County E-911 Addressing
Coordinator.
      (2)   After the filing of an application for a floodplain permit and
receiving a properly and timely filed objection to the issuance of a floodplain
permit application, but prior to the Floodplain Administrator’s decision to
grant or deny the same, the Floodplain Administrator may, in his or her sole
discretion, hold a public meeting wherein evidence can be taken or given by
interested persons or parties. Said meeting shall have a court reporter present
to record all testimony and receive all exhibits and evidence. Said meeting
notice shall be mailed by certified mail return receipt requested to the permit
applicant and the objecting person or entity and placed upon the agenda of a
regularly scheduled City Council meeting announcing the date, time and place of
said meeting not prior to ten calendar days from official announcement. The
meeting transcript and exhibits presented shall be filed in the official
floodplain application permit file.
   (D)   Application procedures. Application for a permit and/or site plan
approvals shall be filed, in writing, in duplicate, on the forms supplied by
the Planning and Development Department and shall include all information
stipulated under §
1735.05.
   (E)   Changes. After the issuance of a floodplain permit or site plan
approval by the Floodplain Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made
to the application, permit, or any of the plans, specification or other
documents submitted with the application without the written consent and
approval of the Floodplain Administrator.
   (F)   Permit placards. The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit
placard, which shall be prominently displayed on the subject property during
the time development is in progress. This placard shall show the number of the
permit, the date of its issuance and be signed by the Floodplain Administrator
or the City Council sitting as the Floodplain Appeals Board.
   (G)   Start of construction. Work on the proposed development shall begin
within 180 days after the date of issuance of the floodplain permit or the
floodplain permit shall expire unless a time extension request made in writing
to the Floodplain Administrator and filed in the official floodplain permit
application file by the Floodplain Manager is granted, in writing, by the
Floodplain Administrator after a showing by the applicant of “justifiable
delay” not caused by the negligence or lack of due diligence of the applicant.
Any extension of the 180-day start of construction timeframe shall only be
granted if the permit holder can demonstrate compliance with this article, FIRM
and/or FIS in effect at the time the extension is granted. All work on the
proposed development must be completed within 18 months of permit issuance, at
which time the permit shall expire, unless a time extension made in writing to
the Floodplain Administrator and filed in the official floodplain permit file
by the Floodplain Manager is granted in writing by the Floodplain
Administrator. The request for a time extension shall be in writing and shall
state the reasons for the extension. When considering an extension, the
Floodplain Administrator shall consider the following criteria:
      (1)   Has the applicant diligently pursued the completion of the proposed
development during the 18 months?
      (2)   Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public safety,
health, or welfare or injurious to other property?
   (H)   Stop work orders, inspections and revocations.
      (1)   Stop work orders.
         (a)   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued,
a stop work order notice for any development found ongoing without having
obtained a floodplain permit. Disregard of a stop work order notice shall
subject the violator to the penalties described in §
1735.99(D).
         (b)   The Floodplain Administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued,
a stop work order notice for any development found non-compliant with the
provisions of this article and/or the conditions of the floodplain permit.
Disregard of a stop work order notice shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in §
1735.99(D).
         (c)   In the event that the Floodplain Administrator issues a stop
work order notice, the floodplain permit shall be stayed pending a
determination of whether a violation actually occurred and/or abatement of the
alleged violation, whichever occurs first.
         (d)   In the event of an appeal on a floodplain permit, the Floodplain
Administrator shall immediately issue a stop work order notice that shall
remain in effect until a resolution of said appeal.
      (2)   Inspections and revocations.
         (a)   During the development period, the Floodplain Administrator or
other authorized municipal, county, state or federal government officials may
inspect the premises to determine that the work is progressing in compliance
with the information provided on the floodplain permit application, this
article and with all applicable federal, state, county and municipal laws,
regulations and ordinances.
         (b)   If the Floodplain Administrator discovers that the work does not
comply with the floodplain permit application, this article or that there has
been a false statement(s) or misrepresentation(s) by any applicant in the
permitting process, the Floodplain Administrator shall issue a stop work order
notice, revoke the permit and request a temporary injunction in the Circuit or
Magistrate Court of the city. The Floodplain Administrator shall notify any
appropriate agency or authority if the Floodplain Administrator finds a
violation of any non-floodplain law, regulation or ordinance.
         (c)   The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized municipal,
county, state or federal government officials may inspect any development
covered by this article or previous floodplain ordinances to determine whether
any portion of the development has been altered to be non-compliant with the
requirements of this article or other ordinances.
   (I)   Certificate of compliance.
      (1)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to occupy, or
to permit the occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof
hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or partly
altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of compliance
has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the building or
land conforms to the requirements of this article. Occupying or using a
building or premises in violation of this division (I) shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in §
1735.99(D).
      (2)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect
and approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until
the utility inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of
compliance issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular
development being inspected conforms to the requirements of this article.
Inspection and approval of utilities in violation of this division (I) shall
subject the violator to the penalties described in §
1735.99(D).
      (3)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the
development conforms to the requirements of this article. Installation of
utilities in violation of this division (I) shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in §
1735.99(D).
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Floodplain
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in the special
flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the certificate of compliance shall be based upon the
inspection conducted as prescribed in this article and any finished
construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing certificate,
or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a condition of the
floodplain permit approval process.
   (J)   Fees.
      (1)   (a)   Floodplain determination fee of $25 shall be assessed on all
proposed development. This shall be a flat fee approved by the City Council.
         (b)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special
flood hazard area regulated by this article shall be assessed an additional
fee, payable to city based upon a set schedule approved by the City Council
using the estimated value of the proposed construction as determined by the
Floodplain Administrator.
         (c)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing
city for any additional costs for services necessary for review and/or
inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not limited to,
professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain Administrator may
require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional costs may include
reimbursement for contracted services.
      (2)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this article is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the city for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this article in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.

Penalty, see §
1735.99
§ 1735.08 APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeals.
      (1)   Whenever a person or entity is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provisions of this article, it is
the right of that person or entity to appeal to the City Council sitting as the
Floodplain Appeals Board. Such appeal must be filed with the Appeals Board or
Floodplain Manager in writing, within 30 days after notification of the
decision of the Floodplain Administrator as announced at a regularly scheduled
City Council meeting. Said appeal shall be served by the aggrieved person by
regular mail on all interested parties on the date that said appeal is filed.
Upon receipt of such appeal, the Floodplain Appeals Board shall set a time,
date and place not less than ten nor more than 60 calendar days for the purpose
of hearing the appeal. Notice of the time, date and place of the hearing shall
be given to all interested parties by placing an announcement of said hearing
date, time and place on the agenda of the next regularly scheduled City Council
meeting notice and to announce the date, time and place of the appeal hearing
not sooner than ten calendar days from said announcement date, at which time
all may appear and be heard. The determination by the Floodplain Appeals Board
shall be final in all cases, subject to any appeal to the Circuit or Magistrate
Court of city or any other court of competent jurisdiction.
      (2)   In the event an appeal is filed wherein a floodplain permit grant
has been ruled by the Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator
shall immediately issue a stop work order notice that shall remain in effect
until a resolution of said appeal.
   (B)   Appeal review criteria. All appeals contesting only the permit fee,
the cumulative substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback
requirement, or the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of
the Floodplain Appeals Board.
   (C)   Variances. If compliance with any of the requirements of this article
would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder, developer or
landowner, the city may, upon request, grant relief from the strict application
of the requirements. Considerations for the issuance of variances to this
article shall adhere to the following criteria:
      (1)   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances;
      (2)   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the special
flood hazard area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,
shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance;
      (3)   An affirmative decision granting a floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure;
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the base flood
elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and (ii)
such construction below the base flood elevation increases risk to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in this article; and
      (5)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all
decisions including justification for the decisions, and (ii) report such
decisions issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
      (6)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for issuance of a
floodplain variance for any construction, development use or activity within

§ 1790.11 NOTICE OF VIOLATION.
   (A)   When, in the course of the inspection required under this article,
violations are discovered on the premises which do not affect the habitability
or safety of a rental dwelling, such violations shall be cited in accordance
with the administrative provisions of the applicable code or ordinance. Such
violations shall not be construed as grounds to withhold or revoke the
certificate of use and occupancy.
   (B)   Where conditions exist which affect the habitability of the dwelling
but which do not pose an imminent hazard to the occupants, a certificate of use
and occupancy shall be issued along with a notice of violation. The notice of
violation shall be in writing, shall be served to the owner or agent, shall
contain a description of the property sufficient for identification, and shall
include:

a notice to vacate issued if the dwelling unit is not in compliance within the
time specified in the notice of violation. However, the Code Official may, upon
written request, extend the period for compliance where the work has been
delayed despite good-faith efforts to comply and where such extension presents
no immediate threat to the health or safety of the occupants of the dwelling
unit or other units or properties. A notice of violation shall not be construed
to verify substandard housing except where conditions exist which require the
vacation of the dwelling or dwelling unit.
   (D)   Where violations are found which, in the judgment of the Code
Official, are sufficient to withhold or revoke the certificate of use and
occupancy, the Code Official shall issue a notice to vacate. The notice to

   (E)   Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the Code
Official from ordering the immediate vacation of any dwelling or dwelling unit
where violations are discovered which pose an imminent threat to the health or
safety of the occupants. Appeal shall not stay an order to vacate under such
conditions.
   (F)   Occupancy of any rental dwelling unit in violation of a notice to
vacate shall subject the owner/agent and/or the occupants to the penalties
prescribed in §
1790.99.
(Ord. 2084, passed 7-8-19)
§ 1790.12 RIGHT OF APPEAL.

Board of Appeals from a decision of the Code Official where it is alleged that
the intent of this article or the codes referenced herein have been incorrectly
interpreted, the provisions of this article do not fully apply, or an
equivalent remedy to any violation may be employed. Such appeal shall be in
writing stating the reasons therefore and shall be submitted to the Code
Official within 20 days of receipt of the notice of violation. Except where
conditions warrant immediate vacation of the dwelling, such appeal shall stay
all action on the part of the Code Official in furtherance of the notice of
violation from which the appeal was taken.
   (B)   Where a violation of the City Planning and Zoning Code is cited in a
notice of violation, appeal shall be to the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 2084, passed 7-8-19)
§ 1790.13 APPLICABILITY OF OTHER LAWS.

any other applicable laws.

fine of not less than $100 nor more than $500. Each day that a violation
