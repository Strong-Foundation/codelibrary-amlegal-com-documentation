EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adaption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self- identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section
number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal, with
the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and the
article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number appears
right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is
1, the article number if 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and the
section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the Spencer Codified Ordinances is indicated.

upon. However, this subsection does not prohibit a public agency from

necessary for broadcasting, photographing, filming, or recording a meeting so
as to prevent undue interference with the meeting. The public agency shall
allow the equipment to be placed within the meeting room in such a way as to
permit its intended use, and the ordinary use of the equipment may not be
declared to constitute undue interference; provided, that if the public agency
in good faith determines that the size of the meeting room is such that all the
members of the public present and the equipment and personnel necessary for
broadcasting, photographing, filming, and tape- recording the meeting cannot be
accommodated in the meeting room without unduly interfering
with the meeting and an adequate alternative meeting room is not readily
available, then the public
agency, acting in good faith and consistent with the purposes of this article,
may require the pooling of the equipment and the personnel operating it.

provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall

313.03 TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the
words "go," "caution" or "stop," or exhibiting different colored lights
successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:

in the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the
drivers of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait .  No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the
direction of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or
her crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island
while the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal) .  When a red lens is illuminated with
rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.

traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic or which
hides from view or interferes with the effectiveness of any official traffic
control device, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public
authority permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing
thereon any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the
erection upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving
useful directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for
official signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other

applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No

against any charge of violating subsection (b), (c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of
this section.
   (n)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:

a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b
to persons adjudicated thereunder. An order for home detention by the court

as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation

permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.

section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the

   (a)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, the court,
without entering a judgment of guilt and with the consent of the accused, shall
defer further proceedings and impose probation, when:
         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge
shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this

      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

may park in any zone where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited or which
creates parking zones for special types of vehicles or which prohibits parking
during heavy traffic periods during specified rush hours or where parking would
clearly present a traffic hazard. To the extent any provision of any ordinance
of any political subdivision of this State is contrary to the provisions of
this section, the provisions of this section take precedence and apply.

or a wall in front of the accessible parking space and instructions may appear

parking spaces for vans having an eight-foot adjacent access aisle should be
designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.

misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).

the international symbol of access shall also include the words “Up to $500
fine”.

designated or marked off as an access aisle adjacent to a van-accessible
parking space or regular accessible parking space. Any person, including a
driver of a vehicle displaying a valid removable windshield placard or special
registration plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and

volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or
otherwise shall go into the local authorities’ General Revenue Fund. Otherwise,
any moneys collected as fines shall be collected for and remitted to the state.

   In any of the parking meter areas established by Council, or any part or
portion thereof, the Chief of Police may cause parking meters to be installed
at such individual spaces in such areas as are, in his discretion, available
for the parking of vehicles; and also may place throughout the parking meter
areas, parking meter fine depositories as in the Chief’s discretion he or she
believes advisable; such parking meter fine depositories to be installed upon
the parking meter standards. The Chief of Police is hereby directed to provide
for the installation, regulation, control, operation, and use of the parking
meters and parking meter fine depositories provided for in this section. Each
parking meter installed in a parking meter area shall be placed upon the curb
immediately adjacent to the parking meter space. Each parking meter shall be
placed and set in such a manner as to show or display by a signal that the
parking space adjacent to such meter is or is not legally in use. Each parking
meter installed shall indicate by proper legend the legal parking time and when
operated shall indicate by some appropriate device the duration of the period
of legal parking, and on the expiration of such period, shall indicate illegal
or overtime parking.
   There shall be plainly indicated upon each parking meter the time limitation
for parking in such space.
(1977 Code 8-904; 8-905.)
365.04 MARKING PARKING SPACES ADJACENT TO METERS; MANNER OF PARKING.
   The Chief of Police may cause lines or markings to be painted or placed upon
the curb or upon the street adjacent to each parking meter for the purpose of
designating the parking space for which such meter is to be used, and a vehicle
parked adjacent or next to any parking meter shall be parked within the lines
or markings so established. When a parking space in any parking meter area is
parallel with the adjacent curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in that parking
space shall be parked so that the foremost part of the vehicle is nearest the
parking meter. When a parking space in any parking meter area is diagonal to
the curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in such parking space shall be parked
so that the foremost part of the vehicle is nearest the parking meter.
(1977 Code 8-906.)
365.05 USE OF PARKING METERS AND SPACES; TIME LIMITS.
   When a vehicle is parked in any space adjacent to which a parking meter is
located, upon entering such parking space during the hours of parking meter
operation, or at the beginning of such hours if the vehicle was parked there
previously, the operator of the vehicle shall immediately deposit or cause to
be deposited in the parking meter adjacent thereto, a coin of the United States
and operate the meter in accordance with the instructions thereon. The failure
of the operator to do so shall constitute a violation of this article. Upon the
deposit of the coin and the operation of the meter, the parking space may be
lawfully occupied by the vehicle during the period of parking time for which
coins have been deposited to operate the parking meter; provided, such
occupancy does not exceed the established maximum time limit for the space.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to permit a vehicle to remain in any
parking space for which a parking meter has been provided, while such meter is
displaying a signal indicating that the vehicle occupying the parking space has
already been parked beyond the period of time prescribed for such parking
space.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to cause, allow or permit any vehicle
registered in his name to park overtime, or beyond the period of legal parking
time shown on any parking meter.
Every hour that a vehicle remains illegally parked shall constitute a separate
offense.

days the Municipal offices are closed to observe holidays, and on any other day
designated by Council by ordinance or resolution, the provisions of this
article shall not apply. When any such policy falls upon Sunday and the holiday
is observed upon the following Monday, the provisions of this article shall not
apply on that Monday.

"ticket", which shall have indicated thereon the date and time of delivery.
   (c)    Failure to deposit and compromise the violation as aforementioned by
depositing the "ticket" and appropriate sum in such meter box within ten days
of the time of violation creates penalties as provided in Section
365.99.
(1977 Code 8-918.)
365.14 INTERPRETATION OF ARTICLE.
   Nothing contained in this article, or in any ordinance hereafter
establishing parking meter areas, shall be construed to permit parking of
vehicles in those spaces within such areas in which, by any ordinance of the

   Nothing herein contained shall prohibit or shall be construed to prohibit
Council from granting the permission to persons and churches to use such

Funds of the City and the cost of supervision, protection, inspection,
operation, maintenance, control and use of such parking meters shall be paid
for from the General Funds of the City. However, this provision shall not
prevent the establishment of a separate or special parking meter fund into
which all receipts from all such meters shall be placed and kept until properly
distributed between the City and the manufacturers of such parking meters
pursuant to the provisions of any contract, lease, or purchase of any such
parking meters.
(1977 Code 8-920.)

illegal parking by paying to the City the amount established by Council for
each violation within ten days of the time such alleged offense was committed.
      (2)   Failure to settle and compromise the claim, as above provided in

obstruct the entrance or exits of any place where police or fire department

745.02 IMPOSITION OF PRIVILEGE TAX.
   There is hereby levied and shall be collected annual privilege taxes against
the persons, on account of the business and other activities, and in the
amounts to be determined by the application of rates against values or gross
income as set forth in Sections
745.03 to
745.11 inclusive.
   If any person liable for any tax under Sections
745.03  and
745.04 shall ship or transport his products, or any part thereof, out of the
State without making sale of such products, the value of the products in the
condition and form in which they exist immediately before transportation out of
the State shall be the basis for the assessment of the tax imposed in said
sections, except in those instances in which another measure of the tax is
expressly provided. The Mayor shall prescribe equitable and uniform rules for
ascertaining such value.
   In determining value, however, as regards sales from one to another of
affiliated companies or persons, or under other circumstances where the
relation of the buyer and seller is such that the gross proceeds from the sale
are not indicative of the true value of the subject matter of the sale, the
Mayor shall prescribe uniform and equitable rules for determining the value
upon which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as
possible to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like
quality or character where no common interest exists between the buyer and
seller, but the circumstances and conditions are otherwise similar.
   Gross income included in the measure of the tax under Sections
745.03 and
745.04, except in the case of production of natural gas, shall neither be added
nor deducted in computing the tax levied under the other sections of this
article.
   A person exercising any privilege taxable under Section
745.03 or
745.04 and engaging in the business of selling his natural resources or
manufactured products at retail in this State shall be required to make returns
on the gross proceeds of such retail sales and pay the tax imposed Section
745.05 for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling such natural
resource or manufactured product at retail in this State. A person exercising
any privilege taxable under this section and engaging in the business of
selling its natural resource products in the municipality shall be required to
make returns of the gross proceeds of such sales and pay the tax imposed in
Section
745.05 of this article for the privilege of engaging in the business of selling
such natural resource products in the municipality.
   Manufacturers exercising any privilege taxable under Section
745.04 shall not be required to pay the tax imposed in Section
745.05 for the privilege of selling their manufactured products for delivery
outside of this State, but the gross income derived from the sale of such
manufactured products outside of this State shall be included in determining
the measure of the tax imposed on such manufacturer in Section
745.04.
   A person exercising privileges taxable under the other sections of this
article, producing coal, oil, natural gas, minerals, timber, or other natural
resource products, the production of which is taxable under Section
745.04, and using or consuming the same in his business, shall be deemed to be
engaged in the business of mining and producing coal, oil, natural gas,
minerals, timber, or other natural resource products for sale, profit, or
commercial use, and shall be required to make returns on accounts of the
production of the business showing the gross proceeds, or equivalent, in
accordance with uniform and equitable rules for determining the value upon
which such privilege tax shall be levied, corresponding as nearly as possible
to the gross proceeds from the sale of similar products of like quality or
character by other taxpayers, which rules the Mayor shall prescribe.
(1977 Code 5-402.)
745.03 PRODUCTION OF NATURAL RESOURCE PRODUCTS.
   Upon every person engaging or continuing within this City in the business of
producing for sale, profit, or commercial use any natural resource products,
the amount of such tax to be equal to the value of the articles produced as
shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the producer,
except as otherwise provided, multiplied by the rate as follows: all natural
resources, one percent (1%). The measure of this tax is the value of the entire
production in this City, regardless of the place of the sale or the fact that
the delivery may be made to points outside the City.
(1977 Code 5-403.)
745.04 MANUFACTURED OR COMPOUNDED PRODUCTS.
   Upon every person engaging or continuing within this City in the business of
manufacturing, compounding, or preparing for sale, profit, or commercial use,
either directly or through the activity of others in whole or part, any article
or articles, substance or substances, commodity or commodities, or electric
power not produced by public utilities under other provisions of this article,
the amount of the tax is to be equal to the value of the article, substance,
commodity, or electric power manufactured, compounded, or prepared for sale, as
shown by the gross proceeds derived from the sale thereof by the manufacturer
or person compounding or preparing the same, except as otherwise provided,
multiplied by a rate one-half of one percent (.5%). The measure of this tax is
the value of the entire product manufactured, compounded, or prepared in this
City for sale, profit, or commercial use, regardless of the place of sale or
the fact that deliveries may be made to points outside the City. However, the
dressing and processing of poultry and turkeys by a person, firm, or
corporation shall not be considered as manufacturing or compounding, but the
sale of these products, on a wholesale basis shall be subject to the same tax
as is imposed on the business of selling at wholesale as provided in Section
745.05.
   It is further provided, however, that in those instances in which the same
person partially manufactures products outside this City the measure of his tax
under this section shall be that proportion of the sale price of the
manufactured product that the payroll cost of manufacturing within this City
bears to the entire payroll cost of manufacturing the product; or, at the
option of the taxpayer, the measure of his tax under this section shall be the
proportion of the sales value of the articles that the cost of operations in
the City bears to the full cost of manufacture of the articles. (Passed 4-23-
87.)
745.05 BUSINESS OF SELLING TANGIBLE PROPERTY; SALES EXEMPT.
   Upon every person engaging or continuing within this City in the business of
selling any tangible property whatsoever, real or personal, including the sale

      (3)    “Gross receipts tax” means a tax which (i) is imposed on or
measured by the gross volume of business in terms of Gross receipts or in other
terms and in the determination of which deductions allowed would not constitute
the tax an income tax or value added tax and (ii) which is not, pursuant to law
or custom, separately stated from the sales price.
   (c)   If imposition of the municipality’s tax would place an undue burden
upon interstate commerce or violate constitutional requirements, a taxpayer
shall be allowed a credit to the extent necessary to preserve the validity of
the tax under this article, and still apply the tax to as much of the
taxpayer’s activities as may be subject to the municipality’s taxing authority.

tax equivalent to two percent (2%) of the gross amount of each periodic
statement rendered such purchasers or consumers by such public utilities.
Provided, however, that sales of tangible personal property such as appliances,
or the like, as distinguished from the public service supplied, shall not be
included in the gross amount subject to the measure of this tax. Such
purchasers or consumers shall pay to such public utilities the amount of the
tax levied pursuant to this section which shall be added to and constitute a
part of the cost of the service or property so purchased or consumed and shall
be collectible as such by said public utilities, who shall account to the City
of Spencer for all tax paid by such purchasers or consumers pursuant to the
provisions of this article. The collection of said tax shall be made uniformly
from all purchasers and consumers of all such services and property within the
corporate limits of the City of Spencer.
   Said utilities, as set forth herein, shall bill this tax from all such
purchasers and consumers with each periodic billing from such utility and shall
thereafter collect the same in the usual course of business and shall, each
quarter of each calendar year, make an accounting of the amount of tax received
and pay said amount of said tax unto the City of Spencer. Provided, that the
tax herein levied shall not apply to any Municipally owned utility nor shall
said tax be levied upon charges for telephone services which are paid by the

telephone calls to points outside the taxing Municipality. Provided, the tax
herein levied shall be effective on the 1st day of July, 1987, but shall not be
effective as to any utility affected by the tax herein levied at such date,
unless the City of Spencer gives sixty days written notice of the effective
date of the ordinance by certified mail to such utility doing business within
the said City of Spencer. If as to any such utility not given sixty days notice
as herein set forth by the 1st day of July, 1987, such tax herein imposed shall

1329.01 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this article to provide zoning regulation of uses of
property within the City of Spencer which, because of their nature, require
that special use permits be obtained to insure that incompatible uses be zoned
in separate classifications as provided for in the Zoning Ordinance and to
insure that incompatible uses be separated. It is further intended that the
special permit process shall provide a method whereby it can be determined
whether or not a use would cause any damage, hazard, nuisance, or other
detriment to persons or property in the vicinity of a special use.
   In addition, it is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare
of the citizens of the City, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of special
use businesses within the City.
   Further, the provisions of this article have neither the purpose nor effect
of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent nor effect of this article to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither it is the intent nor effect of this article to condone
or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.

1333.01 REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Intent.
      (1)   Existing nonconformities. If within the districts established by
this Zoning Ordinance or amendments that may later be adopted, there exist
lots, structures, and uses of land and structures which were lawful before this
Zoning Ordinance was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited under the
term of this Zoning Ordinance or future amendment, these nonconformities shall
be permitted to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their
survival.
      (2)   Extension or enlargement of nonconformities. A nonconforming use of
a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure
and land shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of this Zoning
Ordinance.
      (3)   Actual construction at time of Zoning Ordinance adoption or
amendment. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be
deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any
building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance and upon which actual
building construction has been diligently carried on. Actual construction is
hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent
position and fastened in a permanent manner, and demolition, elimination, and
removal of an existing structure in connection with such construction, provided
the actual construction work shall be diligently carried on until the
completion of the building involved.
   (b)   Nonconforming Lots of Record.
      (1)   Single lots. In any district in which single-family dwellings are
permitted, notwithstanding limitations im posed by other provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings
may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and
not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership. This
provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for
area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district;
provided, that yard dimensions and other requirements not involving area or
width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in
which such lot is located. Variance of area, width, and yard requirements shall
be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (2)   Two or more lots. If two or more lots or combinations of lots and
portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record at
the time of passage or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, and if all or part
of the lots do not meet the requirements for lot width and area as established
by this Zoning Ordinance, the lands involved shall be considered to be an
undivided parcel for the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, and no portion of
said parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and area
requirements established by this Zoning Ordinance, nor shall any division of
the parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the
requirements stated in this Zoning Ordinance.
   (c)   Nonconforming Uses of Land. Where, at the effective date of adoption
or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, lawful use of land exists that is made
no longer permissible under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance, as enacted or
amended, such use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful,
subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   Enlargement. No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or
increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at
the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Replacement on the lot. No such nonconforming use shall be moved in
whole or in part to any other portion of the lot or parcel occupied by such use
at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   Discontinuance. If any such nonconforming use of land is ceased for
any reason, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the regulations
specified by this Zoning Ordinance for the district in which such land is
located.
   (d)   Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the
effective date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance that could not
be built under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance by reason of restrictions on
area, lot coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or
its location on the lot, such structure may be continued so long as it remains
otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   Enlargement. No such structure may be enlarged or altered in a way
which increases its nonconformity.
      (2)   Reconstruction. Should such structure be destroyed by any means to
the extent where the cost of reconstruction exceeds its assessed value at the
time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with
the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   Movement. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any
distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the
district in which it is located after it is moved.
   (e)   Nonconforming Uses of Structures. When a nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or
abandoned, the structure, or structure and premises in combination, shall not
thereafter be used except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located. A nonconforming use shall be considered discontinued or
abandoned when the intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent or
when the characteristic equipment and the furnishings of the nonconforming use
have been removed from the premises and have not been replaced by similar
equipment within one year, unless other facts show intention to resume the
nonconforming uses, or when it has been replaced by a conforming use, or when
it has been changed to another use under permit from the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
   (f)   Repairs and Maintenance. On any building devoted in whole or in part
to any nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of one year from the
beginning of work on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten
percent (10%) of the current replacement value of the building; provided, that
the cubical content of the building as it existed at the time of passage or
amendment of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be increased.
   Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any City official or agency charged with protecting
the public safety, upon order of such official.
   (g)   Uses Under Special Use Provisions Not Nonconforming Uses. Any use for
which a special use is permitted as provided in this Zoning Ordinance shall not
be deemed a nonconforming use, but shall without further action be deemed a
conforming use in such district.

      (1977 Code Title 4A.)
1337.03 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)   Special Uses. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall:
      (1)   Hear and determine appeals from and review any order, requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Zoning Officer in the enforcement of
this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Permit and authorize special uses in specific districts as
specified in this Zoning Ordinance.
      (3)   Hear and decide special uses to the terms of this Zoning Ordinance
upon which the Board of Zoning Appeals is required to act under this Zoning
Ordinance, decide such questions as are involved in determining whether special
uses should be granted, and grant special uses with such conditions and
safeguards as are appropriate under this Zoning Ordinance, or deny special uses
when not in harmony with the purpose and intent of this Zoning Ordinance. A
special use shall not be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and
until a written application for a special use is submitted indicating the
section of this Zoning Ordinance under which the special use is sought.
    In granting any special use, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which special use is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning
Ordinance and punishable under the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall prescribe a time limit within which the
action for which the special use is required shall be begun or completed, or
both. Failure to begin or complete, or both, such action within the time limit
set shall void the special use. The Zoning Officer shall be responsible for
maintaining permits issued for special uses and conditions under which the
special use is granted.
   (b)   Variances.
      (1)   Authorize upon appeal in specific cases such variance from the
terms of this Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest,
where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this Zoning Ordinance would result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the
spirit of the Zoning Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done.
A variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance shall not be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until:
         A.   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:
            1.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure or building involved and which are not
applicable to other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
            2.   That literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this Zoning Ordinance.
            3.   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result
from the actions of the applicant.
            4.   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this Zoning Ordinance to
other lands, structures, or buildings in the same district.
            5.   That no nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures, or
buildings in the same district, and no permitted use of lands, structures, and
buildings in other districts shall be considered grounds for the issuance of a
variance.
         B.   A public hearing shall be held and notice of such public hearing
shall be given in accordance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
         C.   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make findings that the
requirements of subsection (b)(1)A. hereof have been met by the applicant for a
variance.
         D.   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall further make a finding that the
reasons set forth in the application justify the granting of the variance, and
that the variance is the minimum variance that will make possible the
reasonable use of land, building, or structure.
         E.   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall further make a finding that the
granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purposes and
intent of this Zoning Ordinance, will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or
otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare.
      (2)   In granting any variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Zoning Appeals grant a variance to
permit a use not generally or by special use permitted in the district
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this Zoning Ordinance in said district.
         (1977 Code Title 4A.)

      (35)   Start of Construction. The date the permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or

would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. See “Substantial Improvement”.
      (40)   Substantial Improvement. Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the Start of Construction of the Improvement.
   This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage”, as
defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does
not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to correct
existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all
Ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific Ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.

the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor other structural part of the
building commences whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (41)   Top of Bank. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the fist
significant slope landward of the water’s edge when it is followed by at least
50 feet of relative flat land.
      (42)   Violation. The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all the requirements of this Ordinance. Any structure or other
development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation
certificate or other evidence of compliance required by this Ordinance is
presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
(Passed 2-2-12.)
1721.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Spencer which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood, as
shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Spencer by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) dated 03/02/2012 or the most recent revision thereof
including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by the City of Spencer by use or other
technical data and shown on an officially recognized “Local Flood Hazards Map”.
These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the level of technical data
described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The floodway shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100- year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the City of Spencer where natural or man-made changes have occurred
and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      (2)   A City of Spencer’s base flood elevation may increase or decrease
resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as
practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the City of Spencer shall notify the NFIP Administrator of
the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The City of Spencer may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a “Local Flood Hazard
Map” using best available topographic data and locally derived information such
as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning the location of
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any part
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Spencer. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail. Elevation data certified by a License Professional
Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this Ordinance if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the
applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either:
         A.   The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study, or
         B.   The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the
City of Spencer in approximate floodplains.
   The proposed development shall then be required to conform to all
appropriate flood damage reduction provisions of this article.
         (Passed 2-2-12.)
1721.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway.  
      (1)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the City
of Spencer during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant
engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a through technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (2)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
City of Spencer, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent
land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood hazard
areas as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit
of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe. Within the Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE without Floodway. Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).
      (1)   Within any Approximated Floodplain:
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
         B.   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed all
proposed development to determine:
            1.   The amount being invested and,
            2.   The specific flood risk at the site.
   The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the applicant to determine
the elevation above which the development will be reasonably safe from flooding
using elevation data, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other techniques.
When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be
undertaken by a Registered Professional Engineer who shall certify that the
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided
that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      (2)   See appendix 4.4 for Sample “Approximated floodplain (Zone A)
techniques”.
   (e)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.  
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of Spencer, the Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition prior to issuing the local
permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval.
         See appendix 4.5 for Sample “Stream Alteration process and contact
sheet”.
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Spencer in writing that
the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of a stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc, shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a through
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain “best practice” techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City of Spencer a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses includes culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreement shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy of the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1721.08(c).
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.

Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this Ordinance. In order to obtain an “elevation credited” flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
         C.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the
plans in subsection (c)(2)A. hereof, stating that the finished structure,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage, (Appurtenant Structures
only):
         A.   A site plan prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirms that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1721.08(c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria. Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks.
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
      (2)   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lies partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated
floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres, whichever
is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a
floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (5)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
approximated floodplain area (Zone “A”) boundary depicted on the map,
development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In
these cases the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at
intervals of two (2) of five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly
delineate the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard
boundary area as scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer
or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area. (Passed 2-2-12.)

 1721.06(a) are applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require all compliance with this
Ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence
of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a copy of
all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1721.08(c).
   (d)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or,
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions, or,
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
   (e)   Fill. The City of Spencer officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Therefore:
      (1)   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
      (2)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
      (3)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (4)   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1721.04. All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed
the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The City of Spencer may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City of Spencer. During permit review the City of
Spencer shall consider the following issues that have the potential to cause
adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and step topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding).
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the
perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed fill use; particular attention is
necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         H.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map Revision
based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         J.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow,
and,
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback.
      (1)   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles “fill”
material shall not be considered “storage” material for purposes of this
subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.  
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage.
      (1)   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      (2)   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (l)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard areas.
      (Passed 2-2-12.)

shall notify the violator by means of written violation notice. The violation
notice shall specify the nature of the violation and request that the violation

restrain the violator from continuing the violation, including but not limited
to requests for the removal of structures or land uses from the property

permit the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the building or land conforms to the requirements of this local law. Occupying

violator to the penalties described in Section
1721.08(c) of this local law.
      (2)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises; or both, or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the
inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance issued by
the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular development
being inspected conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1721.08(c) of this local law.
      (3)   In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of

penalties described in Section
1721.08(c) of this local law.
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)   Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspection

a condition of permit approval.

City of Spencer for any additional costs for services necessary for review and/
or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not limited

reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this Ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the County for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this Ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.

with the Town Council of the City of Spencer, in writing, within thirty (30)
days after notification of the decision. Upon receipt of such appeal, the
Appeals Board shall set a time and place not less than ten (10) nor more than

Board.

shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause,
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the appeal would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and
            3.   A determination that the granting of an appeal will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a City of Spencer official that:
            1.   The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a
structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance,
            2.   Such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases
risk to life and property.

required in subsection (b)(2)E. hereof; and

construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)   Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this Ordinance or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the City of Spencer, shall
be unlawful and shall be referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Spencer of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. In default
of such payment such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed 10
days. Each day during which any violation of this Ordinance continues shall
constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other
actions are hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this Ordinance. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or non-compliance with, this Ordinance shall not excuse the
violation or non-compliance with the Ordinance or permit it to continue; and
all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-
compliance within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, altered or relocated in non-compliance with this Ordinance may be
declared by the Town Council of the City of Spencer to be a public nuisance and
abatable as such.
