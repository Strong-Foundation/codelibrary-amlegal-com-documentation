name written thereon shall not be visible on the outside, and shall deposit the
ballots in a secure box, to be prepared for the purpose, which shall be known
as the “jury box” and which shall be safely kept by the Clerk of the Court, and
shall be opened only by the order of the Jury Commissioners or as hereinafter
prescribed.
   (G)   Selection of trial jurors. All jurors required for the trial of cases

person commanding him or her to attend as a juror at a time and place
designated therein, which copy shall be registered or certified and deposited

address. The personal receipt of the person so addressed for such registered or
certified copy shall be regarded as personal service of such writ or summons
upon such person.

not incompatible with the proper dispatch of its business, shall have power to
discharge persons summoned as jurors or dispense with their attendance on any

of the duties required in this section to be performed by any of the officers

than $15, which sum shall include travel expenses and meal allowance. There

verdict of a jury may be rendered in a case, and against any person on whose
motion the verdict of a jury is set aside and a new trial granted, a total

the Clerk from the party, shall be paid to the city treasury. All money so
received by the Clerk shall be forthwith paid by him or her to the City
Treasurer and the Clerk and his or her surety shall be liable therefor on his
or her official bond as for other money coming into his or her hands by virtue
of his or her office.
      (2)   The Clerk of the Court shall at least annually certify to the City
Treasurer a list of all money so paid to him or her and, in addition thereto, a

any moneys so received by him or her or otherwise fail to comply with the
provisions of this section shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and fined
not less than $50.

adjournment of the Court, or before the adjournment of the Court at such time
as the Court may direct, shall deliver to each juror a certified copy of any
order under the preceding section making an allowance to him or her, payable
out of the city treasury; and the Treasurer shall, upon demand, pay to such
juror the amount allowed to him or her.
   (W)   Fraud in selection of jurors. If any person shall be guilty of any
fraud, by tampering with the jury box prior to drawing jurors, or in drawing a
juror, or in returning into the jury box the name of any person which has
lawfully been drawn out and drawing and substituting another instead, or in
failing to place such name in the box for the ballots marked “drawn”, or in any
other way in the drawing of jurors, he or she shall, on conviction thereof, be
punished by a fine not exceeding $500.

They shall be sufficiently strong for the purpose intended and free from
objectionable tears or leakage. All bags must be securely tied to prevent
spillage and placed at the designated collection location.

representative determines after receiving satisfactory evidence that a
particular commercial establishment produces less than one cubic yard of solid
waste per week, then he or she may allow the use of garbage bags or cans as
provided for in divisions (A)(1) or (A)(2) above. Dumpster units shall be of a
type, size and weight to be determined by the Mayor or his or her duly

service. Notwithstanding discontinuance of service, the city may pursue any
other legal remedy as provided by law or ordinance.

and other writings which have been displayed and used for reading, writing or

produced on that person’s property, provided that such person shall not permit
any solid waste to spill or fall on the streets or highways within the
corporate limits of the city.

device. The water consumer shall, at his or her own expense, install such an

occupants of any property so served shall furnish to the chief water plant
operator any information that he or she may request regarding the piping system
or systems of water use on such property. A refusal to provide the requested
information is an admission that an improper connection exists at this location
and it must be fitted with an approved backflow prevention device.
   (E)   The chief water plant operator is hereby authorized and directed to
discontinue, after reasonable notice to the occupant thereof, the water service
to any property wherein any connection in violation of the provisions of this
section is known to exist, and to take such other precautionary measures as he
or she may deem necessary to eliminate any danger of contamination of the
public water system. Water service to such property shall not be restored until
such conditions shall have been eliminated or corrected in compliance with the

misdemeanor. The consent of the owner of a vehicle to its taking or driving
shall not in any case be presumed or implied because of such owner’s consent on
a previous occasion to the taking or driving of such vehicle by the same or a
different person. Any person who assists in, or is a party or accessory to or
an accomplice in any such unauthorized taking or driving, is guilty of a

application could not be filed 72 hours in advance.
      (1)   The permit may be refused or canceled if:
         (a)   The time, place, size or conduct of the parade including the
assembly areas and route of march would unreasonably interfere with the public
convenience and safe use of the streets and highways;
         (b)   The parade would require the diversion of so great a number of
police officers to properly police the line of movement, assembly area and
areas contiguous thereto so as to deny normal police protection to the
municipality;

interfere with the movement of police vehicles, firefighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the municipality;

dispersal, the route of march or travel and the streets, highway or portion
thereof which may be used or occupied.

successively one at a time, or with arrows, the following colors only shall be
used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (A)   Green alone or “go”.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under §
72.121, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (B)   Yellow alone or “caution” when showing following the green or “go”
signal.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or “stop” signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or “stop”
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right-of-way to all vehicles.
   (C)   Red alone or “stop”.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or “go” is
shown alone except as provided in divisions (C)(2) and (C)(3) below.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or “stop” signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or “stop” signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
       (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or “stop” signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or “stop” signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (D)   Red with green arrow.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right-of-way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
or she can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (E)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
(W.Va. Code § 17C-3-5) (1986 Code, § 313.03) Penalty, see §
71.99
§ 71.38 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.

the direction of the signal and shall be given the right-of-way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (B)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
(W.Va. Code § 17C-3-6) (1986 Code, § 313.04) Penalty, see §
71.99
§ 71.39 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.

sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows.
   (A)   Flashing red (stop signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (B)   Flashing yellow (caution signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.

traffic times, may permit flashing signals between the hours of 11:00 p.m. and
6:00 a.m.

upon or in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic-control
device or traffic-control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or
device which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official
traffic-control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct
the movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic-control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic-control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising.
      (2)   This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection upon private
property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful directional
information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official signs.
   (B)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.

does not apply to a second conviction that is subject to a period of license
revocation under division (H) above.
   (K)   For purposes of division (J) above relating to second offenses, the
following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions under this
section:

this section which is alleged to have occurred within the applicable time
period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there has not been a
final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous offense. In that
case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth the date,
location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No person may be

(C), (D) or (E) above, or any person permitted to drive as described under

controlled substance, or a drug does not constitute a defense against any
charge of violating divisions (B), (C), (D), (E), (F) or (G) above.
   (N)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this subchapter are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or

alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this section
for a first or subsequent offense; provided, further, that for any period of
home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense under
this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than five
days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not
leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of W.Va. Code §
62-11B-5; and provided further, that for any period of home incarceration

permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (Q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in W.Va. Code §
17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the order to the

§ 72.021 DEFERRAL OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS FOR CERTAIN FIRST OFFENSES UPON
CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM;
PROCEDURE ON CHARGE OF VIOLATION OF CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (E) below, whenever any person who has
not previously been convicted of any offense under this subchapter or under any
statute of the city or of any statute of the state or any other state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance or any
other drug:
      (1)   Notifies the court within 30 days of his or her arrest of his or
her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)   Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under division (B) below, the court, without entering a judgment of
guilt and with the consent of the accused, shall defer further proceedings and,
notwithstanding any provisions of this code to the contrary, place him or her
on probation, which conditions shall include, that he or she successfully
completes the motor vehicle alcohol test and lock program as provided in W.Va.
Code § 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein shall be for a period of at least 165
days after he or she has served the 15 days of license suspension imposed
pursuant to W.Va. Code § 17C-5A-2.
   (B)   A defendant’s election to participate in deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in W.Va. Code § 17C-5A-2.
   (C)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the motor vehicle alcohol test and lock program
has been removed there from by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to division (D) below, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to division (C)(1)
above must be filed during the period of the motor vehicle alcohol test and
lock program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the motor vehicle alcohol test and
lock program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the motor
vehicle alcohol test and lock program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (D)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the motor
vehicle alcohol test and lock program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
motor vehicle alcohol test and lock program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within 30 days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the 30-day period, the court shall thereafter dismiss
the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with regard to
the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in division (C)
above.
   (E)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this division (E) be convicted of a subsequent violation of this subchapter,
discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of
guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities
imposed by law upon conviction of a crime except for those provided in W.Va.
Code § 17C-5A. Except as provided in W.Va. Code § 17C-5A-2(k), (l) and (m)
regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and discharge shall
be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status he or she
occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal and
discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of perjury,
false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his or her
failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in response to
any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any inquiry made in
connection with any subsequent offense as that term is defined in W.Va. Code §
17C-5A-4.
   (F)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (G)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section;
      (1)   In any prosecution in which any violation of any other provision of
this section has been charged;
      (2)   If the person holds a commercial driver’s license or operates
commercial motor vehicle(s); or
      (3)   The person has previously had his or her driver’s license revoked
under W.Va. Code § 17C-5-2 or under any statute of the United States or of any
state relating to driving under the influence alcohol, any controlled substance
or any other drug.
   (H)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, trial,
and conviction, pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the
Division of Motor Vehicles; provided, that any person who has previously been
convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within 30 days after service of a
motion for expungement and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this division (H) has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.
   (I)   Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, any person
prosecuted for a violation of W.Va. Code § 17C-5-2(d) whose case is disposed of
pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be liable for any court costs
assessable against a person convicted of a violation of W.Va. Code § 17C-5-2
(j). Payment of such costs may be made a condition of probation. The costs
assessed pursuant to this division (I), whether as a term of probation or not,
shall be distributed as other court costs in accordance with, W.Va. Code §§ 14-
2A-4 and 30-29-4.

§ 72.024 PRELIMINARY ANALYSIS OF BREATH TO DETERMINE ALCOHOLIC CONTENT OF
BLOOD.
   When a law enforcement officer has reason to believe a person has committed
an offense prohibited by W.Va. Code § 17C-5-2 or by an ordinance of a
municipality of this state which has the same elements as an offense described
in said W.Va. Code § 17C-5-2, the law enforcement officer may require such
person to submit to a preliminary breath analysis for the purpose of
determining such person’s blood alcohol content. Such breath analysis must be
administered as soon as possible after the law enforcement officer has a
reasonable belief that the person has been driving while under the influence of
alcohol, controlled substances or drugs. Any preliminary breath analysis
required under this section must be administered with a device and in a manner
approved by the Department of Health for that purpose. The results of a
preliminary breath analysis shall be used solely for the purpose of guiding the
officer in deciding whether an arrest should be made. When a driver is arrested
following a preliminary breath analysis, the tests as hereinafter provided in
this section shall be administered in accordance with the provisions thereof.
(Ord. passed 3-12-2007)
§ 72.025 DEFINITION OF PHRASE “IN THIS CITY”; PHRASES SYNONYMOUS WITH DRIVING
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL; VALIDATION OF WARRANTS AND INDICTMENTS.
   (A)   For purposes of this subchapter, the phrase IN THIS CITY shall mean
anywhere within the physical boundaries of this city, including, but not
limited to, publicly maintained streets and highways, and subdivision streets
or other areas not publicly maintained but nonetheless open to the use of the
public for purposes of vehicular travel.
   (B)   When used in this code, the terms or phrases DRIVING UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR, DRIVING OR OPERATING A MOTOR VEHICLE WHILE
INTOXICATED, FOR ANY PERSON WHO IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF INTOXICATING LIQUOR
TO DRIVE ANY VEHICLE, or any similar term or phrase shall be construed to mean
and be synonymous with the term or phrase WHILE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL
DRIVES A VEHICLE as the latter term or phrase is used in §
72.020.
   (C)   From and after July 21, 2009 a warrant or indictment which charges or
alleges an offense, prohibited by the provisions of §
72.020, and which warrant or indictment uses any of the terms or phrases set
forth in division (B) hereof, shall not thereby be fatally defective if such
warrant or indictment otherwise informs the person so accused of the charges
against him.
§ 72.026 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (A)   Any person who drives a motor vehicle in this state is deemed to have
given his or her consent by the operation of the motor vehicle to a preliminary
breath analysis and a secondary chemical test of either his or her blood,
breath or urine for the purposes of determining the alcoholic content of his or
her blood.
   (B)   A preliminary breath analysis may be administered in accordance with
the provisions of §
72.024 whenever a law enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe a
person has committed an offense prohibited by §
72.020 or by an ordinance of a municipality of this state which has the same
elements as an offense described in §
72.020.
   (C)   A secondary test of blood, breath or urine is incidental to a lawful
arrest and is to be administered at the direction of the arresting law
enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person has
committed an offense prohibited by §
72.020 or by an ordinance of a municipality of this state which has the same
elements as an offense described in §
72.020.
   (D)   The law enforcement agency that employs the law enforcement officer
shall designate which type of secondary test is to be administered: provided,
that if the test designated is a blood test and the person arrested refuses to
submit to the blood test, then the law enforcement officer making the arrest
shall designate either a breath or urine test to be administered.
Notwithstanding the provisions of §
72.028, the refusal to submit to a blood test only may not result in the
revocation of the arrested person’s license to operate a motor vehicle in this
state.
   (E)   Any person to whom a preliminary breath test is administered who is
then arrested shall be given a written statement advising him or her that his
or her refusal to submit to the secondary chemical test pursuant to division
(D) hereof, will result in the revocation of his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle in this state for a period of at least one year and up to life.
   (F)   Any law enforcement officer who has been properly trained in the
administration of any secondary chemical test authorized by this subchapter,
including, but not limited to, certification by the Division of Health in the
operation of any equipment required for the collection and analysis of a breath
sample, may conduct the test at any location in the county wherein the arrest
is made; provided, that the law enforcement officer may conduct the test at the
nearest available properly functioning secondary chemical testing device
located outside the county in which the arrest was made, if there is no
properly functioning secondary chemical testing device located within the
county the arrest was made or there is no magistrate available within the
county the arrest was made for the arraignment of the person arrested. A law
enforcement officer who is directing that a secondary chemical test be
conducted has the authority to transport the person arrested to where the
secondary chemical testing device is located.
   (G)   If the arresting officer lacks proper training in the administration
of a secondary chemical test, then any other law enforcement officer who has
received training in the administration of the secondary chemical test to be
administered may, upon the request of the arresting law enforcement officer and
in his or her presence, conduct the secondary test. The results of a test
conducted pursuant to this section may be used in evidence to the same extent
and in the same manner as if the test had been conducted by the arresting law
enforcement officer.
   (H)   Only the person actually administering or conducting a test conducted
pursuant to this subchapter is competent to testify as to the results and the
veracity of the test.
   (I)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the term LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER
or POLICE OFFICER means:
      (1)   Any member of the state police;
      (2)   Any sheriff and any deputy sheriff of any county;
      (3)   Any member of a police department in any municipality as defined in
W.Va. Code § 8-1-2;

instruction at a law enforcement training academy as provided for under the
provisions of W.Va. Code § 30-29-9.
   (J)   A law enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to believe that
person has committed an offense prohibited by W.Va. Code § 20-7-1, relating to
the operation of a motorboat, jet ski or other motorized vessel, shall follow
the provisions of this section in administering, or causing to be administered,
a preliminary breath analysis and the secondary chemical test of the accused
person’s blood, breath or urine for the purpose of determining alcohol content
of his or her blood.
§ 72.027 ADMINISTRATION OF TEST.
   Only a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, or registered nurse, or trained
medical technician at the place of his or her employment, acting at the request
and direction of the arresting law enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for
the purpose of determining the alcoholic content thereof. These limitations
shall not apply, to the taking of a breath test or a urine specimen. In
withdrawing blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content thereof,
only a previously unused and sterile needle and sterile vessel may be utilized
and the withdrawal shall otherwise be in strict accord with accepted medical
practices. A nonalcoholic antiseptic shall be used for cleansing the skin prior
to venipuncture. The person tested may, at his or her own expense, have a
doctor of medicine or osteopathy, or registered nurse, or trained medical
technician at the place of his or her employment, of his or her own choosing,
administer a chemical test in addition to the test administered at the
direction of the law enforcement officer. Upon the request of the person who is
tested, full information concerning the test taken at the direction of the law
enforcement officer shall be made available to him or her. No person who
administers any such test upon the request of a law enforcement officer as
herein defined, no hospital in or with which such person is employed or is
otherwise associated or in which such test is administered, and no other
person, firm or corporation by whom or with which such person is employed or is
in any way associated, shall be in anywise criminally liable for the
administration of such test, or civilly liable in damages to the person tested
unless for gross negligence or willful or wanton injury.
§ 72.028 REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO TESTS.
   (A)   If any person under arrest as specified in §
72.026 of this subchapter refuses to submit to any secondary chemical test, the
tests shall not be given; provided, that prior to the refusal, the person is
given an oral warning and a written statement advising him or her that his or
her refusal to submit to the secondary test finally designated will result in
the revocation of his or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this state
for a period of at least 45 days and up to life; and that after 15 minutes
following the warnings the refusal is considered final. The arresting officer
after that period of time expires has no further duty to provide the person
with an opportunity to take the secondary test. The officer shall, within 48
hours of the refusal, sign and submit to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles a
written statement of the officer that:
      (1)   He or she had reasonable grounds to believe the person had been
driving a motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs;
      (2)   The person was lawfully placed under arrest for an offense relating
to driving a motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs;
      (3)   The person refused to submit to the secondary chemical test finally
designated in the manner provided in §
72.026 of this subchapter; and
      (4)   The person was given a written statement advising him or her that
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this state would be revoked
for a period of at least 45 days and up to life if he or she refused to submit
to the secondary test finally designated in the manner provided in §
72.026 of this subchapter. The signing of the statement required to be signed
by this section constitutes an oath or affirmation by the person signing the
statement that the statements contained in the statement are true and that any
copy filed is a true copy. The statement shall contain upon its face a warning
to the officer signing that to willfully sign a statement containing false
information concerning any matter or thing, material or not material, is false
swearing and is a misdemeanor. Upon receiving the statement, the Commissioner
shall make and enter an order revoking the person’s license to operate a motor
vehicle in this state for the period prescribed by this section.
   (B)   For the first refusal to submit to the designated secondary chemical
test, the Commissioner shall make and enter an order revoking the person’s
license to operate a motor vehicle in this state for a period of one year or 45
days, with an additional one year of participation in the motor vehicle alcohol
test and lock program in accordance with the provisions of W.Va. Code § 17C-5A-
3a; provided, that a person revoked for driving while under the influence of
drugs is not eligible to participate in the motor vehicle test and lock
program. The application for participation in the motor vehicle alcohol test
and lock program shall be considered to be a waiver of the hearing provided in
W.Va. Code § 17C-5A-3a. If the Commissioner has previously revoked the person’s
license under the provisions of this section, the Commissioner shall, for the
refusal to submit to the designated secondary chemical test, make and enter an
order revoking the person’s license to operate a motor vehicle in this state
for a period of ten years; provided, however, that the license may be reissued
in five years in accordance with the provisions of W.Va. Code § 17C-5A-3a. If
the Commissioner has previously revoked the person’s license more than once
under the provisions of this section, the Commissioner shall, for the refusal
to submit to the designated secondary chemical test, make and enter an order
revoking the person’s license to operate a motor vehicle in this state for a
period of life. A copy of each order shall be forwarded to the person by
registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, and shall contain the
reasons for the revocation and shall specify the revocation period imposed
pursuant to this section. A revocation shall not become effective until ten
days after receipt of the copy of the order. Any person who is unconscious or
who is otherwise in a condition rendering him or her incapable of refusal shall
be considered not to have withdrawn his or her consent for a test of his or her
blood, breath or urine as provided in §
72.024 of this subchapter and the test may be administered although the person
is not informed that his or her failure to submit to the test will result in
the revocation of his or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this state
for the period provided for in this section. A revocation under this section
shall run concurrently with the period of any suspension or revocation imposed
in accordance with other provisions of this code and growing out of the same
incident which gave rise to the arrest for driving a motor vehicle while under
the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs and the subsequent
refusal to undergo the test finally designated in accordance with the
provisions of W.Va. Code § 17C-5A-4.
   (C)   For the purposes of this section, where reference is made to previous
suspensions or revocations under this section, the following types of
suspensions or revocations shall also be regarded as suspensions or revocations
under this section:
      (1)   Any suspension or revocation on the basis of a conviction under a
municipal ordinance of another state or a statute of the United States or of
any other state of an offense which has the same elements as an offense
described in W.Va. Code § 17C-5A-2 for conduct which occurred on or after June
10, 1983; and
      (2)   Any revocation under the provisions of W.Va. Code §§ 17C-5A-1 or
17C-5A-2 for conduct which occurred on or after June 10, 1983.
   (D)   A person whose license to operate a motor vehicle in this state has
been revoked shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard, in accordance with
the provisions of W.Va. Code § 17C-5A-2.
§ 72.029 INTERPRETATION AND USE OF CHEMICAL TEST.
   (A)   Upon trial for the offense of driving a motor vehicle in this state
while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, or upon
the trial of any civil or criminal action arising out of acts alleged to have
been committed by any person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, evidence of the amount of alcohol
in the person’s blood at the time of the arrest or of the acts alleged, as
shown by a chemical analysis of his or her blood, breath or urine, is
admissible, if the sample or specimen was taken within two hours from and after
the time of arrest or of the acts alleged. The evidence gives rise to the
following presumptions or has the following effect:
      (1)   Evidence that there was, at that time, 0.05% or less, by weight, of
alcohol in his or her blood, is prima facie evidence that the person was not
under the influence of alcohol;
      (2)   Evidence that there was, at that time, more than 0.05% and less
than 0.08%, by weight, of alcohol in the person’s blood is relevant evidence,
but it is not to be given prima facie effect in indicating whether the person
was under the influence of alcohol;
      (3)   Evidence that there was, at that time, 0.08% or more, by weight, of
alcohol in his or her blood, shall be admitted as prima facie evidence that the
person was under the influence of alcohol.
   (B)   A determination of the percent, by weight, of alcohol in the blood
shall be based upon a formula of:
      (1)   The number of grams of alcohol per 100 cubic centimeters of blood;
      (2)   The number of grams of alcohol per 210 liters of breath;
      (3)   The number of grams of alcohol per 67 milliliters of urine; or
      (4)   The number of grams of alcohol per 86 milliliters of serum.
   (C)   A chemical analysis of a person’s blood, breath or urine, in order to
give rise to the presumptions or to have the effect provided for in division
(A) hereof, must be performed in accordance with methods and standards approved
by the state Division of Health. A chemical analysis of blood or urine to
determine the alcohol content of blood shall be conducted by a qualified
laboratory or by the State Police Scientific Laboratory of the Criminal
Identification Bureau of the State Police.
   (D)   The provisions of this subchapter do not limit the introduction in any
administrative or judicial proceeding of any other competent evidence bearing
on the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs.
§ 72.030 RIGHT TO DEMAND TEST.
   Any person lawfully arrested for driving a motor vehicle on the public
streets or highways of the city while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs and who is not tested at the direction of the
arresting officer under the provisions of §
72.026 of this subchapter, or who is lawfully arrested as aforesaid by any
other police law enforcement officer, shall have the right to demand that a
sample or specimen of his blood, breath or urine be taken within two hours from
and after the time of arrest, and that a chemical test thereof be made. The
analysis disclosed by such chemical test shall be made available to such
arrested person forthwith upon demand.
§ 72.031 FEE.
   A reasonable fee shall be allowed to the person withdrawing a blood sample
or administering a urine test at the request and direction of a law enforcement
officer in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. If the person
whose blood sample was withdrawn or whose urine was tested was arrested and
charged with a violation of §
72.022 of this subchapter, the county having venue of such charge shall pay
said fee, and if said person is subsequently convicted of such charge, such fee
shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the criminal proceeding and shall be
paid, notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary, into
the General Fund of said county. If the person whose blood sample was withdrawn
or whose urine was tested was arrested and charged with a violation of a
similar ordinance of any municipality, said municipality shall pay said fee,
and if said person is subsequently convicted of such charge, such fee shall be
taxed as a part of the costs of the criminal proceeding and shall be paid,
notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary, into the
General Fund of said municipality.

   (A)   A person may not operate a passenger vehicle on a public street or
highway unless the person, any passenger in the back seat under 18 years of
age, and any passenger in the front seat of the passenger vehicle is restrained
by a safety belt meeting applicable federal motor vehicle safety standards. For

restraint is inappropriate.

negligence or contributory negligence or comparative negligence in any civil
action or proceeding for damages, and shall not be admissible in mitigation of
damages: provided, that the court may, upon motion of the defendant, conduct an
in camera hearing to determine whether an injured party’s failure to wear a
safety belt was a proximate cause of the injuries complained of. Upon such a
finding by the court, the court may then, in a jury trial, by special
interrogatory to the jury, determine:
         (a)   That the injured party failed to wear a safety belt; and
         (b)   That the failure to wear the safety belt constituted a failure
to mitigate damages.
      (2)   The trier of fact may reduce the injured party’s recovery for
medical damages by an amount not to exceed 5% thereof. In the event the
plaintiff stipulates to the reduction of 5% of medical damages, the court shall
make the calculations and the issue of mitigation of damages for failure to
wear a safety belt may not be presented to the jury. In all cases, the actual
computation of the dollar amount reduction shall be determined by the court.

or to a demolisher for demolition, wrecking or dismantling, and no further
titling of such motor vehicle shall be necessary by either the purchaser at the
auction, the licensed salvage yard or the demolisher, who shall be exempt from

city treasury to be kept and maintained as a special revolving account,

remainder from the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle or junked
motor vehicle after payment of such expenses shall be held for the last
registered owner of such motor vehicle or any lienholder for 90 days, after
which time, if no owner or lienholder claims the remainder, it shall be
deposited in said special fund.

§ 95.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Greenbrier County Clean Air Regulation”.
(Regulation eff. 9-1-2012)
§ 95.02 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The United States Surgeon General and other authoritative public
health authorities have determined that involuntary inhalation of tobacco
smoke:
      (1)   Is a cause of numerous diseases in healthy non-smokers;
      (2)   Is a major contributor to indoor air pollution;
      (3)   Places children, unborn children of pregnant women, elderly people,
and individuals with cardiovascular and/or respiratory disease at special risk;
      (4)   Is a trigger for acute episodes of respiratory distress and
myocardial infection;
      (5)   Increases the lifetime exposure to carcinogenic tobacco smoke of
both smokers and non-smokers;
      (6)   Burdens the health care system by increasing the number and
frequency of required hospital admissions and emergency visits thereby
increasing the public and private expenditures required for the treatment;
      (7)   Reduces the life expectancy of persons consistently exposed to
secondary smoke; and
      (8)   Causes substantial losses in productivity through smoking related
absences from work and school.
   (B)   Excerpted from the December 2, 2003 State Supreme Court Decision
Foundation for Independent Living, Inc. v. Cabell-Huntington Board of Health,
214 W.Va. 818, 591 S.E.2d 744 (W.Va. 2003).... “In attempting to minimize the
effects of tobacco smoke on the general public in public places, the
regulations of [boards of health] address a serious health issue which the
Legislature has recognized. Based upon the foregoing observations, we find that
clean indoor air regulations of local boards of health that place restrictions
on smoking in enclosed public places (1) are consistent with the findings of
the Legislature “that smoking may cause lung cancer, heart disease, emphysema
and other serious health problems”, (2) advance the legislatively prescribed
public policy “to provide the state with a citizenry free from the use of
tobacco” and (3) fall within the bounds of authority granted by the Legislature
to such boards.....” Id, 591 S.E.2d at 753.
   (C)   Accordingly, the purposes of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in
public places;
      (2)   To prohibit smoking in places of employment;
      (3)   To recognize that where the need to breathe smoke-free air
conflicts with the desire to smoke, the need to breathe smoke-free air shall
have priority;
      (4)   To facilitate smoking cessation by active smokers; and
      (5)   To discourage non-smokers from taking up the habit and thereby
developing a nicotine addiction.
(Regulation eff. 9-1-2012)

   Except where otherwise expressly provided herein, the fees provided for
herein apply to any person undertaking the herein described activities, trades
or professions for any part, no matter how small, of a given time period in
which the fee is imposed. Except where otherwise expressly provided herein, the
licenses provided for in this subchapter are not transferable; that is, the
payment by one person of a license fee provided for in this subchapter shall
not exempt or excuse a purchaser from, a successor to, or assignee of, any such
person from the payment of the prescribed fee for the maintenance or possession
of a particular license for the conduct of a particular activity. The licenses
provided for herein are nontransferable personal privileges. The fees provided
for in this subchapter apply only to persons engaging in the specified acts,
having the specified ownership, or carrying on the specified operation or
conduct of a trade or business where the foregoing are located within the
geographic limits of the city.

113.999
§ 113.006 EFFECT OF IMPOSITION OF LICENSE TAX.
   In every case where this subchapter imposes a license tax or fee, it shall
be deemed that a license is required to perform the activity and that a license
can and must be issued by the City Recorder with respect to that activity, but
only upon payment of the requisite fee and completion of the requisite
application. The imposition of a license tax by this subchapter shall mean that
the payment of the tax is a prerequisite to the lawful conduct of the activity
upon which the tax is imposed.
(1986 Code, § 741.06) Penalty, see §
113.999
§ 113.007 ACTS PROHIBITED.
   Whenever a license tax is imposed by this subchapter, no person shall engage

any device upon which the fee is levied, without first paying the tax and
acquiring the license provided for under this subchapter.
(1986 Code, § 741.07) Penalty, see §
113.999
§ 113.008 EFFECT OF LICENSE.
   In any case in which a license is required by this subchapter, the issuance
of the license shall be deemed a prerequisite to the lawful conduct of the
activity for which the license is required. Issuance of any license under this
subchapter shall not, however, make valid or legal any act not otherwise valid
or legal or not otherwise authorized by other provisions of law. Nothing in
this subchapter shall authorize any act, activity or ownership not otherwise
lawful.
(1986 Code, § 741.08)
§ 113.009 DUTIES AND POWERS OF CITY RECORDER.
   The City Recorder shall have the power to prepare application forms for any

on or blanks for any information reasonably deemed necessary by the City
Recorder. The City Recorder is expressly authorized to require applicants to
have, and to provide evidence of, a valid and existing state business franchise
registration certificate. Proper completion of an application is a condition
precedent to the City Recorder having any duty to issue a license. Upon proper
completion of a license application and payment of the requisite fee, the City
Recorder shall issue the requested license to the applicant. The form of the
license and information thereon shall be such as the City Recorder may
reasonably prescribe. The City Recorder, or his or her designated agent, shall
have the power to examine activities and locations of each business to
determine compliance with this subchapter.
(1986 Code, § 741.09)
§ 113.010 LICENSE FEES CUMULATIVE.
   The license fees imposed in this subchapter are cumulative and the
imposition of any one fee does not preclude the imposition of other fees upon
any one individual or entity. The fees imposed by this subchapter are imposed
for engaging in certain trades or activities, or for the use or possession of
certain devices. The pursuit of a particular trade or activity, or the
ownership or use of a particular device, shall not excuse a person or entity
from the requirement for a license and payment of a license fee for each such
activity or device for which, if engaged in or possessed singly, a license
requirement and license fee would be imposed.
(1986 Code, § 741.10)
§ 113.011 CHANGE IN NAME OR PARTNERS.
   A change in the name under which a person does business shall not require
the person to seek any new license for any activity licensed under a prior
name; nor shall the withdrawal or addition of partners to a partnership require
the partnership to obtain a new license, provided that the partnership always
retains at least one partner who was a member of the firm at the time the
license was granted.

(Ord. passed 11-12-2019)
§ 113.137 PROVISIONS FOR CONTRACTING.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      BUILDINGS or STRUCTURES. Everything artificially built up or composed of
parts joined together in some definite manner and attached to real property.
BUILDINGS or STRUCTURES includes not only buildings in the general and ordinary
sense, but also tanks, fences, conduits, systems, tunnels, monuments, retaining
walls, bridges, trestles, parking lots and pavement for foot or vehicular
traffic.
      CONTRACTING. Has the same meaning as that defined in §
113.135.
      CONTRACTING, REPAIRING, DECORATING OR IMPROVING OF A NEW OR EXISTING
BUILDING OR STRUCTURE OR ANY PART THEREOF. In addition to its ordinary meaning,
includes the installing or attaching of any article of tangible personal
property in or to real property, whether or not such personal property becomes
a part of the realty by virtue of such installation.
      PRIME CONTRACTOR. A person engaged in the business of performing for
others, contracts for the constructing, repairing, decorating or improving of a
new or existing building or buildings or other structures under, upon or above
real property, either for the entire work or for a specific portion thereof.
       PRIME CONTRACTOR and/or SUBCONTRACTOR. In addition to the definition of
CONTRACTING contained herein includes persons performing labor and services in
respect to the moving of earth or clearing of land, razing or moving of
existing buildings or structures even though such services may not be done in
connection with a contract involving the construction, repairing or altering of
a new or existing building or structure.
      SUBCONTRACTOR. A person engaged in the business of performing contracting
or a like or similar service for persons other than consumers, either for the
entire work or for a specific portion thereof.
    (B)   The business of contracting is taxable under the business and
occupation tax subchapter, and the gross income derived therefrom must be
reported under the contracting classification. The rate of tax applied against
gross income under the contracting classification is taxable at the rate
specified in §
113.136(E).
      (1)   Prime and subcontractors, taxable on gross income with no
deductions therefrom. A prime contractor, one who furnishes work or both
materials and work under a written or oral contract, for the construction,
alteration, repair, decoration or for the construction, alteration, repair,
decoration or improvement of a new or existing building or structure may take
no deduction from gross income on account of payments made to the
subcontractor. The subcontractor will also be taxable on his or her gross
income under the contracting classification.
      (2)   Contracting entered into with governments. Gross income received by
a person for contracting activities performed for the state, the federal
government, or any of their instrumentalities, agencies, boards, commissions or
political subdivisions and the like is taxable and shall be reported under the
contracting classification. The fact that the owner is a governmental unit does
not relieve the contractor, subcontractor, suppliers or any other person from
liability for business and occupation tax on the full amount of gross income.
      (3)   Prime contractors liable for taxes due from subcontractors.
Whenever a contracting, repairing, decorating or improving contract is let for
work to be done in the city, the prime contractor shall submit a list of all
subcontractors who will work under the contract to the Director of Finance. The
list shall be submitted within 30 days of the original contract. The names of
any and all subcontractors engaged after the list is submitted shall be
submitted as they are engaged. A standard form for the list shall be approved
by the Finance Director or his or her designee. Upon completion of the
contract, but prior to final payment to the subcontractor or subcontractors,
the prime contractor shall notify the Finance Director in writing and request a
letter of release from the Finance Director stating that such subcontractor or
subcontractors, as appropriate, have timely filed and paid taxes due the city.
If the Finance Director is satisfied that such subcontractor or subcontractors,
as appropriate, have timely filed and paid taxes due the city, he or she shall
issue such letter of release forthwith. Nothing herein shall be construed to
relieve any subcontractor of its liability for taxes due the city under §
113.136(E).
(Ord. passed 11-12-2019)
§ 113.138 PROVISIONS FOR BANKING.
   (A)   Each business engaging in banking business in the city that also
maintains a banking location outside the city shall make a good faith
allocation of its gross income in accordance with this section, subject to the
approval of the Finance Director. Each bank subject to this regulation shall
report gross income for municipal business and occupation tax purposes to
reflect all gross income generated from loans originated and services provided
to customers at or through each banking location within the municipal limits of
the city and each such bank’s report shall fully reflect gross income earned
from investments (other than loans) funded by deposits and repurchase
agreements regularly maintained at or through each banking location within the
municipal limits of the city. Other gross income shall be allocated in a
reasonable manner that attributes all income to banking locations. No
allocation methodology used to make such a report shall allocate or apportion
gross income to locations other than a banking location.
   (B)   Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
      (1)   The phrase BANKING LOCATION (and all derivations thereof) means a
physical facility maintained by a bank engaged in banking business at which
customers normally personally visit to conduct typical banking transactions,
such as opening accounts, originating loans, making deposits and the like; and
      (2)   Gross income from loans is reportable (without adjustment,
apportionment or allocation) to the banking location at which the loan
originates. The transfer of loan files to a location outside of a municipality
for processing or collection does not alter the taxability of the interest from
such loans with respect to the banking location at which such loans originate.
   (C)   Gross income from investments (other than loans) acquired or
repurchase agreements is reportable to banking location(s) in which deposits
giving rise to the income are maintained, regardless of whether the investments
function is managed or directed at a separate location. Deposits and repurchase
agreements are considered maintained only at banking locations in accordance
with reasonable procedures that reflect typical customer deposit activities and
repurchase agreement relationships maintained at banking locations of the
taxpayer subject to the approval of the Finance Director. Gross income from
investments (other than loans) acquired or funded from sources other than
deposits or repurchase agreements shall be reported to banking location(s) in a
reasonable manner that fairly allocates all such gross income to banking
locations.
   (D)   (1)   Gross income from fees is reportable to the banking location at
which the activity giving rise to the fee is primarily undertaken, using a
reasonable method that fully reports fee income to one or more banking
locations.
      (2)   The Finance Director shall have authority to review and approve
reasonable allocation methods in accordance with this section.
      (3)   Each bank subject to this regulation shall establish and maintain
sufficient records for review by the Finance Director and its designee as long
as the contents of such records may be material in the administration of the
municipal business and occupation tax of the city along with such additional
information as may otherwise be required. Each bank subject to this regulation
shall file reports on such forms designed from time to time by the Finance
Director and shall follow all instructions in connection therewith.

§ 113.139 PROVISIONS FOR HMOS.
   The rate of municipal business and occupation or privilege tax on the
activity of a health maintenance organization holding a certificate of

0.5% to be applied solely to that portion of gross income received from the

sources other than Medicaid, state employee programs administered by the public
employees insurance agency and other federal programs for health care items or
services provided directly or indirectly by the health maintenance
organization; provided, that this tax rate limitation shall not extend to that
part of the gross income of health maintenance organizations which is received
from the use of real property other than property in which any such company
maintains its office or offices in the municipal limits of the city, whether
such income is in the form of rentals or royalties.

§ 113.145 ASSESSMENT OF TAX.
   If the Finance Director believes that the tax imposed by this subchapter is
insufficiently returned by a taxpayer, either because the taxpayer had failed
to properly remit the tax or has failed to make a return, or has made a return
which is incomplete, deficient or otherwise erroneous, the Finance Director may
proceed to investigate and determine or estimate the tax liability of the
taxpayer and make an assessment therefor.
(Ord. passed 11-12-2019)
§ 113.146 JEOPARDY ASSESSMENTS.
   (A)   If the Finance Director believes that the collection of any tax which
it is required to administer will be jeopardized by delay, it shall thereupon
make an assessment of the tax, noting that fact upon the assessment. The amount
assessed shall be immediately due and payable. Unless the taxpayer against whom
a jeopardy assessment is made petitions for reassessment within 20 days after
service of notice of the jeopardy assessment, such an assessment becomes final.
   (B)   A petition for reassessment by a person against whom a jeopardy
assessment has been made must be accompanied by such security as the Finance
Director may deem necessary to ensure compliance with this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 11-12-2019)

§ 113.148 NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   The Finance Director shall give to the taxpayer written notice of any
assessment made pursuant to this subchapter. Unless the taxpayer to whom a
notice of assessment is directed shall, within 30 days after service thereof
(except in case of jeopardy assessments), either personally or by certified
mail, file with the Finance Director a petition in writing, verified under oath
by the taxpayer or his or her duly authorized agent, having knowledge of the
facts, setting forth with definiteness and particularity the items of the
assessment objected to, together with the reason for such objections, such
assessment shall become and be deemed conclusive and the amount thereof shall
be payable at the end of the 30-day period. In every case where a petition for
reassessment as above described is filed, the Finance Director shall assign a
time for the hearing at City Hall, by written notice at least 20 days in
advance thereof and such hearing shall be held within 60 days from the filing
of the petition for reassessment unless continued by agreement or by the
Finance Director for good cause. The hearing shall be informal. At such
hearing, evidence may be offered to support the assessment or to prove that it
is incorrect. After such hearing the Finance Director shall, within a
reasonable time, give notice in writing of the decision. Unless an appeal is
taken within 30 days from service of this notice, the Finance Director’s
decision shall be final and conclusive and not subject to administrative or
judicial review. The amount, if any, due the city under such decision shall be
due and payable on the day following the date upon which such decision becomes

sureties approved by the Clerk, the penalty of the bond to be not less than the
total amount of the tax, interest and penalties (to such date) appealed from,
and conditioned that the plaintiff shall perform the orders of the Court;
provided, that the judge of the Circuit Court may stay the collection of the
tax without the requirement of a bond, upon a proper showing by the taxpayer
that the properties of the taxpayer are sufficient to secure performance of the
Court’s orders or that the ends of justice will be served thereby.
   (C)   The Court shall hear the appeal and determine anew all questions
submitted to it on appeal from the determination of the Finance Director. In
such appeal, a certified copy of the city’s assessment shall be admissible and
shall constitute prima facie evidence of the tax due. The Court shall render
its decree thereon and a certified copy of the decree shall be filed by the
Clerk of the Court with the Finance Director who shall then correct the
assessment in accordance with such decree. An appeal may be taken by the city
or the taxpayer to the State Supreme Court of Appeals.

succeeding month, or fraction thereof, of delinquency; provided, however, that
if such failure is due to reasonable cause, the city may waive or remit in
whole or in part these penalties.
   (C)   If the failure to pay is due to fraud or intent to evade this
subchapter and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, there shall be
added an additional penalty of 25% of the amount of the tax, exclusive of
penalties.

costs.

of a proper order in the cause, make provision for the regular payment of such
taxes as the same become due.

   (B)   If, on such petition and the proofs filed in support thereof, the
Finance Director shall be of the opinion that the tax, interest or penalty, or
any part thereof, was overpaid, he or she shall refund the same to the

exists an overpayment, he or she may institute against the taxpayer a
declaratory judgment proceeding in the Circuit Court of the county to ascertain

that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (F)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;
      (2)   That the offender post a sufficient bond to secure the payment for
all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed $5,000; and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
    (G)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (H)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

§ 135.06 JUVENILE JURISDICTION OF CIRCUIT COURTS, MAGISTRATE COURTS AND
MUNICIPAL COURTS; CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEES; HEARINGS; EVIDENCE AND
TRANSCRIPTS.
   (A)   The Circuit Court has original jurisdiction of proceedings brought
under this chapter.
   (B)   If during a criminal proceeding in any court it is ascertained or
appears that the defendant is under the age of 19 years and was under the age
of 18 years at the time of the alleged offense, the matter shall be immediately
certified to the juvenile jurisdiction of the Circuit Court. The Circuit Court
shall assume jurisdiction of the case in the same manner as cases which are
originally instituted in the Circuit Court by petition.
   (C)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, Magistrate Courts
have concurrent juvenile jurisdiction with the Circuit Court for a violation of
a traffic law of the state or for any violation of W.Va. Code §§ 20-1-1 et
seq.. Juveniles are liable for punishment for violations of these laws in the
same manner as adults except that Magistrate Courts have no jurisdiction to
impose a sentence of incarceration for the violation of these laws.
   (D)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, Municipal Courts
have concurrent juvenile jurisdiction with the Circuit Court for a violation of
any municipal ordinance regulating traffic or for any municipal curfew
ordinance which is enforceable. Municipal Courts may impose the same punishment
for these violations as a Circuit Court exercising its juvenile jurisdiction
could properly impose, except that Municipal Courts have no jurisdiction to
impose a sentence of incarceration for the violation of these laws.
   (E)   A juvenile may be brought before the Circuit Court for proceedings
under this chapter only by the following means:
      (1)   By a juvenile petition requesting that the juvenile be adjudicated
as a status offender or a juvenile delinquent; or
      (2)   By certification or transfer to the juvenile jurisdiction of the
Circuit Court from the criminal jurisdiction of the Circuit Court, from any
foreign court, or from any Magistrate Court or Municipal Court in the state.
   (F)   If a juvenile commits an act which would be a crime if committed by an
adult, and the juvenile is adjudicated delinquent for that act, the
jurisdiction of the court which adjudged the juvenile delinquent continues
until the juvenile becomes 21 years of age. The court has the same power over
that person that it had before he or she became an adult, and has the further
power to sentence that person to a term of incarceration; provided, that any
such term of incarceration may not exceed six months. This authority does not
preclude the court from exercising criminal jurisdiction over that person if he
or she violates the law after becoming an adult or if the proceedings have been
transferred to the court’s criminal jurisdiction pursuant to W.Va. Code § 49-4-
710.
   (G)   A juvenile is entitled to be admitted to bail or recognizance in the
same manner as an adult and shall be afforded the protection guaranteed by
Article III of the State Constitution.
   (H)   A juvenile has the right to be effectively represented by counsel at
all stages of proceedings under the provisions of this chapter. If the juvenile
or the juvenile’s parent or custodian executes an affidavit showing that the
juvenile cannot afford an attorney, the court shall appoint an attorney, who
shall be paid in accordance with W.Va. Code §§ 29-21-1 et seq.
   (I)   In all proceedings under this chapter, the juvenile shall be afforded
a meaningful opportunity to be heard. This includes the opportunity to testify
and to present and cross-examine witnesses. The general public shall be
excluded from all proceedings under this chapter except that persons whose
presence is requested by the parties and other persons whom the Circuit Court
determines have a legitimate interest in the proceedings may attend; provided,
that in cases in which a juvenile is accused of committing what would be a
felony if the juvenile were an adult, an alleged victim or his or her
representative may attend any related juvenile proceedings, at the discretion
of the presiding judicial officer; provided, however, that in any case in which
the alleged victim is a juvenile, he or she may be accompanied by his or her
parents or representative, at the discretion of the presiding judicial officer.
   (J)   At all adjudicatory hearings held under this chapter, all procedural
rights afforded to adults in criminal proceedings shall be afforded the
juvenile unless specifically provided otherwise in this chapter.
   (K)   At all adjudicatory hearings held under this chapter, the rules of
evidence applicable in criminal cases apply, including the rule against written
reports based upon hearsay.
   (L)   Except for res gestae, extrajudicial statements made by a juvenile who
has not attained 14 years of age to law enforcement officials or while in
custody are not admissible unless those statements were made in the presence of
the juvenile’s counsel. Except for res gestae, extrajudicial statements made by
a juvenile who has not attained 16 years of age but who is at least 13 years of
age to law enforcement officers or while in custody, are not admissible unless
made in the presence of the juvenile’s counsel or made in the presence of, and
with the consent of the juvenile’s parent or custodian, and the parent or
custodian has been fully informed regarding the juvenile’s right to a prompt
detention hearing, the juvenile’s right to counsel, including appointed counsel
if the juvenile cannot afford counsel, and the juvenile’s privilege against
self-incrimination.
   (M)   A transcript or recording shall be made of all transfer, adjudicatory
and dispositional hearings. At the conclusion of each of these hearings, the
Circuit Court shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law, both of which
shall appear on the record. The court reporter shall furnish a transcript of
the proceedings at no charge to any indigent juvenile who seeks review of any
proceeding under this chapter if an affidavit is filed stating that neither the
juvenile nor the juvenile’s parents or custodian have the ability to pay for
the transcript.

with prior written notice in the workplace that such act or acts may result in

product or tobacco-derived product; provided, that minors participating in the

the W.Va. Code § 29-3-23 specifies that each package containing toy paper or

upon when during the business registration year the sparklers and novelties
registration fee is paid or the sparklers and novelties registration
certificate becomes effective. Consequently, a business that wants to sell
sparklers and novelties after June 8, 1995, and after June 30, 1995, must pay a
$30 registration fee for a registration certificate covering the period June 9,
1995, through June 30, 1996.

sufficient time for the application to be received and processed by the
Department and for the registration certificate to be delivered, by mail, to
the applicant. The fee for a sparklers and novelties registration certificate
covering the period July 1, 1995, through June 30, 1996, is $15. (Renewals of
business registration certificates will be handled like they have been handled
in prior years.)

file Form 8.01, application for business registration, found at https://
tax.wv.gov/Documents/TaxForms/brt803.pdf, and an application for a sparklers

      (5)   If a business has two or more business locations in this state from

habitation or is unsafe, unsanitary, dangerous or detrimental to the public
welfare, the Commission shall enter an order requiring that such building be
closed or demolished, or in a proper case, setting forth such repairs as are
considered necessary in order to make the building reasonably suited for human
habitation, or to make it safe and sanitary and not dangerous or detrimental to
the public. The order shall fix a date when such work shall be begun and a date
for its completion, which latter date may, for cause, be extended. The owner
may within the time fixed in the order therefor notify the Commission of his or
her intention to comply with the order, in which case the work shall be done
under the supervision of the city building official. When the work has been
completed in accordance with the order of the Commission, an order shall be
entered approving the work and closing the case. If the owner shall fail to
proceed with the work in the manner or according to the schedule set forth in
the order, it shall be duty of the Commission to take the work in hand and
complete it as though the owner had never elected to perform it himself or
herself.
   (B)   If within the time provided in the order the owner fails to notify the
Commission of his or her election to do the work required, the Commission shall
proceed to have such work done, either by contract or by the purchase of
necessary material and the employment of workers and equipment.

is too great a threat. Typical CRITICAL FACILITIES include hospitals, fire
stations, police stations, storage of critical records and similar facilities.
These should be given special consideration when formulating regulatory
alternatives and floodplain management plans. A CRITICAL FACILITY should not be
located in a special flood hazard area if at all possible. If a CRITICAL
FACILITY must be located in a special flood hazard area it should be provided a
higher level of protection so that it can continue to function and provide
services during a flood.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
tilling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of

   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The official report in which the Federal Emergency
Management Agency has provided flood profiles, floodway information and water
surface elevations.
   FLOODPLAIN.
      (1)   A relatively flat or low land area adjoining a river, stream or
watercourse which is subject to partial or complete inundation; and
      (2)   An area subject to the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of
surface waters from any source.
   FLOOD PROOFING. Any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to
real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures and their contents.
   FLOODWAY. The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
area that must be reserved to discharge the base flood without increasing the
water surface elevation of that flood more than one foot at any point.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for purposes of floodplain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for
unknown factors that may contribute uncertainty to flood heights of any given
flood and floodway condition, such as wave action, blockage at stream crossings
and increased runoff from urbanization of the watershed. FREEBOARD also tends
to lower the cost of flood insurance.
   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE (HAG). The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface immediately adjacent to the development or structure foundation. This
is primarily used during insurance rating in approximated floodplains.
   HISTORIC STRUCTURE. Any structure that is:

Examiners of Land Surveyors to engage in the practice of land surveying as
defined in the West Virginia Code.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG). The lowest natural elevation of the ground
surface immediately adjacent to the proposed development or structure
foundation. The primary use of the LAG is to determine whether the structure is
located within a special flood hazard area by comparing it to the base flood
elevation.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished enclosure constructed with flood resistant materials
as defined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2-08 and usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is
not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure has
proper flood openings and is not built so as to render the structure in
violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.

licensed as a registered professional engineer by the State Board of
Registration for Professional Engineers as required under W.Va. Code Art. 30-13
et seq.
   REMEDY A VIOLATION. To bring a structure or other development into
compliance with the requirements of this chapter, or, if full compliance is not
possible, to reduce the adverse impacts of the noncompliance to the greatest
extent feasible.
   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA. The land in the floodplain subject to a 1% or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in flood insurance
studies and on flood insurance rate maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30 and A99.
This term shall also include areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are
specifically listed or otherwise described in this chapter.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the permit was issued, provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
ACTUAL START means either the first placement of permanent construction on a
site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond initial excavation, or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a permit must be
obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms,
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For an alteration, the ACTUAL START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STATE COORDINATING OFFICE. The West Virginia Division of Homeland Security
and Emergency Management
   STREAM. As defined in W.Va. Code § 7-1-3u, any watercourse, whether natural

through which water flows continually or intermittently, regardless of its
volume.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE also means cumulative flood-related damages sustained by a
structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost
of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds
25% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. See
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement.
      (2)   This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial
damage, as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
      (3)   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT as defined above, must comply with all
ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   For the purpose of this definition IMPROVEMENT is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
   TOP OF BANK. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each side of a
stream indicate the TOP OF BANK. In the field, a professional familiar with
fluvial geomorphology should document the TOP OF BANK. When a professional is
not employed, the TOP OF THE BANK may be considered to be the top of the first
significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at least
50 feet of relatively flat land.
   VIOLATION. The failure of any structure or development to be fully compliant
with all the requirements of this chapter. Any structure or other development
lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation certificate or
other evidence of compliance required by this chapter is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

below and shall be managed accordingly.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.036 DESCRIPTIONS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREAS.
   The identified special flood hazard area shall consist of the following four
specific areas.
   (A)   The floodway shall be those areas of AE zone identified as floodways
in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any floodway
areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and designated as
such by the community.
   (B)   The floodway fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which specific
100-year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS but which lie beyond
the floodway area.
   (C)   The AE area without floodway shall be those areas identified as an AE
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year flood
elevations have been provided but no floodway has been delineated.
   (D)   The approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no 100-year
flood elevations have been provided.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.037 CHANGES IN DESIGNATION OF AREA.
   (A)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the city where natural or human-made changes have occurred and/or
more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or individual
document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such change,
approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
   (B)   A city’s base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting from
physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practicable but, not
later than six months after the date such information becomes available, the
city shall notify the NFIP Administrator of the changes by submitting technical
or scientific data.
   (C)   The city may identify and regulate new local flood hazard or ponding
areas. These areas may be delineated on a local flood hazard map using best
available topographic data and locally derived information such as flood of
record, historic high water marks or approximate study methodologies.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.038 BOUNDARY DISPUTES.
   Should a dispute concerning the location of proposed development relative to
a special flood hazard area arise, an initial determination shall be made by
the Floodplain Administrator and any party aggrieved by this decision may
appeal to the city. The burden of proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.039 ELEVATIONS PREVAIL.
   Elevation data certified by a licensed professional surveyor or registered
professional engineer shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a
thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (A)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this chapter if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a letter of map amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest,
the applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the preferred risk policy should be
provided.
   (B)   (1)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either:
         (a)   The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study; or
         (b)   The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the
city in approximate floodplains.
      (2)   The proposed development shall then be required to conform to all
appropriate flood damage reduction provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA
§ 153.050 FLOODWAY.
   (A)   Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements or other development shall be permitted
unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed
encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the city
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering
study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations and the like shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (B)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters, the floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
      (2)   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
      (4)   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway has
been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development not
incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the city,
be determined to be the channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a
distance of one-half the width of the special flood hazard area as measured
from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland limit of the 1% annual
chance special flood hazard area boundary.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.051 FLOODWAY FRINGE.
   Within any floodway fringe area any development and/or use of land shall be
permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.052 AE WITHOUT FLOODWAY.
   Within any AE without floodway area, no new construction or development
shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the
proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the elevation of the 100-year flood more than
one foot at any point. This requirement can be satisfied by utilization of the
floodway where determined.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.053 APPROXIMATED FLOODPLAIN (ZONE A).
   Within any approximated floodplain:
   (A)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from federal, state or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding;
   (B)   (1)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed, all
proposed development to determine:
         (a)   The amount being invested; and
         (b)   The specific flood risk at the site.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator shall then require the applicant to
determine the elevation above which the development will be reasonably safe
from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other
techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall
only be undertaken by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that
the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations and the like shall be submitted in sufficient
detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.054 ALTERATION OR RELOCATION OF A STREAM.
   (A)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within the
special flood hazard area, the developer shall notify in writing, by certified
mail, the city, the Floodplain Administrator, the State Coordinating Office,
any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners of all such intended
activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the stream. Copies of all
required notifications must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA). In addition, prior to issuing the local permit the Floodplain
Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from those
governmental agencies from which federal or state law requires approval.
   (B)   (1)   The developer shall also assure the city in writing that the
flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the stream
will be maintained.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator may require the applicant to
demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will provide equal
or greater conveyance than the original stream segment.
      (3)   If hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only
be undertaken by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
      (4)   In addition, studies, analyses, computations and the like shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (C)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain “best practice” techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
   (D)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream crossings
shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this chapter.
   (E)   The developer is required to provide the city a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer this
agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in §
153.999.
   (F)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the flood
insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.

(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.067 ELEVATION AND FLOOD PROOFING INFORMATION.
   (A)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the elevation of the lowest floor above the
freeboard height required by this chapter.
   (B)   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information
shall also be included in the application for work within the special flood
hazard area.
      (1)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the base flood
elevation.
         (a)   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed;
         (b)   A determination of elevations of the base flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor;
         (c)   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures and the like. When required by the
Floodplain Administrator, a registered professional engineer or architect shall
prepare these plans;
         (d)   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas and the like) from flooding to two feet
above the base flood elevation at the building site;
         (e)   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error;
         (f)   A finished construction elevation certificate shall be prepared
by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications.
The elevation certificate shall confirm that the structure in question,
together with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit
conditions; and
         (g)   1.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the city determines that the area below the first floor could be
converted to a nonconforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below
base flood elevation that are five feet high or more). This agreement shall
state:
               a.   The area below base flood elevation shall not be converted
for use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this chapter; and
               b.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via

elevation (nonresidential structures only).
         (a)   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood
proofing requirements contained herein.
         (b)   Flood insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing
the level of flood proofing above the height required by this chapter. In order
to obtain an “elevation credited” flood insurance rate on dry flood proofed
buildings, flood proofing must extend at least one foot above the base flood
elevation:
            1.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared
by a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed
structure and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed;
            2.   A determination of elevations of the base flood, existing
ground, proposed finished ground, lowest floor and flood proofing limits;
certified by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor; and
            3.   A flood proofing certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in division (B)(2)(b)1. above, stating that the finished structure,

impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the base flood elevation; and
               b.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures and other factors associated with the base flood.
      (3)   For appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage (appurtenant structures
only).
         (a)   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         (b)   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must
be prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-08 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the base flood elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the base flood elevation; and
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided;
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         (c)   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in §
153.999.

§ 153.068 SITE PLAN CRITERIA.
   (A)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   (B)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites and
fills;
      (2)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section;
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two or five feet depending upon the slope of the land and identify
accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor shall certify the site
plan;
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the approximated
floodplain and which are greater than ten lots or two acres, whichever is the
lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and shall delineate a floodway
when directed to do so by the Floodplain Administrator.
         (a)   When a flood insurance study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
         (b)   If a FEMA flood insurance study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
         (c)   If the required data is not available from other sources, the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a flood insurance study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
      (5)   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
approximated floodplain area (Zone “A”) boundary depicted on the map,
development of detailed base flood elevation data may not be necessary. In
these cases the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at
intervals of two or five feet, depending on the slope, and clearly delineate
the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard boundary
area as scaled from the FEMA map. A registered professional engineer or
licensed professional surveyor shall certify the site plan.

chapter. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence of
this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a copy of all
new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to
transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in §
153.999.
   (D)   Recreational vehicle placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions; or
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
chapter.
   (E)   Fill. The city officially recognizes the beneficial functions the
floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during floods.
      (1)   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
      (2)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
      (3)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (4)   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of §
153.050. All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed
the following standards.
         (a)   1.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The city may require the applicant to
demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would not adversely
affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
shall be undertaken only by registered professional engineers who shall certify
that the technical methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical
concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed
by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic
terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations and the like shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
city.
            2.   During permit review the city shall consider the following
issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to adjacent properties:
               a.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights;
               b.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property;
               c.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing
structures;
               d.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems; and
               e.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         (b)   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         (c)   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid
ponding).
         (d)   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance
to provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally 15 feet beyond the building line from all points before the start of
sloping required in division (E)(4)(e) below. For nonresidential structures,
fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use. At grade
access, with fill extending laterally 15 feet beyond the building line shall be
provided to a minimum of 25% of the perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         (e)   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         (f)   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         (g)   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one vertical on two
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         (h)   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         (i)   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a letter of map revision
based on fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         (j)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (F)   Placement of structures and other development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater:
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow;
and
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (G)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the base flood elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (H)   Flood protection setback.
      (1)   A flood protection setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this division (H).
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the flood
protection setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the flood
protection setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (I)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below base flood elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this chapter, material that resembles “fill” material
shall not be considered “storage” material for purposes of this division (I).
   (J)   Utility and facility requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (K)   Drainage.
      (1)   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      (2)   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (L)   Backflow preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area.

(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.116 APPEAL REVIEW CRITERIA.
   (A)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative substantial
damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement or the freeboard
requirements may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals Board.
   (B)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this chapter shall
adhere to the following criteria.
      (1)   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the appeal would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of an appeal will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
      (2)   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
      (3)   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
      (4)   (a)   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over
the signature of a city official that:
            1.   The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a
structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance; and
            2.   Such construction below the base flood elevation increases
risk to life and property.
         (b)   Such notifications shall be maintained with a record of all
decisions as required in this division (B)(4).
      (5)   The Appeals Board shall:
         (a)   Maintain a record of all decisions including justification for
their issuance; and
         (b)   Report such decisions issued in its biannual report to the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).
      (6)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any construction,
development, use or activity within any floodway area that would cause any
increase in the base flood elevation.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
GOVERNMENT ACTIONS
§ 153.130 JURISDICTIONAL BOUNDARY CHANGES.
   (A)   The county floodplain ordinance in effect on the date of annexation
shall remain in effect and shall be enforced by the municipality for all
annexed areas until the municipality adopts and enforces an ordinance which
meets or exceeds the requirements for participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (B)   Municipalities with existing floodplain ordinances shall pass a
resolution acknowledging and accepting responsibility for enforcing floodplain
ordinance standards prior to annexation of any area containing identified flood
hazards.
   (C)   All plats or maps of annexation shall show the special flood hazard
area boundaries, base flood elevation and location of floodway where
determined.
   (D)   In accordance with 44 C.F.R. subpart (B), § 59.22(a)(9)(v) all NFIP
participating communities will notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) and the state coordinating office in writing whenever the boundaries of
the city have been modified by annexation or the city has otherwise assumed or
no longer has authority to adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations
for a particular area. In order that all flood insurance rate maps accurately
represent the city’s boundaries, a copy of a map of the city suitable for
reproduction, clearly delineating the new corporate limits or new area for
which the city has assumed or relinquished floodplain management regulatory
authority shall be included with the notification.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.131 PERMITS FOR GOVERNMENT ENTITIES.
   Unless specifically exempted by law, all public utilities and municipal,
county, state and federal entities are required to comply with this chapter and
obtain all necessary permits. Any entity claiming to be exempt from the
requirements of this chapter shall provide a written statement setting forth
the rationale for exemption. In addition the entity claiming exemption shall
provide copies of all relevant legal documentation demonstrating the exemption.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.132 LIABILITY.
   The granting of a permit or approval of a subdivision or development plan in
an identified flood prone area, shall not constitute a representation,
guarantee or warranty of any kind by the city, or by any official or employee
thereof of the practicability or safety of the proposed use, and shall create
no liability upon the city.
(Ord. passed 9-10-2012)
§ 153.999 PENALTY.
   Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the requirements or
provisions of this chapter or direction of the Floodplain Administrator, or any
other authorized employee of the city, shall be unlawful and shall be referred
to the prosecuting attorney who shall expeditiously prosecute all such
violators. A violator shall, upon conviction, pay a fine to the city of not
less than $50 or more than $500 plus cost of prosecution. In default of such
payment such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed ten days.
Each day during which any violation of this chapter continues shall constitute
a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this chapter. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or
noncompliance with, this chapter shall not excuse the violation or
noncompliance with the chapter or permit it to continue; and all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or noncompliance within
a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered
or relocated in noncompliance with this chapter may be declared by the City
Council to be a public nuisance and abatable as such.
