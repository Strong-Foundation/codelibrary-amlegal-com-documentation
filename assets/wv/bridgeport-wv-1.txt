EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in

PREAMBLE TO THE BRIDGEPORT CITY CHARTER
   Bridgeport became an incorporated community on March 21, 1887, many years
after having been carved out of the wilderness by our pioneer ancestors. From
humble beginnings, it has become a small city of 7,000 friendly people who take
pride in its growth, development, convenience and aesthetic values.
   It was the mission of the Charter Board, elected and empowered by the
citizens of Bridgeport at an election held June 3, 1992, to study and recommend
such improvements in the city government as may be deemed necessary.
   The study has identified the following two problem areas:
   1.    The lack of effective short and long term planning, as well as a lack
of continuity and consistency, are the result of the short and unstaggered
terms of the governing body.
   2.    City growth has created additional administrative needs in excess of
the response capacity of the administrative authority which meets regularly two
evenings per month. Inefficiencies result from the lack of access to an
effective central authority on a daily basis.
   The proposed charter contains the following remedies to the identified
problems:
   1.    Retain as the governing body, with longer staggered terms, the present
Council consisting of the Mayor, Recorder and 5 other members. The Council
shall have full legislative powers and be responsible for governmental policy
and citizen contacts.
   2.    Council shall be empowered and required to employ a Manager who is
responsible for all the administrative duties of city operations.
   In this charter we have provided for leadership of the city, as mandated by
the electorate, and a government which is accountable to the citizens it
represents, clearly delineating the duties, responsibilities and authorities,
of the administrative and legislative branches of the city's government.
   In the hope that we have fulfilled our mission and our obligation, we, the
Charter Board, have adopted and do propose to the electorate of the City of
Bridgeport, the following charter:
CHARTER OF
THE CITY Of BRIDGEPORT. WEST VIRGINIA
SECTION 1. INCORPORATION AND SUCCESSION.
   The inhabitants within the corporate boundaries of the City of Bridgeport,
as they now are or as they may hereafter be, shall be and continue to be a
municipal body politic and corporate by the name of the "The City of
Bridgeport" and as such shall have perpetual succession and shall succeed to
and own, possess and enjoy all property, rights, title and interests of every
kind and character owned or held by or vested in the City of Bridgeport, a
municipal corporation, at the time this charter becomes effective and shall be
subject to all existing debts, liabilities or obligations of said municipal
corporation.
SECTION 2. FORM OF GOVERNMENT.
   A "Manager-Mayor Plan", set forth as "Plan V" in Section 2 of Article
3 of Chapter 8 of the West Virginia Code 1931 as amended, is established as the
form of government for the City of Bridgeport. There shall be a Mayor elected
at large by the qualified voters of the City, as hereinafter provided, who
shall serve as a member and the presiding officer of the Council; and a Manager
who shall be appointed by the Council. The Council, Mayor and Recorder shall be
the governing body. The Manager shall be the administrative authority. The
Manager shall manage the affairs of the City under the supervision of the
Council and shall be responsible to the Council. The Manager shall appoint or
employ, in accordance with Chapter 8 of the West Virginia Code and this
Charter, all subordinates and employees for whose duties or work the Manager is
responsible to Council.
SECTION 3. POWERS OF THE CITY, SELF GOVERNMENT AND HOME RULE.
   The City of Bridgeport shall have each and every authority and power granted
to it by this Charter and any power and authority heretofore conferred on it by
the legislature by general, special or local law or parts thereof not
inconsistent with the constitution or general law of the State. The City of
Bridgeport shall also have all powers granted to municipalities under the
constitution and statutes of the State of West Virginia, including all powers
of local self government and home rule granted by Chapter 8 of the Code of West
Virginia, as amended, as well as any powers or authority fairly incidental
thereto or reasonably implied and within the purpose thereof, and all such
powers shall be executed in the manner prescribed by this Charter and if not
prescribed herein, in such manner as shall be provided by ordinance of
City Council.
SECTION 4. LEGISLATIVE POWER OF COUNCIL; QUALIFICATIONS, TERM OF OFFICE,
VACANCIES.
   All legislative powers of the City shall be vested, subject to the terms of
this Charter and the constitution of the State, in the Governing Body
consisting of five (5) Council members, the Mayor and Recorder, elected at
large. The Governing Body shall have authority to pass all ordinances necessary
and proper to carry into force and effect all of the powers of the City and to
fix from time to time the salaries of all City employees and officers,
including the Mayor, Manager, Recorder and members of Council: Provided, that
no elected officer's salary shall be increased during the term for which he or
she is elected. All members of Council shall be qualified voters of the City
and shall hold no other elected public office or be employed by the City.
Members of Council shall be elected for terms of four (4) years beginning on
the 1st day of July following their election, except that of the five members
of Council elected at the first election held under the provisions of this
Charter, the two receiving the smallest number of votes shall be elected for
terms of two (2) years. At each regular election thereafter either two or three
members of Council as the case may be, shall be elected to succeed the
incumbent members whose terms of office expire on the 30th day of June
following the election. The terms of office of all members of Council in office
on the date this Charter is adopted shall continue until the close of business
on the 30th day of June following the first election held hereunder.
   If any member of Council shall cease to be qualified as such, for any
reason, the office shall immediately become vacant. Any vacancy on Council
shall be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining members
of Council appointing a qualified person to fill the vacancy for the unexpired
term. If the vacancy is not filled within sixty (60) days by the affirmative
vote of the majority of the remaining members of Council, the Mayor shall
appoint a qualified person to fill the vacancy. A council member, including the
Mayor and Recorder, shall be subject to removal from office for neglect of duty
pursuant to West Virginia Code 6-6-7 if he (1) lacks at any time during his
term of office any qualification for the office prescribed by this Charter, (2)
violates any express prohibition of this Charter, (3) is convicted of a crime
involving moral turpitude, or (4) fails to attend three consecutive regular
meetings of the Council without being excused by the Council as reflected in
the minutes.
SECTION 5. MEETINGS OF COUNCIL; RULES OF PROCEDURE.
   Regular meetings of City Council shall be held at least twice a month.
Regular meetings of the City Council shall be held at 7:00 p.m. on the second
and fourth Tuesdays of each month or on such other days as Council may by
ordinance prescribe. Special meetings may be held at any time upon the call of
the Mayor or any three (3) members of Council or upon such notice as Council by
rule may prescribe. All meetings shall be open to the public. Four (4) members
of Council shall constitute a quorum and the Mayor and Recorder shall be
entitled to vote on all matters before Council. The Council may adopt such
rules, procedures or order of business as it deems appropriate from time to
time and in the absence of such rules adopted by Council, the proceedings of
Council shall be governed by the rules of parliamentary procedure contained in
Roberts' Rules of Order.
SECTION 6. ATTENDANCE AT COUNCIL MEETING REQUIRED FOR VOTING.
   No member of Council may vote on any matter before Council unless that
member is present at the time of the vote. No proxies or absentee votes shall
be permitted.
SECTION 7. SELECTION, POWERS AND DUTIES OF MAYOR.
   There shall be a Mayor elected at large by the qualified voters of the City
who shall serve as a member and the presiding officer of the Council and shall
perform such other duties as provided by this Charter or by law. The Mayor
shall serve for a term of four (4) years beginning on July 1st following his or
her election and continuing until June 30 following the next mayoral election.
Any vacancy in the office of Mayor shall be filled by appointment by the
remaining members of the Governing Body of one of its members to serve for the
unexpired term.
SECTION 8. DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE; MAYOR'S ADVISORY COMMISSION ON ECONOMIC AND
INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   The Mayor shall appoint and chair a Development Committee consisting of
three members of Council, including the Mayor, and two residents of the City.
The Development Committee shall consider and report annually to Council matters
related to economic development, the use of public buildings and real estate,
planning, zoning, housing and annexation.
SECTION 9. LIMITATION ON TERMS OF THE MAYOR.
   The Mayor shall be elected to not more than two consecutive terms: Provided,
that nothing herein shall be construed as preventing an incumbent Mayor from
election to a Council term following the end of the Mayor’s term.
SECTION 10. RECORDER.
   There shall be a Recorder elected at large by the qualified voters of the
City who shall serve as a member of the Council and shall keep the journal of
proceedings of the Council and have charge of and preserve the records of the
City. Whenever the Mayor is unable because of illness or absence from the
municipality to perform the duties of his office and during any vacancy in the
office of Mayor, the Recorder shall perform the duties of the Mayor and be
vested with all of his power and authority. The Recorder shall serve for a term
of four (4) years; provided however, that the Recorder elected at the first
election held hereunder shall serve for a term of two (2) years. Any vacancy in
the office of Recorder shall be filled by the affirmative vote of Council
appointing a qualified person to fill the vacancy for the unexpired term.
SECTION 11. OATHS OF MAYOR AND MEMBERS OF COUNCIL.
   The Mayor, Recorder, and all other members of Council, before entering upon
the duties of the office, shall make an oath or affirmation to support the
Constitutions of the United States and the State of West Virginia and to
discharge faithfully the duties of the office to the best of their skill and
judgment. This oath or affirmation must be before someone authorized to
administer oaths and shall be filed with the City Recorder.
SECTION 12. PERSONAL INTEREST OF MEMBERS OF THE GOVERNING BODY; EFFECT.
   Any member of the Governing Body having any interest, direct or indirect,
other than as a citizen of Bridgeport, in any matter to be acted upon in any
way by Council, shall have no vote on such matter, nor shall be privileged to
take part in the discussion thereof except by unanimous consent, and, upon the
request of any other member of the Governing Body, the member shall retire from
the session until such matter has been disposed of.
SECTION 13. APPOINTMENT, REMOVAL AND QUALIFICATIONS OF MANAGER.
   There shall be a Manager appointed by Council to serve at the pleasure of
Council: Provided, that the removal of the Manager shall require a vote of a
majority plus one of the members elected to Council: provided further, that, if
removed at any time after the Manager has served six months, the Manager may
demand written charges and the right to be heard thereon at a public meeting of
the Council prior to the date on which the final removal shall take effect; but
pending and during that hearing the Council may suspend the Manager from
office. The action of suspending or removing the Manager shall be final, it
being the intention of this Charter to vest all authority and fix all
responsibility for such suspension or removal in the Council. The Council may
designate some other officer of the City to perform the duties of the Manager
during the Manager's absence or disability. No person shall be eligible to the
office of Manager who has been convicted of bribery, perjury, a felony or other
infamous crime. The Manager shall be appointed by Council solely on the basis
of his executive and administrative qualifications, and he shall have at least
three (3) years experience as a manager or assistant manager in city or county
government, and shall hold at least a Bachelors Degree in a field reasonably
related to his duties. The Manager need not be a resident of the City or State
when appointed, but may be required by Council to reside within the City while
in office. Neither the Mayor nor any member of Council shall be chosen as
Manager. The performance of the Manager shall be reviewed by Council at least
semiannually.
SECTION 14. MANAGER, OATH, BOND.
   Before entering upon his duties, the Manager shall make an oath of
affirmation to support and defend the Constitution of the United States and of
this State and to perform the duties of the office faithfully, honestly and to
the best of the Manager's skill and judgment. This oath or affirmation must be
before someone authorized to administer oaths and shall be filed with the City
Recorder. Before entering upon the duties of the office, the Manager shall give
a good and sufficient bond, payable to the City in such amount as may be
prescribed by Council but not less than ten thousand dollars, conditioned upon
the faithful performance of the Manager's duties, and with a corporate surety
authorized to do business within the State; and such bond shall be filed with
the City Recorder after being approved as to form and surety by a judge of the
Circuit Court of Harrison County. The premium on such bond shall be payable by
the City.
SECTION 15. MANAGER, POWERS AND DUTIES GENERALLY.
   It shall be the duty of the Manager unless otherwise specifically provided
in this Charter; to supervise the administration of the affairs of the City; to
see that the orders, bylaws, ordinances, acts and resolutions of the Council
thereof are faithfully executed and enforced; and to see that the laws of the
State are enforced within the corporate limits of the City. The Manager shall
be an ex officio member of all committees of Council. It shall also be the duty
of the Manager to make all appointments and removals in the administrative and
executive services, except as otherwise provided in this Charter, and those
appointments and removals shall be made exclusively by the Manager without the
consultation, advice or approval of the Council or any member thereof; to
recommend from time to time to the Council such measures as the Manager may
deem necessary for the welfare of the City; to keep the Council advised of the
financial condition and future needs of the City; to prepare and submit to the
Council the annual budget estimate; to prepare and submit to the Council such
reports as may be required by that body, and to perform such other duties as
may be prescribed by this Charter or required by ordinance or resolution of the
Council. The Manager shall determine the needs and prepare, in consultation
with City department heads, a long range plan, extending two, five, and ten
years, setting forth the capital expenditures which are needed to enhance the
growth, prosperity and future development of the City and the improvement and
development of its facilities, suggesting funding sources to acquire the same.
The Manager shall report his findings to Council prior to submission of the
annual budget. The Manager shall be responsible to Council for the proper
administration of the affairs of the City by the Manager's subordinates. Except
as otherwise provided in this Charter, all other executive and administrative
powers conferred by the laws of the State upon any municipal official shall be
exercised by the Manager or persons designated by the Manager. The Manager
shall be vested with discretion in the performance of his duties, and shall not
be subject to direction or control by any member of the Council or any other
person or persons. The Manager shall have the power to remove any officer whom
he may appoint, or any employee of the City for whose duties or work the
Manager is responsible, unless otherwise provided in this Charter; Provided,
however, that the Manager may exercise this power only with the consent of
Council during the first six (6) months of his employment.
SECTION 16. MANAGER CONTRACTS; RATIFICATION.
   The Manager shall negotiate and enter into all contracts upon behalf of the
City except as otherwise provided in this Charter or by ordinance. Such
contracts to be negotiated and entered into by the Manager shall be within the
limits of the budget, as determined by the purpose and subject matters of the
contracts. If any such contract involves the expenditure of more than
$5,000.00, or the performance thereof extends beyond the budget year, or
involves the expenditure of money not within the budget, such contract must be
ratified by Council. The Manager shall report in writing to Council any
negotiations and the terms of the contracts requiring their ratification, and
the Council may in such cases alter, amend, ratify or reject any such contract.
Any contract executed by the Manager on behalf of the City in violation of the
terms of this section shall not be binding upon the City.
SECTION 17. EXECUTIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICIALS; QUALIFICATIONS, BOND.
   The duties assigned to administrative officers shall be exercised under the
supervision of the Manager. In all cases required by ordinance or in which the
Manager may deem it advisable, the Manager shall take, of any person appointed,
a bond payable to the City of Bridgeport. Such bond shall be conditioned on the
faithful performance of the person's duties and in such amount as the Manager
shall deem requisite. Such bonds shall be filed with the Director of Finance.
No person shall be appointed in the executive or administrative services of the
City who has been convicted of bribery, perjury, felony or other infamous
crime. Residence within the City at the time of such appointment shall not be a
necessary qualification for appointment unless the Constitution of the State
shall provide otherwise. If the Manager or any other officer of the City shall
be a member, manager, officer or stockholder of any partnership, business, firm
or corporation, which by contract furnished material and supplies to the City
or to any workman or contractor for the City, that shall not of itself
constitute a disqualification for office under this Charter.
SECTION 18. COUNCIL SEATS FOR CITY OFFICERS; RIGHTS.
   The Manager and such other officers of the City as may be designated by vote
of Council shall be entitled to seats in Council Chambers. None of those
officials shall have a vote, but the Manager shall have the right to discuss
any matter coming before the Council and the other officers shall be entitled
to discuss any matter before the Council relating to their respective
departments and offices.
SECTION 19. ELECTIONS.
   A special City election of the Mayor, Recorder and members of Council shall
be held on June 8, 1993. Regular City elections shall be held on the second
Tuesday of June, 1995, and the second Tuesday of June of each odd year
thereafter.
   The conduct of all municipal elections shall be integrated with the system
of “permanent registration of voters,” and those provisions of Chapter Three of
the West Virginia Code that integrate county-state elections with the
“permanent registration system” are hereby incorporated by reference, to the
extent reasonably applicable.
   Except as otherwise provided herein, the provisions of general law with
respect to the method and time for the filing of certificates of candidacy,
conducting elections, and determining and certifying the results of such
elections, shall apply to City elections.
   All City elections shall be nonpartisan. Any person who is eligible to hold
and seeks to hold the office of Mayor, Recorder, or member of Council shall
file with the City Recorder at least sixty (60) days before the election, a
certificate declaring candidacy for such office, accompanied by the $25.00
filing fee, which certificate shall be in form and effect as follows:

candidate for the office of [Mayor, Recorder, or member of Council] of the City
of Bridgeport, and desire my name to be printed on the official ballot of the

SECTION 20. RECALL OF MAYOR, RECORDER OR MEMBER OF COUNCIL.
   The Mayor, Recorder or any member of Council may be removed from office by
the following procedure: a petition signed by at least ten percent of the
qualified voters of the City shall be filed with the Recorder, which petition
shall contain a general statement of the grounds for which the removal is
sought. The petition shall be accompanied by a bond in an amount determined by
the Recorder to equal the cost of the recall election with sufficient surety
condition to pay the cost of the recall election if majority of the legal votes
cast are against the recall. Such petition and bond shall be submitted to,
examined and certified by the Recorder, and if such petition be deemed
sufficient by the Recorder, the Recorder shall certify the same to the City
Council without delay. Upon receipt of such petition the Council shall order
and fix a date for holding a special recall election, not less than thirty days
nor more than fifty days from the date of the Recorder's certificate. The
Council shall publish notice of the election once a week for three successive
weeks in two newspapers of general circulation in the City. The ballot for such
recall election shall be substantially of the following form and effect:
OFFICIAL BALLOT

   Should a majority of the votes cast be in favor of recall the person
recalled shall forthwith forfeit his office and the Council shall, at its next
meeting following the recall election, appoint a successor to such office for

accordance with law and upon display of proper identification, at any
reasonable time in pursuance of such duties; provided, that this section shall

123.04 AUTHORITY OF DEPUTIES, ASSISTANTS AND ACTING CITY OFFICERS AND

(1976 Code Sec. 2-12)
123.05 OFFICERS AND EMPLOYEES RELATIONSHIP WITH PUBLIC.
   (a)   City officers and employees shall be courteous in their official
transactions with the public, and they shall conduct themselves in the

at the time and under the circumstances then existing, of any lawful right or
benefit to which such person may be entitled. Any person who feels aggrieved by
the conduct of any City officer or employee in violation of this subsection is

employee's department head or to the Manager without prejudice to any other
recourse to which such aggrieved person may be entitled.
   (b)   Members of the public, in turn, should be courteous in their
transactions with City officers and employees, and it shall be unlawful for any

while such City officer or employee is lawfully engaged in the performance of
official duty. (1976 Code Sec. 13-11)
123.06 CODE IMPOSES NO LIABILITY FOR ACTS OR OMISSIONS PURSUANT THERETO.
   (a)   Nothing in the Codified Ordinances or any other ordinance or
resolution of the City shall be construed to impose any liability upon the City

such act or omission is otherwise lawful, in good faith, and without malice or
mischievous intent and, in the case of any City officer or employee, is in line
of duty and within the scope of his authority.
   (b)   It shall be the duty of Council to provide for the defense of City
officers and employees against all claims, demands, actions, suits,
prosecutions and other proceedings brought against them for their acts or
omissions while acting in line of duty and within the purview of subsection (a)
of this section. (1976 Code Sec. 1-8)
123.07 INDEMNIFICATION OF PUBLIC OFFICERS.
   (a)   The City shall indemnify and hold harmless each person who shall serve
at any time hereafter as Mayor, Recorder, member of Council or public officer
thereof from and against any and all claims and liabilities to which such
person shall become subject by reason of his having heretofore or hereafter
been Mayor, Recorder, member of Council or public officer of the City or by
reason of any action alleged to have been heretofore or hereafter taken or
omitted by him as such Mayor, Recorder, member of Council or public officer.
   (b)   The City shall reimburse each such person for all legal and other
expenses reasonably incurred by him in connection with any claim or liability,
including the deductible under any insurance policy insuring against officers
and directors of public officials' liability; provided, however, that no such
person shall be indemnified against any expense incurred in connection with any
claim arising out of his own willful misconduct.
   (c)   All rights accruing to any person under the provisions of this section
shall not exclude any other right to which he may be lawfully entitled nor
shall anything herein contained restrict the right of the City to indemnify or
reimburse such person in any proper case even though not specifically herein
provided. (2-11-86)
123.08 FINANCIAL PROCEDURES.
   (a)   Generally. No money shall be drawn from the Treasury of the City, nor
shall any obligation for the expenditure of money by the City be incurred by
any officer, board or commission authorized to expend City money, except
pursuant to an appropriation and the allotment thereof. All fees received by
all City officers or employees in connection with their official duties shall
be accounted for and paid into the City treasury.
   (b)   Budget Process. The General Fund and Coal Severance Tax budget process
for the City of Bridgeport shall begin in January. At this time, each
Department Director shall be requested to prepare a detailed budget request for
his or her department. In this process, each line item should be analyzed to
determine if the budget amount needs to be increased or decreased from the
previous year’s budget. A number of factors must be considered when this is
done including inflation, increase or decrease in the work force, utility rate
increases as well as new requests.
      (1)   By the second council meeting in March, proposed balanced budgets
for the General Fund and the Coal Severance Tax Fund shall be presented to City
Council and formally acted upon. The budgets shall be put in the proper format
for submission to the WV State Auditor’s Office.
      (2)   The Water, Sewer and Cemetery fund budgets shall be prepared after
the completion of the General Fund budget process. The same prudence will be
necessary in the preparation of these budgets; however, the same time
constraints will not be in effect. These budgets shall be prepared by their
Department Directors and given to the Finance Director for compilation.
Balanced budgets shall be approved by the appropriate governing body.
   (c)   Budget Revisions. There are two types of budget revisions used by the
City of Bridgeport.
      (1)   Internal Budget Revisions. These revisions shall be prepared when
funds are transferred between accounts within the same department. They shall
be requested by the Department Director and approved by the Director of Finance
and the City Manager. When final approval is received, the revision shall be
posted to the accounts and the Department Director shall be notified. These
revisions should not be used for new purchases. The City Manager shall have the
power and authority to make line item revisions within departments in the
General budget and line item revisions in the Water Fund budget, the Sewer Fund
budget and the Cemetery budget. This authority shall extend only to line item
revisions within departments and within funds and shall not be construed to
delegate authority to transfer items from one department to another or to
budget additional revenues or contingency funds.
      (2)   Formal Budget Revisions. These revisions shall be necessary when
additional funds are needed. The funds shall be taken from Contingency,
additional revenues, or reduced expenditures in other departments. These
revisions shall require City Council and W.V. State Auditor’s Office approval.
Requests shall be given to the City Manager who will forward them to the
Finance Department for compilation. The revision shall be approved by City
Council, and then forwarded to the WV State Auditor’s Office. When their
approval is received, the revision shall be posted and the Department Director
shall be notified. These funds shall not be spent or encumbered until final WV
State Auditor’s Office approval is received.
   (d)   Contracts for Expenditures. No office, department, board, commission
or other agency of the City shall during any fiscal year expend, or contract to
expend, any money or incur any liability, or enter into any contract for any
purpose in excess of the amounts appropriated or allotted; and no such payment
shall be made nor any obligation or liability incurred unless the Director or
Finance shall first certify that unencumbered or unappropriated funds for the
designated purpose are available by signing an approved purchase order. This
approved purchase order shall be obtained prior to the signing of any contract.
Any contract, verbal or written made in violation of this section shall be null
and void, and if any officer, agent or employee of the City shall knowingly or
willfully violate this provision, such action may be cause for his or her
removal from office. Nothing in this section shall prevent the making of
contracts or leases providing for the payment of funds at a time beyond the
fiscal year in which such contracts are made if the funds have been previously
appropriated, provided, that the nature of such transactions conforms to the
Constitution of the State, the Charter of the City and the general law of the
State.
   The City Manager shall negotiate and enter into all contracts upon behalf of
the City, except as otherwise provided in the Charter or by ordinance. Such
contracts to be negotiated and entered into by the Manager shall be within the
limits of the budget, as determined by the purpose and subject matters of the
contracts. If any such contract involves the expenditure of more than five
thousand dollars ($5,000), or the performance thereof extends beyond the budget
year, or involves the expenditure of money not within the budget, such contract
shall be ratified by Council. However, in any event, all contracts entered into
must comply with federal, state and city regulations. The Manager shall report
in writing to Council any negotiations and the terms of the contract requiring
their ratification, and the Council may in such cases alter, amend, ratify or
reject any such contract. Any contract executed by the Manager on behalf of the
City in violation of the terms of this section shall not be binding upon the
City.
   (e)   Capital Reserve Fund. The following policies will be utilized in the
future to administer these funds.
      (1)   Monies budgeted from General, Water or Sewer Funds shall only be
transferred to the Capital Reserve Fund when funding for the project is going
to be escrowed for more than one year.
      (2)   If, at any time, it is determined that there are excess monies in
the General, Water or Sewer Fund Transfer to Capital Reserve accounts in excess
of what is needed to complete the project, only the amount required will be
transferred to the Capital Reserve Fund. The balance of these funds shall
remain in the appropriate line items, and can only be utilized with further
appropriation from Council.
      (3)   When a project is completed in the Capital Reserve Fund, any
remaining balances in project budgets or contingencies shall be transferred at
the end of the fiscal year back to the appropriate account in the General,
Water or Sewer Funds which will increase their fund balance. These funds may be
re-appropriated by the governing body at a future time.
   (f)   Rainy Day Fund. The Rainy Day Fund may receive appropriations, gifts,
and grants from any other funds made available. This account may be funded over
a period of years up to the maximum level of thirty percent (30%) of the City’s
operating budget. These funds may be used to cover the General Fund’s short
falls; and any other purpose the governing body considers appropriate. It is
the goal of City Council to set aside a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the
General Fund, fund balance each year into this account and a minimum of twenty-
five percent (25%) of Business and Occupation tax on construction on any
federal or state contract or any construction project with a value of over one
million dollars.
   (g)   Banking, Investment and Purchasing Procedures. Due to the changing
nature of banking and investments, a Finance Committee is hereby established
and shall consist of the Mayor, City Manager and the Director of Finance. This
committee shall have the sole authority to select banking and other financial
institutions to provide services relating to the management of the City’s
resources in accordance with the Short and Long Term Investment Policies
previously established by the Finance Committee. The committee is also
responsible for establishing purchasing and bidding procedures and to establish
and amend the Financial Policies and Procedures Manual.

   (b)   The City shall pay a benefit which, together with Worker's
Compensation payable for the same period, will equal normal earnings during the

leave shall not be charged. After an employee has used up his ninety-day

he has accumulated sick leave. The City shall supplement Worker's Compensation
wages and benefits one calendar day for each day of accumulated sick leave
acquired prior to the accident which caused the Worker's Compensation claim.
   After return to work an employee may be reinstated to the ninety-day
supplement after working for a period of one year without being absent for
Worker's Compensation claim injury.
   Existing employees who have used up their 120 days as of the effective date

   Except as may be provided otherwise in any case by State law, the Codified
Ordinances, or other ordinance, whenever any person is arrested for any
violation of an ordinance of the City or for any offense of which the Municipal
Judge has jurisdiction, the Municipal Judge, Recorder, Municipal Court Clerk,
Chief of Police and the Desk Sergeant or person in charge of Police
Headquarters may admit such person to bail upon the execution of a bond to the
City in such an amount, not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more
than the maximum fine which may be adjudged against such person for the offense
or offenses he is alleged to have committed plus the costs which could be
assessed against him, as in the discretion of the officer will secure the
prisoner's presence, conditioned that the accused will appear upon a day named,
before the Municipal Judge of the City, to await trial. Every such bond taken
shall be filed as soon as practicable with the Municipal Court by the officer
approving and taking such bond. The Municipal Judge, Recorder, Municipal Court
Clerk, Chief of Police and the Desk Sergeant or person in charge of Police
Headquarters shall each have the power to approve any bond taken under the
provisions of this section, precedence being given to the ranking officer
present when such bond is presented. No person shall be accepted as surety upon
any penal bond unless he shall acknowledge the bond before some official duly
authorized by the Codified Ordinances or by State law to administer an oath,
and shall make oath that he is the owner in fee of real estate situated in the
County and worth the amount of the bond over and above his debts and
liabilities; but the officers hereinbefore named in this section are hereby
authorized and empowered to accept a deposit in cash of an amount, not less
than the minimum nor more than the maximum hereinbefore specified for a bond,
which, in the judgment of the officer accepting the deposit, will be sufficient
to cause the prisoner's appearance upon the day required of him before the
Municipal Judge to await trial upon the charge against him. In the event any
person so released upon bond or such deposit shall fail to appear before the
Municipal Judge for trial at the appointing time, or, having appeared, shall
leave the court without awaiting trial, his bond shall be forfeited thereby to
the City, and if a cash deposit has been made to secure his release, the sum so
deposited shall be delivered to the Municipal Judge and by him promptly turned
into the City Treasury to the credit of the General Fund and accounted for by
him in the same manner that fines collected by him are counted for; and in the
event of the forfeiture of a penal bond, the Director of Finance shall
forthwith take the steps necessary at law for the collection thereof.
(1976 Code Sec. 11-13)
171.12 REQUISITES AND DISPOSITION OF CASH DEPOSITS.
   No cash bond shall be accepted by any officer authorized to accept such bond
unless the prisoner and the officer authorized to accept it are present at
Police Headquarters. The money deposited as security for any person's
appearance shall be deposited with the Desk Sergeant at Police Headquarters, to
be safely kept until the next regular session of the Municipal Court, when it
shall be turned over by the Desk Sergeant who received it to the Judge of the
Municipal Court, and by the Judge disposed of as required by the bond and this
and the preceeding section.
(1976 Code Sec. 11-14)
171.13 UNAUTHORIZED ACCEPTANCE OF CASH BOND; APPROVAL IN FELONY CASES.
   If any officer shall accept or approve any cash bond at any place or in any
other manner than is provided for and authorized by this article, such
unauthorized acceptance or approval shall constitute good cause for his
suspension or removal or the reprimand or fining of such officer after a
hearing on the charge by Council. In case of the arrest of any person upon a
charge of a felony, the bond for his release, if approved, shall only be
approved by the Municipal Judge, or the judge of a court having jurisdiction to
try the prisoner for the felony alleged to have been committed by him.
(1976 Code Sec. 11-15)
171.14 PERSONS PROHIBITED TO BE SURETY ON BAIL BONDS.
   No practicing attorney, officer of the Municipal Court or member of the
Police Department shall be accepted as surety on any bond provided for in this
article.
(1976 Code Sec. 11-16)
171.15 METHOD OF PAYMENT WHEN DEFENDANT UNABLE TO PAY.
   Whenever a person is convicted in the Municipal Court of a violation of the
Codified Ordinances or other ordinance or any rule, regulation, notice or order
promulgated pursuant to authority thereof, and such person is sentenced to pay
a fine, and it shall appear to the Court on its own motion or on motion of the
defendant that such defendant is unable to pay such fine forthwith, the Court
may order the defendant to pay such fine and any costs which the defendant may
be required to pay in installments or upon such other terms and conditions or
within such period of time as may enable the defendant to pay such fine and
costs.
(1976 Code Sec. 11-17)
171.16 DETERMINATION OF ABILITY TO PAY.
   (a)   In determining whether a defendant is unable to pay a fine forthwith,
the Municipal Court may require such defendant to file a petition, under oath,
with the Court, upon a form provided by the Court, setting forth the financial
condition of the defendant.
 
   (b)   Such form shall be a questionnaire, and shall include, but shall not
be limited to: the name and residence of the defendant; his occupation, if any;
his family status and the number of persons dependent upon him; his monthly
income; whether or not his dependants are employed and, if so, their
approximate monthly income; his banking accounts, if any; real estate owned by
the defendant, or any interest he may have in real estate; income produced
therefrom; any independent income accruing to the defendant; tangible and
intangible personal property owned by the defendant, or in which he may have an
interest; and a statement listing the approximate indebtedness of the defendant
to other persons. Such form shall also include a payment plan of the defendant,
if the Court should exercise its discretion in permitting the payment of such
fine and costs in installments or other conditions to be fixed by the Court. At
the end of such form there shall be printed in boldface type, in a distinctive
color the following: "THIS STATEMENT IS MADE UNDER OATH. ANY FALSE STATEMENT OF
A MATERIAL FACT TO ANY QUESTION CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL CONSTITUTE FALSE
SWEARING AND SHALL BE AN OFFENSE AGAINST THIS SECTION. THE MAXIMUM PENALTY IS
$100 FINE OR THIRTY DAYS IN JAIL, OR BOTH." A copy of the petition shall be
retained by the defendant.
 
   (c)   If the defendant is unable to read or write, the Court or the Clerk,
may assist the defendant in completing the petition and require him to affix
his mark thereto. The consequences of the making of a false statement shall be
explained to such defendant.
(1976 Code Sec. 11-18)
171.17 PAYMENT MAY BE CONDITION OF PROBATION OR SUSPENSION OF SENTENCE.
   If a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine and payment of the fine and/or
costs is ordered to be made on an installment basis or on other conditions
under the provisions of Section
171.15, and if the defendant is also placed on probation or imposition of the
execution of sentence is suspended, the Municipal Court may make payment of the
fine a condition of probation or suspension of sentence. (1976 Code Sec. 11-19)
171.18 GOOD BEHAVIOR UNTIL FINE AND COSTS ARE PAID.
   If a defendant is permitted to pay a fine and/or costs on an installment
basis, or under such other conditions as the Municipal Court shall fix under
the provisions of Section
171.15, the Court may require as a condition that the defendant be of peace and
good behavior until the fine and costs are paid.
(1976 Code Sec. 11-20)
171.19 PROCEDURE UPON DEFAULT IN PAYMENT UNDER AGREEMENT.
   When any person sentenced to pay a fine defaults in the payment of any such
fine or of any installment thereof, the Municipal Court may issue a summons for
such person to appear before the Court for a hearing on the question of whether
such person's failure to pay the fine or any installment was attributable to
intentional refusal to comply with the prior order of the Court or to a lack of
a good faith effort to comply therewith. The Court may, after hearing, order
that the person in default be allowed additional time for payment, may reduce
or remit the amount of the fine or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in
part, or upon a finding that the default was intentional or due to the lack of
a good faith effort to comply with the prior order of the Court, may order such
person confined for such period up to thirty days as the Court in its
discretion shall determine.
(1976 Code Sec. 11-21)
171.20 MUNICIPAL COURT COSTS.
   In addition to any other costs which may be lawfully imposed, an additional
cost shall be imposed in the amount of thirty dollars ($30.00) for all charges,
except violations of municipal parking violations.
(Ord. 06-10. Passed 10-25-10.)
171.21 REINSTATEMENT FEES; DRIVER'S LICENSE.
   A fee of fifty dollars ($50.00) is hereby imposed upon any person whose
driver's license or privilege to operate a motor vehicle in this State is
reinstated after having been suspended for any of the following:
   (a)   Failure to timely pay costs, fines, forfeitures or penalties imposed
by the Municipal Court;
   (b)   Default on a payment plan for such costs, fines, forfeitures or
penalties; or
   (c)   Failure to appear or otherwise respond in court when charged with a
municipal violation, all as provided for by the West Virginia Code.
   The fee imposed by this section shall be paid at the time the person's
driver's license or privilege to drive is reinstated by the State Division of
Motor Vehicles. Such fee is imposed to defer the costs to the City associated
with administrative expenses related to the suspension and reinstatement.

for an offense as described in subsection (b) of this section and the
subsection creating the offense requires a period of incarceration, period of
license revocation, or fine that is greater than what is required for a
conviction under this subsection, the greater period of incarceration, period
of revocation, or fine shall be imposed: provided, however, that this section
does not apply to a second conviction that is subject to a period of license
revocation under subsection (h) of this section.
   (k)   For purposes of subsection (j) of this section relating to second
offenses, the following events shall be regarded as offenses and convictions
under this section:
      (1)   Any conviction under the provisions of subsection (b), (c), (d),
(e), (f) or (g), of this section, or under a prior enactment of this section,
for an offense which occurred within the 10-year period immediately preceding
the date of arrest in the current proceeding;
      (2)   Any conviction under a municipal ordinance of this state or any
other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state of an
offense which has the same elements as an offense described in subsection (b),
(c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) of this section, which offense occurred within the
10-year period immediately preceding the date of arrest in the current
proceeding; and
      (3)   Any period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b for violation of subsection (c) of this section, which
violation occurred within the 10-year period immediately preceding the date of
arrest in the current proceeding.
   (l)   A person may be charged in a warrant, indictment, or information for a
second or subsequent offense, as described in subsection (h) or (j) of this
section, if the person has been previously arrested for, or charged with, a
violation of this section which is alleged to have occurred within the
applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No
person may be convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this section

(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described

this section.
   (n)   The sentences provided in this section upon conviction for a violation
of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:

impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b
to persons adjudicated thereunder. An order for home detention by the court
pursuant to the provisions of West Virginia Code 62-11B-1 et seq. may be used
as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation
of this section, electronic monitoring shall be included for no fewer than ten
days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not
leave home for those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.

permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the
order to the Commissioner of the Division of Motor Vehicles.

         A.   The person pleads to or is found guilty of the offense defined in
Section
333.01(c);
         B.   The person has not previously been convicted of any offense under
this article or under any statute of the United States or of any state relating
to driving under the influence of alcohol, any controlled substance, or any
other drug; and
         C.   The person notifies the court within thirty days of his or her
arrest of his or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If all the requirements in subsection (a)(1) hereof are met, the
court, without entering a judgment of guilt, shall defer further proceedings
and place the person on probation, the conditions of which shall include that
he or she successfully completes the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock
Program as provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. Participation therein
shall be for a period of at least 165 days after a fifteen-day suspension of
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle and shall be completed within one
year thereafter.
   
   (b)   (1)   If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (c) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)   A motion alleging a violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)(1)
hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable time
after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant’s right to a speedy trial under any
applicable federal or state constitutional provisions, statutes, or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (c)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program and complied with its conditions, the
defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within thirty days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant’s attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the thirty-day period, the court shall thereafter
dismiss the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with
regard to the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in
subsection (b) hereof.
   (d)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection is convicted of a subsequent violation of Section
 333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5, discharge and dismissal under this section
shall be without adjudication of guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of
disqualifications or disabilities imposed by law upon conviction of a crime,
except for those provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-1 et seq. Except as
provided in Section
 333.01 regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal and
discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the status
he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a dismissal
and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be guilty of
perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by reason of his
or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or trial in
response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than any
inquiry made in connection with any subsequent offense as provided in Section
333.01.
   (e)   There may be only one discharge and dismissal under this section with
respect to any person.
   (f)   No person shall be eligible for dismissal and discharge under this
section:

 333.01 or West Virginia Code 17C-5 has been charged;
      (2)    If the person holders a commercial driver’s license or operates
commercial motor vehicles;

motor vehicle revoked for any offense under a municipal ordinance of this state
or any other state or a statute of the United States or of any other state
which has the same elements as an offense described in this article; or
      (4)    If a court entered an order finding that the person refused the
secondary chemical test pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-7a.
   (g)   (1)   After a period of not less than one year, which shall begin to
run immediately upon the expiration of a term of probation imposed upon any
person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge all official records of his or her arrest, trial, and conviction,
pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the Division of Motor
Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been convicted of a
felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within thirty days after service of a
motion for expungement, and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant’s attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.

vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the

scene. The owner or operator of such vehicle in the case of an impounded
vehicle, shall be responsible for all costs of such impounding.

occupant or other person in charge of the premises within three days after
written notice of removal. Upon failure to comply with such notice, the City
may cause the obstruction to be removed and the owner, occupant or other person
in charge of the premises shall pay the cost of such removal.
   (f)   Notice of Lane Designation; Appeal. Whenever the Chief of the Fire
Department designates a fire lane, written notice thereof shall be given to the
owner, occupant or person in charge of the premises. Such designation may be
appealed within ten days by filing a written objection to such designation with

367.01 LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS; STATEMENT OF POLICY.
   Council recognizes and declares that abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor
vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative household
appliances are and constitute a public nuisance and hazard to both adults and
children and therefore are dangerous and constitute a clear and present danger;
that such abandoned motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires
and certain abandoned or inoperative household appliances serve as harborage
and breeding places for rodents, mosquitoes, fleas, ticks, mice, rats and other
insects, pests and flies injurious to the public health, safety and general
welfare; that abandoned motor vehicles and junked motor vehicles serve
frequently as temporary or permanent places of human residence unconducive to
public health, safety and welfare; that the accumulation and storage of any of
such items or parts thereof on private or public property, including but not
limited to highways, is hereby found to create a condition tending to reduce
the value of private property and to promote blight and deterioration which if
permitted to remain will continue to destroy the natural beauty of the City and
have adverse economic and social effects; that such abandoned motor vehicles,
junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or inoperative
household appliances constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the
health and safety of minors; that such items are nearly always located on
public highways, rights of way, or within sight of such highway rights of way
and on private property within a reasonable proximity thereto; that all such
visual pollution is a deterrent to economic development; and that it is in the
public interest and welfare to provide for a program to eliminate the unsightly
practice of abandoning motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned
or inoperative household appliances.
   In view of these findings, Council declares it to be the public policy of
the City to eliminate the present danger resulting from abandoned motor
vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned or
inoperative household appliances and to eliminate the visual pollution
resulting from these items, and that in order to provide for the public health,
safety and welfare, and quality of life, to enact legislation to that end by
providing expeditious means and methods for effecting the disposal of abandoned
motor vehicles, junked motor vehicles, old vehicle tires and certain abandoned
household appliances. Council further finds and declares that the presence of
an abandoned motor vehicle, junked motor vehicle, old vehicle tire or an
abandoned or inoperative household appliance, or any part thereof, on private
or public property, including but not limited to highways, except as expressly
hereinafter permitted, is a public nuisance injurious to the public health,
safety and general welfare of the residents of the City which shall be abated
as such by the methods provided in this article. (1976 Code Sec. 18-109)

licensed salvage yard or demolisher. The purchaser of such motor vehicle shall
take title to such motor vehicle free and clear of all liens and claims of
ownership, and shall receive a sales receipt from the Police Department. The
sales receipt at such sale shall be sufficient title only for purposes of
transferring such motor vehicle to a licensed salvage yard or to a demolisher
for demolition, wrecking or dismantling, and no further titling of such motor
vehicle shall be necessary by either the purchaser at the auction, the licensed
salvage yard or the demolisher, who shall be exempt from the payment of any
fees and taxes required under West Virginia Code Article 17A-3, as so provided
in West Virginia Code 17-24-9; provided, that the purchaser at the auction must

the licensed salvage yard or demolisher must demolish, wreck or dismantle such
motor vehicle within six months after taking possession of such motor vehicle

City Treasury to be kept and maintained as a special revolving account,
designated as the "abandoned and junked property fund"; provided, that any
remainder from the proceeds of the sale of an abandoned motor vehicle or junked
motor vehicle after payment of such expenses shall be held for the last
registered owner of such motor vehicle or any lienholder for ninety days, after
which time, if no owner or lienholder claims the remainder, it shall be
deposited in the special fund.
   (c)   Any money so collected and deposited in such special fund shall be
used solely for the payment of auction, towing, removing, preserving, storing,

boisterous conduct or language or by the making of unreasonably loud noise that
is intended to cause annoyance or alarm to another person, and who persists in
such conduct after being requested to desist by a law-enforcement officer
acting in his or her lawful capacity: provided, that nothing in this subsection

demonstrate in support or protest of public policy issues.

509.03 DISRUPTION OF GOVERNMENT.
   (a)   Council takes cognizance of reported activities of organized groups of
individuals in other cities of the United States, such as so-called "sit-ins"
held in the offices and hallways of buildings in which governmental business is
transacted; disruption of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, designed to prevent
or delay governmental personnel from reaching their places of duty; failing or
refusing to obey the lawful orders of police officers and others in authority,
et cetera, and as is generally known to all who read the newspapers, all for
the avowed purpose of preventing public officers and employees from performing
their duties and thereby preventing altogether, or hindering and delaying the
transaction of governmental business and nullifying important functions of
government.
   (b)   Council takes further cognizance of the fact that the City is a
municipal corporation existing under the laws of the State, with a
representative form of government in harmony with the Constitutions of the
United States and the State of West Virginia, and that the primary purpose of
the City Government is to serve the people of the City; and Council finds that
activities of groups of individuals which are intended and designed to prevent,
delay, hinder or otherwise impair the lawful transaction of City business or
functions of the City Government constitute a clear and present danger to the
good order and government of the City for its established purposes; for though
but one such organized effort may not be wholly effective, nevertheless, if it
is not promptly and firmly dealt with, other such efforts may be expected to
follow, so that any one such organized effort does in fact constitute a clear
and present danger to the ability of the City Government to serve the people of
the City, and to the very survival of the City as a lawful municipal
corporation.
   (c)   Therefore, and in view of the foregoing findings, no person, acting
alone or in concert with one or more other persons, shall commit any act or
omission, otherwise lawful, with intent to prevent, delay, confuse, disrupt,
pervert or render ineffective the orderly and timely transaction of any City
business or any governmental or proprietary function of the City.

idly, whether alone or in company with other loiterers.
   (b)   No person shall loiter on any of the sidewalks, streets, public places
or vacant lots, or in public buildings or the entranceways thereof, or in or
upon other places open to the public, and there conduct himself in a manner
annoying to persons passing by or occupants of adjacent buildings; or shall
insult, threaten, intimidate or in any manner interfere with, or impede the
progress of, any other person then and there conducting himself in a lawful and
orderly manner.
   (c)   Any person who loiters on any of the sidewalks, streets, public places

in charge of such building or place, or who is ordered by a police office, to
depart therefrom shall obey such order forthwith.
   (d)   No person, not the owner or tenant of any premises within the City,
shall enter after dark and loiter or sleep therein without the consent of such
owner or tenant.
   (e)   This section shall not apply to any person or assembly of persons
waiting, assembled or standing in line in an orderly manner for any lawful
purpose incident to the building or other place mentioned in this section, nor
shall it be construed to restrict the right to lawful assembly, picketing,
public speaking or other lawful means of expressing public opinion not in
contravention of other laws or ordinances. (1976 Code Sec. 13-31)
509.05 DISTURBING THE PEACE.

525.01 CONTRIBUTING TO DELINQUENCY OF A CHILD.
   (a)   No person eighteen years of age or older shall knowingly contribute to
or encourage the delinquency of a child.
   (b)   As used in this section, “delinquency” means the violation or
attempted violation of any federal or state statute, county or municipal
ordinance, or a court order, or the habitual or continual refusal to comply,
without just cause, with the lawful supervision or direction of a parent,
guardian or custodian.
   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child
under the care, custody or control of the parent, guardian or custodian with
necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:
      (1)   That offender pay for any and all treatment, support, and
maintenance while the child is in the custody of the state or person that the
court determines reasonable and necessary for the welfare of the child;

all sums ordered to be paid under this section, as long as the bond does not
exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000); and
      (3)   That the offender participate in any program or training that will
assist the child in correcting the delinquent behavior or, in the case of
neglect, that will assist the offender in correcting his or her behavior that
led to violation of this section.
   (g)   (1)   The penalty of a bond given upon suspension of a sentence which
becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

which may be ordered by the court, the court may order any person convicted
under the provisions of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting. Such reasonable

authorized by this section. However, a merchant who has recovered the penalty
prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not
limit the right of such establishment to demand, orally or in writing, that a
person who is liable for damages or a penalty under this section remit such
damages or penalty prior to the commencement of any legal action. (WVaC 61-3A-

   (c)   “Concealed” means hidden from ordinary observation so as to prevent

or death.

transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or

(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)

   (a)   Except where otherwise defined in this article, businesses,
occupations, trades, commercial ventures and terms of art used in Sections
717.14 through 717.27 have those meanings given them in the West Virginia Code,
as amended and in force on January 1, 1970.
 
   (b)   Except as otherwise defined in this article, terms, phrases,
occupations, trades, commercial ventures and terms of art used in sections of
this article other than those referred to in subsection (a) hereof shall have
the meaning given to them in the West Virginia Code, as amended and currently
in force and, when there is more than one such meaning, they shall have the
meaning given in the sections of the West Virginia Code imposing any State
license tax correlative to the City's license tax.
 
   (c)   "Fee" and "tax" may be used interchangeably to refer to the charges
imposed under this article.
 
   (d)   "Person" includes, wherever the context will permit, not only natural
persons, but all other legal entities such as partnerships, corporations,
business trusts and the like.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
717.03 PAYMENT AND TERM OF LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise specified in this article, the entirety of any license
fee designated as an annual fee shall be billed on or about June 1 in each
year, and shall be paid within thirty days of the bill being sent. All annual
licenses provided for by this article shall be issued for a term of one year
beginning on July 1 and ending on the next succeeding June 30. Biennial
licenses shall be issued for a term of two years, commencing on July 1 and
ending on June 30 two years after the initial license date. Where licenses of

but the Director of Finance shall select such dates as State law requires, if
any, for any correlative State licenses, certificates or permits.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
717.04 FEES TO CONSTITUTE DEBTS DUE THE CITY.
   The fees provided for in this article shall constitute debts due to the City
and may be collected by the Director of Finance by an appropriate action in
either the circuit courts or magistrate courts of West Virginia.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
717.05 APPLICABILITY; NONTRANSFERABILITY.
   Except where otherwise expressly provided herein, the fees provided for
herein apply to any person undertaking the herein described activities, trades
or professions for any part, no matter how small, of a given time period in
which the fee is imposed. Except where otherwise expressly provided herein, the
licenses provided for in this article are not transferable; that is, the
payment by one person of a license fee provided for in this article shall not
exempt or excuse a purchaser from, a successor to, or assignee of, any such
person from the payment of the prescribed fee for the maintenance or possession
of a particular license for the conduct of a particular activity. The licenses
provided for herein are nontransferable personal privileges. The fees provided
for in this article apply only to persons engaging in the specified acts,
having the specified ownership, or carrying on the specified operation or
conduct of a trade or business where the foregoing are located within the
geographic limits of the City.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
717.06 EFFECT OF IMPOSITION OF LICENSE TAX.
   (a)   In every case where this article imposes a license tax or fee, it
shall be deemed that a license is required to perform the activity at each
location within the City and that a license can and must be issued by the
Director of Finance with respect to that activity at each location within the
City, but only upon payment of the requisite fee and completion of the
requisite application. The imposition of a license tax by this article shall
mean that the payment of the tax is a prerequisite to the lawful conduct of the
activity upon which the tax is imposed, at each location within the City. (Ord.
8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
 
   (b)   Before application for a municipal license to conduct any type of
business activity within the corporate municipal limits is granted, the
applicant shall provide proof that the business will be located in a permanent
structure so designed for the type of business activity with accessible
permanent plumbing, electrical, and mechanical facilities necessary as
regulated by the State Building Code. Also, it shall be verified that there is
the required number of parking spaces located on site. This information shall
be in writing and verified by the Municipal Building Official or his duly
authorized agent and shall be attached to the application. (Ord. 1-95. Passed
1-30-95.)
717.07 ACTS PROHIBITED.
   Whenever a license tax is imposed by this article, no person shall engage in
the activity or occupation upon which the fee is levied, nor own or operate any
device upon which the fee is levied, without first paying the tax and acquiring
the license provided for under this article.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
717.08 EFFECT OF LICENSE.
   In any case in which a license is required by this article, the issuance of
the license shall be deemed a prerequisite to the lawful conduct of the
activity for which the license is required. Issuance of any license under this
article shall not, however, make valid or legal any act not otherwise valid or
legal or not otherwise authorized by other provisions of law. Nothing in this
article shall authorize any act, activity or ownership not otherwise lawful.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
717.09 DUTIES AND POWERS OF DIRECTOR OF FINANCE.

Director of Finance. The Director of Finance is expressly authorized to require

to the applicant. The form of the license and information thereon shall be such
as the Director of Finance may reasonably prescribe. The Director of Finance,
or his designated agent, shall have the power to examine activities and
locations of each business to determine compliance with this article.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
717.10 LICENSE FEES CUMULATIVE.
   The license fees imposed in this article are cumulative and the imposition
of any one fee does not preclude the imposition of other fees upon any one
individual or entity. The fees imposed by this article are imposed for engaging
in certain trades or activities, or for the use or possession of certain
devices. The pursuit of a particular trade or activity, or the ownership or use
of a particular device, shall not excuse a person or entity from the
requirement for a license and payment of a license fee for each such activity
or device for which, if engaged in or possessed singly, a license requirement
and license fee would be imposed.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
717.11 CHANGE IN NAME OR PARTNERS.
   A change in the name under which a person does business shall not require
the person to seek, any new license for any activity licensed under a prior
name; nor shall the withdrawal or addition of partners to a partnership require
the partnership to obtain a new license, provided that the partnership always
retains at least one partner who was a member of the firm at the time the
license was granted.
(Ord. 8-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
717.12 OTHER TAXES.

Director of Finance has issued the applicable license to such licensee.
   (b)   The annual license period for each facility for the performance of
exotic entertainment shall be from the 1st day of July to the 30th day of June

that the public utility service was not purchased, used or consumed within the
corporate limits of the City, the seller shall refer the question to the
Director of Finance, and such seller shall thereafter collect or refrain from

money, credits, property or other consideration for or in exchange for the
right to occupy a hotel room as herein defined.
   (b)   "Consumer" means a person who pays the consideration for the use or
occupancy of a hotel room. The term "consumer" shall not be construed to mean
the government of the United States of America, its agencies or
instrumentalities, or the government of the State of West Virginia or political
subdivisions thereof.
   (c)   "Hotel" means any facility, building or buildings, publicly or
privately owned, including a facility located in a State, County or Municipal
park, in which the public may, for a consideration, obtain sleeping
accommodations. The term shall include, but not be limited to, boarding houses,
hotels, motels, inns, courts, lodges, cabins and tourist homes. The term
"hotel" shall also include State, County and City parks offering accommodations
as herein set forth. The term "hotel" shall not be construed to mean any
hospital, sanitarium, extended care facility, nursing home or university or
college housing unit or any facility providing fewer than three hotel rooms,
nor any tent, trailer or camper campsites: provided, that where a university or
college housing unit provides sleeping accommodations for the general
nonstudent public for a consideration, the term "hotel" shall, if otherwise
applicable, apply to such accommodations for the purposes of this tax.
   (d)   "Hotel operator" means the person who is proprietor of a hotel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee,
trustee in possession, trustee in bankruptcy, receiver, executor or in any
other capacity. Where the hotel operator performs his functions through a
managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing
agent shall also be deemed a hotel operator for the purposes of this article
and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance
with the provisions of this article by either the principal or the managing
agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

Code. For purposes of this article, any recreational facility otherwise
qualifying as a "hotel" and situated within a State park shall be deemed to be
solely within the county in which the building or buildings comprising such
facility are physically situated, notwithstanding the fact that the State park
within which such facility is located may lie within the jurisdiction of more
than one county.
   (h)   "Tax," "taxes" or "this tax" means the hotel occupancy tax authorized
by this article.

   (a)   The consumer shall pay to the hotel operator the amount of tax imposed
by this article which tax shall be added to and shall constitute a part of the

shall be collectible as such by the hotel operator who shall account for, and
remit to the taxing authority, all taxes paid by consumers. The hotel operator
shall separately state the tax authorized by this article on all bills,
invoices, accounts, books of account and records relating to consideration paid
for occupancy or use of a hotel room. The hotel operator may commingle taxes
collected hereunder with the proceeds of the rental of hotel accommodations
unless the taxing authority shall, by ordinance, order, regulation or otherwise
require in writing the hotel operator to segregate such taxes collected from
such proceeds. The taxing authority's claim shall be enforceable against, and
shall be superior to, all other claims against the moneys so commingled
excepting only claims of the State for moneys held by the hotel pursuant to the
provisions of West Virginia Code Article 11-15. All taxes collected pursuant to
the provisions of this article shall be deemed to be held in trust by the hotel
until the same shall have been remitted to the taxing authority as hereinafter
provided.
 
   (b)   A hotel or hotel operator shall not represent to the public in any
manner, directly or indirectly, that it will absorb all or any part of the tax
or that the tax is not to be considered an element in the price to be collected
from the consumer.
(6-11-85)
745.04 OCCUPANCY BILLED TO GOVERNMENT AGENCIES OR EMPLOYEES.

be exempt from this tax; provided, that rooms paid for by a Federal Government
employee for which reimbursement is made shall be subject to this tax.

subdivisions shall be exempt from this tax; provided, that rooms paid for by an

tax.

otherwise, of the property or estate of any person, all taxes due and unpaid
authorized under this article shall be paid from the first money available for
distribution in priority to all claims and liens except taxes and debts due to
the United States which under Federal law are given priority over the debts and
liens created by municipal ordinance or order of the County Commission for this
tax and taxes and debts due to the State. Any person charged with the
administration or distribution of any such property or estate who violates the

for such amount as he failed to collect or remit; provided, that such hotel
operator shall not be held liable for failure to collect such tax if the hotel
operator can by good and substantial evidence prove the refusal of the
purchaser to pay this tax despite the diligent effort in good faith of the
hotel operator to collect the tax.
(6-11-85)
745.08 TOTAL AMOUNT COLLECTED TO BE REMITTED.
   No profit shall accrue to any person as a result of the collection of the
tax authorized under this article. Notwithstanding that the total amount of
such taxes collected by a hotel operator may be in excess of the amount for
which a consumer would be liable by the application of the levy provided in
Section
745.01 for the occupancy of a hotel room or rooms, the total amount of all
taxes collected by any hotel operator shall be remitted to the taxing authority
as hereinafter provided.

in which the tax authorized by this article is not collected by the hotel
operator at the time of such sales, such tax shall not, for purposes of this
article, be regarded as having the expiration of the thirty-day period set
forth in Section
745.05, whichever shall first occur.
   The tax imposed and levied by this article, if not paid when due, shall bear
interest at the rate of eight percent (8%) per annum from the due date of the

unpaid, from the date such tax should have been paid, a penalty in the amount
of five percent (5%) of the tax for the first month, or fraction thereof, of
delinquency and one percent (1%) of the tax for each succeeding month, or
fraction thereof, of delinquency; provided, that if such failure is due to
reasonable cause, the Director of Finance may waive in whole or in part these
penalties.
   Interest and penalties may be collected in the same manner as the tax
imposed by this article.
   The hotel operator shall, on or before the fifteenth day of each month,
prepare and deliver to the taxing authority a return for the preceding month,
in the form prescribed by the Director of Finance. Such form shall include all
information necessary for the computation, collection and subsequent
distribution of the tax as the Director of Finance may require. A remittance
for the amount of tax due shall accompany each return. Each return shall be
signed by the hotel operator or his/her duly authorized agent.
   If any person fails to remit the taxes, interest and penalty provided for
under this article, the Director of Finance in his discretion may direct the
City Attorney to institute a civil action to collect such tax, interest and
penalty or may take whatever legal action in his/her discretion is available.

sales and of charges, together with a record of the tax collected thereon, and
shall keep all invoices and other pertinent documents in such form as the
taxing authority may require. Such records and other documents shall be
preserved for a period of not less than three years, unless the taxing
authority shall consent in writing to their destruction within that period or
shall require that they be kept for a longer period.

additions to tax or penalties which may be imposed by this article or other
authority, may be enforced against such officers as against the association or

901.10 UTILITY CLEARANCE.
   Tree limbs that grow within public rights of way, in which trees are
routinely pruned or otherwise cut during utility maintenance operations by
utility companies or companies paid by utility companies to do such work, shall
be maintained by the utility company in compliance with applicable franchise
agreements approved by the City. Should a franchise agreement expire, the
regulations of this article shall apply to any such utility, the same as if the
work were being performed by a City department. The same shall apply to all
public utilities doing work within a public right of way. Each tree trimming
policy of a utility company must be reviewed by the City Manager, or his/her
designee, prior to any trimming by the utility company.
   (a)    The tree trimming policy mentioned above shall include a plan for
providing the City or other landowner, tenants of abutting realty whose trees
will be cut or trimmed by order of the utility, with reasonable notice which
shall include:
      (1)    A description of the area(s) in which the right of way clearing or
maintenance is performed;
      (2)    An approximate schedule of work;
      (3)    A description of the type(s) of work to be performed, including,
but not limited to tree trimming, tree removal, brush cutting, herbicide
application, growth regulation, slash disposition.
      (4)    A general description of clearances required or rights of way
widths to be maintained; and
      (5)    The name and telephone number of a contact person at the utility.
   (b)    In the case of right of way clearing or maintenance planned or
scheduled in the normal course of operation, the utility company shall make
personal contact with the City or other landowner, and owners or tenants of
abutting realty whose trees will be cut or trimmed by order of the utility. In
the case of abutting realty which lacks a habitable structure or contains a
vacant structure, personal contact shall be replaced by a Class I legal
advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the City of Bridgeport.
   (c)    In the case of right of way clearing or maintenance resulting from a
sudden emergency, the utility shall issue a news release to the Bridgeport
media. After the sudden emergency is over and the necessary clearing is
complete, the utility shall publish a notice regarding the affected properties
in a Class I legal advertisement in a newspaper of general circulation in the
City of Bridgeport.
   (d)    For purposes of this section, "personal contact" means, that at least
seven (7) business days prior to the scheduled clearing or maintenance, an
attempt will be made by the utility to contact the persons by telephone or in
person. Should the attempt be unsuccessful, a door hanger or similar type of
written notice will be left at the residence which contains the information
required by this section. A second personal contact attempt will be made prior
to the start of work. Should contact be made with a tenant, the utility shall
either actually contact the owner before beginning work or publish a legal
advertisement as set forth in subsections (b) and (c) hereof.
   (e)    Upon receiving notice of such work to be performed by the utility,
the City of Bridgeport will notify existing neighborhood associations within
the affected area, of the same.
   (f)    All tree removal on public land or within public rights of way shall
follow City tree removal standards established by the City Manager or his/her
representative.
   (g)    All tree pruning and maintenance shall be subject to the requirements
established by the City Manager or his/her representative.
   (h)    Utility maintenance that requires digging or trenching near trees
shall provide protection of the Critical Root Zone. Open trenching in the root
zone of a tree is to be avoided when practical except when the trenching falls
outside of the Critical Root Zone.
   (i)    All trees located where there is insufficient space to bypass the
Critical Root Zone must be augured if practical. Auguring activity shall not
occur on more than one side of the tree and shall follow distance and depth
requirements outlined in the ANSI tree care specifications manual.
   (j)   If auguring is not practical or the Critical Root Zone is damaged, the
Utility shall remove the existing tree and replace the tree, the location and
type of tree to be determined by the City Manager, or his/her designated
representative.   
      (Passed 6-26-17.)
901.11 DEDICATION AND ACCEPTANCE OF STREETS, ROADS AND ALLEYS POLICY.
   (a)   Creation of Public Streets, Alleys or Roads By Purchase or
Condemnation.  The City may lay out and create a public street, alley, or way,
by purchase or condemnation by and through action taken by the governing body
of the City by ordinance.
   (b)   Creation of Public Streets, Alleys or Roads By Dedication and
Acceptance.  The recording of a plat or map showing streets, alleys, and roads
constitutes a private dedication and such private dedication creates no
proprietary rights of the general public and the City has no responsibility for
the repair, maintenance and upkeep of such platted streets, alleys, or roads.
The private dedication of streets, alleys, or roads through the recording of a
plat showing those streets, alleys, or roads becomes a public street, alley or
a road only by acceptance of the City either express or implied. The City, by
formal action of the governing body, by resolution, ordinance, or by approval
by notation upon the plat of the streets, alleys or roads, will be deemed to
expressly accept the dedication and the City will assume responsibility for the
maintenance and repair of the streets, alleys and roads so accepted. Acceptance
by the City of a privately dedicated street, alley, or road may be implied by
act of the City by assuming maintenance and repair and expending public funds
for the upkeep, improvement, repair, or maintenance of the platted street,
alley or road, at which time the City will assume responsibility for such
maintenance and repair and attendant liability with respect to the accepted
street, alley or road.
   It is the policy of the administrative staff of the City of Bridgeport that
no maintenance, repair, improvement, or other expenditure of public funds shall
be performed or made upon any platted street, alley or road not heretofore
accepted without formal action of the governing body. All plats approved in
accordance with the subdivision or zoning regulations of the City of Bridgeport
shall bear a notation that the acceptance is as to form and that such approval
does not constitute acceptance of the street, alley, or road as a public way
and the City therefore has no responsibility for the maintenance, upkeep, and
repair of the streets, alleys or roads shown upon the plat or map without
formal action by the governing body. The private dedication of streets, roads,
or alleys may be formally rejected by the City by procedure adopted by the
governing body, in which case such privately dedicated streets, roads, and
alleys shall not become public streets, roads, or alleys and shall not be shown
on official City maps.
   Unless otherwise approved by Council, all streets are to be built in
compliance with the City of Bridgeport's Design and Construction Standards.
   Roadway plans shall require approval by the City Engineer prior to
construction. City inspection is to be performed during construction to monitor
the quality of work and the adherence to design plans.
   Dedication requests shall be accompanied by a final as-built survey, plat,
and full description of the street/roadway/alley and total easement to be
dedicated.
   The City Engineer or designee shall inspect the street/roadway/alley upon
the request for dedication and shall submit a report to the Governing Body as
to the suitability for acceptance.
   The City shall only maintain, repair, and improve streets, roads, and alleys
which are shown upon an official map of all streets, roads, and alleys in the
City, which official map shall show all streets, roads, and alleys heretofore
either expressly or impliedly accepted by the City. (Passed 8-24-20.)

1303.01 TITLE.
   These regulations shall be known as the Bridgeport Zoning Code, and shall be
referred to herein as “this code.”
1303.02 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this ordinance is to safeguard the health, property and
public welfare by controlling the design, location, use or occupancy of all
buildings and structures through the regulated and orderly development of land
and land uses within this jurisdiction. This ordinance supports the City’s
comprehensive plan as the basis for zoning.
1303.03 SCOPE
   The provisions of this code shall apply to the construction, addition,
alteration, moving, repair and use of any building, structure, parcel of land
or sign within a jurisdiction, except work located primarily in a public way,
public utility towers and poles, and public utilities unless specifically
mentioned in this code.
   Where, in any specific case, different sections of this code specify
different requirements, the more restrictive shall govern. Where there is
conflict between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable. In fulfilling these purposes, this ordinance
is intended to benefit the public as a whole and not any specific person or
class of persons. Although through the implementation,    administration and
enforcement of this code, benefits and detriments will be enjoyed or suffered
by specific individuals, such is merely a byproduct of the overall benefit to
the whole community. Therefore, unintentional breaches of the obligations of
administration and enforcement imposed on the jurisdiction hereby shall not be
enforceable in tort. If any portion of this code is held invalid for any
reason, the remaining herein shall not be affected.

Ordinance;

of this Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest, where, owing
to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this
Ordinance will result in unnecessary hardship, and so that the spirit of this
Ordinance shall be observed and substantial justice done as follows:
      (1)   Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of
a specific piece of property at the time of enactment by reason of exceptional
situation or condition of such piece of property, or of the use or development
of property immediately adjoining the piece of property in question, the
literal enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance would result in
peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties or exceptional and undue
hardship upon the owner of such property, unnecessary to carry out the spirit
and purpose of this Ordinance, the Board shall have the power to authorize,
upon appeal, a variance from such strict applications, so as to relieve such
difficulties or hardships, and so that the spirit and purpose of this Ordinance
shall be observed and substantial justice done. In authorizing a variance the
Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and
other features of the proposed building, structure or use as it may deem
advisable in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of this Ordinance.

Ordinance shall be authorized by the Board unless the Board finds that all of
the following conditions exist:

conditions applying to the property in question or generally to other
properties or class of uses in the same zoning district.
         B.   That such variance is necessary for the preservation and
enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other properties in the
same zoning district and in the vicinity affected by such variance.
         C.   That the authorizing of such variance will not:
            1.   Alter the land use characteristics of the district;

property;

            5.   Increase the congestion in the public streets;
            6.   Otherwise impair the public health, safety and general
welfare.
      (3)   No grant or variance shall be authorized unless the Board
specifically finds that the condition or situation of the specific piece of
property for which the variance is sought is not of so typical or recurrent a
nature as to make reasonably practicable the formulation of a general
regulation, under an amendment of this Ordinance, for such conditions or
situations.
   (e)   In exercising its powers and authority the Board may reverse or
affirm, in whole or in part, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or

1321.01 GENERAL.
   Planned unit developments shall be allowed by planning commission approval
in any zoning district. No such planned unit development permit shall be
granted unless such development will meet the use limitations of the zoning
district in which it is located and meet the density and other limitations of
such districts, except as such requirements may be lawfully modified as
provided by this code. Compliance with the regulations of this code in no way
excuses the developer from the applicable requirements of a subdivision
ordinance, except as modifications thereof are specifically authorized in the
approval of the application for the planned unit development.
   These regulations are to encourage and provide means for effecting desirable
and quality development by permitting greater flexibility and design freedom
than that permitted under the basic district regulations, and to accomplish a
well balanced, aesthetically satisfying city and economically desirable
development of building sites within a PUD-Planned Unit Development. These
regulations are established to permit latitude in the development of the
building site if such development is found to be in accordance with the
purpose, spirit and intent of this ordinance and is found not to be hazardous,
harmful, offensive or otherwise adverse to the environment, property values or
the character of the neighborhood or the health, safety and welfare of the
community. It is intended to permit and encourage diversification, variation
and imagination in the relationship of uses, structures, open spaces and
heights of structures for developments conceived and implemented as
comprehensive and cohesive unified projects. It is further intended to
encourage more rational and economic development with relationship to public
services, and to encourage and facilitate preservation of open lands.
1321.02 CONDITIONS.
   (a)   No planned unit development shall have an area less than 5 acres.
   (b)   Uses. A planned unit development which will contain uses not permitted
in the zoning district in which it is to be located will require a change of
zoning district and shall be accompanied by an application for a zoning
amendment, except that any residential use shall be considered a permitted use
in a planned unit development which allows residential uses and shall be
governed by density, design and other requirements of the planned unit
development permit.
   Where a site is situated in more than one use district, the permitted uses
applicable to such property in one district may be extended into the adjacent
use district.
   (c)   Ownership. The development shall be in single or corporate ownership
at the time of application, or the subject of an application filed jointly by
all owners of the property.
   (d)   Design. The Planning Commission shall require such arrangements of
structures and open spaces within the site development plan as necessary to
assure that adjacent properties will not be adversely affected.
   (e)   Density. Density of land use shall in no case be more than 15 percent
higher than allowed in the zoning district.
   (f)   Arrangement. Where feasible, the least height and density of buildings
and uses shall be arranged around the boundaries of the development.
   (g)   Specific regulations. Lot area, width, yard, height, density and
coverage regulations shall be determined by approval of the site development
plan. All front yard and rear yard setbacks must be consistent for the zone
located. Flexibility may be granted in side yard setbacks.
   (h)   Open Spaces. Preservation, maintenance and ownership of required open
spaces within the development shall be accomplished by either:
      (1)   Dedication of the land as a public park of parkway system, or
      (2)   Creating a permanent, open space easement on and over the said
private open spaces to guarantee that the open space remains perpetually in
recreational use, with ownership and maintenance being the responsibility of an
owners’ association established with articles of association and bylaws which
are satisfactory to the legislative body.
   (i)   Landscaping. Landscaping, fencing and screening related to the uses
within the site and as a means of integrating the proposed development into its
surroundings shall be planned and presented to the Planning Commission for
approval, together with other required plans for the development.
   (j)   Desirability. The proposed use of the particular location shall be
shown as necessary or desirable, to provide a service or facility which will
contribute to the general well being of the surrounding area.

1325.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE AND INTENT; INTERPRETATION.
   (a)    Findings:
      (1)    Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative
uses for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation.
The purpose of this article is to regulate the size, color, illumination,
movement, materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on
property for exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property
values; preservation of the character of the various neighborhoods; creation of
a convenient, attractive, and harmonious community; and the safety and welfare
of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and
encouraging economic development. This article allows adequate communication
through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location,
and size of all signs. These regulations do not eliminate all the harms that
may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they strike an
appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by means of
signs while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms caused by
signs.
      (2)    This article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States guarantee of free
speech. If any provision of this article is found by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall not affect the validity of other
provisions of this article which can be given effect without the invalid
provision.
      (3)    Signs not expressly permitted under this code are prohibited.
      (4)    The City of Bridgeport, the State of West Virginia and other
governmental entities are not subject to the requirements of this article.
   (b)    Intent. Signs have a strong visual impact on the character and
quality of the community. As a prominent part of the scenery, they attract or
repel the viewing public, affect the safety of vehicular traffic, and their
suitability or appropriateness helps to set the tone for the community. Because
the City relies upon its physical setting and beauty to attract commerce,
aesthetic considerations assume economic value. It is the intent of the City,
through this chapter, to protect and enhance both the City's residential
character and its economic base through the provision of appropriate and
aesthetic signage. In addition, it is the intent of the City to limit the size,
type and location of signs in order to minimize their distracting effect on
drivers and thereby improve traffic safety.
   (c)    Purpose. The purpose of this article is to promote the public health,
safety and welfare through a comprehensive system of reasonable effective
consistent, content-neutral and nondiscriminatory sign standards and
requirements. This article has been adopted to:
      (1)    Promote and accomplish the goals, policies and objectives of the
City's comprehensive plan and the city council's vision, mission and goals
statement;
      (2)    Provide minimum standards in order to safeguard life, health,
property and public welfare and promote traffic safety by controlling the
design, quality of materials, construction, illumination, size, location and
maintenance of signs and sign structures and discouraging excessive numbers of
signs;
      (3)    Recognize free speech rights by regulating signs in a content-
neutral manner;
      (4)    Promote the free flow of traffic and protect pedestrians and
motorists from injury and property damage caused by or which may be fully or
partially attributable to cluttered, distracting and/or illegible signage;
      (5)    Promote a positive visual image of the City and protect the beauty
of the City's built environment by encouraging signs that are compatible with
the architectural style, characteristics, and scale of the building to which
they may be attached; appropriate to the size of the subject property and
amount of street frontage adjacent to the subject property; and compatible with
adjacent buildings and businesses;
      (6)    Protect property values, the local economy and the quality of life
by preserving and enhancing the appearance of the City's streetscape;
      (7)    Provide consistent sign design standards;
      (8)    Protect and encourage creative and innovative approaches to
signage and signs that are of a quality design, pleasing in appearance and are
appropriate in size, materials and illumination to the surrounding area;
      (9)    Provide an improved visual environment for the citizens of and
visitors to the City;
      (10)    Adopt clear, understandable regulations which will assure equal
protection and fair treatment under the law through consistent application of
the regulations and consistent enforcement of the article;
      (11)    Balance both public and private business needs with the specific
objectives of creating a community with an unmatched quality of life and strong
focus on economic well-being, aesthetics, community and family, the environment
and public infrastructure;
      (12)    Support and enhance the economic well-being of all business
within the City and recognize the needs of all businesses to identify their
premises and advertise their products and services;
      (13)    Recognize that the aesthetic value of the total environment
affects economic values and that an unrestricted proliferation of signs can and
does detract from the economic value of the community; and
      (14)    Regulate the use ofbillboard signs to certain zoning districts by
recognizing that billboards affect the aesthetic value of the community,
thereby reducing property values and impact traffic safety because of the
distraction that is created by large signage along public rights of way.
   (d)    Interpretation.
      (1)    This article is not intended to and shall not be interpreted to
restrict speech based on its content, viewpoint, or message.
      (2)    Any classification of signs in this article which purports to
permit speech because of the type of sign or identity of the sign user or
otherwise, shall be interpreted to allow either commercial or non-commercial
speech on the sign.
      (3)    No part of this article shall be construed to favor commercial
speech over noncommercial speech.

      (Passed 9-14-20.)
1325.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SIGNS.
   (a)    Setback and Placement.  All signs, including Billboards, shall be set
back from any public right-of-way at least the height of the sign. Electronic
message displays, where permitted by this ordinance, shall be placed
perpendicular to residential structures where possible and shall comply with
FCC regulations, including the avoidance of harmful interference with radio
frequencies.
   (b)    Illumination. The purpose of the following provisions regulating
signage lighting is to ensure that signs are lighted in such a manner as to
maintain aesthetic consistency with signs already existing in the community and
to ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians, while also ensuring that signs
are adequately able to convey sign messages.
      (1)    Definitions.
         A.   "Candela" means the basic unit of measurement of light in SI
(metric) units.
         B.   "Candela per square meter (cd/m2)” means the SI (metric) unit
used to describe the luminance of a light source or of an illuminated surface
that reflects light. Also referred to as Nits.
         C.   “Nit" means a photometric unit of measurement referring to
luminance.
            One nit is equal to one (1) cd/m2
         D.   "SI (International System of Units)" means the modem metric
system of measurement, abbreviated SI for the French term "Le Systeme
International d 'Unites."
      (2)    With the exception of Temporary Signs, a sign in any district may
be illuminated at night. Signs that are illuminated at night may not exceed a
maximum luminance level of seven hundred and fifty (750) cd/m2 or Nits,
regardless of the method of illumination, at least one-half (0.5) hour before
Apparent Sunset, as determined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), US Department of Commerce, for the specific geographic
location and date. All illuminated signs must comply with this maximum
luminance level throughout the night, if the sign is energized, until Apparent
Sunrise, as determined by the NOAA, at which time the sign may resume luminance
levels appropriate for daylight conditions.
      (3)    The maximum luminance during daylight conditions, between Apparent
Sunrise and one-half (0.5) hour before Apparent Sunset, shall be ten thousand
(10,000) cd/m2 or Nits.
      (4)    All permitted and conditional use signs may be backlit, internally
lighted, or indirectly lighted, subject to lighting limitations in this code.
All external sign lighting shall have lighting fixtures or luminaires that are
fully shielded.
      (5)    Temporary signs shall not be lighted.
   (c)    Maximum Height Measurements. Wall signs and other signs with sign
structures not affixed to the ground are measured from the lowest attached
component of the sign to the
highest attached component of the sign. The height of signs with sign
structures affixed to the ground is measured as the distance from the base of
the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the
sign, subject to limitations in this article. Normal grade is the lower of:
      (1)    Existing grade prior to construction; or
      (2)    The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating primarily for the purpose of mounting
or elevating the sign.
   (d)    Measurement of Sign Area.  Sign area is calculated under the
following principles:
      (1)    With signs that are regular polygons or circles, the area can be
calculated by the mathematical formula for that polygon or circle. With signs
that are not regular polygons or circles, the sign area is calculated using all
that area within a maximum of three abutting or overlapping rectangles that
enclose the sign face.
      (2)    The permitted area of a double-faced a-frame sign shall be
considered to be the area on one side only. If one face contains a larger sign
area than the other, the larger face shall be used in calculating the sign
area.
      (3)    For projecting signs, the sign area also includes the area of the
visible sides of the sign, calculated as a rectangle enclosing each entire side
view.
      (4)    Supports, uprights, or structures on which any sign is supported
shall not be included in determining the sign area unless such supports,
uprights, or structure are designed in such a way as to form an integral
background of the display; except, however, when a sign is placed on a fence,
wall, planter, or other similar structure that is designed to serve a separate
purpose other than to support the sign, the entire area of such structure shall
not be computed.
      (5)    In instances where there are multiple tenants or users on a
property or in a building, allowable sign area for all parties shall not exceed
the maximum sign area computed based upon the number of tenants multiplied by
forty (40) square feet per tenant. In no case shall any tenant sign exceed
forty (40) square feet.
      (6)    All signs displayed, whether permanent or temporary, and
regardless of the type of sign are counted toward the maximum sign area allowed
per use, except window signs on non-dwellings where permitted.
   (e)    Wall Signs.  Wall signs shall provide as part of zoning permit
application:
      (1)    Express permission from the operator and/or owner of the building;
      (2)    The name and address of the person applying the wall sign; and
      (3)    A clear drawing of the proposed wall sign including dimensions and
location.
      (4)    Wall signs larger than one hundred (100) square feet are subject
to the design review standard in subsection (f).
   (f)   Design review standards for wall signs in excess of one hundred (100)
square feet. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall issue zoning permits for signs
subject to design review in accordance with Section
1307.06, except that the Board of Zoning Appeals shall issue a determination
within forty (40) business days. In determining whether a sign is compatible
with the theme and overall character to be achieved in each zoning district or
overlay, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall base its compatibility determination
on the
following criteria:
      (1)    The relationship of the scale and placement of the sign to the
building or premises on which it is to be displayed.
      (2)    The relationship of the colors of the sign to the colors of
adjacent buildings and nearby signs.
      (3)    The similarity or dissimilarity of the sign's size and shape to
the size and shape of other signs in the area.
      (4)    The similarity or dissimilarity of the style of lettering or
number of words on the sign to the style oflettering or number of words of
nearby signs.
      (5)    The compatibility of the type of illumination, if any, with the
type of illumination in the area.
      (6)    The compatibility of the materials used in the construction of the
sign with the materials used in the construction of other sign in the area.

1325.11 NONCONFORMING OUTDOOR SIGNS.
   (a)    Outdoor Signs lawfully existing on the effective date of this code
that do not conform to the provisions of this code, and signs that are
accessory to a nonconforming use shall be deemed nonconforming signs and may
remain except as qualified below.
      (1)    Nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged nor shall any feature of
a nonconforming sign, such as illumination or technology, be increased.
      (2)    Nonconforming signs shall not be extended, structurally

1325.13 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   Temporary signs pose distinct concerns with visual clutter, safety in
erection and display, and removal when the time for display has concluded.
Temporary signs also pose distinct concerns with materials quality. The
following provisions and individual zoning of temporary signs per district
serve to address these concerns.
   (a)    All temporary signs shall be permitted for a maximum of thirty (30)
days prior to the event they advertise or provide notice of and Temporary Signs
advertising or providing notice of a particular event must be removed forty-
eight (48) hours after the conclusion of the event. Any Temporary Sign

1325.14 R-1, R-2 AND R-3 RESIDENCE DISTRICTS.
   (a)    Purpose.  Signage in residential districts poses a heightened risk of
visual blight and unsightly clutter, as residential neighborhoods typically
contain markedly less signage than other districts in order to maintain the
residential character of the neighborhood. At the same time, communicating from
one's residence is a distinct and impactful form of speech that should be
protected, and nonresidential uses should be afforded adequate signage
incidental to the primary use in the form of on-premises signs. Signs permitted
in these districts are smaller, fewer in number, and limited in sign type in
order to limit visual clutter and distraction, while affording ample speech.
   (b)    Signs Permitted as Accessory to Dwellings.
      (1)    Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to dwellings:
Freestanding, Minor, Projecting, Wall, Wicket, Window. No more than four (4)
permanent signs are permitted by right per dwelling.
      (2)    Temporary signs as accessory to dwellings: A-frame, Banner,
Beacon, Chalkboard, Geological, Inflatable/Tethered, Minor, Wall, Wicket,
Window. No more than ten (10) Temporary signs are permitted by right per
dwelling.
      (3)    No more than three (3) flags as accessory to dwellings.
   (c)    Signs Permitted as Accessory to Non-dwellings.
      (1)    Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to non-dwellings:
Freestanding, Geological, Minor, Projecting, Wall, Wicket, Window. No more than
five (5) permanent signs are permitted by right per use.
      (2)    Temporary signs: A-frame, Banner, Beacon, Chalkboard, Changeable
Copy, Inflatable/Tethered, Minor, Wall, Wicket, Window. No more than three (3)
Temporary signs are permitted by right per use.
      (3)    No more than three (3) flags.

   (a)    Purpose. On-premises signage in mixed-use areas is essential for the
operation of a variety of uses. In Professional Office Districts, particularly
those near residential development and neighboring residential districts,
signage that is less intrusive by being smaller, shorter in height, and more
uniform in sign type improves the aesthetic qualities of these and neighboring
districts and limits the visual distraction of signage.
   (b)    Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as for
Section
1325.14.
   (c)    Sign Permitted as Accessory to Non-dwellings.

due to unusual topography or conditions beyond the control of the subdivider
then the Planning Commission may modify, vary or waive such requirements
provided that such modification, variance or waiver will not nullify the intent
or purpose of these Regulations, and provided further that such modification,
variance or waiver and the reason therefor shall be entered upon the minutes of
the Commission. (Ord. 6-95. Passed 7-24-95.)

judgment, justify such modifications, variances and waivers and still maintain
substantially the objectives of these Subdivision Regulations.
 
   (b)   Each and every modification, variance or waiver of these Regulations
sought by the subdivider shall be specifically applied for in writing in letter
application form setting forth the reasons that the subdivider feels he
qualifies under this article. Any condition shown on the plat which would
require a modification, variance or waiver, shall constitute a ground for
disapproval of the plat unless such special application for modification,
variance or waiver is made and granted by the Commission. (Ord. 6-95. Passed 7-
24-95.)
1335.05 PERMIT.
   Prior to the issuance of a building permit allowing the construction of any

1339.01 GENERAL.
   To obtain approval of a proposed subdivision and plat thereof, the
subdivider or applicant shall apply and submit to the Planning Commission or
secretary thereof, all information as regulated by the City of Bridgeport
Design and Construction Standards Manual as referenced in Section
1341.02. (Ord. 6-95. Passed 7-24-95.)
1339.02 PREAPPLICATION.
   Prior to filing a preliminary plat, the applicant shall schedule a meeting
with the City Engineer, City Planner and Zoning Administrator to present plans
initially and discuss the conditions and restrictions the applicant will be
legally bound to comply with.
(Ord. 6-95. Passed 7-24-95.)
1339.03 APPLICATION.
   The subdivider may then apply and submit the preliminary plat to the
Planning Commission for review. Along with all City staff notes, the
preliminary plat must contain all information as referenced in the City of
Bridgeport Design and Construction Standards Manual referenced in Section
1341.02. The preliminary plat must be presented to the Commission or secretary
thereof at least fifteen days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting of the
Planning Commission, otherwise the proposed preliminary plat shall not be
considered at that meeting. Such preliminary plats shall be of the total land
to be ultimately developed and then may be identified as “Phases”.
(Ord. 6-00. Passed 8-14-00.)

the scheduled date, place, time and agenda of the meeting at which the proposed
preliminary plat is to be reviewed. The date for such meeting shall not be more
than sixty days from the date of submission of the preliminary plat for
approval. The Commission shall act on the preliminary plat stating its
approval, conditional approval or disapproval. If approved conditionally, and
if necessary, the Planning Commission may require the subdivider to submit a
revised preliminary plat. If any of the requirements are modified or waived,
the reasons for such shall be specified. If the Commission should disapprove
the preliminary plat, recommendations shall be made on the basis of which the
proposed subdivision would be approved. Approval of a preliminary plat shall
not constitute approval of a final plat, but rather shall indicate an
expression of approval of the layout submitted on the preliminary plat as a
basis to the preparation of the final plat. The Commission shall retain the
preliminary plat.
   (c)   Once the preliminary plat is approved by the Commission, the
construction of the infrastructure shall begin. The installation of all
utilities, streets, lighting, sidewalks, and any other improvement shall be
installed as regulated by the City of Bridgeport Design and Construction
Standards Manual as referenced in Section
1341.02 and inspected as referenced by Section

(Ord. 5-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
1707.04 REGISTRATION REVOCATION; APPEAL.
   A registration issued pursuant to this section may be revoked by the
Building Inspector if he finds that the landlord's rental property is unfit for
habitation or use for its intended purpose or for landlord's refusal to conform
his property to the requirements of law, or breaches of such other duties
placed on the landlord by the Building Code or general law. Any such revocation
shall be preceded by written notice of the anticipated revocation sent by
certified mail to the landlord's last known address at least fifteen days prior
to revocation, but not before the Building Inspector has made every effort to
serve the landlord's in person. Such notice shall inform the landlord of the
grounds for revocation and his right to an appeal to the Code Appeals Board as
provided by law. A revocation of a registration shall not entitle a landlord to
a refund of any part of the registration fee.
   If the Building Inspector refuses to register any landlord or if a landlord
is notified by the Building Inspector that he was not in compliance with any
provision of this article, such landlord shall have the same right of appeal as
under a revocation of a registration. If any decision of the Code Appeals Board
is adverse to any landlord, the landlord may apply to the Circuit Court of
Harrison County for review of such decision in the appropriate manner within
thirty days of such decision.
   The Building Inspector shall advise the landlord of his/her/its rights under
this section on any notice given to such landlord relating to the review of the
Building Inspector's decision.
(Ord. 5-88. Passed 5-24-88.)
1707.99 PENALTY.
   Whoever engages in any activity contrary to the provisions of this article,
whether without obtaining a registration certificate required therefor before
commencing the same or by continuing the same after the termination of the
effective period of any such registration certificate, may, in addition to
paying the registration fee, be liable for a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00)
for each month or fraction thereof during which he has been in default of the
registration fee. The Building Inspector, after written notification, shall
collect the full amount of the registration fee and penalty imposed and he
shall not issue any registration certificate until the registration fee and the
penalty have been paid in full.

foundation. The primary use of the LAG is to determine whether the structure is
located within a special flood hazard area by comparing it to the base flood
elevation.
      (23)   Lowest Floor: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement). An unfinished enclosure constructed with flood resistant
materials as defined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2 and usable solely for parking
of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area

compliance with the requirements of this ordinance, or, if full compliance is
not possible, to reduce the adverse impacts of the non-compliance to the
greatest extent feasible.
      (33)   Reasonably Safe from Flooding: Means that during the base flood,
water should not damage structures and any subsurface waters related to the
base flood should not damage existing or proposed structures.
      (34)   Special Flood Hazard Area: The land in the floodplain subject to a
one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30,
and A99. This term shall also include areas shown on other flood hazard maps
that are specifically listed or otherwise described in this article.
      (35)   Start of Construction:  The date the permit was issued, provided
the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction does not
include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it
include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include
excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of
temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or

storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (39)   Substantial Damage: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damage condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means cumulative flood-related
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10 year
period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred. See "Substantial Improvement."

         A.   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of
the market value of the structure before the Start of Construction of the
improvement.
         B.   This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation of state or local health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement
official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         C.   Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that
would constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with
all ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
          D.   For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to
occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural
part of the building commences whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the structure.
      (41)   Top of Bank:  The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of bank. In the field a professional familiar
with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of bank. When a professional
is not employed the top of the bank may be considered to be the top of the
first significant slope landward of the waters edge when it is followed by at
least 50 feet of relatively flat land.
      (42)   Violation: The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all the requirements of this ordinance. Any structure or other
development lacking the certifications, finished construction elevation

1731.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Bridgeport which are subject to the one hundred (100) year flood,
as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and described in the Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Bridgeport by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated 10/02/2012 or the most recent revision
thereof including all digital data developed as part of the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas identified by the City of Bridgeport by use of
historic or other technical data and shown on an officially recognized "Local
Flood Hazards Map". These areas shall be designated as appropriate with the
level of technical data described below and shall be managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The Floodway Fringe shall be those areas of AE zone for which
specific one hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided in the FIS
but which lie beyond the floodway area.
      (3)   The AE Area without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (4)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.  
      (1)   The delineation of the identified special flood hazard area may be
revised by the City of Bridgeport where natural or man-made changes have
occurred and/or more detailed studies conducted or undertaken by the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers, a River Basin Commission or other qualified agency or
individual document the necessity for such changes. However, prior to any such
change, approval must be obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA).
      (2)   A City of Bridgeport's base flood elevations may increase or
decrease resulting from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon
as practicable but, not later than six months after the date such information
becomes available, the City of Bridgeport shall notify the NFIP Administrator
of the changes by submitting technical or scientific data.
      (3)   The City of Bridgeport may identify and regulate new local flood
hazard or ponding areas. These areas may be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard
Map" using best available topographic data and locally derived information such
as flood of record, historic high water marks or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning the location of
proposed development relative to a special flood hazard area arise, an initial
determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator and any party
aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Bridgeport. The burden of
proof shall be on the appellant/applicant.
   (e)   Elevations Prevail. Elevation data certified by a Licensed
Professional Surveyor or Registered Professional Engineer shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   The proposed development will automatically conform to the flood
damage reduction requirements of this ordinance if the natural lowest adjacent
grade (LAG) to the proposed development is at or above the closest applicable
base flood elevation (BFE) specified in the flood insurance study. The
applicant shall be advised to apply for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from
FEMA to have the special flood hazard area designation removed from the
structure or specific area. If the difference between LAG and BFE is modest the
applicant will also be advised to use caution during site preparation or
excavation and information concerning the Preferred Risk Policy should be
provided.
      (2)   The proposed development shall be considered to be within the
special flood hazard area if the natural LAG to the proposed development is
below either;
         A.   The closest applicable BFE specified in the flood insurance
study, or
         B.   The reasonably safe from flooding elevation determined by the
City of Bridgeport in approximate floodplains. The proposed development shall
then be required to conform to all appropriate flood damage reduction
provisions of this article.
            (7-9-12)
1731.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway.  Within any floodway area, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within
the City of Bridgeport during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The
resultant engineering study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by
the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms.
In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (1)   Because floodways present increased risk to human life and property
due to their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodway shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
         A.   New development shall not be permitted in the floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere. In addition to the requirements below
the applicant shall demonstrate that there are no reasonable alternatives other
than the floodway encroachment before a permit is issued.
         B.   When the floodway is the only reasonable alternative the
applicant shall demonstrate that the floodway encroachment is the minimum
necessary to accomplish the project.
         C.   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be
undertaken in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions
contained herein, and in all other applicable codes, ordinances and
regulations.
         D.   In special flood hazard areas for which no regulatory floodway
has been designated, the regulatory floodway for small, single lot development
not incorporating significant amounts of fill can, at the discretion of the
City of Bridgeport, be determined to be the channel of the stream and the
adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the width of the special flood
hazard area as measured from the top of the bank nearest the site to the upland
limit of the 1% annual chance special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   Floodway Fringe . Within any Floodway Fringe area any development and/
or use of land shall be permitted provided that all such uses, activities and/
or development shall be undertaken in strict compliance with the flood-proofing
and related provisions contained herein and in all other applicable codes,
ordinances and regulations.
   (c)   AE without Floodway. Within any AE without Floodway area, no new
construction or development shall be allowed unless it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, will not increase the elevation of the
100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point. This requirement can be
satisfied by utilization of the floodway where determined.
   (d)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A).  
      (1)   Within any Approximated Floodplain
         A.   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
         B.   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine; 1. The amount being invested and, 2. The
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
will be reasonably safe from flooding using elevation data, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses or other techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
are required, they shall only be undertaken by a Registered Professional
Engineer who shall certify that the methods used correctly reflect currently
accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a cover letter,
signed by the responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in
basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be
submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the
Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided
that all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with the flood-proofing and related provisions contained herein and
in all other applicable codes, ordinances and regulations.
   See appendix (d)(4) for Sample "Approximated floodplain (Zone A) techniques"
   (e)   Alteration or relocation of a stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of Bridgeport, The Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). In addition prior to issuing the local
permit the Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary
permits from those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law
requires approval..
   See appendix (d)(5) for Sample "Stream Alteration process and contact sheet"
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Bridgeport in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of culverts, bridges or
other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may require the use of
certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of bridges, culverts or
stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream crossings and localized
flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may include, but are not limited
to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings to be of sufficient size to
pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
article.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the City of Bridgeport a legal
agreement detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed
on altered or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other
stream crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
this agreement to the new owner when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1731.08(c).
      (6)   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood
Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by the
Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose. (7-9-12)
1731.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.
   (a)   General. Permits are required in order to determine whether all new
construction or substantial improvements are:
      (1)   Located in an identified Floodplain, Floodway or other special
flood hazard area.
      (2)   Designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (3)   Constructed with material and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage as outlined in FEMA Technical Bulletin 2 or the most recent revision
thereof.
      (4)   Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (5)   Constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.

Floodplain Administrator for review within five (5) business days of contract
signing. The City of Bridgeport does not require and will not keep copies of
the contracts or addendums. Failure to present contract or addendums for review
shall void the permit. If a licensed contractor is not involved, or the work is
of an aggregate value of less than ten thousand dollars including materials and
labor, a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value
will suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this article.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   For structures to be elevated two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a Registered
Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the method of elevating the proposed structure
including details of proposed fills, pile structures, retaining walls,
foundations, erosion protection measures, etc. When required by the Floodplain
Administrator, a Registered Professional Engineer or Architect shall prepare
these plans.
         D.   Plans showing the methods used to protect utilities (including
sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional
Surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate shall be prepared
by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated qualifications.
The elevation certificate shall confirm that the structure in question,
together with attendant utilities is elevated in compliance with permit
conditions.
         G.   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the City of Bridgeport determines that the area below the first floor
could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas
below base flood elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement shall
state:
            1.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
            2.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1731.08(c).
      (2)   For structures to be flood proofed to two feet above the Base Flood
Elevation (nonresidential structures only):
   All applicants are encouraged to exceed the minimum flood proofing
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a Registered Professional Engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits; certified by
a Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor.
         C.   A Flood proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the Registered Professional Engineer who prepared the
plans in (1) above, stating that the finished structure, together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities is designed so that:
            1.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
used solely for parking of vehicles or limited storage, (Appurtenant Structures
only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An elevation certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a Licensed Professional Surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. The elevation certificate confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            1.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2 are used in the construction of the structure from the lowest
structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that all
utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            2.   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional Engineer or
Architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a non-conversion agreement
and notify prospective buyers of the existence of the agreement. It shall be
the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the non-conversion agreement to
any new owner at closing via notarized signature. A signed copy of the
transferred non-conversion agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain
Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to
the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set
forth in Section
1731.08(c).
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria.
      (1)   Site plans are required for all development, new construction and
substantial improvements determined to be located in a special flood hazard
area and all proposed Subdivisions and Manufactured Home Parks. These proposals
shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure that they are
consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
      (2)   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
         A.   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to special flood hazard areas, proposed lot sites, and
fills.
         B.   Name of Registered Professional Engineer, Licensed Professional
Surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
         C.   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
public utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
Registered Professional Engineer or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall
certify the site plan.
         D.   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments
which are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the
approximated floodplain and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2)
acres, whichever is the lesser, shall include base flood elevation data and
shall delineate a floodway when directed to do so by the Floodplain
Administrator.
            1.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study shall be used to substantiate the base flood.
            2.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
state and local water resource department.
            3.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a Registered Professional Engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts.
         E.   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in
the special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will
take place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the
approximated floodplain area (Zone "A") boundary depicted on the map,
development of detailed Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In
these cases the site plan for the proposed development must show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet, depending on the slope, and clearly
delineate the area to be developed and the location of the special flood hazard
boundary area as scaled from the FEMA map. A Registered Professional Engineer
or Licensed Professional Surveyor shall certify the site plan.
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces not lower
than 1 foot below the elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard
area limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided
lot that is located outside of the special flood hazard area. (7-9-12)
1731.06 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS; DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS .
   In order to prevent excessive damage to buildings, structures, and related
utilities and facilities, the following restrictions apply to all development,

ductwork and utilities, elevated to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation;
or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so
that the structure is water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water from the lowest structural element to two feet above the Base
Flood Elevation.
      (3)   Openings - For all new construction, relocation, substantial
improvements, and repair of substantial damage, those fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to
flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces
on exterior walls by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for
meeting this requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
         B.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.
         C.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (4)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant on all
flood-proofed structures and any elevated structures when the City of
Bridgeport determines that the area below the first floor could be converted to
a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed areas below base flood
elevation that are 5 ft. high or more). This agreement shall state:
         A.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this article.
         B.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the
existence of the non-conversion agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the new owner via
notarized signature, a copy of all new agreements shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1731.08(c).
   (b)   Manufactured Home Placement.  Certain unique characteristics of
manufactured homes installed in special flood hazard areas pose an elevated
risk to safety and substantial damage to property. Therefore;
      (1)   All manufactured homes to be sited within the special flood hazard
areas of City of Bridgeport shall be installed by a contractor possessing a
valid WV Manufactured Home Installer's license. The Licensed Manufactured Home
Installer shall use an installation design engineered to withstand flood
hazards specific to the particular home site. Manufactured homes to be placed
or substantially improved within the special flood hazard areas shall be
installed in accordance with the following standards:
         A.   The lowest floor, ductwork and utilities including HVAC/heat pump
shall be elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation
         B.   Elevation shall be on reinforced piers on a permanent foundation,
or shall use foundation elements of at least equivalent strength engineered for

block piers shall not be used in special flood hazard areas.
         C.   All manufactured homes shall be securely anchored to an
adequately anchored foundation system in compliance with the requirements of 42
West Virginia Code of State Regulations, Series 19, Sections 10.1, 10.2, and
10b as authorized by West Virginia Code § 21-9-4 or the most recent revisions
thereof. The anchoring shall be adequate to resist flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include but are not limited to the
over-the-top and frame ties, attached to permanent foundation elements. Ground
anchors may not be adequate to satisfy flood specific anchoring requirements.
This requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring
requirements for resisting wind forces.
         D.   Permanently attached rigid skirts and/or perimeter wall skirts of
brick or block shall have openings to prevent collapse and damage to supporting
piers. The openings shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces by allowing for entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting
this requirement shall either be certified by a Registered Professional
Engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
            3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         E.   Any additions to a manufactured home shall be similarly anchored
and vented.
      (2)   The licensed WV Manufactured Home Installer placing the unit shall
perform a site inspection and certify in writing that the manufactured home has
been installed to the standards set forth in this ordinance.
                  
   (c)   Appurtenant Structures.
      (1)   Except as provided in subsection (c)(2) below, appurtenant
structures shall be located out of the special flood hazard area or elevated to
two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
         A.   Use of the structure shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
         B.   Structures shall be no more than 200 square feet in size and
valued at less than $5,000.00.
         C.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one side.
         D.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to minimize
flood damage.
         E.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
         F.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical Bulletin
2 shall be used in the portions of the structure below BFE.
         G.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all utilities
shall be located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
         H.   The venting requirements contained in subsection (a) hereof are
applicable and shall be strictly adhered to.
      (3)   A non-conversion agreement shall be signed by the applicant stating
that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or attached garage shall
not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that the structure may be
subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood insurance premiums may be
possible, and that a change in use may require full compliance with this
ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective buyers of the existence
of this agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer
the agreement at closing to the new owner via notarized signature, a copy of
all new agreements shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the agreement and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain
Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1731.08(c).
   (d)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
      (1)   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days. Or,
      (2)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational vehicle
is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached
to the site only by quick disconnect utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions. Or,
      (3)   Be installed in accordance with the Manufactured Home Placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
ordinance.
   (e)   Fill.  The City of Bridgeport officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the floodplain serves in storage and transportation of water during
floods. Therefore;
      (1)   Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is discouraged
and should be minimized.
      (2)   No fill shall be permitted in the floodway.
      (3)   Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
      (4)   No fill shall be permitted unless it meets the requirements of
Section
1731.04(a). All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or
exceed the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect adjacent properties. The City of Bridgeport may require the
applicant to demonstrate through engineering reports that proposed fill would
not adversely affect adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses shall be undertaken only by Registered Professional
Engineers who shall certify that the technical methods used correctly reflect
currently accepted technical concepts. The resultant study shall include a
cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible professional, providing a
statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses,
computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the City of Bridgeport During permit review the City of
Bridgeport shall consider the following issues that have the potential to cause
adverse impact to adjacent properties:
            1.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            2.   Blocking drainage from adjacent property.
            3.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            4.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            5.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to adjacent property
including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, Karst topography, stream
blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   Filled site shall be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in following subsection. For nonresidential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the
building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five (25) percent of the
perimeter of a nonresidential structure.
         E.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         F.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards shall be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         G.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         H.   Fill site and fill shall be protected from erosion.
            1.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            2.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         I.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) from FEMA when directed to
do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After fill
is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR to a Letter of Map Revision
based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a certificate of compliance can be issued.
         J.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps, when notified by
the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs assessed by
FEMA for this purpose.
   (f)   Placement of Structures and Other Development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed or placed on the lot so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to have a
minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
      (1)   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
      (2)   So far as practicable, structures and other development shall be
placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
   (g)   Anchoring.
      (1)   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse.
      (2)   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools and storage tanks
located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly anchored to resist
flotation.
   (h)   Flood Protection Setback.
      (1)   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank or 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall
be maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks, enhance
flood protection and benefit aquatic resources.
      (2)   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection.
      (3)   The Floodplain Administrator may consider an appeal to the Flood
Protection Setback requirement if the applicant demonstrates that it is
impossible to allow any development without encroachment into the Flood
Protection Setback area. The appeal conditions shall be the minimum necessary
and shall be made only after due consideration is given to varying other siting
standards, such as side, front and back lot line setbacks.
   (i)   Storage.
      (1)   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times of
flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation.
      (2)   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to major damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent flotation or
readily removable from the area within the time available after flood warning.
      (3)   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making it
more difficult to enforce this article, material that resembles "fill" material
shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this subsection.
   (j)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
      (1)   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
      (2)   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public or
private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters
into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
      (3)   All other new or replacement public and/or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
      (4)   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (k)   Drainage.  
      (1)   Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure to flood
hazard.
      (2)   Adequate drainage paths are required around structures on slopes
within zones AH and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
   (l)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used for
all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area.

      (9)    The City of Bridgeport shall provide sufficient space to allow the
Floodplain Administrator to keep on file in perpetuity, in a location safe from
natural hazards, all information collected during the course of the
administration of this ordinance.
   (d)    Application Procedures. Application for a permit and/or site plan
approvals shall be made, in writing, on the forms supplied by the City of
Bridgeport, and shall include all information stipulated under Section
1731.05.
   (e)    Changes. After the issuance of a permit or site plan approval by the
Floodplain
Administrator, no changes of any kind shall be made to the application, permit,
or any of the plans, specification or other documents submitted with the
application without the written consent or approval of the Floodplain
Administrator.
   (f)    Permit Placards. The Floodplain Administrator shall issue a permit
placard, which shall be prominently displayed on the premises during the time
construction is in progress. This placard shall show the number of the permit,
the date of its issuance and be signed by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (g)    Start of Construction. Work on the proposed development shall begin
within 180 days after the date of issuance of the permit or the permit shall
expire unless a time extension is granted, in writing, by the Floodplain
Administrator. All work on the proposed development shall be completed within
18 months of permit issuance, at which time the permit shall expire, unless a
time extension is granted in writing by the Floodplain Administrator. The
request for a time extension shall be in writing and shall state the reasons
for the extension. When considering an extension, the Floodplain Administrator
shall consider the following criteria:
      (1)    Has the developer diligently pursued the completion of the
proposed development during the 18 months?
      (2)    Will the granting of the extension be detrimental to public
safety, health, or welfare or injurious to other property?
   
   (h)    Inspections, Stop-Work Orders, Violation Notice and Revocations.
      (1)    Inspections.
         A.    Upon learning of a potential violation of this ordinance, the
Floodplain Administrator or staff shall investigate to determine whether a
violation has occurred.
         B.    During the construction period, the Floodplain Administrator or
other authorized official may inspect the premises to determine that the work
is progressing in compliance with the information provided on the permit
application and with all applicable laws and ordinances.
         C.    The Floodplain Administrator or other authorized official may
inspect any development covered by this or previous ordinance to determine
whether any portion of the development has been altered to be in non-compliance
with the requirements of this article.
      (2)    Stop-Work Orders.
         A.    The Floodplain Administrator shall immediately issue, or cause
to be issued, a "Stop Work Order" for any development found ongoing without
having obtained a floodplain determination or a permit. Disregard of a stop
work order shall subject the violator to the penalties described in Section
1731.08(c).
      (3)    Violation Notice and Revocations. When it appears after
investigation that a permitted development is non-compliant with the provisions
of this law and/or the conditions of the permit, the Floodplain Administrator
shall notify the violator by means of written violation notice. The violation
notice shall specify the nature of the violation and request that the violation
be corrected within fifteen (15) days from the date appearing on the notice.
Failure to correct the violation within this time period shall be cause for
revocation of the permit and the governing body, or authorized employee or
agent to:
         A.    Seek an injunction in the Circuit Court of Harrison County to
restrain the violator from continuing the violation, including but not limited
to requests for the removal of structures or land uses from the property
involved; and
         B.    Seek a misdemeanor conviction in magistrate court or circuit
court.
   (i)    Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)    In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to occupy, or to
permit the use or occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the building or land conforms to the requirements of this local law. Occupying
or using a building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the
violator to the penalties described in Section
1731.08(c).
      (2)    In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to inspect and
approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or
part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until the
inspector is in possession of a copy of the certificate of compliance issued by
the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular development
being inspected conforms to the requirements of this local law. Inspection and
approval of utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator
to the penalties described in Section
1731.08(c).
      (3)    In areas of flood hazard it shall be unlawful to install a
permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until a certificate of
compliance has been issued by the Local Floodplain Administrator stating that
the development conforms to the requirements of this local law. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1731.08(c).
      (4)   A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the Local
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in areas of
special flood hazard.
      (5)    Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in this article or local administrative procedures, and
any finished construction elevation certificate, hydraulic data, flood proofing
certificate, or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a
condition of permit approval.
   (j)    Fees.
      (1)    A Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by the City of Bridgeport.
      (2)    Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this ordinance shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to the City of Bridgeport based upon a set schedule approved by the
City of Bridgeport using the estimated value of the proposed construction as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)    In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing
the City of Bridgeport for any additional costs for services necessary for
review and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
      (4)   Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the County for the additional cost of
processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover this cost
the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by the same
person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.
         (Passed 3-11-19.)
1731.08 APPEALS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   Appeals. Whenever any person is aggrieved by a decision of the
Floodplain Administrator with respect to the provision of this article, it is
the right of that person to appeal to the Town Council of the City of
Bridgeport which shall be known as the Appeals Board. Such appeal shall be
filed with the Town Council of the City of Bridgeport, in writing, within
thirty (30) days after notification of the decision. Upon receipt of such
appeal, the Appeals Board shall set a time and place not less than (ten (10)
nor more than (sixty (60) days for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of
the time and place of the hearing shall be given to all parties at which time
they may appear and be heard. The determination by the Appeals Board shall be
final in all cases.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria.
      (1)   All appeals contesting only the permit fee, the cumulative
substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback requirement, or
the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of the Appeals
Board.
      (2)   All decisions on appeals to all other provisions of this article
shall adhere to the following criteria:
         A.   Affirmative decisions shall only be issued by the Appeals Board
upon (i) a showing of good and sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that
failure to grant the appeal would result in exceptional hardship to the
applicant, and (iii) a determination that the granting of an appeal will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public or conflict with existing locals laws or ordinance.
         B.   An affirmative decision shall be issued only upon determination
that it is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief. Financial hardship, as a sole criterion, shall not be considered
sufficient justification to grant an appeal.
         C.   An affirmative decision shall be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary
to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
         D.   The Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing over the
signature of a City of Bridgeport official that (i) the issuance of a decision
to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood Elevation will result
in increased premium rates for flood insurance, (ii) such construction below
the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and property. Such
notifications shall be maintained with a record of all decisions as required in
paragraph (4) of this section; and
         E.   The Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all decisions
including justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such decisions
issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA)..
         F.   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for any
construction, development, use or activity within any floodway area that would
cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (c)   Penalties. Any person who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this ordinance or direction of the Floodplain
Administrator, or any other authorized employee of the City of Bridgeport,
shall be unlawful and shall be referred to the prosecuting attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Bridgeport of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. In default
of such payment such person shall be imprisoned for a period not to exceed 10
days. Each day during which any violation of this ordinance continues shall
constitute a separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other
actions are hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper
enforcement of this ordinance. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any
violation of, or non-compliance with, this ordinance shall not excuse the
violation or non-compliance with the ordinance or permit it to continue; and
all such persons shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-
compliance within a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed,
enlarged, altered or relocated in non-compliance with this ordinance may be
declared by the Town Council of the City of Bridgeport to be a public nuisance
and abatable as such.
