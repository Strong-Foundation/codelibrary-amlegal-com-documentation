EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, chapters, articles and sections are based on an adoption of the decimal
numbering system which is in accord with the best accepted practice in
instituting a codification. Each section is self-identifying as to code,
article and section number. For example, 305.06 indicates that the code number
is 3, the article number is 305 (or the 5th article within code 3), and the
section number is .06. The code and article numbers appear left of the decimal,
with the code number preceding the first two digits left of the decimal, and
the article number being all digits left of the decimal. The section number
appears right of the decimal. As another example, 113.10 indicates the code
number is 1, the article number is 113 (or the 13th article within code 1), and
the section number is.10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, chapters, and articles
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within articles are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99. Newly created sections
subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three digits right
of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two consecutively
numbered sections. For example, newly created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063
follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given article.

reference shall be deemed to refer to the section or sections as the same shall
then stand or as thereafter amended.

meaning or legal effect of the questions of the subject matter taken as a
whole.
 
 101.08  SEPARABILITY.
   Each section of the Codified Ordinances and every part of each section is an
independent section and part of a section, and the holding of any section or a
part thereof to be unconstitutional, void or ineffective for any cause does not
affect the validity or constitutionality of any other section or part thereof.

remuneration from the City, and does now hereby affirm, ratify and adopt said
State-defined purposes as being the same purposes of this Municipal Government
Ethics Ordinance, without specifically republishing said State purposes herein.
(Passed 8-15-89)

   Council further finds that for the purpose of assisting in the

2, Sections 6 and 7 of the West Virginia Code respecting financial disclosure,
and Chapter 6B, Article 3 regarding the regulation and registration of
lobbyists, and which said statutory provisions the Council hereby expressly
opts not to include as provisions of this article, and affirmatively elects

employees.

West Virginia which are expressly herein adopted and incorporated as provisions
of this article, shall upon enactment by the State Legislature, pursuant to the

article unless the City expressly opts not to adopt any such amendment by

amendments.

effectuate the purposes of this article including the adoption of guidelines
for changes to landmarks and all buildings in designated historic districts,
but no such rules and regulations shall be inconsistent with any plan of the
Planning Commission of the Municipality. If there is a conflict between the
requirements of the zoning district and the requirements for landmarks and for
all buildings in the Historic District, the zoning district requirements apply.
The Commission may adopt and use the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for
Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings. Any
guidelines for changes to landmarks and all property in the Historic District
shall be submitted to the City Council for its approval.
      (13)    Conduct educational programs including the preparation of

materials, colors and construction techniques, drawings, photographs and other
information as may be reasonably deemed necessary by the Commission to enable
it to make a determination on the application. The Commission shall hold a
public hearing upon each application for a certificate of appropriateness.
Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given by publication, in a
newspaper having general circulation in the City, at least seven days before
the hearing and by posting the notice on or near the main entrance of the hall
or room where the Commission usually meets. The Commission shall take such
action as required to inform the owners and tenants of any adjacent property
likely to be affected by the application and shall give the applicant and such
owners and tenants an opportunity to be heard. The applicant shall give notice
to adjacent property owners as directed by the Commission. Persons may give
testimony at the hearing on the application, and persons may submit their views
in writing prior to the public hearing.
      (1)    In reviewing an application and plan, the Commission shall give
consideration to:
         A.   The historical and architectural value or significance of the
landmark, building, structure, or site and its relation to the historic value
of the surrounding area.
         B.   The relationship of the exterior architectural features of a
designated structure to the rest of the structure and to the surrounding area.
         C.   The general compatibility of exterior design, arrangement,
texture, color and materials proposed.
         D.   Signs shall be further regulated as provided in the Zoning
Ordinance, except that all signs must be compatible with the exterior of
existing buildings in the Historic District.
         E.   Any new site element or landscape feature having impact on the
setting or streetscape of the Historic District.
         F.   The general compatibility with adjacent and surrounding
structures and to the street where the structure or element is placed.
      (2)    The Commission shall pass only on exterior features of a structure
and shall not consider interior arrangements; nor shall it disapprove
applications except in regard to the considerations set forth above. Exterior
features shall include such portion of the exterior of a building or structure
as is open to view from a public street, way or place. Architectural features
subject to review shall include the architectural character and general
composition of the exterior of a building or structure, including, but not
limited to, the kind, color and texture of the building material and the type,
design and character of all windows, doors, light fixtures, signs, other
appurtenant elements and natural features when they are integral to the
significance of the site.
      (3)    If the strict application of any provision of this article would
result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue economic hardship upon any
owner of any specific property, the Commission, in passing upon applications,
shall have the power to vary or modify strict adherence to the provisions or to
interpret the meaning of the provision so as to relieve such difficulty or
hardship: provided, that such variance, modification or interpretation shall
remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the provisions so that
architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be
conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the Commission
may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will
in its judgment best fulfill the purpose of this article.
      (4)    In the case of an application for repairs or alterations affecting
the exterior appearance of a structure which the Commission deems of value to
the City that the loss thereof will be a great loss to the City, State or
nation, the Commission shall endeavor to work out with the owner an
economically feasible plan for the preservation of such structure.
      (5)    The review and approvals by the Commission shall extend to all the
properties in the Historic District in order to maintain the character of the
Historic District. It is not the intent of this article to limit new
construction, alteration or repairs to any one period of architectural style.
In reviewing plans for new construction, the Commission shall be aware that it
is important for the new building or structure to make a contribution to
maintaining or strengthening the character of the Historic District. The
Commission shall also be aware of importance of appropriate and compatible
design for new construction that fills a vacant lot on a block in the Historic
District.
      (6)    In their applications, the applicants shall present material about
alternatives to the plans they present, and this material shall include cost
figures obtained for the application. This material shall be submitted in order
to help the Commission in its evaluation of the plans of the applicant.
      (7)    Property owners and tenants are encouraged to have an early
consultation with the Commission during Commission meetings. Owners and tenants
are encouraged to discuss the outlines of their project before they start
preparing their plans and purchasing materials. At its meeting, the Commission
will discuss with owners and tenants their plans and make suggestions about
their plans that will be prepared and submitted to the Commission. This
preliminary discussion is not a substitute for the review required under the
provisions of this article. Concerning signs for commercial property, the
Commission shall regularly remind owners and tenants of the value of an early
consultation so that their application will provide for a sign that is
appropriate for the Historic District.
      (8)    Nothing in this article shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature in or on a
designated historic property, which maintenance or repair does not involve a
material change in design, material or outer appearance thereof, nor shall this
article prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not
prohibited by other laws, ordinances or regulations.
   (c)   (1)   The Commission shall approve the application and issue a
certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed action will be
appropriate. Unless the Commission is satisfied that proposed construction,
alteration or repair will not materially impair the historical or architectural
value or significance of a landmark, or a building, structure or site, situate
within the Historic District, the Commission shall reject the application and
deny the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness. If the applicant wants
to make a change in the approval given, the applicant must return to the
Commission and submit the proposed change for approval under the Commission's
procedures. The Commission shall adopt procedures to make certain that
applicants confirm that they understand what has been approved by the
Commission.
      (2)   If an applicant asks for relief because of economic hardship
involving the proposed alteration, repair or new construction, the applicant
shall submit an affidavit providing information about the property, its annual
expenses and the cost of the proposed work. The applicant shall also submit an
affidavit from the person who will do the proposed work providing information
on the cost of the work and the cost of recent similar work that has been
completed. The applicant may ask that financial information given to the
Commission be kept private. The Commission shall study the question of economic
hardship for the applicant, and it may ask the applicant for additional
material including information on alternatives to the proposed plans. The
Commission shall determine whether the property can be put to reasonable
beneficial use without the approval of the application. If economic hardship is
not proved, the Commission shall turn down the request for relief and shall
deny the application. If the Commission finds economic hardship, it shall
approve the application.
      (3)    In the case of an application to demolish a building or structure,
the applicant shall provide information about the present use of the property,
its annual expenses, its present condition, the cost of any repairs that are
needed and any offers to sell or to buy the property. The applicant shall
present this information through an affidavit and shall also submit an
affidavit about the cost of repairs and the condition of the building or
structure from a person who has rehabilitated three or more buildings. The
applicant may ask that financial information given to the Commission be kept
private. The applicant shall also provide information on the plans for the
property if permission is granted to demolish the building. These plans shall
include financial information and a timetable for completion of the work. If
the Commission finds that these plans are not feasible and that the lot on
which the designated property is located will become a vacant lot, the
Commission may reject the demolition application.
      (4)    The Commission may approve an application to demolish a building
or structure in an Historic District if it finds that the building or structure
does not contribute to the Historic District. On all other demolition
applications, the Commission shall reach a decision based on the other criteria
of this section. The Commission shall endeavor to work out with the applicant
an economically feasible plan for the preservation of the building or
structure.
      (5)    If the applicant asks for relief because of economic hardship
involving the proposed demolition, the Commission shall study the question of
economic hardship for the applicant, and it may ask the applicant for
additional material including information on alternative uses for the building
or structure. The Commission shall determine whether the property can be put to
reasonable beneficial use without the approval of the application. If economic
hardship is not proved, the Commission shall turn down the request for relief
and shall deny the application. If the Commission finds economic hardship, it
shall approve the application. The regulations on proposed demolitions shall
apply to a property owner's request to demolish part of a designated building
or structure.
      (6)    All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness
shall conform to the provisions of such certificate. After the approval has
been given, the Commission may assign one of its members to work with and help
the applicant. While the work is under way, the Commission, helped by the City
staff, shall stay informed about the work being performed in order to ensure
compliance with the certificate. The purpose of this provision is to avoid the
cost to the applicant of redoing work. If work is being performed that is not
in compliance with such certificate, the City shall take the necessary action
to obtain compliance. At its regular meetings the Commission may schedule a
report on the status of the approvals it has given, including the work under
way.
      (7)   When the approved work has been completed, the applicant shall
notify the City, and the Commission shall ask the zoning officer to inspect the
property in order to determine that the work complies with the approval given
by the Commission. Where there has not been compliance, the Commission and the
City shall take further action as needed. Failure to comply with the approval
given by the Commission shall constitute a violation of this article.
      (8)    In the event the Commission rejects an application, it shall place
upon its records and shall transmit a record of this action and reasons
therefore, in writing, to the applicant. In this written record, the Commission
may make recommendations relative to design, arrangement, texture, material and
similar features. The applicant, if he so desires, may make modifications to
the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so.
      (9)    During the meeting at which the applicant's plans are being
considered, he may ask that his application be tabled because he wishes to make
the modifications being suggested by the Commission. The Commission may then
table the application. Where appropriate, the Commission may approve an
application with the requirement that the applicant submit revised plans
showing the modifications that the Commission has suggested.
      (10)    Applicants or their representative shall attend the meeting at
which their application will be considered in order to answer questions that
members of the Commission ask. The Commission has a need to clarify issues
before it approves or rejects an application. The Commission may table an
application until the applicant or a representative attends a Commission
meeting. The Commission may reject an application at the end of the 45 day
period if the applicant or a representative has not attended a Commission
meeting.
   (d)   The Commission shall file with the Zoning Officer its certificate of
appropriateness or rejection of all applications submitted to it for review.
      (1)    No work shall begin until such certificate shall have been filed.
      (2)    In the case of rejection, such certificate shall be binding on the
Zoning Officer and no building permit shall be issued.
   (e)   Where there is any violation of this article the Commission, or the
Zoning Officer shall, through the City Attorney, institute appropriate action
to prevent, enjoin, abate or remove such violation. The violation of this
article shall include starting or completing work on a designated property
without the approval of the Commission where such approval is required.
   (f)   The Commission shall cooperate with and coordinate its activities with
the West Virginia Department of Archives and History, the West Virginia
Historical Society, Greenbrier County Historical Society, and the West Virginia
Antiquities Commission, with the view of developing a unified program for the
identification, study, preservation and protection of all historic buildings,
structures and sites in the Municipality.
   (g)   The Commission shall submit a brief annual report of its activities to
the City Planning Commission, to Council and to the West Virginia Department of
Archives and History. The report shall provide a list of decisions of the
Commission during the year and a list of designated properties threatened by
demolition. The Commission may ask the City staff for assistance in determining
the buildings threatened by demolition and in preparing the report.
141.04 RULES AND REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Any person, individual, firm or corporation proposing to construct,
alter, move, demolish, or repair any landmark, or any building, structure or
site within the Historic District and such changes are visible or intended to
be visible from an adjacent publicway, shall file an application for the same
with the Zoning Officer along with all maps, plats, plans and all other data
concerning such construction. The City shall promptly notify the chair or
secretary of the commission when an application is received. Each application
shall include the following:
      (1)    Scaled elevation and/or suitable photographs of the buildings
facades which are visible from a public way. The applicant shall also submit
suitable photographs of the streetscape showing adjacent buildings including
buildings across the street.
      (2)    Specification of materials, colors, and construction techniques.
      (3)    Other data as required by the rules of the Commission.
   (b)   A Certificate of Appropriateness from the Commission is mandatory
before the following may be undertaken on a landmark or within the Historic
District: construction, moving, demolition, repair or alteration of any
landmark, building, structure or site in any manner affecting the exterior
appearance of such landmark, building, structure or site, if such changes are
visible from an adjacent public way. It shall be the responsibility of property
owners or tenants to submit an application to the Commission when one part of
their plans involves the exterior of the building. This requirement applies to
a situation in which the owner or tenant originally received a permit for work
that did not require review by the Commission.
   (c)   A Certificate of Appropriateness from the Commission shall
automatically expire, unless extended by the Commission, if:
      (1)    In the case of an application for repairs or alterations to a
structure and an application for the demolition or moving of a structure, the
work has not commenced within six months or has not been completed within 18
months from the date of issuance of the Certificate of Appropriateness.
      (2)    In the case of an application for the construction of a new
structure, the work has not commenced within six months from the date of the
Certificate of Appropriateness or is not completed within three years.
   The Commission may ask the City staff for assistance in mailings to
applicants reminding them of the deadline for completion of their approved
work.
   (d)   (1)   Failure of the Commission to act within forty-five days from the
date the application is filed shall constitute approval unless an extension is
agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the Commission. If an extension is
not agreed to and the Commission needs more time to deal with the issues
presented by the application, the Commission may reject the application at the
end of the forty-five day period and at the same time schedule a further
discussion of the application at its next meeting in order to find a
satisfactory solution. This additional time will enable the Commission to carry
out its responsibility to protect Lewisburg's historic buildings.
      (2)    Where appropriate, the members of the Commission may be polled by
telephone in order to act on an application that is pending before the
Commission.
   (e)   There shall be no monetary charge imposed on the applicant by virtue
of this article.
141.05 MAINTENANCE; DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT; EMERGENCY CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Every person in charge of a designated historic property shall keep in
good repair: all of the exterior portions of the building or structure; and all
interior portions thereof which, if not so maintained, may cause it to
deteriorate or become damaged or otherwise to fall into a state of disrepair.
The purpose of this provision is to prevent a person from forcing the
demolition of a building or structure by neglecting it and by permitting damage
to it because of weather or vandalism. A person shall meet the requirements of
this paragraph by complying with the building regulations of the City. No
provision of this article shall be interpreted to require an owner or tenant to
undertake an alteration or to restore a building or structure to its original
appearance.
   (b)   The Commission shall prepare and maintain a list of designated
properties that are not being maintained in a safe and sanitary condition. The
City staff shall help in the preparation and maintenance of this list which
will be based on the City's rules and regulations. The Commission may ask the
Zoning Officer to inspect a building so that it will have current information
on the property. When necessary for reasons of health or safety, the Zoning
Officer may seek access to the interior of a landmark or a building or
structure in the Historic District in accordance with the instructions of the
City Attorney. The Commission shall regularly review its list of deteriorating
properties and may request a meeting with the owner or tenant when the property
is in poor repair. The Commission shall discuss with the owner or tenant ways
to improve the condition of the property. The Commission shall discuss with
City staff the condition of the property and steps to remedy the existing
condition. The steps may include the taking of legal action against the owner
or tenant.
   (c)   In any case where the City determines that there are emergency
conditions dangerous to life, health or property that affect a designated
property, the City shall order the remedying of these conditions without the
approval of the Commission. The City staff shall promptly notify the chair of
the Commission of the action being taken.
141.06 BOUNDARIES.
   The boundaries of the historic district shall be delineated upon a map
described as "Lewisburg Historic District No. 1."and herein incorporated into
this article by reference.

Commission shall submit its report, including maps and photographs as
necessary, to the West Virginia Department of Archives and History. In the case
of a report for a proposed Historic District, the Commission shall submit with
the report a map showing the boundaries of the proposed district. The
Department of Archives and History may prepare written comments within forty-
five days on the report.
   (b)    Council shall hold a public hearing on the proposed designation of
the historic property or Historic District and any proposed regulations and
requirements for the historic property or district. Notice of the hearing shall
be published at least two times in the principal newspaper of general
circulation in the City. Written notice of the hearing shall be mailed by
certified mail with signed return receipt required by the Commission to all
owners and occupants of such properties. All the notices shall be published or
mailed not less than ten or more than twenty days prior to the date set for the
public hearing.
   (c)    Unless the owner of a proposed individual landmark building or fifty
percent (50%) of the ownership interest in a proposed district objects to such
designation or regulations and requirements within thirty days following the
public hearing, Council may designate the property or properties as historic,
and approve, amend or reject the proposed regulations or requirements.
   (d)    Within thirty days following such designation or approval, the owners
and occupants of each designated historic property shall be given written
notification of the designation and approval by Council, which notice shall
apprise the owners and occupants of the necessity of obtaining a certificate of
appropriateness prior to undertaking any material change in the exterior
appearance of the historic landmark or of the property in the Historic
District.
   (e)    Any historic landmark or district designated by the City shall be
shown on the official zoning map of the City in order to provide notice of the
designation in addition to other notification requirements of this article.
   (f)    The steps in this section shall apply to any proposed enlargement of
a Historic District, and the report and public hearing requirements shall apply
to the removal of a designation or to the reduction in size of a Historic
District.
141.08 VIOLATIONS.
   Any person, firm or corporation, or agent of such, found guilty of
constructing, altering, moving, demolishing, or repairing any landmark, or any
building, structure or site within the Historic District where such changes are
visible from a public way without having secured the approval of the Commission
as required by this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
subject to a fine of not more than fifty dollars ($50.00) and costs, and every
day any such violation shall continue to exist shall constitute a separate
offense and shall be punishable as such hereunder.
141.09 NOTICE.
   (a)    The Commission shall arrange for notice in the County land records of
the designation of landmarks and the individual properties in the Historic
District. The City staff shall help the Commission in providing this notice to
the public.
   (b)    Prior to the sale or transfer of a designated landmark or a property
in an Historic District, the owner shall give written notice to the person
acquiring the landmark or the property that it has been designated as historic
and is subject to the provisions of this article. The current owner shall give
written notice to the Commission that this notification has been given. Failure
of the owner to give the required notice shall constitute a violation of this
Article.
141.10 APPEALS.
   Any person or persons, firm or corporation, aggrieved by a decision of the
Commission shall have the right of appeal concerning such decision to the
Greenbrier Circuit Court.

($50.00) or imprisonment for five days.
   (c)   The conviction for contempt, specifying the particular circumstances
of the offense and judgment thereon, shall be entered by the Municipal Judge in

171.07 BAIL BONDS AND CASH DEPOSITS.
   (a)   Except as may be provided otherwise in any case by State Law, this
Code or other Ordinances, whenever any person is arrested for any violation of
an ordinance of the City or for any offense of which the municipal judge has
jurisdiction, it shall be lawful for the Municipal Judge, Recorder, Mayor,
Chief of Police and the desk sergeant or person in charge of police
headquarters to admit such person to bail upon the execution of a bond to the
City in such an amount, not less than twenty-five dollars nor more than the
maximum fine which may be adjudged against such person for the offense or
offenses he is alleged to have committed plus the costs which could be assessed
against him, as in the discretion of the officer will secure the prisoner's
presence, conditioned that the accused will appear upon a day named, before the
municipal judge of the City, to await trial; and every such bond taken shall be
filed as soon as practicable with the Municipal Court by the officer approving
and taking such bond; and the Municipal Judge, Recorder, Mayor, Chief of Police
and the desk sergeant or person in charge of police headquarters shall each
have the power to approve any bond taken under the provisions of this section,
precedence being given to the ranking officer present when such bond is
presented. No person shall be accepted as surety upon any penal bond unless he
shall acknowledge the bond before some official duly authorized by this Code or
by State Law to administer an oath, and shall make oath that he is the owner in
fee of real estate situate in Greenbrier County and worth the amount of the
bond over and above his debts and liabilities; but the officers hereinbefore
named in this section are hereby authorized and empowered to accept a deposit
in cash of an amount, not less than the minimum nor more than the maximum
hereinbefore specified for a bond, which, in the judgment of the officer
accepting the deposit, will be sufficient to cause the prisoner's appearance
upon the day required of him before the Municipal Judge to await trial upon the
charge against him. In the event any person so released upon bond or such
deposit shall fail to appear before the Municipal Judge for trial at the
appointing time, or, having appeared, shall leave the court without awaiting
trial, his bond shall be forfeited thereby to the City, and if a cash deposit
has been made to secure his release, the sum so deposited shall be delivered to
the Municipal Judge and by him promptly turned into the City treasury to the
credit of the general fund and accounted for by him in the same manner that
fines collected by him are counted for; and in the event of the forfeiture of a
penal bond, the Treasurer shall forthwith take the steps necessary at law for
the collection thereof.
   (b)   No cash bond shall be accepted by any officer authorized to accept
such bond unless the prisoner and the officer authorized to accept it are
present at police headquarters. The money deposited as security for any
person's appearance shall be deposited with the desk sergeant at police
headquarters, to be by him safely kept until the next regular session of the
Municipal Court, when it shall be turned over by the desk sergeant who received
it to the judge of the Municipal Court, and by the Judge disposed of as
required by the bond and this and the preceding section.
   (c)   If any officer shall accept or approve any cash bond at any place or
in any other manner than is provided for and authorized by this article, such
unauthorized acceptance or approval shall constitute good cause for his
suspension or removal or the reprimand or fining of such officer after a
hearing on the charge by the City Council. In case of the arrest of any person
upon a charge of a felony, the bond for his release, if approved, shall only be
approved by the Municipal Judge, or the Judge of a court having jurisdiction to
try the prisoner for the felony alleged to have been committed by him.
   (d)   No practicing attorney, officer of the Municipal Court or member of
the Police Department shall be accepted as surety on any bond provided for in
this article.
(Ord. 279. Passed 4-6-19.)
171.08  FINES AND COSTS WHEN DEFENDANTS UNABLE TO PAY.
   (a)   Whenever a person is convicted in the Municipal Court of a violation
of this Code or other ordinance or any rule, regulation, notice or order
promulgated pursuant to authority thereof, and such person is sentenced to pay
a fine, and it shall appear to the court on its own motion or on motion of the
defendant that such defendant is unable to pay such fine forthwith, the court
may order the defendant to pay such fine and any costs which the defendant may
be required to pay in installments or upon such other terms and conditions or
within such period of time as may enable the defendant to pay such fine and
costs.
   (b)   In determining whether a defendant is unable to pay a fine forthwith,
the court may require such defendant to file a petition, under oath with the
court, upon a form provided by the court, setting forth the financial condition
of the defendant.
   (c)   Such form shall be a questionnaire, and shall include, but shall not
be limited to: The name and residence of the defendant; his occupation, if any;
his family status and the number of persons dependent upon him; his monthly
income; whether or not his dependents are employed and, if so, their
approximate monthly income; his banking accounts, if any; real estate owned by
the defendant, or any interest he may have in real estate; income produced
there from; any independent income accruing to the defendant; tangible and
intangible personal property owned by the defendant, or in which he may have an
interest; and a Statement listing the approximate indebtedness of the defendant
to other persons. Such form shall also include a payment plan of the defendant,
if the court should exercise its discretion in permitting the payment of such
fine and costs in installments or other conditions to be fixed by the court. At
the end of such form there shall be printed in boldface type, in a distinctive
color the following: "THIS STATEMENT IS MADE UNDER OATH. ANY FALSE STATEMENT OF
A MATERIAL FACT TO ANY QUESTION CONTAINED HEREIN SHALL CONSTITUTE FALSE
SWEARING AND SHALL BE AN OFFENSE AGAINST THIS SECTION. THE MAXIMUM PENALTY IS
$100 FINE OR THIRTY DAYS IN JAIL, OR BOTH." A copy of the petition shall be
retained by the defendant.
   (d)   If the defendant is unable to read or write, the court or the clerk
may assist the defendant in completing the petition and require him to affix
his mark thereto. The consequences of the making of a false Statement shall be
explained to such defendant.
   (e)   If a defendant is sentenced to pay a fine and payment of the fine or
fine and costs is ordered to be made on an installment basis or on other
conditions under the provisions of section 11-17, and if the defendant is also
placed on probation or imposition of the execution of sentence is suspended,
the court may make payment of the fine a condition of probation or suspension
of sentence.
   (f)   If a defendant is permitted to pay a fine or fine and costs on an
installment basis or under such other conditions as the court shall fix under
the provisions of section 11-17, the court may require as a condition that the
defendant be of peace and good behavior until the fine and costs are paid.
   (g)   When any person sentenced to pay a fine defaults in the payment of any
such fine or of any installment thereof, the court may issue a summons for such
person to appear before the court for a hearing on the question of whether such
person's failure to pay the fine or any installment was attributable to
intentional refusal to comply with the prior order of the court or to a lack of
a good faith effort to comply therewith. The court may, after hearing, order
that the person in default be allowed additional time for payment, may reduce
or remit the amount of the fine or the unpaid portion thereof in whole or in
part, or upon a finding that the default was intentional or due to the lack of
a good faith effort to comply with the prior order of the court, may order such
person confined for such period up to thirty days as the court in its
discretion shall determine.
(Ord. 279. Passed 4-6-19.)

   (a)   Administrative Fee Per Summons. A Municipal Court Fee of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) is hereby established to be assessed on each summons, upon
conviction.

provisions of this Traffic Code, unless otherwise directed by a traffic or
police officer, subject to the exceptions granted the driver of an authorized
emergency vehicle in this Traffic Code.
   (b)   No provision of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall
be enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible

though no signs are erected or in place.
(WVaC 17C-3-4)
313.02 OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS AT STREET CONSTRUCTION.

   Whenever traffic is controlled by traffic control signals exhibiting the

used and such terms and lights shall indicate and apply to drivers of vehicles
and pedestrians as follows:
   (a)   Green alone or "go":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal, except when prohibited under
Section
343.02, may proceed straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at
such place prohibits either such turn. But vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left, shall yield the right of way to other vehicles
and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection or an adjacent crosswalk at
the time such signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing the signal may proceed across the roadway within
any marked or unmarked crosswalk.
   (b)   Yellow alone or "caution" when showing following the green or "go"
signal:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal is thereby warned that the red
or "stop" signal will be exhibited immediately thereafter and such vehicular
traffic shall not enter or be crossing the intersection when the red or "stop"
signal is exhibited.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing such signal are thereby advised that there is
insufficient time to cross the roadway, and any pedestrian then starting to
cross shall yield the right of way to all vehicles.
   (c)   Red alone or "stop":
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing the signal shall stop before entering the
crosswalk on the near side of the intersection or, if none, then before
entering the intersection and shall remain standing until green or "go" is
shown alone except as provided in subsection (c)(2) and (3) hereof.
      (2)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection, may
cautiously make a right turn but such vehicle shall yield the right of way to
pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other vehicular traffic
proceeding as directed by the signal at such intersection, except that Council
may by ordinance prohibit any such right turn against a red or "stop" signal at
any intersection which ordinance shall be effective when a sign is erected at
such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (3)   A vehicle which is stopped in obedience to a red or "stop" signal
as close as practicable at the entrance to the crosswalk on the near side of
the intersection or, if none, then at the entrance to the intersection on a
one-way street which intersects another one-way street on which traffic moves
to the left, may cautiously make a left turn into the one-way street but such
vehicle shall yield the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk
and to other vehicular traffic proceeding as directed by the signal at such
intersection, except that Council may by ordinance prohibit any such left turn
against a red or "stop" signal at any intersection, which ordinance shall be
effective when a sign is erected at such intersection giving notice thereof.
      (4)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (d)   Red with green arrow:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing such signal may cautiously enter the
intersection only to make the movement indicated by such arrow but shall yield
the right of way to pedestrians lawfully within a crosswalk and to other
traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (2)   No pedestrian facing such signal shall enter the roadway unless he
can do so safely and without interfering with any vehicular traffic.
   (e)   In the event an official traffic control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
      (WVaC 17C-3-5)
313.04 PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words "walk" or
"wait" are in place such signals shall indicate as follows:
   (a)   Walk. Pedestrians facing such signal may proceed across the roadway in
the direction of the signal and shall be given the right of way by the drivers
of all vehicles.
   (b)   Wait. No pedestrian shall start to cross the roadway in the direction
of such signal, but any pedestrian who has partially completed his or her
crossing on the walk signal shall proceed to a sidewalk or safety island while
the wait signal is showing.
      (WVaC 17C-3-6)
313.05 FLASHING TRAFFIC SIGNALS.
   Whenever an illuminated flashing red or yellow signal is used in a traffic
sign or signal it shall require obedience by vehicular traffic as follows:
   (a)   Flashing Red (Stop Signal). When a red lens is illuminated with rapid
intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles shall stop before entering the
nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at a limit line when marked, or, if
none, then before entering the intersection and the right to proceed shall be
subject to the rules applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
   (b)   Flashing Yellow (Caution Signal). When a yellow lens is illuminated
with rapid intermittent flashes, drivers of vehicles may proceed through the
intersection or past such signal only with caution.
   Local authorities, in areas that experience low traffic times, may permit
flashing signals between the hours of eleven o’clock p.m. and six o’clock a.m.
(WVaC 17C-3-7)
313.06 UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No local authority or person shall place, maintain or display upon or
in view of any street or highway any unauthorized traffic control device or
traffic control signal, or any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device
which purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic
control device or railroad sign or signal, or which attempts to direct the
movement of traffic or which hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official traffic control device or any railroad sign or
signal, and no person shall place or maintain nor shall any public authority
permit upon any street or highway any traffic control device bearing thereon
any commercial advertising. This shall not be deemed to prohibit the erection
upon private property adjacent to a street or highway of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for official
signs.
   (b)   Every such prohibited device, signal, sign or marking is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance and the Commissioner of Highways or other
authority having jurisdiction over the street or highway is hereby empowered to
remove the same or cause it to be removed without notice.
(WVaC 17C-3-8)
313.07 ALTERATION, INJURY, REMOVAL OF TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   No person shall without lawful authority attempt to or in fact alter,
deface, injure, knock down or remove any official traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal or any inscription, shield or insignia thereon, or any
other part thereof.
(WVaC 17C-3-9)

   (b)   No person shall violate any posted speed restriction or traffic
restriction at such construction site referred to in subsection (a) of this

section, if the person has been previously arrested for, or charged with, a
violation of this section which is alleged to have occurred within the
applicable time period for prior offenses, notwithstanding the fact that there
has not been a final adjudication of the charges for the alleged previous
offense. In that case, the warrant or indictment or information must set forth
the date, location, and particulars of the previous offense or offenses. No
person may be convicted of a second or subsequent offense under this section
unless the conviction for the previous offense has become final, or the person
has previously had a period of conditional probation imposed pursuant to West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b.
   (m)   The fact that any person charged with a violation of subsection (b),
(c), (d), or (e) of this section, or any person permitted to drive as described

this section.

of this article are mandatory and are not subject to suspension or probation:

a first offense under this section: provided, however, that the court may
impose a term of conditional probation pursuant to West Virginia Code 17C-5-2b

as an alternative sentence to any period of incarceration required by this
section for a first or subsequent offense: provided, further, that for any
period of home incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a second offense
under this section, electronic monitoring shall be required for no fewer than
five days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may
not leave home for those five days notwithstanding the provisions of West
Virginia Code 62-11B-5: and provided further, that for any period of home
incarceration ordered for a person convicted of a third or subsequent violation

days of the total period of home confinement ordered and the offender may not
leave home for those ten days notwithstanding West Virginia Code 62-11B-5.

this section must complete a comprehensive safety and treatment program as set
forth in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3 before his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle can be reinstated and his or her driving privileges restored.
   (p)   For any offense for which an alternative revocation period is
permitted conditioned upon participation in the test and lock program, an
alternative sentence may not be imposed without the consent of the driver.
   (q)   Upon entering the order of conviction for an offense under this
section, or the imposition of conditional probation as provided in West
Virginia Code 17C-5-2b, the clerk of the court shall immediately transmit the

CONDITION OF PARTICIPATION IN MOTOR VEHICLE ALCOHOL TEST AND LOCK PROGRAM;
PROCEDURE ON CHARGE OF VIOLATION OF CONDITIONS.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsections (g) hereof, whenever any person who
has not previously been convicted of any offense under this article or under
any statute of the United States or of any state relating to driving under the
influence alcohol, any controlled substance or any other drug:
      (1)    Notifies the court within thirty days of his or her arrest of his
or her intention to participate in a deferral pursuant to this section; and
      (2)    Pleads guilty to or is found guilty of driving under the influence
of alcohol under Section
333.01(c)(2), the court, without entering a judgment of guilt and with the
consent of the accused, shall defer further proceedings and, notwithstanding
any provisions of this code to the contrary, place him or her on probation,
which conditions shall include, that he or she successfully completes the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program as provided in Section Three-a, Article
Five-a of the WV State Code. Participation therein shall be for a period of at
least one hundred and sixty five days after he or she has served the fifteen
days of license suspension imposed pursuant to Section Two, Article Five-a of
the WV State Code.
   (b)   A defendant's election to participate in deferral under this section
shall constitute a waiver of his or her right to an administrative hearing as
provided in Section Two, Article Five-a, of the WV State Code.
   (c)    (1)    If the prosecuting attorney files a motion alleging that the
defendant during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock program
has been removed therefrom by the Division of Motor Vehicles, or has failed to
successfully complete the program before making a motion for dismissal pursuant
to subsection (d) hereof, the court may issue such process as is necessary to
bring the defendant before the court.
      (2)    A motion alleging such violation filed pursuant to subsection (c)
(1) hereof must be filed during the period of the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test
and Lock Program or, if filed thereafter, must be filed within a reasonable
time after the alleged violation was committed.
      (3)   When the defendant is brought before the court, the court shall
afford the defendant an opportunity to be heard. If the court finds that the
defendant has been rightfully removed from the Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and
Lock Program by the Division of Motor Vehicles, the court may order, when
appropriate, that the deferral be terminated, and thereupon enter an
adjudication of guilt and proceed as otherwise provided.
      (4)   Should the defendant fail to complete or be removed from the Motor
Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program, the defendant waives the appropriate
statute of limitations and the defendant's right to a speedy trial under any
applicable Federal or State constitutional provisions, statutes or rules of
court during the period of enrollment in the program.
   (d)   When the defendant shall have completed satisfactorily the Motor

defendant may move the court for an order dismissing the charges. This motion
shall be supported by affidavit of the defendant and by certification of the
Division of Motor Vehicles that the defendant has successfully completed the
Motor Vehicle Alcohol Test and Lock Program. A copy of the motion shall be
served on the prosecuting attorney who shall within 30 days after service
advise the judge of any objections to the motion, serving a copy of such
objections on the defendant or the defendant's attorney. If there are no
objections filed within the 30-day period, the court shall thereafter dismiss
the charges against the defendant. If there are objections filed with regard to
the dismissal of charges, the court shall proceed as set forth in subsection
(c) hereof.
   (e)   Except as provided herein, unless a defendant adjudicated pursuant to
this subsection be convicted of a subsequent violation of this article,
discharge and dismissal under this section shall be without adjudication of
guilt and is not a conviction for purposes of disqualifications or disabilities
imposed by law upon conviction of a crime except for those provided in article
five-a of this chapter. Except as provided in Section
333.01(j)(k) and (l) regarding subsequent offenses, the effect of the dismissal
and discharge shall be to restore the person in contemplation of law to the
status he or she occupied prior to arrest and trial. No person as to whom a
dismissal and discharge have been effected shall be thereafter held to be
guilty of perjury, false swearing, or otherwise giving a false statement by
reason of his or her failure to disclose or acknowledge his or her arrest or
trial in response to any inquiry made of him or her for any purpose other than
any inquiry made in connection with any subsequent offense as that term is
defined in Section
333.01(l).

respect to any person.

person under this section, the person may apply to the court for an order to
expunge from all official records all recordations of his or her arrest, trial,
and conviction, pursuant to this section except for those maintained by the
Division of Motor Vehicles: provided, that any person who has previously been
convicted of a felony may not make a motion for expungement pursuant to this
section.
      (2)   If the prosecuting attorney objects to the expungement, the
objections shall be filed with the court within 30 days after service of a
motion for expungement and copies of the objections shall be served on the
defendant or the defendant's attorney.
      (3)   If the objections are filed, the court shall hold a hearing on the
objections, affording all parties an opportunity to be heard. If the court
determines after a hearing that the person during the period of his or her
probation and during the period of time prior to his or her application to the
court under this subsection has not been guilty of any serious or repeated
violation of the conditions of his or her probation, it shall order the
expungement.
   (i)   Notwithstanding any provision of this code to the contrary, any person
prosecuted for a violation of Section
333.01(c) whose case is disposed of pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be liable for any court costs assessable against a person convicted of a
violation of Section

333.03 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   Any person who drives a motor vehicle in this State is deemed to have
given his or her consent by the operation of the motor vehicle to a preliminary
breath analysis and a secondary chemical test of either his or her blood,
breath or urine for the purposes of determining the alcoholic content of his or
her blood.
   (b)    A preliminary breath analysis may be administered in accordance with
the provisions of section five of this article whenever a law-enforcement
officer has reasonable cause to believe a person has committed an offense
prohibited by Section
333.01 or by an ordinance of a municipality of this State which has the same
elements as an offense described in Section
333.01.
   (c)    A secondary test of blood, breath or urine is incidental to a lawful
arrest and is to be administered at the direction of the arresting law-
enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the person has
committed an offense prohibited by Section
333.01 or by an ordinance of a municipality of this State which has the same
elements as an offense described in Section
333.01.
   (d)    The law-enforcement agency that employs the law-enforcement officer
shall designate which type of secondary test is to be administered: provided,
that if the test designated is a blood test and the person arrested refuses to
submit to the blood test, then the law-enforcement officer making the arrest
shall designate either a breath or urine test to be administered.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section
333.06, the refusal to submit to a blood test only may not result in the
revocation of the arrested person's license to operate a motor vehicle in this
state.
   (e)    Any person to whom a preliminary breath test is administered who is
then arrested shall be given a written statement advising him or her that his
or her refusal to submit to the secondary chemical test pursuant to subsection
(d) hereof, will result in the revocation of his or her license to operate a
motor vehicle in this State for a period of at least one year and up to life.
   (f)    Any law-enforcement officer who has been properly trained in the
administration of any secondary chemical test authorized by this article,
including, but not limited to, certification by the division of health in the
operation of any equipment required for the collection and analysis of a breath
sample, may conduct the test at any location in the county wherein the arrest
is made: Provided, That the law-enforcement officer may conduct the test at the
nearest available properly functioning secondary chemical testing device
located outside the county in which the arrest was made, if (1) there is no
properly functioning secondary chemical testing device located within the
county the arrest was made or (2) there is no magistrate available within the
county the arrest was made for the arraignment of the person arrested. A law-
enforcement officer who is directing that a secondary chemical test be
conducted has the authority to transport the person arrested to where the
secondary chemical testing device is located. 
   (g)    If the arresting officer lacks proper training in the administration
of a secondary chemical test, then any other law-enforcement officer who has
received training in the administration of the secondary chemical test to be
administered may, upon the request of the arresting law-enforcement officer and
in his or her presence, conduct the secondary test. The results of a test
conducted pursuant to this subsection may be used in evidence to the same
extent and in the same manner as if the test had been conducted by the
arresting law-enforcement officer.
   (h)    Only the person actually administering or conducting a test conducted
pursuant to this article is competent to testify as to the results and the
veracity of the test.
   (i)    For the purpose of this article, the term "law-enforcement officer"
or "police officer" means:
      (1)    Any member of the West Virginia State Police;
      (2)    Any sheriff and any deputy sheriff of any county;
      (3)    Any member of a police department in any municipality as defined

West Virginia Code who has completed the course of instruction at a law-
enforcement training academy as provided for under the provisions of Section
Nine, Article Twenty-Nine, Chapter Thirty of the West Virginia Code.
   (j)   A law-enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to believe that
person has committed an offense prohibited by Section Eighteen, Article Seven,
Chapter Twenty of the West Virginia Code, relating to the operation of a
motorboat, jet ski or other motorized vessel, shall follow the provisions of
this section in administering, or causing to be administered, a preliminary
breath analysis and the secondary chemical test of the accused person's blood,
breath or urine for the purpose of determining alcohol content of his or her
blood.
(Ord. 211. Passed 7-20-10.)
333.04 PRELIMINARY BREATH ANALYSIS.
   When a law-enforcement officer of this City has reason to believe a person
has committed an offense prohibited by Section
333.01, the law-enforcement officer may require such person to submit to a
preliminary breath analysis for the purpose of determining such person's blood
alcohol content. Such breath analysis must be administered as soon as possible
after the law-enforcement officer has a reasonable belief that the person has
been driving while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or
drugs. Any preliminary breath analysis required under this section must be
administered with a device and in a manner approved by the Department of Health
for that purpose. The results of a preliminary breath analysis shall be used
solely for the purpose of guiding the officer in deciding whether an arrest
should be made. When a driver is arrested following a preliminary breath
analysis, the tests as hereinafter provided in this article shall be
administered in accordance with the provisions thereof.
(Ord. 211. Passed 7-20-10.)
333.05 ADMINISTRATION OF TEST.
   Only a doctor of medicine or osteopathy, or registered nurse, or trained
medical technician at the place of his employment, acting at the request and
direction of the arresting law-enforcement officer, may withdraw blood for the
purpose of determining the alcoholic content thereof. These limitations shall
not apply, to the taking of a breath test or a urine specimen. In withdrawing
blood for the purpose of determining the alcoholic content thereof, only a
previously unused and sterile needle and sterile vessel may be utilized and the
withdrawal shall otherwise be in strict accord with accepted medical practices.
A nonalcoholic antiseptic shall be used for cleansing the skin prior to
venipuncture. The person tested may, at his own expense, have a doctor of
medicine or osteopathy, or registered nurse, or trained medical technician at
the place of his employment, of his own choosing, administer a chemical test in
addition to the test administered at the direction of the law-enforcement
officer. Upon the request of the person who is tested, full information
concerning the test taken at the direction of the law-enforcement officer shall
be made available to him or her. No person who administers any such test upon
the request of a law-enforcement officer as herein defined, no hospital in or
with which such person is employed or is otherwise associated or in which such
test is administered, and no other person, firm or corporation by whom or with
which such person is employed or is in any way associated, shall be in anywise
criminally liable for the administration of such test, or civilly liable in
damages to the person tested unless for gross negligence or willful or wanton
injury.
(Ord. 211. Passed 7-20-10.)
333.06 REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO TESTS.
   (a)   If any person under arrest as specified in Section
333.03 refuses to submit to any secondary chemical test, the tests shall not be
given: provided, that prior to the refusal, the person is given an oral warning
and a written statement advising him or her that his or her refusal to submit
to the secondary test finally designated will result in the revocation of his
or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this State for a period of at
least forty-five days and up to life; and that after fifteen minutes following
the warnings the refusal is considered final. The arresting officer after that
period of time expires has no further duty to provide the person with an
opportunity to take the secondary test. The officer shall, within forty-eight
hours of the refusal, sign and submit to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles a
written statement of the officer that:
      (1)   He or she had reasonable grounds to believe the person had been
driving a motor vehicle in this State while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs;
      (2)   The person was lawfully placed under arrest for an offense relating
to driving a motor vehicle in this state while under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs;
      (3)   The person refused to submit to the secondary chemical test finally
designated in the manner provided in Section
333.03; and
      (4)   The person was given a written statement advising him or her that
his or her license to operate a motor vehicle in this state would be revoked
for a period of at least forty-five days and up to life if he or she refused to
submit to the secondary test finally designated in the manner provided in
Section
333.03. The signing of the statement required to be signed by this section
constitutes an oath or affirmation by the person signing the statement that the
statements contained in the statement are true and that any copy filed is a
true copy. The statement shall contain upon its face a warning to the officer
signing that to willfully sign a statement containing false information
concerning any matter or thing, material or not material, is false swearing and
is a misdemeanor. Upon receiving the statement the commissioner shall make and
enter an order revoking the person's license to operate a motor vehicle in this
state for the period prescribed by this section.
   For the first refusal to submit to the designated secondary chemical test,
the commissioner shall make and enter an order revoking the person's license to
operate a motor vehicle in this state for a period of one year or forty-five
days, with an additional one year of participation in the Motor Vehicle Alcohol
Test and Lock Program in accordance with the provisions of West Virginia Code
17C-5A-3a; provided, that a person revoked for driving while under the
influence of drugs is not eligible to participate in the Motor Vehicle Test and
Lock Program. The application for participation in the Motor Vehicle Alcohol
Test and Lock Program shall be considered to be a waiver of the hearing
provided in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. If the commissioner has previously
revoked the person's license under the provisions of this section, the
commissioner shall, for the refusal to submit to the designated secondary
chemical test, make and enter an order revoking the person's license to operate
a motor vehicle in this state for a period of ten years: provided, however,
that the license may be reissued in five years in accordance with the
provisions of West Virginia Code 17C-5A-3a. If the commissioner has previously
revoked the person's license more than once under the provisions of this
section, the commissioner shall, for the refusal to submit to the designated
secondary chemical test, make and enter an order revoking the person's license
to operate a motor vehicle in this state for a period of life. A copy of each
order shall be forwarded to the person by registered or certified mail, return
receipt requested, and shall contain the reasons for the revocation and shall
specify the revocation period imposed pursuant to this section. A revocation
shall not become effective until ten days after receipt of the copy of the
order. Any person who is unconscious or who is otherwise in a condition
rendering him or her incapable of refusal shall be considered not to have
withdrawn his or her consent for a test of his or her blood, breath or urine as
provided in section four of this article and the test may be administered
although the person is not informed that his or her failure to submit to the
test will result in the revocation of his or her license to operate a motor
vehicle in this state for the period provided for in this section. A revocation
under this section shall run concurrently with the period of any suspension or
revocation imposed in accordance with other provisions of this code and growing
out of the same incident which gave rise to the arrest for driving a motor
vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs
and the subsequent refusal to undergo the test finally designated in accordance
with the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C- 5A-4.
   (b)    For the purposes of this section, where reference is made to previous
suspensions or revocations under this section, the following types of
suspensions or revocations shall also be regarded as suspensions or revocations
under this section:
      (1)   Any suspension or revocation on the basis of a conviction under a
municipal ordinance of another state or a statute of the United States or of
any other state of an offense which has the same elements as an offense
described in West Virginia Code 17C-5A-2 for conduct which occurred on or after
the tenth day of June, one thousand nine hundred eighty-three; and
      (2)   Any revocation under the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C- 5A 1
or 2 for conduct which occurred on or after the tenth day of June, one thousand
nine hundred eighty-three.
   (c)    A person whose license to operate a motor vehicle in this state has
been revoked shall be afforded an opportunity to be heard, in accordance with
the provisions of West Virginia Code 17C 5A 2.

333.07 INTERPRETATION AND USE OF CHEMICAL TEST.
   (a)    Upon trial for the offense of driving a motor vehicle in this state
while under the influence of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, or upon
the trial of any civil or criminal action arising out of acts alleged to have
been committed by any person driving a motor vehicle while under the influence
of alcohol, controlled substances or drugs, evidence of the amount of alcohol
in the person's blood at the time of the arrest or of the acts alleged, as
shown by a chemical analysis of his or her blood, breath or urine, is
admissible, if the sample or specimen was taken within two hours from and after
the time of arrest or of the acts alleged. The evidence gives rise to the
following presumptions or has the following effect:
      (1)   Evidence that there was, at that time, five hundredths of one
percent or less, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood, is prima facie
evidence that the person was not under the influence of alcohol;
      (2)   Evidence that there was, at that time, more than five hundredths of
one percent and less than eight hundredths of one percent, by weight, of
alcohol in the person's blood is relevant evidence, but it is not to be given
prima facie effect in indicating whether the person was under the influence of
alcohol;
      (3)   Evidence that there was, at that time, eight hundredths of one
percent or more, by weight, of alcohol in his or her blood, shall be admitted
as prima facie evidence that the person was under the influence of alcohol.
   (b)    A determination of the percent, by weight, of alcohol in the blood
shall be based upon a formula of:
      (1)   The number of grams of alcohol per one hundred cubic centimeters of
blood;
      (2)   The number of grams of alcohol per two hundred ten liters of
breath;
      (3)   The number of grams of alcohol per sixty-seven milliliters of
urine; or
      (4)   The number of grams of alcohol per eighty-six milliliters of serum.
   (c)    A chemical analysis of a person's blood, breath or urine, in order to
give rise to the presumptions or to have the effect provided for in subsection
(a) hereof, must be performed in accordance with methods and standards approved
by the state division of health. A chemical analysis of blood or urine to
determine the alcohol content of blood shall be conducted by a qualified
laboratory or by the state police scientific laboratory of the criminal
identification bureau of the West Virginia state police.
   (d)    The provisions of this article do not limit the introduction in any
administrative or judicial proceeding of any other competent evidence bearing
on the question of whether the person was under the influence of alcohol,
controlled substances or drugs.

law-enforcement officer, shall have the right to demand that a sample or
specimen of his blood, breath or urine be taken within two hours from and after
the time of arrest, and that a chemical test thereof be made. The analysis
disclosed by such chemical test shall be made available to such arrested person
forthwith upon demand.
(Ord. 211. Passed 7-20-10.)
333.09 FEE.
   A reasonable fee shall be allowed to the person withdrawing a blood sample
or administering a urine test at the request and direction of a law-enforcement
officer in accordance with the provisions of this article. If the person whose
blood sample was withdrawn or whose urine was tested was arrested and charged
with a violation of section two of this article, the county having venue of
such charge shall pay said fee, and if said person is subsequently convicted of
such charge, such fee shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the criminal
proceeding and shall be paid, notwithstanding any other provision of this code
to the contrary, into the general fund of said county. If the person whose
blood sample was withdrawn or whose urine was tested was arrested and charged
with a violation of a similar ordinance of any municipality, said municipality
shall pay said fee, and if said person is subsequently convicted of such
charge, such fee shall be taxed as a part of the costs of the criminal
proceeding and shall be paid, notwithstanding any other provision of this code
to the contrary, into the general fund of said municipality.

height. All accessible parking spaces should have a signpost in front or
adjacent to the accessible parking space displaying the international symbol of
access sign mounted at a minimum of eight feet above the pavement or sidewalk
and the top of the sign. Lines or markings on the pavement or curbs for parking
spaces and access aisles may be in any color, although blue is the generally

issued pursuant to West Virginia Code 17A-3-14(c)(6) shall be recognized and
accepted as meeting the requirements of this section.
   (d)   A vehicle from any other state, United States territory or foreign

all times.
   (f)   Any person whose vehicle properly displays a valid, unexpired special
registration plate or removable windshield placard may park the vehicle for
unlimited periods of time in parking zones unrestricted as to length of parking
time permitted: Provided, that this privilege does not mean that the vehicle
may park in any zone where stopping, standing or parking is prohibited or which
creates parking zones for special types of vehicles or which prohibits parking
during heavy traffic periods during specified rush hours or where parking would
clearly present a traffic hazard. To the extent any provision of any ordinance
of any political subdivision of this State is contrary to the provisions of
this section, the provisions of this section take precedence and apply.
   The parking privileges provided for in this subsection apply only during
those times when the vehicle is being used for the loading or unloading of a
person with a mobility impairment. Any person who knowingly exercises, or
attempts to exercise these privileges at a time when the vehicle is not being
used for the loading or unloading of a person with a mobility impairment, upon
first conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he or she may
otherwise incur, shall be fined two hundred dollars ($200.00); upon second

registration plate or removable windshield placard may not stop, stand or park
a motor vehicle in an area designated, zoned or marked for accessible parking
with signs or instructions displaying the international symbol of access,
either by itself or with explanatory text. The signs may be mounted on a post
or a wall in front of the accessible parking space and instructions may appear
on the ground or pavement, but use of both methods is preferred. Accessible
parking spaces for vans having an eight-foot adjacent access aisle should be
designated as “van accessible” but may be used by any vehicle displaying a
valid special registration plate or removable windshield placard.
   Any person who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (h)   All signs that designate areas as “accessible parking” or that display
the international symbol of access shall also include the words “Up to $500
fine”.
   (i)   No person may stop, stand or park a motor vehicle in an area
designated or marked off as an access aisle adjacent to a van-accessible
parking space or regular accessible parking space. Any person, including a

registration plate, who violates the provisions of this subsection is guilty of
a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined two hundred dollars
($200.00); upon second conviction thereof, in addition to any other penalty he
or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined three hundred dollars ($300.00); and
upon third and subsequent convictions thereof, in addition to any other penalty
he or she may otherwise incur, shall be fined five hundred dollars ($500.00).
   (j)   Parking enforcement personnel who otherwise enforce parking violations
may issue citations for violations of this section and shall reference the
number on the vehicle’s license plate, since the driver normally will not be
present.
   (k)   Law-enforcement agencies may establish a program to use trained
volunteers to collect information necessary to issue citations to persons who
illegally park in designated accessible parking spaces. Any law-enforcement
agency choosing to establish a program shall provide for workers’ compensation
and liability coverage. The volunteers shall photograph the illegally parked
vehicle and complete a form, to be developed by supervising law-enforcement
agencies, that includes the vehicle’s license plate number, date, time and
location of the illegally parked vehicle. The photographs must show the vehicle
in the accessible space and a readable view of the license plate. Within the
discretion of the supervising law-enforcement agency, the volunteers may issue
citations or the volunteers may submit the photographs of the illegally parked
vehicle and the form to the supervising law-enforcement agency, who may issue a
citation, which includes the photographs and the form, to the owner of the
illegally parked vehicle. Volunteers shall be trained on the requirements for
citations for vehicles parked in marked, zoned or designated accessible parking
areas by the supervising law-enforcement agency.
   (l)   Local authorities who adopt the basic enforcement provisions of this
section and issue their own local ordinances shall retain all fines and
associated late fees. These revenues shall be used first to fund the provisions
of subsection (k) of this section, if adopted by local authorities, or
otherwise shall go into the local authorities’ General Revenue Fund. Otherwise,
any moneys collected as fines shall be collected for and remitted to the state.

motor vehicle after payment of such expenses shall be held for the last
registered owner of such motor vehicle or any lienholder for ninety days, after
which time, if no owner or lienholder claims the remainder, it shall be
deposited in said special fund.
   (c)   Any money so collected and deposited in such special fund shall be
used solely for the payment of auction, towing, removing, preserving, storing,
notice and publication costs which result from taking other abandoned motor

change the motor-powered speed capability or motor engagement between pedal-

subsection are not applicable to a modified electric bicycle operated solely
and exclusively on a person’s own property.

trails where traditional, non-electronic bicycle use is allowed will be given

rule intends to facilitate increased access to public lands that may otherwise
be inaccessible to those with disabilities, health issues, or age-related
limitations.
      (2)   A Class 3 electric bicycle may not be operated on a bicycle path,
multiuse trail, or single-use trail unless it is within a highway or roadway:
provided, that the provisions of this subdivision are not applicable to a

   (c)   In addition to any penalty provided under Section
501.99 and any restitution which may be ordered by the court pursuant to West
Virginia Code 61-11A-5, the court may order any person convicted of a violation
of subsection (a) of this section to pay all or any portion of the cost of
medical, psychological or psychiatric treatment provided the child resulting
from the acts for which the person is convicted.
   (d)   This section does not apply to any parent, guardian or custodian who
fails or refuses, or allows another person to fail or refuse, to supply a child

necessary medical care, when medical care conflicts with the tenets and
practices of a recognized religious denomination or order of which parent,
guardian or custodian is an adherent or member.
   (e)   It is not an essential element of the offense created by this section
that the minor actually be delinquent.
   (f)   Upon conviction, the court may suspend the sentence of a person found
guilty under this section. A suspended sentence may be subjected to the
following terms and conditions:

becomes forfeited is recoverable without a separate suit. The court may cause a
citation or a summons to issue to the principal and surety, requiring that they
appear at a time named by the court, not less than ten days, from the issuance
of the summons, and show cause why a judgment should not be entered for the
penalty of the bond and execution issued against the property of the principal
and the surety.
      (2)   Any money collected or paid upon an execution, or upon the bond,
shall be deposited with the clerk of the court in which the bond was given. The
money shall be applied first to the payment of all court costs and then to the
treatment, care or maintenance of the child who was at issue when the offender
was convicted of this section.
   (h)   If the guilty person had custody of the child prior to conviction, the
court or judge may, on suspending sentence, permit the child to remain in the
custody of the person, and make it a condition of suspending sentence that the
person provides whatever treatment and care may be required for the welfare of
the child, and shall do whatever may be calculated to secure obedience to the
law or to remove the cause of the delinquency.

detain such person in a reasonable manner and for a reasonable length of time
not to exceed thirty minutes, for the purpose of investigating whether or not
such person has committed or attempted to commit shoplifting. Such reasonable

prescribed by subsection (f) hereof is not entitled to recover the penalty
imposed by this section.
      (4)   Right to demand payment. The fact that a mercantile establishment
may bring an action against an individual as provided in this section does not

545.01 DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this article, unless the context otherwise requires:
   (a)   “Antique firearm” means:
      (1)   Any firearm, including, but not limited to, a firearm with a match
lock, flintlock, percussion cap, or similar type of ignition system which was
manufactured on or before 1898;
      (2)   Any replica of any firearm described in subsection (a)(1) hereof if
such replica is not designed or redesigned to use rimfire or conventional
centerfire fixed ammunition which is no longer manufactured in the United
States and which is not readily available in the ordinary channels of
commercial trade; and
      (3)   Any muzzle-loading rifle, muzzle-loading shotgun, or muzzle-loading
pistol, which is designed to use black powder, or black powder substitute, and
which cannot use fixed ammunition. For purposes of this subdivision, the term
“antique firearm” shall not include any weapon which includes a firearm frame
or receiver, any firearm which is converted into a muzzle-loading weapon, or
any muzzle-loading weapon which can be readily converted to fire fixed
ammunition by replacing the barrel, bolt, breechblock, or any combination
thereof.
   (b)   "Blackjack" means a short bludgeon consisting, at the striking end, of
an encased piece of lead or some other heavy substance and, at the handle end,
a strap or springy shaft which increases the force of impact when a person or
object is struck. "Blackjack" includes, but is not limited to, a billy, billy
club, sand club, sandbag or slapjack.
   (c)   “Concealed” means hidden from ordinary observation so as to prevent
disclosure or recognition. A deadly weapon is concealed when it is carried on
or about the person in such a manner that another person in the ordinary course
of events would not be placed on notice that the deadly weapon was being
carried. For purposes of concealed handgun licensees, a licensee is considered
to be carrying on or about his or her person while in or on a motor vehicle if
the firearm is located in a storage area in or on the motor vehicle.
   (d)   “Controlled substance” has the same meaning as is ascribed to that
term in West Virginia Code 60A-1-101(e).
   (e)   “Deadly weapon” means an instrument which is designed to be used to
produce serious bodily injury or death or is readily adaptable to such use. The
term “deadly weapon” includes, but is not limited to, the instruments defined
in subsections (a) through (h) hereof, inclusive, of this section or other
deadly weapons of like kind or character which may be easily concealed on or

11a, the term “deadly weapon” includes explosive, chemical, biological and
radiological materials. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section,
the term “deadly weapon” does not include any item or material owned by the
school or county board, intended for curricular use, and used by the student at
the time of the alleged offense solely for curricular purposes. The term
“deadly weapon” does not include pepper spray as defined in subsection (l)
hereof when used by any person solely for self-defense purposes.

Virginia 60A-1-101(m).

an explosion: provided, that it does not mean an antique firearm as defined in
subsection (a) hereof; except for the purposes of West Virginia Code 48-27-502.
   (h)   "Gravity knife" means any knife that has a blade released from the
handle by the force of gravity or the application of centrifugal force, and

to be used as a weapon, consisting of a sharp-edged or sharp-pointed blade,

cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds. The term "knife" includes, but is not
limited to, any dagger, dirk, poniard or stiletto with a blade over three and
one-half inches in length, any switchblade knife or gravity knife, and any
other instrument capable of inflicting cutting, stabbing or tearing wounds. A
pocket knife with a blade three and one-half inches or less in length, a
hunting or fishing knife carried for hunting, fishing, sports or other
recreational uses, or a knife designed for use as a tool or household implement
shall not be included within the term "knife" as defined herein, unless the
knife is knowingly used or intended to be used to produce serious bodily injury
or death.
   (j)   “Metallic or false knuckles” means a set of finger rings attached to a
transverse piece to be worn over the front of the hand for use as a weapon and
constructed in such a manner that, when striking another person with the fist
or closed hand, considerable physical damage may be inflicted upon the person
who was struck. The terms “metallic or false knuckles” includes any such
instrument without reference to the metal or other substance or substances from
which the metallic or false knuckles are made.
   (k)   “Nunchaku” means a flailing instrument consisting of two or more rigid
parts, connected by a chain, cable, rope, or other nonrigid, flexible, or
springy material, constructed in a manner that allows the rigid parts to swing

   (f)   Requirements.
      (1)   Water Purveyor.
         A.   On new installations, the Water Purveyor will provide on-site
evaluation and/or inspection of plans in order to determine the type of
backflow preventer, if any, that will be required and will perform inspection
and testing.
         B.   For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the
Water Purveyor will perform evaluations and inspections of plans and/or
premises and inform the owner by letter of any correction action deemed
necessary, the method of achieving the correction, and the time allowed for the
correction to be made. Ordinarily, ninety (90) days will be allowed. However,
this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved
and the history of the device(s) in question.
         C.   The Water Purveyor will not allow any cross-connection to remain
unless it is protected by an approved backflow prevention, which will be
regularly tested to insure satisfactory operation.
         D.   The Water Purveyor shall inform the Owner by letter, of any
failure to comply, by the time of the first re-inspection. The Purveyor will
allow an additional fifteen (15) days for the correction. In the event the
Owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the second
re-inspection, the Water Purveyor will inform the Owner by letter, that the
water service to the Owner's premises will be terminated within a period not to
exceed five (5) days. In the event the Owner informs the Water Purveyor of
extenuating circumstances as to why the correction has not been made, a time
extension may be granted by the Water Purveyor, but in no case will exceed an
additional thirty (30) days.
   E.   If the Water Purveyor determines at any time that a serious threat to
the public health exists, the water service will be terminated immediately.
         F.   The Purveyor will begin initial premise inspections to determine
the nature of existing or potential hazards. An initial focus will be on high
hazard industries and commercial premises.
      (2)   Owner.
         A.   The Owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection
of all cross-connections on his premises.
         B.   The Owner, after having been informed by a letter from the Water
Purveyor, shall at his expense, install, maintain, and test, or have tested,
any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
         C.   The Owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow
preventer, which is revealed by periodic testing.
         D.   The Owner shall inform the Purveyor of any proposed or modified
cross-connections and also any existing cross-connections of which the Owner is
aware, but have not been found by the Water Purveyor.
         E.   The Owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow
preventer unless there is a backflow preventer of the same type on the bypass.
Owners who cannot shut down operation for testing of the device(s) must supply
additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
         F.   The Owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved
by the Water Purveyor or the WVBPH.
         G.   The Owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the
Water Purveyor or WVBPH.
         H.   Any Owner having a private well or other private water source
must have the approval of the Water Purveyor and the WVBPH if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system. Permission to cross-
connect may be denied. The Owner may be required to install a backflow
preventer at the service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even
if it is not cross-connected to the Water Purveyor’s system.
         I.   In the event the Owner installs plumbing to provide potable water
for domestic purposes which is on the Water Purveyor’s side of the backflow
preventer, such plumbing must have its own backflow preventer installed.
         J.   The Owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for
permits, annual or semi-annual device testing, retesting in the case that the
device fails to operate correctly, and second re-inspection for non-compliance
with the Water Purveyor or WVBPH requirements.
   (g)   Degree of Hazard.  The Water Purveyor recognizes the threat to the
public water system arising from cross-connections. All threats will be
classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved
backflow prevention devices.
   (h)   Existing In-Use Backflow Prevention Devices. Any existing backflow
preventer shall be allowed by the Water Purveyor to continue in service unless
the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present
backflow preventer, or result in an unreasonable risk to the public health.
Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in the case of a residential
installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow
preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device, or a reduced
pressure principle device must be installed in the event that no backflow
device is present.
   (i)   Periodic Testing.
      (1)   Backflow prevention devices shall be tested and inspected at least
annually.
      (2)   Periodic testing shall be performed by a WVBPH certified tester.
This testing will be done at the owner's expense.
      (3)   Any backflow preventer, which fails during a periodic test, will be
repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair
the device will be retested at owner's expense to insure correct operation.
High hazard situations will not be allowed to continue unprotected if the
backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty (30) days after the test
date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair
tools, or a replacement device. Parallel installation of two (2) devices is an
effective means of the owner insuring that there is uninterrupted water service
during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when the owner
desires such continuity.
      (4)   Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified in subsection (i)(1) hereof, in cases where there is a history of
test failures and the Water Purveyor feels that due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be
borne by the owner.
   (j)   Records. The Water Purveyor will initiate and maintain the following:
      (1)   Master files on customer cross-connections.
      (2)   Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections.
Copies of lists and summaries supplied to the WVBPH upon request, the Water
Purveyor will submit records of inspection, surveys, tests or corrective
actions to the West Virginia Bureau for Public Health.

1121.01 ADOPTION.
   There is hereby adopted a Vacant Structure Code for the City of Lewisburg.
(Ord. 218. Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.02 PURPOSE.
   (a)   The City has determined that an uninspected and unmonitored vacant
building may present a fire hazard, may provide temporary occupancy by
transients (including drug users and traffickers), may detract from private
and/or public efforts to rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and
that the health, safety and welfare of the public is served by the regulation
of such vacant buildings.
   (b)   Owners of uninspected and unmonitored vacant buildings shall register
such vacant buildings with the City, make payment of a fee for the registration
thereof, and otherwise conform to these vacant building regulations.
   (c)   This article ensures that, through a registration, inspection, and
monitoring process, vacant buildings will be kept weather tight and secure from
trespassers, will provide safe entry to police officers and firefighters in
times of emergency, will not impede private and /or public efforts to
rehabilitate or maintain surrounding buildings, and will not present otherwise
a public hazard.
   (d)   The City, by and through its departments (particularly the Building
Maintenance Board) shall inspect and monitor vacant buildings (especially
vacant downtown buildings), shall assess the effects of the condition of those
buildings on nearby structures, and shall promote substantial efforts to
rehabilitate and develop such buildings when appropriate.
   (e)   These provisions will streamline and consolidate the existing
procedure (that is, complaint, research, notification, inspection, orders,
fines, liens, appeals and due process lien enforcement) by placing the
responsibility to register and maintain vacant structures on the building owner
before a building's condition falls into disrepair or otherwise merits a
complaint.
(Ord. 218. Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.03 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this article, the following words and phrases shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them as follows:
   (1)   “Boarded” means a building or structure subject to the provision of
this article shall be deemed to be "boarded" if in place of one or more
exterior doors, other than a storm door, or of one or more windows, there is a
sheet or sheets of plywood or similar material covering the space for such door
or window.
   (2)   “Exterior maintenance and major systems" means the safe and lawful
maintenance of the facade, windows, doors, roof and other parts of the exterior
of the building and the maintenance of its major systems consisting of the
roof, the electrical and plumbing systems, the water supply system, the sewer
system, and the sidewalk, driveway, if any, area of the lot, as applicable and
as enforced by the Building Maintenance Board, particularly in connection with
codes adopted by the City as well as all applicable local, state and federal
laws.
   (3)   “Occupied”. Any building or structure shall be deemed to be occupied
if one or more persons actually conducts a lawful business or resides in all or
any part of the building as the licensed business occupant, or as the legal or
equitable owner/occupant(s) or tenant(s) on a permanent, non-transient basis,
or any combination of the same. For purposes of this article, evidence offered
to prove that a building is so occupied may include, but shall not be limited
to, the regular receipt of delivery of regular mail through the U.S. Postal
Service; proof of continual telephone, electric, gas, heating, water and sewer
services; a valid City business license, or the most recent, federal, state or
City income tax statements indicating that the subject property is the official
business or residence address of the person or business claiming occupancy; or
proof of bonafide pre-rental inspection.
   (4)   “Open”. A building or structure subject to the provisions of this
section shall be deemed to be "open" if any one or more exterior doors other
than a storm door is broken, open and /or closed but, without a properly
functioning lock to secure it, or if one or more windows is broken or not
capable of being locked and secured from intrusion, or any combination of the
same.
   (5)   “Owner”. An owner of the freehold of the premises or any lesser estate
therein, a mortgagee, a vendee-in-possession, assignee of rents, receiver,
executor, trustee, lessee, agent or any other person, firm or corporation that
is directly or indirectly in control of a building subject to the provisions of
this article, and as set forth below.
   (6)   “Vacant”. A building or structure shall be deemed to be vacant if no
person or persons actually, currently conduct a lawfully licensed business, or
lawfully reside, dwell, or live in any part of the building as the legal or
equitable owner(s) or tenant-occupant(s), or owner-occupant(s), or tenant(s) on
a permanent, non-transient basis. A building or structure shall be deemed
vacant and subject to the registration and possible penalty provisions provided
herein if the exterior maintenance and major systems of the building and the
surrounding real property thereof, as defined in this section, are in violation
of the building codes or health and sanitation codes and if there is not proof
of continual utility service evidencing actual use of electric, gas (i.e.,
applicable heating sources, water service, etc). Continued is meant to be
without more than one thirty (30) day interruption in any given three hundred
sixty (360) day period. In order for such continual utility service to be
considered as being actually in use as described in this article, it must be
more than merely registered to the owner for purposes of billing and must be
utilized, at a minimum, in order to keep the property and the major systems of
the building in compliance with building and safety codes. The person or entity
asserting that there has been continued utility service has the burden to
produce actual bills evidencing utility service for the relevant period.
      (Ord. 218. Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.04 STANDARDS.
   All vacant structures shall also comply with the following criteria:

gardens maintained at no more than 12 inches of growth. All noxious weeds are

structure and install two GFCI protected receptacles.
   (d)   NEC and OSHA compliant string lighting is to be provided to the entire
structure so that it may be illuminated as needed to view the structure.
   (e)   Unstable interior and exterior surfaces and components are to be
removed. Unstable or unsound accessory buildings are to be razed or renovated.
   (f)   Using wood sheet goods, all loose, deteriorated and broken windows and
doors are to be covered to eliminate the danger of their falling and to prevent
the unwanted entry of trespassers. Such wood sheet goods are to be cut and
neatly fit, not just nailed over the opening.
   (g)   All loose or deteriorated trim, gutter or overhang extensions (masonry
or frame) are to be removed or reattached to prevent falling.
   (h)   Regular routine monitoring of the structure is to occur by the owner
to ensure that the building is being kept in compliance with the above items.
   (i)   Utilities need to be connected to the structure.
      (Ord. 218. Passed 12-21-10.)

      (Ord. 218. Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.06 INSPECTIONS.
   At the time of registration, the Chief Building Inspector, Fire Chief, City
Engineer and Police Chief shall determine whether it is necessary for any or
all of them to inspect the structure so as to identify any public safety issues
needing addressed. Inspections shall also be available to verify the status of
any property concerning occupancy, vacancy, etc. If an internal inspection is
deemed necessary, the owner will be notified of the same and arrangements made
for the same. If the owner fails or refuses to consent to and arrange for an
inspection, the City will seek an administrative search warrant from a court of
competent jurisdiction, which shall include the Municipal Court, to authorize
inspection of the premises for the purpose of determining the structural
integrity of the building, the repairs necessary to insure its structural
integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire fighters and police
officers in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do not
present a hazard to the public during the time that the building remains
vacant.
(Ord. 218. Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.07 CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   The property owners shall be notified in writing of any corrective action
deemed necessary for the protection of life and safety and enforcement of the
City Building Code. This notice shall contain the applicable code provisions
and regulations in question, as well as setting a reasonable time for the
correction to be taken.
(Ord. 218. Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.08 REGISTRATION GENERALLY.
    (a)   At the time of adoption of this article, all owners of realty within
the City of Lewisburg that contain a vacant structure, as defined above, shall
register the same with the Office of the Building Inspector of the City. For
those structures that qualify as a vacant structure and after the adoption of
this article, the owner thereof shall be required to register the structure
with the Building Inspector within 30 days after the structure is found to meet
the definition of a vacant structure. The registration form shall require
information from the registrant deemed necessary by the Administrator, Building
Inspector, Fire Chief, City Engineer and Police Chief of the City, so as to
ensure that the purpose of this article is met. Specifically, the above named
City officers shall have the authority to require that the property owner
provide a professional opinion (architect, engineer, etc.) to determine the
structural integrity and that it will be safe for entry by fire fighters and
police officers in time of emergency, and that the building and its contents do
not present a hazard to the public during the time the building remains vacant.
The above named officers shall have the authority to issue orders to the owner
for corrective action deemed necessary. The Building Inspector and Fire Chief
shall rely upon the West Virginia State Building Code and Fire Code, as well as
other applicable law, for guidance during any such structural review.
   (b)   If none of the persons listed, as above, is shown at an address within
the State, the registration statement also shall provide the name and address
of a person who resides within the state and who is authorized to accept
service of process on behalf of the owners and who shall be designated as a
responsible, local party or agent, both for purposes of notification in the
event of an emergency affecting the public health, safety or welfare and for
purposes of service of any and all notices or registration statements as herein
authorized and in connection herewith. Registration shall be required for all
vacant buildings, whether vacant and secure, vacant and open or vacant and
boarded, and shall be required whenever any building has remained vacant for
sixty consecutive days or more. In no instance shall the registration of a
vacant building and the payment of registration fees be construed to exonerate
the owner, agent or responsible party for compliance with any other Building
Code or Fire Code requirement. One registration statement may be filed to
include all vacant buildings of the owner so registering, but each structure
constitutes a separate fee. The owner of the vacant property as of the last day
of the month when the property has been registered of each calendar year shall
be responsible for the payment of the non-refundable registration fee. Said fee
shall be billed by the City; and based on the duration of the vacancy as
determined by the following scale:
      (1)   No fee for properties that are vacant for less than one year;
      (2)   $200.00 for properties that are vacant for at least one year but
less than two years;
      (3)   $ 400.00 for properties that are vacant for at least two years but
less than three years;
      (4)   $600.00 for properties that are vacant for at least three years but
less than four years;
      (5)   $ 800.00 for properties that are vacant for at least four years but
less than five years; and
      (6)   $1,600 for properties that are vacant for at least five years, plus
an additional $ 300 for each year in excess of five years.
         (Ord. 218. Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.09 RIGHT OF APPEAL.
   (a)   The owner shall have the right to appeal the imposition of the
registration fees to the City Administrator; upon filing an application in
writing to the Building Inspector no later than 15 calendar days after the date
of the billing statement. On appeal, the owner shall bear the burden of
providing satisfactory objective proof of occupancy as defined in this article
specifically.
   (b)   A waiver of the registration fee, or an extension of a waiver fee up
to 90 days from the date of the current billing statement, may be granted by
the City Administrator or his designee upon application of the owner and upon
review and advice of the Building Maintenance Board; if the owner:
      (1)   Demonstrates with satisfactory proof to the City Administrator or
his designee that he/she is in the process of demolition, rehabilitation or
other substantial repair of the vacant building; and
      (2)   Objectively demonstrates to the City Administrator or his designee
a reasonable anticipated length of time for the demolition, rehabilitation, or
other substantial repair of the vacant building;
      (3)   Provides satisfactory proof to the City Administrator or his
designee that he/she was actively attempting to sell or lease the property
during the vacancy period; or
      (4)   Provides satisfactory proof to the City Administrator, to be
evaluated on a case-by-case basis, that the vacancy is temporary and may be due
to illness of the owner, active military service, or some other reasonable
explanation believed to be short term in nature and documentable as necessary.
   (c)   Within thirty days, or as soon thereafter as possible, after the
waiver application is received, the City Administrator or his designee shall
grant or deny the waiver, or request for extension, in writing, and dispatch
the written decision by mail to the owner. If the owner properly submitted an
application for a waiver or request for extension to the City Administrator or
his designee, and the City Administrator or his designee rendered a decision
which the owner seeks to appeal to the City Council, the owner must file an
Appeal Petition in writing no later than 30 calendar days from the date of the
City Administrator or his designee's decision. City Council shall either grant
or deny the appeal. Thereafter the decision of the City Council is final unless
within thirty (30) days of such decision the owner appeals for injunctive
relief to the Circuit Court of Greenbrier County.
(Ord. 218. Passed 12-21-10.)
1121.10 AMENDING INFORMATION.
   (a)   Duty to Amend Registration Statement. If the status of the
registration information changes during the course of any calendar year, it is
the responsibility of the owner, responsible party or agent for the same, to
contact the Building Inspector within thirty (30) days of the occurrence of

accordance with the West Virginia Rules of Civil Procedure, either by
delivering the notice to the person in violation personally, or by delivering

and by advising such person of the purpose of the citation. Proof of personal
service shall be made at the time of service by a written declaration executed
by the enforcement official effective service and shall declare the time, date
and manner by which service was made. If personal service cannot be
effectuated, the enforcement official may send the citation to the person via

   All fines imposed by citations under this section shall be due within ten
days of service of the citation. The failure to pay when due any fine imposed

under W. Va. Code § 8-10-2b(c) and may result in notification to the department
of motor vehicles. (Ord. 267. Passed 12-20-16.)
1141.07 APPEAL.
   (a)   Issuance of a citation under the provisions of this section shall be
deemed to be prima facie evidence of the violation indicated on the face of the
citation. As such, any person who is issued a citation shall pay the fine
indicated for the violation, as set forth in Section
1141.05, in full to the office of the municipal court clerk within ten days of
the service of the citation. Any person alleging that he or he was improperly
issued such citation may, within ten days of service of such citation, file a
petition for appeal of the citation or payment thereof, along with the required
bond, with the municipal court clerk in accordance with the following:
      (1)   In order to properly and timely appeal his or her citation, within
ten days of service of the citation, the alleged violator shall pay the
required amount of the applicable fine in full to the municipal court clerk,
which amount will be held by the municipal court as bond pending evidentiary
hearing before, and resolution of the case by, the municipal court; the
municipal court clerk shall issue a receipt to the alleged violator showing the
amount of the bond paid. In addition to the bond, the alleged violator shall
file with the municipal court clerk a petition for appeal of the citation. If
any petition for appeal filed in accordance with this section is not timely
filed or is not accompanied with the required bond, the alleged violator shall
be deemed to have waived his or her right to appeal the citation, and such
petition shall be summarily denied as untimely filed; provided, however that
nothing set forth hereinabove shall prevent the municipal judge from finding,
upon proper application and showing, that an alleged violator suffers from a
financial hardship, and, as a result, waiving the requirement that the bond be
posted as a prerequisite to filing a petition for appeal.
      (2)   Any petition for appeal filed with the municipal court clerk must
be in writing, on the form to be provided by the municipal court clerk, and
must be signed by the alleged violator affirming that the contents of the
petition are true and accurate to the best of the alleged violator's knowledge
at that time. Such petition for appeal shall state the facts and reasons in
support of the petition. Upon filing any such petition for appeal with the
municipal court clerk, the alleged violator shall serve a copy of the petition
and the receipt showing proof of bond or waiver upon the city attorney.
   (b)   Upon the filing of any petition for appeal with the municipal court
clerk, the clerk or his or her designee shall place the case on the municipal
court docket, set the case for evidentiary hearing within 30 days from the date
of the filing of the petition for appeal, provide a notice of hearing to the
alleged violator, and forward a copy of the petition to the enforcement
officer. Upon receipt of the petition, the enforcement office shall cause a
copy of the citation at issue to be forwarded to the municipal court clerk who
shall file it as the original complaint alleging the violation indicated
therein.
   (c)   The municipal court shall treat the citation itself as the original
complaint before the court, and shall treat it as prima facie evidence of the
violation alleged therein. At the close of all of the evidence presented at the
hearing on the petition for appeal, should the municipal court judge find
against the alleged violator, the bond posted by the alleged violator shall be
applied as payment for the fine imposed for the violation. In the event the
municipal court judge finds that a violator suffers from financial hardship,
the municipal court judge may permit alternative sentencing. Should the court
find in favor of the alleged violator, the bond shall be refunded to the
alleged violator by the municipal court clerk, and the citation shall be
dismissed.

1309.01 URBAN DESIGN PRINCIPLES.
   The design of each subdivision shall be prepared in accordance with the land
use, community facilities, transportation, utility and related principles
contained in these regulations as follows:
   (a)   The size of lots and blocks and other areas for residential and other
developed land uses should be designed to provide adequate light, air, open
space, landscaping with living plants and off street parking.
   (b)   The arrangement of lots and blocks and the street system should be
designed to make the most advantageous use of existing topography, natural
views and scenic vistas and natural physical features. Tree masses and large
individual trees should be preserved. The system of roadways, sidewalks and
bikeways should be designed to take advantage of the areas visual qualities.
   (c)   Circulation in subdivisions within Lewisburg should be provided in
accordance with the following design principles.
      (1)   Major streets should be located on the perimeter of the residential
neighborhood.
      (2)   Minor streets should be designed to provide access to each parcel
under separate ownership, in a manner that will discourage use by through
traffic. They should be planned so that future expansion will not require the
conversion of minor streets to collector or major streets.
      (3)   Collector streets should be designed to provide a direct route from
minor streets to the major or expressway road system, and to provide access to
community facilities and activity centers. Collector streets should not be
aligned in a way that will encourage their use by through traffic.
      (4)   Ingress to single family residential properties should be provided
only on minor and collector streets.
      (5)   Pedestrian ways should be separated from roadways used by vehicular
traffic. Sidewalks should be designed to provide all residential building sites
with direct access to neighborhood
      (6)   Bicycle lanes or bicycle paths should be provided and separated
from pedestrian and vehicular traffic when possible. Bicycle routes should be
designed to provide access to major focal points within and beyond the
neighborhood.
   (d)   Minimum standards for development are contained within these
regulations. If only the minimum standards are used in designing new
subdivisions, monotony will result. Subdivision design should strive to
complement Lewisburg's unique historic, natural and scenic qualities.
      (Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.02 LOTS AND BUILDING LINES.
   (a)   Front yard building lines and exterior side yard building lines shall
be provided in accordance with the front yards and exterior side yards
established for the various districts in the Lewisburg Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)    Restrictions on buildings to be located within the building lines
shown on the plat shall be set forth on the plat.
   (c)    Residential lots for single family detached units shall be not less
that fifty feet in width at the front building line and shall abut a street a
distance not less that thirty-five feet, except that a corner lot shall not be
less that sixty feet in width at the front building line.
   (d)   Side lot lines shall be approximately at right angles to straight
street lines or radial to curved street lines.
   (e)   The area of residential lots shall not be less than that which is
required by the Lewisburg Zoning Code, except where they may be approved as
part of a Planned Development subdivision.
   (f)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided, except
where they may be needed to provide separation of residential developments from
major streets or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography or
orientation.
(Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.03 EASEMENTS.
   (a)   The subdivider shall dedicate to the public appropriate easements to
the end that each and every lot, piece, or parcel of land within subdivision
shall have access to all available essential public facilities.
   (b)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage channel or
stream, there shall be provided a right of way and access thereto for drainage
and public utility purposes. In the case of sinkholes, the Planning Commission
shall require the dedication of appropriate access or drainage easements.
   (c)    Reserve strips as defined in these regulations shall be prohibited.
(Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.04 DESIGN STANDARDS; PLANNED DEVELOPMENT SUBDIVISIONS.
   Whenever a subdivision is developed under the Planned Development Overlay
Zoning District classification, the Planning Commission may vary the
requirements of these regulations in accordance with the Lewisburg Zoning Code
in order to allow the subdivider more freedom in the arrangement of streets,
lots, and building lines, but at the same time protect the convenience, health,
safety and welfare of future residents, as well as the character of the
surrounding property and general welfare of the community. In no case, however,
shall the proposed design violate other requirements of the Lewisburg Zoning
Ordinance or be construed in such a manner as to circumvent the requirements
for adequate streets, easements, sidewalks and other essential public
improvements.
(Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.05 PUBLIC AREAS AND OPEN SPACE.
   Parks shall be provided in accordance with the requirements and standards
set forth in Article
1325. (Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.06 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS: SIDEWALKS.
   (a)    All residential subdivisions or portions thereof, except those
subdivisions within the RR Rural Residential zones, shall have installed in
them sidewalks to serve each lot and parcel of land situated within the
subdivision.
   (b)    No plat shall receive the approval of either the Planning Commission
or City Council unless provisions for the installation of sidewalks are part of
said plat.
(Passed 2-15-94.)
1309.07 SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS: STREETS.
   It is the intent of this section that all lots and blocks provided in a
subdivision abut on a street adequate to accommodate all traffic generated in a
reasonable and safe manner. The arrangement, character, grade, width and
location of all streets shall be designed in accordance with the following
provisions.
   (a)   Each subdivision shall provide for the continuation of all major and
collector streets.
   (b)   Residential lots shall not front onto a major street but only abut on
rear and side lot lines, unless a road is provided for access purposes or when
residential lots are more than two acres in size.
   (c)   Subdivision streets shall not open onto major streets except at an
average interval of not less than one quarter mile, measured from the
centerlines.
   (d)   Minor streets shall be laid so that their use by through traffic will
be discouraged, but easy accessibility by emergency and maintenance vehicles
must be maintained, where possible by more than one access point.
   (e)   Collector streets shall be provided in the subdivision wherever
traffic is being collected from minor streets to provide access to a major
street or community facility. Any street shall be deemed a collector street
when it serves more than fifty dwelling units.
   (f)   A tentative plan of the proposed future street system shall be shown
on the preliminary plat.
   (g)   When a tract is subdivided into larger than normal building lots or
parcels, such lots or parcels shall be so arranged as to permit the logical
extension of future streets and appropriate resubdivision, with provision for
adequate utility easements and connections for such resubdivision.
   (h)   A street crossing another street should continue on the same
alignment: however, if it does not, then the offset should be not less than 125
feet measured from the centerlines.
   (i)   Street right of way widths, pavement and sidewalk construction
specifications and construction standards shall be in accordance with
requirements of the City of Lewisburg Department of Public Works.
   (j)   Half streets shall be prohibited.
   (k)   No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be confused with
existing streets. Street names and house numbers shall be subject to approval
of the Department of Public Works.

1321.01 VARIATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS.
   Whenever the tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size, or shape or it
is surrounded by such development or unusual conditions that the strict
application of the requirements contained in this article would result in
substantial hardship or inequity, the Planning Commission with the approval of
the City Council may modify or vary requirements of design, but not procedure
or offsite improvements, so that the subdivider may develop the property in a
reasonable manner, provided that the public welfare and interests of the City
are protected and the purpose and intent of these regulations are preserved.
Provided, however, that a variation based upon unique conditions shall not be
granted when the unique condition(s) was created or contributed to by the
subdivider. (Passed 2-15-94.)
1321.02 PARTIAL EXCEPTION FOR MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   Whenever a tract of land under a single ownership which is to be subdivided
into three or fewer lots, where all required off site improvements are in place
and accepted by the City, the proposed subdivision may be exempted from the
procedural requirements of this article, but this shall not constitute an
exemption from any of the design or off site improvements requirements
contained herein. Exemptions may be permitted for minor subdivisions under the
following procedures:
   (a)   The proposed subdivision is located along an existing public road, and
involves no opening, widening or extension of a public roadway.
   (b)   An accurate survey of the tract, prepared by a registered land
surveyor, has been submitted to the Mayor or their appointed designee.
   (c)   The Mayor or the appointed designee shall review the proposed minor
subdivision to insure compliance with all design and off site improvement
requirements of these regulations, and submit a written report to the Planning
Commission for consideration at the next regular Planning Commission meeting.

required as a part of the site plan review process. The intent of the plan and
these standards is to promote the general health, safety, and welfare of the
City. In addition, the karst geology of the City and the absence of surface
streams presents special problems and requires careful consideration of pre-
development conditions including, but not limited to, sinkholes and other karst
features on the existing and surrounding properties, use of sinkholes for storm
drainage purposes, post development impacts of stormwater flow, water quality
impacts, and permits required by state and other agencies. Applicants must
comply with all procedures and standards set forth in this article.
   (b)    Authorization of Planning Commission to Review Stormwater Drainage
Plan. The Planning Commission is hereby authorized to review and approve or
disapprove stormwater drainage plans for land use within the City in accordance
with the standards set forth in this Ordinance.
   (c)    Applicability of Review Requirements. All new land use activities
including, but not limited to, new subdivisions and developments within the
City shall require a Stormwater Drainage Plan for review and approval before
the issuance of the building permits, except in the following cases:
      (1)    Construction of a single-family residence.
      (2)    Construction of any approved accessory structures and related
activities.
      (3)    Landscaping and minor associated grading which is not intended to

twenty- five percent (25%).
      (6)    Signs which meet all other requirements of the City of Lewisburg
Zoning Code.
   (d)    Stormwater Committee Review for Changes to Sinkholes and Drainage
Structures. Where a sinkhole or drainage structure is located on private
property and serves adjacent properties or neighborhoods, proposed changes to
the sinkhole, drainage structure, or changes on nearby properties such as
building construction, filling, or regrading which could adversely affect the
drainage capacity of the sinkhole or drainage structure, the Zoning Official
may determine that a review and approval by the Stormwater Committee is
required. The review shall follow the standards set forth in the Stormwater
Drainage Plan Ordinance. Minor changes may be approved by the Stormwater
Committee. Major changes having substantial adverse impact on drainage capacity
may require the submission of a full Stormwater Drainage Plan for approval by
the Planning Commission as prescribed in the Stormwater Drainage Plan
Ordinance. The cost of reviewing the plan by the City consulting engineer shall
be borne by the applicant.

following special standards are required.
         B.   Wherever possible, stormwater flows from the development proposed
by the Stormwater Drainage Plan shall be disposed of onsite.
         C.    Where offsite disposal of stormwater is proposed, any necessary
permits, easements, or agreements shall be obtained for the discharge prior to
approval of the Stormwater Drainage Plan.
         D.    Where sinkholes or injection wells are used for the disposal of
the storm water, these structures shall be sized based on the pre-development
condition of the tributary watershed including drainage area, slope, soil type,
runoff curve number and other applicable parameters.
         E.    The flow rate to sinkholes or injection wells is to be limited
to the predevelopment value.
         F.    Ponds or similar detention structures are to be used to store

public. Other purposes of this ordinance include:

way or road, or on public utilities and public utility structures. In
fulfilling these purposes, this code is intended to benefit the public as a
whole and not any specific person or class of persons. Although, through the
implementation, administration, and enforcement of this code, benefits and
detriments will be enjoyed or suffered by specific individuals, such is merely

with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or
other provisions of law. Where the conditions imposed by, or pursuant to, these
regulations are different from those imposed by any other provision of these
regulations or any other ordinance rule or regulation, statute, or other
provision of law, the provisions that are more restrictive and that impose the
higher or greater standards shall control. If any portion of this code is held
invalid for any reason, the remaining herein shall not be affected.
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1331.11 NON-EXCLUSIONARY INTENT.
   It is not the intent of this code to exclude any persons or groups with
differing economic, race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, or
familial status from enjoyment of a residence, land ownership, or tenancy
within the City of Lewisburg; nor is it the intent of this code to use public
powers in any way to promote the separation within the City of Lewisburg of
economic, racial, religious, or ethnic groups, except as may be an incidental
result of meeting the purposes outlined in this code. (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-
24.)

the accompanying Official Zoning Map, which shall be considered part of this
code. The Official Zoning Map shall be the map certified by the City of

(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1335.09 PROCEDURES RELATING TO ANNEXED OR VACATED AREAS.

required by West Virginia Code, Chapter 8, Article 6, as amended. City Council
shall hear zoning recommendations from the Planning Commission for the subject
area during the required hearing for annexation. Prior to any hearings, the
Lewisburg Planning Commission shall submit its written recommendations, to be
consistent with the comprehensive plan, to City Council at least thirty (30)
days prior to the hearing for annexation.
      (1)   Prior to the annexation hearing and formal zoning designation of
any parcel(s) of land being annexed, the City shall, at least thirty (30) days
prior to the enactment of the zoning map amendment:    
         A.   Give written notice, by certified mail, to the landowner(s) whose
property is directly involved in the proposed amendment; and
         B.   Publish a notice of the proposed amendment to the zoning
ordinance map as a Class II-0 legal advertisement, pursuant to West Virginia
Code Chapter 59.    
      (2)   After the required thirty (30) day notice period ends and the
property owners have been notified by certified mail, the City Council shall
hold a public hearing regarding the zoning designation of the newly annexed
land. After the hearing, City Council can, by ordinance, designate the zoning
districts for the annexed land.   
   
   (b)   Whenever any street, place, alley, public right-of-way, railroad
right-of-way, waterway, or other similar area is vacated by proper authority,
the districts adjoining each side of such street, place, alley, public way,
railroad right-of-way, waterway, or similar area shall be extended
automatically to the center of such vacation and all area included in the
vacation shall then and thenceforth be subject to all appropriate provisions of
the extended districts. In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining
district, or district nearest the portion vacated, shall be extended
automatically to include all of the vacated area.

City of Lewisburg that are not anticipated by this ordinance. In order to
provide for such changes and contingencies, the classification of any new or
unlisted land use shall be made by the Zoning Officer to determine if the use
can reasonably be interpreted to fit into a similar use category described in
this code.

ARTICLE 1357
Scenic Overlay (SO) District
1357.01   Purpose.
1357.03   Application.
1357.05   Design guidelines.
1357.01 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Scenic Overlay District is to preserve and protect the
gateway into the City of Lewisburg and to promote orderly and attractive
development. The overlay will also promote architecture and design that
enhances the natural beauty of the area and considers the impact of development
throughout the gateway corridors.
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1357.03 APPLICATION.
   The Scenic Overlay (SO) District is created as a special zoning district to
be overlaid onto the existing, underlying "fixed" zoning districts. The Scenic
Overlay shall apply to all properties within 250 feet from the boundary of US
Route 219 and Route 60.
   Where conflict exists between the provisions of the Scenic Overly District
and the underlying zoning district, the more stringent requirements shall
apply. Only land within the setbacks indicated on the zoning map, measured as
two hundred and fifty (250) feet from the boundary of US Route 219/Route 60, is
considered the Scenic Overlay District regulated by this Article.
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1357.05 DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (a)   Structure Design.   
      (1)   Building forms and features, including roofs, windows, doors,
materials, colors and textures, should be compatible with the forms and
features of the historic buildings in the area. The scale, materials and forms,
such as roofs, walls, windows, entrances, etc., which may be embodied in
architecture which is contemporary as well as traditional.    
      (2)   Buildings should relate to their site. The overall design of
buildings should have human scale. Scale should be integral to the buildings
and their site design.    
      (3)   Any appearance of "blankness" resulting from building design should
be relieved using building design details or vegetation, or both.   
      (4)   Arcades, colonnades, or other architectural connecting devices
should be used to unify groups of buildings within a development.    
      (5)   Trademark buildings and related features should be modified to meet
the requirements of the guidelines and reflect a style that is compatible with
the City Lewisburg and Greenbrier County.   
   (b)   Accessory Structures and Equipment.   
      (1)   Accessory structures and equipment should be integrated into the
overall plan of development and shall be compatible with the building designs
used on the site.   
      (2)   The following should be screened to eliminate visibility from the
corridor: loading, service, refuse and storage areas; mechanical equipment;
above-ground utilities; and chain link fence, barbed wire, razor wire, and
similar security fencing devices.   
      (3)   Screening devices should be compatible with the design of buildings
and surrounded with natural vegetation and may consist of walls, plantings, and
fencing.    
      (4)   Surface runoff structures and detention ponds should be designed to
fit into the natural topography to avoid the need for screening. Creating
decorative wetlands and utilizing outcroppings that are characteristics of the
area is encouraged.   
   (c)   Lighting.   
      (1)   Light should be contained on the site and not spill over onto
adjacent properties or streets.   
      (2)   Light should be shielded, recessed, or flush-mounted to eliminate
glare; and the light should achieve an incandescent effect. 
      (3)   Street lights and traffic signals should be consistent and be
compatible with Lewisburg's historic character. Fixtures and poles should be
painted a subtle color to downplay their prominence.   
   (d)   Signs.   
      (1)   Signs located within the corridor must conform to the size, height,
and setback requirements as outlined in the Lewisburg Zoning Ordinance
      (2)   Material used in both sign and support structures should reflect
the building being served by the sign.   
      (3)   Lighting should be shielded and not create a glare; front lit signs
are recommended over back-lit signs.   
      (4)   The structure of monument signs should not overpower the message
portion of the sign and sign colors should be harmonious with the building
which they serve.   
   (e)   Landscaping.   
      (1)   Landscaping along US Route 219 and Route 60 should include
flowering ornamental trees and shrubs of a species noninvasive and native to
the region and should be interspersed among the street trees.   
      (2)   A depth of at least twenty-five to accommodate plantings and
fencing should be reserved parallel to US Route 219 and Route 60 and exclusive
of road rights-of-way and utility easements.   
      (3)   Trees should be planted parallel to all interior roads and side and
rear property lines. Such trees should be at least two and one-half (2-1/2)
inch caliper (measured 6 inches above the ground) and should be of a plant
species common to the area. Such trees should be separated by thirty-five (35)
feet or less on center.    
      (4)   Shrubs should be provided in parking areas to minimize the impact
on the US Route 219 and Route 60 corridor. Shrubs should measure twenty-four
(24) inches in height at the time of planting and should be evergreen.
Automobile dealerships with car lots fronting the corridors shall be exempt
from the shrub requirement, though must meet the tree spacing requirement.    
      (5)   Trees or other vegetation should be planted along the front of long
buildings as necessary to soften the appearance of exterior walls. The spacing,
size, and type of trees or vegetation should be determined by the length,
height, and blankness of such walls.   
      (6)   Shrubs should be used to integrate the site buildings and other
structures, dumpsters, accessory buildings, "drive thru" windows, service
areas, and signs. Shrubs should measure at least twenty-four (24) inches in
height at the time of planting and should be evergreen.    
   (f)   Site Development and Layout.   
      (1)   The relationship of buildings and other structures to the US Route
219 and Route 60 Corridors should be as follows:   
         A.   An organized pattern of roads, service lanes, bike paths, and
pedestrian walks should guide the layout of the site;   
         B.   In general, buildings that front the corridors should be parallel
to it. Building groups should also be arranged to parallel the corridors.
         C.   Provisions should be made for connections to adjacent pedestrian
and vehicular circulation systems.   
         D.   Open spaces should be tied into surrounding areas to provide
continuity within the corridors;   
         E.   If significant natural features exist on the site (including
creek valleys, steep slopes, significant trees or rock outcroppings), to the
maximum extent practical, natural features should be reflected in the site
layout.   
         F.   The placement of structures on the site should respect existing
views and vistas on and around the site.   
         G.   Properties with extensive corridor frontage shall utilize
multiple entrance "curb cuts," which allows the continuous "street tree" effect
and provides a visual and landscaped buffer between the corridor and the
development. Individual curb cuts should not exceed twenty-four (24) feet in
width.    
   (g)   Site Grading.   
      (1)   Site grading should respect the existing topographic
characteristics of the site and blend with adjacent properties; site grading
should not change the basic relationship of the site to surrounding
conditions.   
      (2)   Steep cut or fill sections are generally unacceptable.    
      (3)   Cut and filled slopes should be rounded (minimum ten (10) foot
radius) to meet adjacent conditions.   
      (4)   Natural drainage patterns (or to the extend required, new drainage
patterns) should be incorporated into the finished site to the extend possible.
      (5)   No grading, trenching, or tunneling should occur within the drip
line of any significant trees or other existing features. Existing trees should
be fenced at the drip line and protected during construction.

1361.01 PURPOSE.
   The conditional use permit procedure is intended to provide the Board of
Zoning Appeals with review of requests to establish uses that may be
appropriate in a zoning district, but that may have the potential for negative
impacts on the health, safety, and welfare of the public. The conditional use
standards provided in this Article are intended to avoid, minimize, or mitigate
adverse impacts conditional uses may have on the health, safety, and welfare of
the public.
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1361.03 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (a)   All applications for a conditional use permit shall demonstrate that:
   
      (1)   The use is consistent with the policies and intent of the
corresponding purpose for the zoning district in which it lies and the City's
comprehensive plan.   
      (2)   The use is physically and operationally compatible with the
surrounding neighborhood and surrounding existing uses.    
      (3)   The use will be designed, constructed, operated, and maintained so
that it does not cause substantial injury to adjoining property.    
      (4)   The use will be adequately served by public facilities and services
that include but are not limited to water, sewer, electric, schools, streets,
fire and police protection, storm drainage, public transit, and public parks
and trails.    
      (5)   Adequate off-street parking will be provided on the same property
as the proposed conditional use as well as adequate ingress and egress to the
property, or otherwise in compliance with the standards set forth in this
code.   
      (6)   Any storage of hazardous material will comply with all state,
federal, and local regulations, and all such material will be listed and made
known to the Chief of the City of Lewisburg Fire Department.   
      (7)   The use will not endanger public health or safety or constitute a
public nuisance.   
      (8)   The use will not conduct operations in connection with the use that
are offensive, dangerous, or destructive of the environment.   
   (b)   Conditions may be imposed on a proposed conditional use to ensure that
potential significant adverse impacts on surrounding uses will be reduced to
the maximum extent feasible, including but not limited to conditions or
measures addressing:   
      (1)   Location on a site of activities that generate potential adverse
impacts such as noise and glare;   
      (2)   Hours of operation and deliveries;   
      (3)   Location of loading space and delivery zones;

      (10)   On-site circulation; and   
      (11)   Privacy concerns of adjacent uses.   
   (c)   Conditional use permit decisions are made by the Board of Zoning
Appeals (BZA). In considering the proposed conditional use, the BZA must
determine whether the applicable General Standards under this Section have been
met. The BZA may impose additional conditions and safeguards deemed
necessary.   
   (d)   The breach of any condition, safeguard, or requirement shall be
considered a violation of the conditional use permit approval. If the applicant
fails to comply with any of the applicable requirements of this ordinance, the
BZA shall have the authority to revoke any conditional use permit after
providing notice to the property owner and after public hearing is held in the
same manner as the original approval.   
   (e)   Validity of approval. Any conditional use approved by the Board of
Zoning Appeals under which the premises are not used, work is not started
within six (6) months, or the use or work has been abandoned for a period of
one (1) year, shall lapse and cease to be in effect. The BZA may permit one (1)
six (6) month extension if the extension is applied for in writing by the
applicant prior to the expiration of the approval, provided that the BZA finds
that the extension is warranted due to circumstances beyond the control of the
applicant.   
   (f)   No application that has been denied wholly or in part by the Board of
Zoning Appeals shall be resubmitted for a period of one (1) year from the date
of the last denial, unless permitted by the BZA after demonstration by the

height than provided in the district, may be erected to a greater height than
permitted provided that:   
      (1)   The structure shall not occupy more than twenty-five (25%) percent
of the lot area;   
      (2)   The setback requirements of the district in which the structure is
erected shall be increased by one foot for each foot of height over the maximum

closest point between the building and the angled lot line.   
   (f)   Rear Lot Line (Irregular). In the case of a lot having no street
frontage or a lot of an odd shape, only the one lot line farthest from any
street shall be considered a rear lot line. Where there is only one lot line
other than street lot lines, it shall be considered the rear lot line.
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
   
1363.15  SWIMMING POOLS.

removed immediately.    
      (3)   Fence and walls shall not be constructed out of fabric, junk, junk
vehicles, appliances, tanks, barrels, razor wire, barbed wire, or electric
fencing, not including invisible fencing with the use of a remote and collar on
a domesticated animal. Razor wire or barbed wire are permitted in commercial or
industrial uses.   
      (4)   The finished side of the fence shall be oriented towards the front
of the lot or the direction of the adjacent property owner, unless the fence is
not visible from adjoining property.   
   (c)   Screening.   
      (1)   Screening may include any of the following means:   
         A.   A solid board fence at least six (6) feet in height.   
         B.   An opaque evergreen trimmed hedge the thickness of which shall
not be less than thirty (30%) percent of its required height of six (6)
feet.   
         C.   An earthen berm may be used in combination with any of the above
types of screening, but not more than two thirds (2/3) of the required height
of such screening may be provided by the berm.
      (2)   Screening areas shall be continually maintained by the landowner.
Any plant material that does not survive shall be replaced within six (6)
months. All landscaping shall be kept free of refuse and debris.   
      (3)   Screening may be required by the Board of Zoning Appeals as a
condition of a conditional use permit.    
      (4)   Screening shall not be required where the lot abuts an area of
existing natural vegetation that effectively screens the lot from casual
observation to a height of at least six (6) feet.   
      (5)   All species within the screen planting shall be indigenous or
otherwise well-suited to the City, except that trees with large leaves that

extend into the public road or upon the lands of an adjoining owner more than
eighteen inches over the dividing line.   
      (7)   All screening shall follow the lot line of the lot to be screened
or be so arranged within the boundaries of the lot as to substantially hide
from adjoining properties the building, parking, or loading areas or other
activity required to be screened.   
      (8)   Screening shall be installed to a height determined during review
of the zoning permit application.   
   (d)   Commercial or Industrial Property Adjacent to Dwellings and Zoned or

driveway or other openings may be required.
            2.   One tree shall be planted for each forty (40) linear feet of
the landscaping strip in addition to other planting materials.
            3.   A landscaping strip of fifteen (15) feet in width shall be
located along the entire frontage of the property except where driveways or
other openings are required.   
      (2)   Approved landscaping materials used in parking lots shall include
trees, shrubbery, hedges and other live planting materials.    
      (3)   Trees used shall be of a type that provides shade at maturity. All
landscaping trees to be used shall be a minimum of six (6) feet in overall
height upon planting and consist of a species that normally grow to an overall
height of a minimum of fifteen (15) feet.   
      (4)   Effective use of earthen berms and existing topography is also
encouraged as a component of the landscape plan.   
      (5)   The landscaping and planting areas shall be dispersed throughout
the parking lot.   
      (6)   The interior dimensions of any planting area or planting medium
shall be sufficient to protect the landscaping materials planted herein and to
allow proper growth.   
      (7)   In those instances where plant material exists on a parking lot
site prior to its development, such landscape materials may be used in meeting
the requirements of this article.    
   (f)   Permanent Signs Affixed to the Ground. A permanent ground sign shall
require a single continuous landscaped area to be maintained beneath the sign
in accordance with the following standards:   
      (1)   The minimum landscaped area shall be equal to the area of the sign
face.
      (2)   The landscaped area shall include all points where sign structural
supports attach to the ground.   
      (3)   Where the required landscaping area is adjacent to a paved surface
accessible to vehicular traffic, a raised non mountable curb to prevent the
encroachment of vehicles shall be required.   
      (4)   The landscape area shall contain living plantings aesthetically
located and maintained.    
   (g)   Dumpster Screening. All outdoor storage of refuse material, recycling,

1363.19 LIGHTING.
   (a)   All lighting shall be low intensity and shielded so there is no
illumination of adjoining residential properties. All lighting shall be erected
and maintained so that light is confined to the property and will not cast
direct light or glare upon adjacent properties or public rights-of-way. Bare,
unshaded bulbs are prohibited.   
   (b)   Building, parking, and all other exterior lighting shall be shielded
and directed in a manner that lighting does not reflect or cause glare onto
adjacent properties or adversely interfere with street traffic.

loading areas, and for driveways providing ingress and egress for
nonresidential and multi-family developments.    
   (d)   Feature lighting, such as up lighting of trees or other plant material
or seasonal lighting, shall be so arranged to reflect away from any residential
structure. Such lighting shall not create a glare on adjacent streets or
properties.

   (c)   Sound limits shall apply and be measured from all property lines and
from the right-of-way nearest to the origin of the sound. Measurements with
sound level meters shall be made when the wind velocity at the time and place
of such measurement is not more than five (5) miles per hour. In all sound
level measurements, consideration shall be given to the effect of the ambient
noise level created by the encompassing noise of the environment from all
sources at the time and place of such sound level measurement.    
   (d)   Construction projects shall be subject to the maximum permissible
noise levels specified for industrial zones for the period within which
construction is to be completed pursuant to any applicable construction permit
issued by proper authority or, if no time limitation is imposed, for a
reasonable period of time for completion of project.
   (e)   All railroad rights-of-way shall be considered as industrial zones for
the purposes of this article, and the operation of trains shall be subject to
the maximum permissible noise levels specified for such zone.    
   (f)   This Section does not apply to the operation of aircraft or to other
activities which are subject to federal law with respect to noise control or to
the use of property by the State of West Virginia, any political subdivision of
the State of West Virginia, or any other entity not organized for profit,
including, but not limited to, nonprofit corporations, or any of their lessees,
licensees, or permittees, for the purpose of promoting, producing, or holding
cultural, entertainment, athletic, or patriotic events, including, but not
limited to, concerts, music festivals, and fireworks displays. (Ord. 319.
Passed 6-18-24.)
1363.21 SIGHT DISTANCE PROTECTION.
   No landscaping, tree, fence, wall or similar item shall be maintained in the

hazard.
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1363.23 PARKING.
   (a)   Off-street Parking.    
      (1)   General. Off-street parking shall be provided in compliance with
this Section whenever any building is erected, enlarged, converted, or
increased in size or capacity.    
      (2)   Required number. The off-street parking spaces required for each
use permitted by this code shall not be less than that found in Table 1363.23
(b), provided that any fractional parking space be computed as a whole space.
Any commercial buildings not listed Table 1363.23(b) that are built, converted,
modified, or structurally altered shall provide one parking space per 200
square feet of gross floor area and one parking space for each regular, full-
time employee or full-time equivalent in the building or on the premises whose
primary duties are in the building or on the premises, during the largest
shift.   
      (3)   Exceptions. For properties in the CC District, compliance with the
parking requirements may be impracticable due to lot size. When on-site parking
is impracticable, required parking within the CC District may be met with
nearby on- or off-street public parking.    
      (4)   Combination of uses. Where there is a combination of uses on a lot,
the required number of parking spaces shall be the sum of that found for each
use, dividing the gross floor area proportionately between the different uses.
The required parking space for any number of separate uses may be combined in
one lot, but the required space assigned to one use may not be
         assigned to another use at the same time, except that one half (½) of
the parking space required for churches, theaters, or assembly halls with peak
attendance at night or on the weekend may be assigned to a use that will be
closed at night or on the weekend.   
      (5)   Location of lot. The parking spaces required by this code shall be
provided on the same lot as the use or on another lot not more than five
hundred (500) feet radially from the lot where the use is located only if the

   (e)   Design of parking facilities.    
      (1)   General driveway and access way provisions.   
         A.   Driveways and access ways should be located to minimize traffic
conflicts with traffic entering the street from either the same or the opposite
side of the street.   
         B.   All access ways and driveways shall be designed to conform to
West Virginia Department of Transportation specifications with regard to
roads.   
         C.   For dwellings, only one (1) driveway access per unit is
permitted. A lot with at least one hundred (100) feet of frontage along a
street may be permitted one (1) additional driveway access point. Regardless of
frontage, a development may be restricted to a single access way depending on
usage and interior and exterior traffic patterns.    
         D.   On any lot, no wall, fence, hedge, tree, shrub, or other
obstruction shall be allowed that dangerously obscures the view of approaching
traffic along the street, or at any intersection, including driveways and
access ways.   
      (2)   Driveway and access way width.    
         A.   Commercial parking shall provide one or more access way, the
width of which shall be twelve (12) feet for one-way enter/exit or twenty-four
(24) feet for two-way enter/exit.   
         B.   Residential driveways and access ways shall be at least nine (9)
feet in width.   
      (3)   Driveway and ramp slopes. The maximum slope of any driveway, access
way, or ramp shall not exceed twenty percent (20%).    
      (4)   Stall access. Each required parking stall shall be individually and
easily accessed. No automobile shall be required to back onto any public street
or sidewalk to leave any parking stall when such stall serves more than two (2)
dwelling units. All portions of a public lot or garage shall be accessible to
other portions thereof without requiring the use of any public street.
      (5)   Striping. All parking stalls shall be striped. Parking spaces shall
be clearly delineated by suitable markings. Short-term visitor parking spaces
shall be differentiated from long-term employee spaces by suitable markings or
signage.    
      (6)   Surfacing.    
         A.   Permanent surface material, which includes asphalt, concrete,
brick, or concrete pavers or with a similar material approved by the Zoning
Officer shall be the preferred method of surfacing parking areas and driveways.
Gravel may be used for parking areas and driveways provided the gravel is no
less than three inches of No. 57 clean crushed gravel, rolled and compacted to
less than one and one half (1.5) inches after compaction.    
         B.   Permanent surface material, which includes asphalt, concrete,
brick, or concrete pavers or with a similar material approved by the Zoning
Officer shall be constructed on a compacted sub grade free of organic matter.
The gravel shall be well-graded, crushed stone aggregate six (6) inches thick
after rolling. The surface shall be smooth, uniform, and tightly packed.    
         C.   In residential districts, no more than forty percent (40%) of the
front yard may be used for parking, including driveways. Vehicles may not be
parked or stored upon any lawn or vegetated or otherwise landscaped area.    
      (7)   Compact car parking spaces. If twenty (20) or more parking stalls
are required for a parking lot, ten percent (10%) of those spaces may be
designated for compact car parking stalls. Each compact car parking stall shall
be marked as "Compact Car Parking."   
      (8)   Retail parking. Off-street parking areas for all new retail
businesses over seven thousand (7,000) square feet of gross floor area shall be
designed to include bollards to prevent vehicles from driving into the
business. All retail business existing before the date of this ordinance shall
install bollards when replacing or substantially working on the sidewalk in
front of the business's entrance.   
   (f)   Ingress and Egress. Adequate ingress and egress to a parking facility
shall be provided by clearly defined access ways in accordance with any access
management requirements of the City of Lewisburg.   
   (g)   Accessible Parking. Accessible parking spaces and passenger loading
zones shall be provided in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and
local laws, including but not limited to the Americans with Disabilities Act
(ADA), ICC A117.1, and West Virginia Code Section 17c-13-6, and any amendments

      (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1367.03 APPLICABILITY.
   Wireless telecommunications facilities may not be constructed or modified
without a zoning permit issued in accordance with the provisions of this
Article. Modifications to existing wireless telecommunication facilities, as of
the effective date of this Article, are required to comply with this Article.
   This Section does not apply to the replacement of any component of a
wireless telecommunication facility where the replacement is identical to the
component being replaced or to the normal repair and maintenance of a wireless
telecommunication facility that does not involve the addition, removal, or
change of any of the externally discernable physical components of a wireless
telecommunication facility from that which was originally permitted.
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1367.05 SUBSTANTIAL CHANGE CRITERIA.
   For the purposes of determining whether a requested modification is an
eligible facilities request for modification under this Section, a proposed
facilities modification will substantially change the physical dimensions of an
eligible support structure, and therefore not be eligible for the expedited
modification process and corresponding eligible facilities application process
under this Article, if the requested modification meets any of the following
criteria:
   (a)   For towers other than towers in the public rights-of-way, the request
increases the height of the tower by more than ten percent (10%) or by the
height of one additional antenna array with separation from the nearest
existing antenna not to exceed twenty (20) feet, whichever is greater; for
other eligible support structures, it increases the height of the structure by
more than ten percent (10%) or more than ten (10) feet, whichever is
greater.   
   (b)   Changes in height shall be measured from the original support
structure in cases where deployments are or will be separated horizontally,
such as on buildings' rooftops; in other circumstances, changes in height shall
be measured from the dimensions of the tower or base station, inclusive of
originally approved appurtenances and any modifications that were approved
prior to the passage of the Spectrum Act.   
   (c)   For towers other than towers in the public right-of-way, it involves
adding an appurtenance to the body of the tower that would protrude from the
edge of the tower more than twenty (20) feet, or more than the width of the
tower structure at the level of appurtenance, whichever is greater; for other
eligible support structures, it involves adding an appurtenance to the body of
the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than
six (6) feet.   
   (d)   For any eligible support structure, it involves installation of more
than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved,
but not to exceed four (4) cabinets; or, for towers in the public right-of-way
and base stations, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on
the ground if there are no preexisting ground cabinets associated with the
structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than
ten percent (10%) larger in height or overall volume than any other ground
cabinets associated with the structure.
   (e)   It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site.   
   (f)   It would defeat the concealment elements of the eligible support
structure.
   (g)   It does not comply with conditions associated with the siting approval
of the construction or modification of the eligible support structure or base
station equipment; provided, however, that this limitation does not apply to
any modification that is noncompliant only in a manner that would not exceed
the thresholds identified in this section.   
      (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1367.07 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Lighting. Lighting affixed to any wireless telecommunication
facilities shall meet, but not exceed, the minimum lighting required by the
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). For any application where lighting is
required, the applicant shall submit documentation from the FAA stating that
the proposed lighting meets all applicable FAA standards and regulations.   
   (b)   Structural Standards. Wireless telecommunications facilities shall
conform to the most current versions of the ANSI/ASSE A10.48 "Standard Criteria
for Safety Practices with the Construction, Demolition, Modification and
Maintenance of Communication Structures"; ANSI/TIA-222 Standard, "Structural
Standard for Antenna Supporting Structures, Antennas and Small Wind Turbine
Support Structures"; and ANSI/TIA-322 Standard, "Loading, Analysis and Design
Criteria Related to the Installation, Alteration and Maintenance of
Communication Structures." Wireless telecommunication facilities shall also
meet any applicable local building code standards.    
   (c)   Height Restrictions. No wireless telecommunication facility shall
exceed one hundred ninety-nine (199) feet in height, unless the applicant
sufficiently justifies that the height of the tower will eliminate other
similar towers or that the provision of service cannot be accomplished without
a tower height in excess of one hundred ninety-nine (199) feet. Any applicant
proposing a wireless telecommunication facility greater than one hundred
ninety-nine (199) feet in height must provide evidence that the applicant
notified the FAA of the intent to build the facility and received a final
determination of "no hazard" from the FAA. Wireless telecommunications
facilities located atop or within an alternative support structure may extend
ten (10%) percent above the height of the structure or to the maximum height
permitted in the zoning district in which the structure is located, whichever
is less.   
   (d)   Collocation.   
      (1)   An applicant for a new wireless telecommunication facility must
demonstrate by substantial evidence that a bona fide need exists for the
construction of a new tower and that no reasonable combination of locations,
techniques, or technologies would obviate the need. The applicant for a new
facility must further demonstrate that all reasonable efforts have been made to
collocate wireless telecommunication facilities on existing towers or
alternative support structures.   
      (2)   Prior to the approval of an application for a wireless
telecommunications facility, the applicant shall demonstrate commitment to
joint use as follows:
         A.   The applicant shall submit evidence as part of the application
demonstrating that a genuine effort has been made to solicit additional users
for the proposed new wireless telecommunications facility. Evidence of this
shall include, at a minimum, copies of notices sent by registered mail, return
receipt requested, to all other providers of cellular and wireless
telecommunications services within the same county and within adjacent
counties, or a Class II legal advertisement, advising of the intent to
construct a new tower, identifying the location, inviting the joint use and
sharing of costs, and requesting a written response within fifteen (15)
business days.
         B.   As part of the application, the applicant shall attest that the
company will encourage the joint use of telecommunications towers within the
City of Lewisburg, committing that there shall be no unreasonable act or
omission that would have the effect of excluding, obstructing, or delaying
joint use of any tower where fair and just market reasonable compensation is
offered for such use.   
         C.   Wireless telecommunications facilities, other than alternative
support structures, shall be designed and built to accommodate a minimum of
three (3) wireless telecommunications provider's equipment. The owner of the
tower, if different than the applicant, must certify to the City of Lewisburg
that the tower is available for use by other telecommunications service
providers on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis.   
   (e)   Concealment.   
      (1)   All new or modified wireless telecommunication facilities must be
concealed in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the facilities
through careful design, siting, landscaping, screening, and innovative
camouflaging and stealth techniques, unless applicant shows substantial
evidence that to do so is impracticable.   
      (2)   Concealment techniques include fake trees, parapet extensions,
silos, fake chimneys, water towers, fiberglass flagpoles, and steeples.   
      (3)   A description must be included in the application of the
possibilities for concealment that have been explored, and why the proposed
option was chosen.   
      (4)   Visual impact analysis of the wireless telecommunication facility
is required using existing information, predictive modeling techniques,
photographs, and simulations, to accurately and impartially communicate the
potential visual impacts from a proposed project.   
      (5)   If determined to be impracticable by Zoning Officer for a tower or
alternative support structure to be entirely concealed, the applicant will
describe how they will utilize materials, colors, textures, screening and
landscaping to blend facilities into the natural setting and surrounding
buildings.   
      (6)   If an antenna is installed on an alternative support structure, the
antenna and supporting electrical and mechanical equipment must be a neutral
color that is identical to or closely compatible with the color of the
alternative support structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment
as visually unobtrusive as possible.   
      (7)   Any equipment shelter or cabinet must be concealed from public view
or made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding structures or
placed underground.   
   (f)   Replacement or modification of any previously approved concealed tower
or facility must substantially conform to previous design characteristics.    
   (g)   Setback. Each tower shall have a setback of at least one hundred and
ten (110%) percent the tower height measured from the tower base to the nearest
property line.   
   (h)   Collapse Zone. No habitable structure may be located within the
proposed collapse zone. The applicant shall demonstrate that the entire
collapse zone is either under lease or owned by the applicant and that no
habitable structure will be constructed in the collapse zone while the tower is
standing.   
   (i)   Equipment Cabinets. No equipment cabinet for a wireless
telecommunications facility shall exceed seven hundred fifty (750) square feet
in area, nor twelve (12) feet in height. All equipment cabinets shall be
located with the tower and shall be enclosed within a minimum of a six (6) foot
security fence and a locked gate.   
   (j)   Signs. No commercial messages nor any other signs beyond that which is
required, not to exceed twelve (12) square feet cumulatively, shall be placed
on any tower, equipment cabinet, or security fence.   
   (k)   Landscaping.   
      (1)   Existing mature tree growth and natural landforms shall be
preserved to the maximum extent possible. Trees existing within one hundred
(100) feet of the wireless telecommunications facility shall not be removed
except as required for tower construction, security fence construction,
installation of ingress or egress, and the installation of utilities to the
facility. To the extent that existing vegetation is the basis for a waiver of
the landscaping requirement, preservation of such vegetation shall be a
condition of the permit, and if such existing vegetation is removed or
destroyed, the applicant shall meet the landscaping specified in Subsection (k)
(2) below within six (6) months thereafter.   
      (2)   Wireless telecommunications facilities shall be landscaped within
six (6) months after the tower and base station are erected with a visual
buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the equipment
cabinet from adjacent property. The standard visual buffer shall consist of a
landscaped strip of at least four (4) feet wide outside the perimeter of the
security fencing enclosing the facilities. The visual buffer shall include
vegetation of at least eight (8) feet tall, planted ten (10) feet apart behind
a contiguous hedge of shrubs three (3) feet deep. All plant materials shall be
species native to West Virginia. In the case where the tower and base station
are sited on large wooded lots, the applicant may request that the natural
growth preserved around the tower site be considered a sufficient visual
barrier, without the need for additional landscaping. Such a request shall
accompany the application and shall include photographs of the natural growth
to be preserved.   
   (l)   Location of Towers or Antenna in or near Historic Sites, Historic
Districts, and Designated Scenic Resources. Applications for wireless
telecommunications facilities or antennas subject to this Section shall also
demonstrate that the views of, and vistas from, such structures, districts, and
resources shall not be impaired or diminished by the placement of the proposed
tower or antennas. In no instance shall a wireless telecommunications facility
subject to the provisions of this paragraph exceed one hundred and ninety-nine
(199) feet in height.   
   (m)   Site Demarcation. The site shall be physically and visually marked in
the field, for immediate identification, with any combination of survey irons
or flags as needed during the application process or during construction.

1371.01 FINDINGS, PURPOSE, AND INTENT; INTERPRETATION. 
   (a)   Signs obstruct views, distract motorists, displace alternative uses
for land, and pose other problems that legitimately call for regulation. The
purpose of this Article is to regulate the size, color, illumination, movement,
materials, location, height, and condition of all signs placed on property for
exterior observation, thus ensuring the protection of property values;
preservation of the character of the various neighborhoods; creation of a
convenient, attractive, and harmonious community; protection against
destruction of or encroachment upon historic areas; and the safety and welfare
of pedestrians and wheeled traffic, while providing convenience to citizens and
encouraging economic development. This Article allows adequate communication
through signage while encouraging aesthetic quality in the design, location,
and size of signs. These regulations do not entirely eliminate all of the harms
that may be created by the installation and display of signs. Rather, they
strike an appropriate balance that preserves ample channels of communication by
means of signs while still reducing and mitigating the extent of the harms
caused by signs.
   (b)   This Article shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with the
First Amendment guarantee of free speech. If any provision of this Article is
found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such finding shall
not affect the validity of other provisions of this Article that can be given
effect without the invalid provision.   
   
   (c)   Signs not expressly permitted under this code are prohibited.   
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)

required prior to the display and erection of any sign.   
      (1)   An application for a permit shall be filed with the Zoning Officer
on forms furnished by the City. The applicant shall provide sufficient
information to determine if the proposed sign is permitted under this code and
other applicable law. An application for a temporary sign shall state the dates
intended for the erection and removal of the sign. All applications shall
demonstrate that the materials used for the sign are appropriate for the
particular sign type; the submission of manufacturer's specifications is
sufficient to demonstrate the use of appropriate materials. An application for
an electronic message display shall include the manufacturer's statement that
the sign has been pre-programmed, to the extent possible, to conform to the
requirements of this code. Such manufacturer's statement shall include, where
applicable, the pre-stacked sign settings related to text and graphic features,
message change features, message change time intervals, day and night lighting
requirements, and any other settings capable of limiting the electronic message
display such that the sign conforms to this code.   
      (2)   The Zoning Officer shall promptly process the permit application
and approve the application, reject the application, or notify the applicant of
deficiencies in the application within twenty (20) business days after receipt.
Any application that complies with all provisions of this code, the building
code, and other applicable laws, shall be approved.   
      (3)   If the application is rejected, the Zoning Officer shall provide a
list of the reasons for the rejection in writing. An application shall be
rejected for noncompliance with the terms of this code, building code, or other
applicable law.    
   (b)   Permit Fee. A nonrefundable fee shall accompany all permit
applications. The permit fee schedule shall be set by the City.    
   (c)   Duration and Revocation of Permit. If a sign is not installed within
six (6) months following the issuance of a permit or the time period stated
within the permit, or within thirty (30) days for a temporary permit, the
permit shall be void. The permit for a temporary sign shall state its duration,
not to exceed thirty (30) days unless otherwise provided in this code. The
Zoning Officer may revoke a permit under any of the following circumstances:
   
      (1)   The information in the application was materially false or
misleading;
      (2)   The sign as installed does not conform to the permit application;
or
      (3)   The sign violates this code, building code, or other applicable
law.
   (d)   Appeals. Appeals from the denial or granting of a permit shall be made
to the Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to the process set forth in this
code.   
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1371.05 PERMIT NOT REQUIRED.

of the total area of the window or door. (Ord.319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1371.07 PROHIBITED SIGNS.
   The purpose of prohibiting the following signage is to address the
community's substantial public safety and welfare concerns, including aesthetic

   (c)   Prohibitions Based on Location.   
      (1)   Off-premises signs, unless specifically permitted under this
code.   
      (2)   Signs erected on public land other than those approved by the
Zoning Officer in writing, required by law without such approval, or permitted
under West Virginia law. Any sign not so authorized is subject to immediate
removal by the City, with the costs charged to the owner or person having
control of such sign, with payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of
charges. Removal of the sign under this provision does not preclude prosecution
of the person responsible for the sign.   
      (3)   Signs on the roof surface or extending above the roofline of a
building or its parapet wall greater than five (5) square feet in area.   
      (4)   Any sign located in the vision triangle formed by any two (2) or
more intersecting streets or any street and alley.    
      (5)   Window signs with an aggregate area on a window or door in excess
of twenty-five percent (25%) of the total area of the window or door or located
above the first floor unless the related use is only on the floor where the
window sign is displayed.    
         (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1371.09 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Setback and Placement. Except as otherwise expressly permitted, all
freestanding signs and flagpoles shall be set back from any public right-of-way
at least the height of the sign. Electronic message displays shall be placed
perpendicular to residential structures where possible and shall comply with
Federal Communications Commission regulations, including the avoidance of
harmful interference with radio frequencies.    
   (b)   Illumination. The purpose of the following provisions regulating
signage lighting is to ensure that signs are lighted in such a manner as to
maintain aesthetic consistency with signs already existing in the city and to
ensure the safety of drivers and pedestrians, while also ensuring that signs
are adequately able to convey sign messages.   
      (1)   Definitions.   
         A.   "Candela" means the basic unit of measurement of light in SI
(metric) units.   
         B.   "Candela per square meter (cd/m²)" means the SI (metric) unit
used to describe the luminance of a light source or of an illuminated surface
that reflects light. Also referred to as Nits.   
         C.   "Nit" means a photometric unit of measurement referring to
luminance. One nit is equal to one cd/m².   
         D.   "SI (International System of Units)" means the modern metric
system of measurement, abbreviated SI for the French term "Le Systeme
International d'Unites."    
      (2)   Excluding signs accessory to a residential use, signs in any
district may be illuminated at night. Signs that are illuminated at night may
not exceed a maximum luminance level of seven hundred and fifty (750) cd/m² or
Nits, regardless of the method of illumination, at least one-half (0.5) hour
before Apparent Sunset, as determined by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA), US Department of Commerce, for the specific geographic
location and date. All illuminated signs must comply with this maximum
luminance level throughout the night, if the sign is energized, until Apparent
Sunrise, as determined by the NOAA, at which time the sign may resume luminance
levels appropriate for daylight conditions.
      (3)   The maximum luminance during daylight conditions, between Apparent
Sunrise and one-half hour before Apparent Sunset, shall be ten thousand
(10,000) cd/m² or Nits.   
      (4)   All permitted and conditional use signs may be backlit, internally
lighted, or indirectly lighted, subject to lighting limitations in this code.
All external sign lighting shall have lighting fixtures or luminaires that are
fully shielded.   
      (5)   Temporary signs shall not be lighted.   
      (6)   Any sign, when illuminated, shall be externally illuminated with
white light only.   
   (c)   Maximum Height Measurements. Wall signs and other signs with sign
structures not affixed to the ground are measured from the lowest attached
component of the sign to the highest attached component of the sign. The height
of signs with sign structures affixed to the ground is measured as the distance
from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached
component of the sign, subject to limitations in this Article. Normal grade is
the lower of:   
      (1)   Existing grade prior to construction; or   
      (2)   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating primarily for the purpose of mounting
or elevating the sign.   
   (d)   Measurement of Sign Area. Sign area is calculated under the following
principles:
      (1)   With signs that are regular polygons or circles, the area can be
calculated by the mathematical formula for that polygon or circle. With signs
that are not regular polygons or circles, the sign area is calculated using all
that area within a maximum of three (3) abutting or overlapping rectangles that
enclose the sign face.    
      (2)   The permitted area of a double-faced, a-frame sign shall be
considered to be the area on one side only. If one face contains a larger sign
area than the other, the larger face shall be used in calculating the sign
area.    
      (3)   For projecting signs, the sign area also includes the area of the
visible sides of the sign, calculated as a rectangle enclosing each entire side
view.
      (4)   Supports, uprights, or structures on which any sign is supported
shall not be included in determining the sign area unless such supports,
uprights, or structures are designed in such a way as to form an integral
background of the display; except, however, when a sign is placed on a fence,
wall, planter, or other similar structure that is designed to serve a separate
purpose other than to support the sign, the entire area of such structure shall
not be computed.    
      (5)   In instances where there are multiple tenants or users on a
property or in a building, allowable sign area for all parties shall not exceed
the maximum sign area computed based upon the number of tenants multiplied by
forty (40) square feet per tenant. In no case shall any tenant sign exceed
forty (40) square feet.   
      (6)   All signs displayed, whether permanent or temporary, and regardless
of the type of sign are counted toward the maximum sign area allowed per use.
   (e)   Number of Signs. All signs displayed on a lot, whether permanent or
temporary, and regardless of the type of sign are counted towards the maximum
number of signs permitted per use.   
   (f)   Wall Signs.     
      (1)   Wall signs larger than one hundred (100) square feet shall provide
as part of a zoning permit application:    
         A.   Express permission from the operator or owner of the building;
         B.   The name and address of the person applying the wall sign; and
         C.   A clear drawing of the proposed wall sign including dimensions
and location.   
      (2)   Wall signs larger than one hundred (100) square feet are subject to
the design review standard in Subsection (g).   
   (g)   Design Review Standards for Signs. Design review standards shall apply
to wall signs in excess of one hundred (100) square feet. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall issue zoning permits for signs subject to design review in
accordance with Section
1373.05, and the Board of Zoning Appeals shall issue a determination within
forty (40) business days. In determining whether a sign is compatible with the
theme and overall character to be achieved in each zoning district or overlay,
the Board of Zoning Appeals shall base its compatibility determination on the
following criteria:   
      (1)   The relationship of the scale and placement of the sign to the
building or premises on which it is to be displayed.   
      (2)   The relationship of the colors of the sign to the colors of
adjacent buildings and nearby signs.   
      (3)   The similarity or dissimilarity of the sign's size and shape to the
size and shape of other signs in the area.   
      (4)   The similarity or dissimilarity of the style of lettering or number
of words on the sign to the style of lettering or number of words of nearby
signs.
      (5)   The compatibility of the type of illumination, if any, with the
type of illumination in the area.   
      (6)   The compatibility of the materials used in the construction of the
sign with the materials used in the construction of other signs in the area.   
         (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1371.11 NONCONFORMING SIGNS.
   (a)   Signs lawfully existing on the effective date of this code that do not
conform to the provisions of this code, and signs that are accessory to a
nonconforming use shall be deemed nonconforming signs and may remain except as
qualified below.    
      (1)   Nonconforming signs shall not be enlarged nor shall any feature of
a nonconforming sign, such as illumination or technology, be increased.
      (2)   Nonconforming signs shall not be extended, structurally
reconstructed, altered in any manner, or replaced with another nonconforming
sign nor increased in technological advancement, except as permitted by this
code.
      (3)   Nonconforming signs shall not be moved for any distance on the same
lot or to any other lot unless such change in location will make the sign
conform in all respects to the provisions of this Article.    
      (4)   A nonconforming sign that is destroyed or damaged by any casualty
to an extent not exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the sign's area may be
restored within six (6) months after such destruction or damage, but shall not
be enlarged, nor may the sign's nonconformity be increased. If such sign is so
destroyed or damaged to an extent exceeding fifty percent (50%) of the sign's
area, the sign shall not be reconstructed but may be replaced with a sign that
is in full accordance with this code.   
      (5)   Nonconforming sign structures shall be removed if the use to which
they are accessory has not been in operation for a period of one (1) year or
more, except as provided in Section
1371.13(h). Such sign structure shall be removed or made conforming by the
owner or lessee of the property. If the owner or lessee fails to remove or make
conforming the sign structure within thirty (30) days of notice by the Zoning
Officer, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be made conforming or removed
and the cost of such removal or modification shall be charged to the owner,
person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with payment
due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.   
      (6)   If a nonconforming sign is altered such that the sign is conforming
or is replaced by a conforming sign, such sign shall thereafter be kept in
accordance with the provisions of this code.    
   (b)   The burden of establishing nonconforming status of signs and the
physical characteristics and location of such signs shall be with the owner of
the property. Upon notice from the Zoning Officer, a property owner shall
submit verification that sign(s) were lawfully erected. Failure to provide such
verification shall cause the sign to be deemed an illegal sign.
   (c)   Nothing in this Section shall prevent keeping a nonconforming sign in
good repair.
(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)   
1371.13 MAINTENANCE AND REMOVAL.
   (a)   All signs shall be constructed and mounted in compliance with the
building code. All signs and components thereof shall be maintained in good
repair and in a safe, neat, and clean condition.    
   (b)   Safety Hazard. The Zoning Officer may cause to have removed or
repaired immediately without written notice any sign that has become insecure,
in danger of falling, or otherwise unsafe, and, as such, presents an immediate
threat to the safety of the public. If such action is necessary to render a
sign safe, the cost of such emergency removal or repair shall be charged to the
owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with
payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.    
   (c)   Nuisance. Any sign that constitutes a nuisance shall be abated by the
owner within thirty (30) days of notice by the Zoning Officer. At any time, the
Zoning Officer may cause the nuisance to be abated with the costs charged to
the owner, person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign,
with payment due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.    
   (d)   Illegal Sign and Disrepair. Any sign that is illegal or in disrepair
shall be made conforming or repaired within thirty (30) days of notice from the
Zoning Officer. Signs of disrepair include chipped paint, missing or
significantly faded letters or other aspects of the sign, cracked portions of
the sign face, broken lighting, graffiti, and unleveled portions of the sign
structure or face. If an illegal sign or a sign in disrepair is not made
conforming or repaired, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be removed or
repaired and the cost of such removal or repair shall be charged to the owner,
person having control, or person receiving benefit from such sign, with payment
due within thirty (30) days of notice of charges.    
   (e)   Expired Permit. Any sign for which a permit has expired shall be
removed within five (5) days of the permit expiration. If the sign is not
removed, the Zoning Officer may cause the sign to be removed and the cost of
such removal shall be charged to the owner, person having control, or person
receiving benefit from such sign, with payment due within thirty (30) days of
notice of charges.    
   (f)   The owner of any commercial sign, whether conforming or nonconforming,
other than a permitted off-premises sign, located on commercial property where
the use or business has ceased operating shall, within sixty (60) days of the
cessation of the use or business operation, remove temporary signs and all
aspects of any permanent signs with a commercial message. Property owners may
request, in writing, a waiver of such requirement, if the use is temporarily or
seasonally operational, is remodeling, or otherwise has the good will intention
of resuming the use within one (1) year of time of cessation. (Ord. 319. Passed
6-18-24.)
1371.15 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
   Temporary signs pose distinct concerns with visual clutter, safety in
erection and display, and removal when the time for display has concluded.
Temporary signs also pose distinct concerns with materials quality. The
following provisions and individual zoning of temporary signs per district
serve to address these concerns.
   (a)   Temporary signs require a permit, except as provided in this Article,
and may be permitted up to thirty (30) days per calendar year for dwelling uses
or fourteen (14) days per calendar year for all other uses. Temporary signs
accessory to non-dwelling uses may not be erected more than six (6) times in a
calendar year.
   (b)   A use may erect one temporary, off-premises sign on property in any
district where permitted, except residential districts, with the consent of the
persons in charge of such properties, no more than two (2) times in one
calendar year. Each sign shall be no more than eight (8) feet in height and
sixteen (16) square feet in area, and such area counts against the maximum sign
area permitted on that lot.    
   (c)   No more than one (1) temporary, off-premises sign may be displayed per
lot, excluding commercial districts.   
   (d)   Temporary signs shall be securely affixed to the ground or a building,
or a pole designated only to a single temporary sign.   
   (e)   Person-assisted signs shall not be located more than ten (10) feet
from the entrance to a building or within ten (10) feet of a right-of-way.    
      (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1371.17 SIGNS FOR R-1 AND R-2 DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose. Signage in residential districts poses a heightened risk of
visual blight and unsightly clutter, as residential neighborhoods typically
contain markedly less signage than other districts in order to maintain the
residential character of the neighborhood. At the same time, communicating from
one's residence is a distinct and impactful form of speech that should be
protected, and nonresidential uses should be afforded adequate signage
incidental to the primary use, i.e. on-premises signs, in residential
districts. Signs permitted in these districts are smaller, fewer in number, and
limited in sign type in order to limit visual clutter and distraction, while
affording ample speech.   
   (b)   Signs Permitted as Accessory to Dwellings.    
      (1)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to dwellings: A-frame,
Chalkboard, Flag, Geological, Minor, Projecting, Topiary, Wall, and Window. No
more than four (4) permanent signs are permitted by right per dwelling.    
      (2)   Permitted temporary signs as accessory to dwellings: A-frame,
Banner, Chalkboard, Flag, Inflatable/Tethered, Minor, Pennant, Wicket, and
Window. No more than four (4) temporary signs are permitted by right per
dwelling.    
      (3)   No more than four (4) flags as accessory to dwellings.   
   (c)   Signs Permitted as Accessory to Non-dwellings.    
      (1)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to non-dwellings: A-
frame, Awning/Canopy, Chalkboard, Flags, Geological, Minor, Monument,
Projecting, Topiary, Wall, and Window. No more than two (2) permanent signs are
permitted by right per use.    
      (2)   Permitted temporary signs: A-Frame, Banner, Chalkboard, Flag,
Minor, Pennant, Wicket, and Window. No more than two (2) temporary signs are
permitted by right per use.    
      (3)   No more than four (4) flags.   
   (d)   Dimension Specifications Chart. All maximum sign area requirements
include the sum total sign area of all signs per use.

(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1371.19 SIGNS FOR OPEN SPACE AND CONSERVATION DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose. On-premises signage in open space and conservation areas is
essential for the operation of a variety of uses. However, in order to maintain
the natural beauty of these areas, signage that is less intrusive by being
smaller, shorter in height, and more uniform in sign type should be utilized to
preserve the aesthetic qualities of these distinct areas.   
   (b)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as for
Section
1371.17.   
   (c)   Signs Permitted as Accessory to Non-dwellings.    
      (1)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to non-dwellings: Flag,
Geological Signs, Minor, Monument, Projecting, Topiary, Wall, and Window. No
more than four (4) permanent signs are permitted by right per use.    
      (2)   Permitted temporary signs: Banner, Flag, Geological, Minor,
Monument, Projecting, Topiary, Wall and Wicket. No more than eight (8)
temporary signs are permitted by right per use.    
      (3)   No more than three (3) flags.

(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1371.21 SIGNS FOR OFFICE RESIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Purpose. On-premises signage and limited off-premises signage is
needed in office residential, education and institutional, community center,
and neighborhood commercial areas. However, in lower intensity nonresidential
districts, particularly those near residential development and neighboring
residential districts, signage should remain less intrusive by being smaller,
shorter in height, and more uniform in sign type to maintain compatibility with
neighboring districts and limit the visual distraction of signage.   
   (b)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as for
Section
1371.17.   
   (c)   Signs Permitted as Accessory to Non-dwellings.    
      (1)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to non-dwellings: A-
Frame, Awning/Canopy, Chalkboard, Flag, Geological, Minor, Monument, Topiary,
Wall, and Window. No more than two (2) permanent signs are permitted by right
per use.    
      (2)   Permitted temporary signs: A-Frame, Banner, Chalkboard, Flag,
Minor, Pennant, Wicket, and Window. No more than two (2) temporary signs are
permitted by right per use.

1371.23 SIGNS FOR EDUCATIONAL AND INSTITUTIONAL.
   (a)   Purpose. On-premises signage and limited off-premises signage is
needed in office residential, education and institutional, community center,
and neighborhood commercial areas. However, in lower intensity nonresidential
districts, particularly those near residential development and neighboring
residential districts, signage should remain less intrusive by being smaller,
shorter in height, and more uniform in sign type to maintain compatibility with
neighboring districts and limit the visual distraction of signage.   
   (b)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as for
Section
1371.17.   
   (c)   Signs Permitted as Accessory to Non-dwellings.    
      (1)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to non-dwellings: A-
Frame, Awning/Canopy, Chalkboard, Flag, Geological, Minor, Monument, Topiary,
Wall, and Window. No more than two (2) permanent signs are permitted by right
per use.    
      (2)   Permitted temporary signs: A-Frame, Banner, Chalkboard, Flag,

1371.25 SIGNS FOR NEIGHBORHOOD COMMERCIAL.
   (a)   Purpose. On-premises signage and limited off-premises signage is
needed in office residential, education and institutional, and neighborhood
commercial areas. However, in lower intensity nonresidential districts,
particularly those near residential development and neighboring residential
districts, signage should remain less intrusive by being smaller, shorter in
height, and more uniform in sign type to maintain compatibility with
neighboring districts and limit the visual distraction of signage.   
   (b)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as for

(Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1371.27 SIGNS FOR GENERAL COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose. Signage in heavier commercial and industrial districts is
allowed to a greater extent, in size, number, and sign type, in order to
maintain proportion to the size and scope of uses typically present within
these districts. However, even the most intensive use districts in smaller
communities are still limited in signage to some degree in order to maintain
the small-town character of smaller communities and to limit visual distraction
by signage.   
   (b)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as for
Section
1371.17.   
   (c)   Signs Permitted as Accessory to Non-dwellings.    
      (1)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to non-dwellings: A-
Frame, Awning/Canopy, Chalkboard, Changeable Copy, EMD static, Flag,

1371.29 SIGNS FOR COMMUNITY CENTER DISTRICT.
   (a)   Purpose. On-premises signage and limited off-premises signage is
needed in the community center areas. However, in lower intensity
nonresidential districts, particularly those near residential development and
neighboring residential districts, signage should remain less intrusive by
being smaller, shorter in height, and more uniform in sign type to maintain
compatibility with neighboring districts and limit the visual distraction of
signage.   
   (b)   Permitted sign use as accessory to dwellings shall be the same as for
Section
1371.17.   
   (c)   Signs Permitted as Accessory to Non-dwellings.    
      (1)   Permitted permanent sign use as accessory to non-dwellings: A-
Frame, Awning/Canopy, Chalkboard, Flag, Geological, Minor, Monument, Topiary,
Wall, and Window. No more than four (4) permanent signs are permitted by right
per use.    
      (2)   Permitted temporary signs: A-Frame, Banner, Chalkboard, Flag,
Minor, Wicket, and Window. No more than two (2) temporary signs are permitted
by right per use.    
      (3)   No more than three (3) flags.   
   (d)   Dimension Specifications Chart. All maximum sign area requirements
include the sum total sign area of all signs per use.

      (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1375.09 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (a)   Purpose and Applicability. The purpose of this Section is to regulate
and limit the continued existence of uses, structures, and lots established
prior to the effective date of this ordinance or any amendment thereto that
does not conform to this code. Any nonconformity created by a change in the
classification of property or the text of this code shall be regulated by the
provisions of this Article.    
   (b)   General Provisions.   
      (1)   Nonconforming lots, structures, or uses may continue to exist, be
bought or sold, altered, restored, or extended only in accordance with the
provisions of this code.    
      (2)   Nothing in this code shall prevent the strengthening or restoring
to a safe condition any portion of a nonconforming structure declared unsafe by
a proper authority.   
      (3)   Nothing in this ordinance shall be interpreted as authorization for
or approval of the continuance of the illegal use of a structure or premises in
violation of zoning controls in existence at the time of the effective date of
legal enactment of this code.    
      (4)   Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to
transfer an area from one district to another district of a different
classification, the foregoing provisions shall apply to any nonconformities
existing therein.
      (5)   Nothing in this Section prohibits alterations or additions to or
replacement of buildings or structures owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer, or the use of land presently owned by any farm, industry, or
manufacturer but not used for agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing
purposes, or the use or acquisition of additional land that may be required for
the protection, continuing development, or expansion of any agricultural,
industrial, or manufacturing operation of any present or future satellite
agricultural, industrial, or manufacturing use.   
   (c)   Nonconforming Uses.   
      (1)   If a nonconforming use has ceased for one (1) year, abandonment
shall be presumed and the nonconforming use shall not resume. Any future use of
the land or structures shall conform to and be in accordance with this
ordinance. Abandonment of a nonconforming use shall be presumed if one (1) or
more of the following conditions exists, indicating intent on the part of the
property owner to abandon the nonconforming use:   
         A.   When the intent of the owner to discontinue the use is apparent;
         B.   Utilities, such as water, gas, and electricity to the property
have been disconnected;   
         C.   The property, buildings, and grounds, have fallen into disrepair
as evidenced by proper code violation documentation;   
         D.   When the nonconforming use has been replaced by a conforming
use;   
         E.   When the nonconforming use has been changed to a use permitted or
conditional use by the City of Lewisburg; or   
         F.   The business license issued by the City of Lewisburg has expired.
      (2)   Once a nonconforming use has been changed or converted to a
conforming use, it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use.   
   (d)   Nonconforming Buildings or Structures.   
      (1)   A lawful nonconforming structure that is damaged the extent of
fifty percent (50%) or more of its appraised value, as valuated within twelve
(12) months of when the damage occurred, shall not be restored unless it is in
full conformance with this code.   
      (2)   A lawful nonconforming structure that is damaged, by neither
malfeasance nor wanton disregard by an interested party, to the extent of less
than fifty percent (50%) of the structure' appraised value, as valuated within
twelve (12) months of when the damage occurred, may be reconstructed, provided
that:   
         A.   The reconstructed structure shall not exceed the height, area, or
volume of the original structure; and   
         B.   Reconstruction shall be commenced within one year from the date
the structure was destroyed or condemned and shall be carried on without
interruption.   
      (3)   In the event an aggrieved person contests the appraised value
determination, three (3) arbitrators shall be appointed, one (1) by City
Council, one (1) by the aggrieved party, and one (1) by the two arbitrators or
one (1) by the Board of Zoning Appeals if the two arbitrators cannot agree on
the third arbitrator. Any determination regarding he percentage of damage made
by the three (3) arbitrators shall be deemed the official decision of the BZA.
      (4)   The extension of a lawful use to any portion of a nonconforming
structure shall not be deemed the extension of a nonconforming use.   
   (e)   Nonconforming Lot.   
      (1)   Except as provided in this Section, a nonconforming vacant lot
existing and of official record as of the effective date of this ordinance may
be developed for any of the uses permitted by these regulations in the zoning
district in which it is located, provided that the use meets all applicable
yard and setback requirements for the zoning district in which the lot is
located.
      (2)   A nonconforming vacant lot shall not be developed if it could be
combined with an adjoining lot owned by the same person on or after the
effective date of these regulations in order to create a single lot. Where an
owner owns adjoining property, construction may occur across the lot lines if
that is the only way the yard requirements may be met without a variance. If
said combination, however, results in the creation of a single lot that is more
than one and one-half (1.5) times the minimum lot width or area required in the
zoning district, then the single lot may be divided into two lots of equal
width and area without being further classified as nonconforming. For the
purposes of this Section, "adjoining" shall be deemed to mean the sharing of
one or more common lot lines and access to both lots can be provided by the
same street without crossing that street.
   (f)   Nonconforming Accessory Uses and Structures. No nonconforming
accessory use or accessory structure shall continue after the principal use or
structure is terminated by abandonment, damage, or destruction unless such
accessory use or accessory structure thereafter is made to conform to the
standards for the zoning district in which it is located. No nonconforming
accessory use or structure shall become or replace any terminated principal
nonconforming use or structure.   
   (g)   Enlargement or Extension of a Nonconforming Use.    
      (1)   Except if specifically provided for in this Section, no person may
engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity
in a nonconforming situation. In particular, it shall be unlawful to:   
         A.   Increase the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming
use.
         B.   Increase nonconformity with respect to density restrictions,
dimensional requirements such as setbacks and other requirements such as
parking.   
      (2)   A nonconforming use may be extended throughout any portion of a
completed building, that when the use was made nonconforming by this Ordinance,
was manifestly designed or arranged to accommodate such use.
      (3)   Notwithstanding other limitations of this article, any structure
used for single family residential purposes and maintained as a nonconforming
use may be enlarged or replaced with a similar structure of a larger size, so
long as replacement or enlargement does not create new nonconformities with
respect to such matters as setback and parking requirements.
      (4)   Enlargement or extension approval shall be void if construction
work does not begin within one year from the date of approval, or if work is
suspended or abandoned for a period of ninety (90) days at any time after the
work is commenced.   
      (5)   All enlargement or extension of a nonconforming use must comply
with the applicable floodplain management requirements.   
         (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1375.11 VARIANCES.
   (a)   A variance is a deviation from the minimum standards of this ordinance
and shall not involve permitting land uses that are otherwise prohibited in the
zoning district nor shall it involve changing the zoning classifications of a
parcel of land.   
   (b)   The City of Lewisburg Board of Zoning Appeals shall grant a variance
to this ordinance if it finds that the variance:   
      (1)   Will not adversely affect the public health, safety, or welfare or
the rights of adjacent property owners and residents;   
      (2)   Arises from special conditions or attributes that pertain to the
property for which a variance is sought and that were not created by the person
seeking the variance;   
      (3)   Would eliminate an unnecessary hardship and permit a reasonable use
of the land; and   
      (4)   Will allow the intent of this ordinance to be observed and
substantial justice done.     
         (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1375.13 APPEAL TO BOARD OF ZONING APPEALS.
   An appeal from any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by
the Zoning Officer or any other person charged with the enforcement of this
ordinance shall be filed by an aggrieved person with the City of Lewisburg
Board of Zoning Appeals. The appeal shall:
   (a)   Specify the grounds for appeal;   
   (b)   Be filed within thirty (30) days of the date of the original order,
requirement, decision, or determination made by the Zoning Officer, which time
period shall be jurisdictional in nature;    
   (c)   Be on the form prescribed by the Board; and   
   (d)   Upon request of the City of Lewisburg Board of Zoning Appeals, the
Zoning Officer shall transmit all documents, plans, and papers constituting the
record of the action from which the appeal was taken.   
      (Ord. 319. Passed 6-18-24.)
1375.15 NOTICE AND HEARING OF APPEAL.

Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA), the BZA shall set a time for the hearing of the
appeal and give notice. The hearing on the appeal must be held within forty-
five (45) days of receipt of the appeal by the Board.   
   (b)   At least fifteen (15) days prior to the date set for the hearing on
the appeal, the BZA shall publish a notice of the date, time, and place of the
hearing on the appeal as a Class I legal advertisement, pursuant to the West
Virginia Code, and written notice shall be given to the interested parties. The
publication area shall be the area covered in the appeal.   
   (c)   The BZA may require the party taking the appeal to pay for the cost of
public notice and written notice to interested parties.   
   (d)   At the hearing, any party may appear in person, by agent, or by an
attorney licensed to practice in this state.   
   (e)   Every decision by the BZA shall be in writing and state specific
findings of fact and conclusions of law on which the BZA based its decision. If
the BZA fails to provide findings of fact and conclusions of law adequate for
decision by the circuit court and as a result of the failure, the circuit court
returns an appealed matter to the BZA and dismisses jurisdiction over an
applicant's appeal without deciding the matter, whether the court returns the
matter with or without restrictions, the BZA shall pay any additional costs for
court filing fees, service of process, and reasonable attorney's fees required
to permit the person appealing the BZA's decision to return the matter to the
circuit court for the completion of the appeal.   
   (f)   The written decision by the BZA shall be rendered within thirty (30)
days after the hearing. If the BZA fails to render a written decision within
thirty days after the hearing, then any party may pursue additional legal
remedies to obtain a decision, including, but not limited to, seeking a writ of
mandamus.   
   (g)   When an appeal has been filed with the BZA, all proceedings and work
on the premises in question shall be stayed, except as provided below:   
      (1)   If the official or board from where the appeal was taken certifies
in writing to the BZA that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or
property;
      (2)   Upon further administrative proceedings, including, but not limited
to, submissions to and reviews by the staff or any administrative body; or
      (3)   Upon engineering or architectural work that does not disturb the
real estate beyond what is necessary to complete engineering, survey work, or
other tests.   
   (h)   Petition for Writ of Certiorari. The final decision of the City of
Lewisburg Board of Zoning Appeals shall be subject to review by the Circuit
Court of Greenbrier County, West Virginia, by certiorari, as provided by West
Virginia Code Section 8A-9-1 et seq.   
   (i)   Nothing in this Section prevents a party from obtaining an
injunction.

1713.02 INTERPRETATIONS AND DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Definitions.
   General
Unless specifically defined below, words and phrases used in this Ordinance
shall be interpreted so as to give this Ordinance it's most reasonable
application.
      (1)   "Adjacent Property". Adjacent Property includes any surface tract,
regardless of whether such surface tract is entirely within the City of
Lewisburg so long as a portion of said surface tract is located within the City
of Lewisburg, which shares an immediate and common boundary up or down stream
to the property that is the subject of the application for Floodplain Permit.
Adjacent property also includes all other property that may be affected by
flooding.
      (2)   Advisory Flood Height. The water surface elevation (WSEL), in feet,
of the one percent (1%) annual chance (100-year) flood at a given location, as
determined using hydrology and hydraulics (H&H) analysis and the best available
elevation data.
      (3)   "Adversely Affect Adjacent Properties". To adversely affect a
property the increase in the elevation of the 100-year base flood elevation
must be more than one (1) foot at any point. Stated conversely, if the effect
is that the 100-year flood base flood elevation rises one (1) foot or less the
property is not "affected". This standard does not apply to the Floodway. If
prior permit(s) has/have been approved in the same area of the Floodplain, the
above definition would include the cumulative impact to the base flood
elevation.
      (4)   Appurtenant Structure. A secondary structure on the same parcel of
property as the principal structure, the use of which is incidental and shall
not be habitable but shall be used only for storage in association with the
principal structure on said property. This does not include a gas or liquid
storage tank.
      (5)   Base Flood . Means the flood having a one percent (1%) chance of
being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
      (6)   Base Flood Elevation (BFE). The water surface elevation of the base
flood in relation to the datum specified on the County's Flood Insurance Rate
Map. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the one hundred (100) year flood or
one percent (1%) or greater chance of flooding in any given year. (See 100 year
flood also)
      (7)   Basement. Any area of the building having its floor sub grade
(below ground level) on all sides.
      (8)   Certificate of Compliance. A certification that the entire
development, including the elevation of fill or the lowest floor of a structure
is in compliance with all the provisions of this Ordinance.
      (9)   Compensatory storage. An artificially excavated, hydraulically
equivalent volume of storage within the special flood hazard area used to
balance the loss of natural flood storage when artificial fill or structures
are placed within the special flood hazard area.

demolish any building, highway, road, railroad, structure or excavation
associated with a project, development or improvement, or to do any part
thereof, including the erection of scaffolding or other structures or works in
connection therewith, where the cost of undertaking is two thousand five
hundred dollars or more. Contractor includes a construction manager who
performs management and counseling services on a construction project for a
professional fee.

not possible, to reduce the adverse impact of the non-compliance to the
greatest extent feasible.
      (40)   Special Flood Hazard Area. The land in the Floodplain Area subject
to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood
hazard areas are designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in Flood
Insurance Studies and on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as Zones A, AE, AO, A1-30,
and A99. The term includes areas shown on other flood hazard maps that are
specifically listed or otherwise described in this Ordinance.
      (41)   Start of Construction.  (The definition for start of construction
is to be used only when calculating the starting time for expiration of a
Floodplain Permit.)
         The date the Floodplain Permit was issued, including Floodplain Permit
for substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage provided the actual
start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
placement or other improvement was within 180 days of the Floodplain Permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent
construction on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, the
installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond initial
excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Although a
Floodplain Permit must be obtained prior to beginning, permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For an alteration, the actual

storage tank that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
      (45)   Subdivision. Development that includes a creation of individual
land parcels for future sale. It does not include development where rights-of-
way or easements are obtained and recorded.
      (46)   Subject Property. "Subject property" includes the surface tract(s)
upon which the proposed development is planned and for which the Floodplain
Permit Application is submitted.
      (47)   Substantial Damage. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damage condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
      (48)   Substantial Improvement. Any repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the fair market value of the
structure before the start of construction of the improvement.
         This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial
damage", as defined herein regardless of the actual repair work performed. The
term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure to
correct existing violation(s) of State or Local Health, Sanitary or Safety Code
Specifications which have been identified by the Local Code Enforcement
Official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions.
         Historic structures undergoing repair or rehabilitation that would
constitute a substantial improvement as defined above, must comply with all
Ordinance requirements that do not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure. Documentation that a specific Ordinance
requirement will cause removal of the structure from the National Register of
Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places must be obtained from
the Secretary of the Interior or the State Historic Preservation Officer. Any
exemption from Ordinance requirements will be the minimum necessary to preserve
the historic character and design of the structure.
         For the purpose of this definition improvement is considered to occur
when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part
of the building commences whether or not the alteration affects the external
dimensions of the structure.
      (49)   Top of Bank. The lines depicted on the FIRM maps delineating each
side of a stream indicate the top of the bank. In the field a professional
familiar with fluvial geomorphology should document the top of the bank. When a
professional is not employed the top of the bank will be considered to be the
top of the first significant slope landward of the water's edge when it is
followed by at least fifty (50) feet of relatively flat land.
      (50)   Variance. A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a
floodplain management regulation.
      (51)   Violation. The failure of any structure or development to be fully
compliant with all requirements of this Ordinance. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other
evidence of compliance required by this Ordinance is presumed to be in
violation until such time as the documentation is provided. No future
improvements or developments can be made to structures found to be in violation
unless the development is to bring the structure into compliance with the
current ordinance.
         (Ord. 318. Passed 5-16-23.)
1713.03 ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Identification.
      (1)   The identified special flood hazard area shall be those areas of
the City of Lewisburg which are subject to a one percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and
described in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) prepared for the City of Lewisburg
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) dated July 5, 2023, or the
most recent revision thereof including all digital data developed as part of
the FIS.
      (2)   The identified special flood hazard area shall also be those
special flood hazard areas which have been identified as flood hazard areas by
the City of Lewisburg by use of historic or other technical data and shown on
an officially recognized "FIRM or the West Virginia Flood Hazard Determination
Tool Specifically Advisory Flood Height data". These areas shall be designated
as appropriate with the level of technical data described below and shall be
managed accordingly.
   (b)   Descriptions of Special Flood Hazard Areas. The identified special
flood hazard area shall consist of the following four specific areas:
      (1)   The Floodway Area shall be those areas of AE zone identified as
Floodways in the FIS and as shown on the FIRM. The term shall also include any
floodway areas delineated by developers in the approximated floodplain and
designated as such by the community.
      (2)   The AE Area Without Floodway shall be those areas identified as an
AE Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA for which 100-year
flood elevations have been provided but no Floodway has been delineated.
      (3)   The Approximated floodplain shall be those areas identified as an A
Zone on the FIRM included in the FIS prepared by FEMA and for which no one
hundred (100) year flood elevations have been provided
      (4)   Advisory Flood Heights This information is displayed on the WV
Flood Hazard Determination Tool. This data may be used (when available) by the
Floodplain Administrator to determine if a property is in the Special Flood
Hazard Area, also to assist to determine the height in which to elevate the
structure as a permitting tool. And is acceptable data to FEMA for a Letter of
Map Amendment (LOMA).
      (5)   The AO and AH floodplain those areas identified as Zones AO and AH
on the FIRM and in the FIS. These areas are subject to inundation by one
percent (1%)-annual-chance shallow flooding where average depths are between
one and three (3) feet. In Zones AO and AH, drainage paths shall be established
to guide floodwaters around and away from structures on slopes.
   (c)   Changes in Designation of Area.  
      (1)   Where natural or man-made changes have occurred and/or where more
detailed studies have been completed by a qualified government agency, private
entity, or qualified individual who can sufficiently document the necessity for
such changes; the process to revise the delineation of the identified special
flood hazard area may be recommended by the floodplain manager and executed by
the City of Lewisburg. However, prior to any such change, approval must be
obtained from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   A County's base flood elevations may increase or decrease resulting
from physical changes affecting flooding conditions. As soon as practical but,
not later than six (6) months from the date such information becomes available,
the County shall notify FEMA of the changes by submitting technical or
scientific data.
      (3)   The City of Lewisburg may identify and regulate new flood hazard or
ponding areas. These areas shall be delineated on a "Local Flood Hazard Map"
using best available topographic data and locally derived information such as
flood of record, historic high water marks and/or approximate study
methodologies.
   (d)   Elevations Prevail.
      (1)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
above the Base Flood Elevation, and the following is provided to the Floodplain
Administrator:
         i.   Elevation information certified by a Licensed Professional
Surveyor or Engineer and a site plan demonstrating that all proposed
development will occur above the Base Flood Elevation or,
         ii.   A Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) from FEMA removing the site
from the SHFA
         then the site shall be considered to be outside the Floodplain Area
and shall not be required to conform to the provisions of this Ordinance at the
discretion of the Floodplain Manager.
      (2)   If the lowest natural grade adjacent to proposed development is
below the Base Flood Elevation, the site shall be considered to be within the
Floodplain Area and the proposed structure shall be required to conform to all
appropriate provisions of this Ordinance.
   (e)   Boundary Disputes. Should a dispute concerning any Floodplain boundary
arise, an initial determination shall be made by the Floodplain Administrator
and any party aggrieved by this decision may appeal to the City of Lewisburg
sitting as the "Floodplain Appeals Board". The burden of proof shall be on the
appellant/applicant.
(Ord. 318. Passed 5-16-23.)
1713.04 UTILIZATION OF THE SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (a)   Floodway. Within any Floodway Area (F1), no encroachments, including
fill, new construction, substantial improvements, or other development shall be
permitted unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood discharge. The resultant engineering study
shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
   Because Floodways present increased risk to human life and property due to
their relatively faster and deeper flowing waters the Floodways shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible.
      (1)   New development shall not be permitted in the Floodway where
reasonable alternatives exist elsewhere as determined by Floodplain Manager. In
addition to the requirements below the applicant shall demonstrate that there
are no reasonable alternatives other than the Floodway encroachment before a
permit is issued.
      (2)   When the Floodway is the only reasonable alternative the applicant
shall demonstrate that the Floodway encroachment is the minimum necessary to
accomplish the project.
      (3)   All permitted uses, activities, and development shall be undertaken
in strict compliance with the flood proofing and related provisions contained
herein, and in all other applicable Federal and State Law, Ordinances and
Regulations.
      (4)   When small, single lot development (not incorporating significant
amounts of fill) is proposed in a special flood hazard areas for which no
regulatory floodway has been designated, a regulatory floodway may, at the
discretion of the Floodplain Manager, be determined to be a width equal to the
channel of the stream and the adjacent land areas to a distance of one-half the
width of the special flood hazard area as measured from the top of the bank
nearest the site to the upland limit of the one percent (1%) annual chance
special flood hazard area boundary.
   (b)   AE Zone Without Floodway Area. Within any AE Zone Without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
   (c)   Approximated Floodplain (Zone A). Within any Approximated Floodplain
Area:
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator shall use elevation and floodway
information from Federal, State, or other acceptable sources when available to
determine the elevation above which development will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
      (2)   When data from an acceptable source is not available, the
Floodplain Administrator shall review, or shall cause to be reviewed; all
proposed development to determine (1) the amount being invested and (2) the
specific flood risk at the site. The Floodplain Administrator shall then
require the applicant to determine the elevation above which the development
and adjacent properties including but not limited to existing buildings will be
reasonably safe from flooding using hydrologic and hydraulic analyses or other
techniques. When hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall
only be prepared by a registered professional engineer who shall certify that
the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible
professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition,
studies, analyses, computations, etc. shall be submitted in sufficient detail
to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Any development and/or use of land shall be permitted provided that
all such uses, activities and/or development shall be undertaken in strict
compliance with this floodplain ordinance and related provisions contained
herein and in all other applicable Federal and State Laws, Ordinances and
Regulations.
      (4)   Within any approximated Floodplain Zone (Zone A) without Floodway
Area, no new construction or development shall be allowed unless it is
demonstrated that the cumulative impact of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the elevation of the 100-year flood more than one (1) foot at any point.
      (5)   When Advisory Flood Height Data is available, this data will be
utilized to assist in permitting and regulating development within the Special
Flood Hazard Area.
   (d)   Alteration or Relocation of a Stream.
      (1)   Whenever a developer intends to alter or relocate a stream within
the special flood hazard area the developer shall notify in writing, by
certified mail, the City of Lewisburg's Floodplain Administrator, the State
Coordinating Office, any adjacent communities and any adjacent property owners
of all such intended activities prior to the alteration or relocation of the
stream. Copies of all required notifications must be submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. In addition, prior to issuing the local permit the
Floodplain Administrator shall require copies of all necessary permits from
those governmental agencies from which Federal or State Law requires approval
      (2)   The developer shall also assure the City of Lewisburg in writing
that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the
stream will be maintained. The Floodplain Administrator may require the
applicant to demonstrate that the altered or relocated portion of stream will
provide equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. If
hydrologic and hydraulic analyses are required, they shall only be undertaken
by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify that the methods used
correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The resulting study
shall include a cover letter, signed by the responsible professional, providing
a statement of findings in basic terms. In addition, studies, analyses and
computations shall be submitted in sufficient detail to allow a thorough
technical review by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Alteration of a stream includes placement of temporary or permanent
culverts, bridges or other stream crossings. The Floodplain Administrator may
require the use of certain "best practice" techniques in the construction of
bridges, culverts or stream crossings to prevent damage, loss of stream
crossings and localized flooding caused by blockage. These techniques may
include, but are not limited to, wing walls, trash grates or requiring openings
to be of sufficient size to pass debris and/or anticipated future increases in
flood heights.
      (4)   All new and replacement bridges, culverts and other stream
crossings shall adhere to the relevant anchoring requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   The developer is required to provide the County a legal agreement
detailing all scheduled inspections and maintenance to be performed on altered
or relocated watercourses including culverts, bridges and other stream
crossings. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the
agreement to the purchaser when the land associated with the watercourse
alteration is transferred. A copy of all new agreements shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the agreement and provide a
signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the
penalties set forth in Section
1713.08(d) of this Ordinance.
      (6)   When any watercourse alteration has occurred, the applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when notified by the Floodplain
Administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA for this
purpose. (Ord. 318. Passed 5-16-23.)
1713.05 CRITERIA FOR BUILDING AND SITE PLAN APPROVAL.

a brief written description of proposed work and the estimated value will
suffice.
   (c)   Elevation and Flood Proofing Information. All applicants are
encouraged to exceed the minimum elevation requirements contained herein. Flood
insurance rates can be lowered significantly by increasing the elevation of the
lowest floor above the freeboard height required by this Ordinance.
   Depending on the type of structure involved, the following information shall
also be included in the application for work within the Special flood hazard
area:
      (1)   All structures, ductwork and electrical connections shall be
elevated two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and:
         A.   A plan showing the size of the proposed structure and its
relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor, certified by a registered
professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   Plans showing the methods of elevating the proposed structure

sewer, water, telephone, electric, gas, etc.) from flooding to two feet above
the Base Flood Elevation at the building site.
         E.   During the course of construction, as soon as the basic elements
of the lowest floor are in place and before further vertical construction, it
is highly recommended that the applicant check for error by obtaining elevation
data completed by a registered professional engineer or licensed professional
surveyor certifying the height of the lowest floor. If a mistake in elevation
has been made this is the best time to correct the error.
         F.   A finished construction elevation certificate must be prepared by
a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated qualification. The
elevation certificate must confirm the structure in question together with
attendant utilities are elevated in compliance with permit conditions.
         G.   A Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by the applicant
whenever the Floodplain Administrator determines that the area below the first
floor could be converted to a non-conforming use (generally applies to enclosed
areas below base flood elevation that are five (5) feet high or more). This
agreement shall state:
            i.   The area below Base Flood Elevation shall not be converted for
use other than for parking, building access or for allowable storage as
detailed in this Ordinance.
            ii.   The applicant agrees to notify prospective purchasers of the
existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of
the applicant to transfer the agreement at closing to the purchaser through
notarized signature, a copy of all new Non-Conversion Agreements shall be
provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non-

         All applicants shall meet or exceed the minimum flood proofing
requirements contained herein. Flood insurance rates can be lowered
significantly by increasing the level of flood proofing above the height
required by this Ordinance. In order to obtain an "elevation credited" flood
insurance rate on dry flood proofed buildings, flood proofing must extend at
least one foot above the Base Flood Elevation.
         A.   Plans showing details of all flood proofing measures, prepared by
a registered professional engineer, showing the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed.
         B.   A determination of elevations of the Base Flood, existing ground,
proposed finished ground, lowest floor, and flood proofing limits, certified by
a registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor.
         C.   A Flood Proofing Certificate, FEMA 81-65, as revised by FEMA,
shall be prepared by the registered professional engineer who prepared the
plans in (1) above, stating the structure in question, together with attendant
utility and sanitary facilities are designed so that:
            i.   The structure is water tight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water from the lowest structural element to two
feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            ii.   The structure will withstand the hydrostatic, hydrodynamic,
buoyant, impact, and other forces resulting from the flood depths, velocities,
pressures, and other factors associated with the Base Flood.
      (3)   For Appurtenant structures constructed of flood resistant materials
- used solely for parking of vehicles, or limited storage (Appurtenant
Structures only)
         A.   A site plan prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications showing elevation of existing ground,
proposed finished ground and lowest floor. The plan shall also show details of
proposed flood resistant materials usage and the size of the proposed structure
and its relation to the lot where it is to be constructed. The location of the
Floodway boundary shall be represented on the plan when a Floodway is present
on the site.
         B.   An Elevation Certificate, based on finished construction, must be
prepared by a licensed professional surveyor or others of demonstrated
qualifications. This certificate or report must confirm that the structure in
question, together with attendant utilities is designed so that:
            (i)   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) are used in the construction of the structure from the
lowest structural element to two feet above the Base Flood Elevation and that
all utilities are located at least two feet above the Base Flood Elevation.
            (ii)   Hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls are equalized by
allowing for automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this
requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
               a.   A minimum of two openings have a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided.
               b.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade.
               c.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and
exit of floodwaters.
         C.   In addition, the applicant shall sign a Non-Conversion Agreement
and notify prospective purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion
Agreement. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-
Conversion Agreement to any purchaser at closing through notarized signature. A
signed copy of the transferred Non-Conversion Agreement shall be provided to
the Floodplain Administrator. Failure to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement
and provide a signed copy to the Floodplain Administrator shall subject the
violator to the penalties set forth in Section
1713.08(d) of this Ordinance.
   (d)   Site Plan Criteria. Site plans are required for all development, new
construction and substantial improvements determined to be located in a special
flood hazard area and all proposed subdivisions and manufactured home parks.
These proposals shall be reviewed by the Floodplain Administrator to assure
that they are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
   The owner or developer shall submit a preliminary site plan to the
Floodplain Administrator that includes the following information:
      (1)   Name of registered professional engineer, licensed professional
surveyor or other qualified person responsible for providing the information
required in this section.
      (2)   A map showing the location of the proposed subdivision and/or
development with respect to Floodplain Areas, proposed lot sites, and fill
areas.
      (3)   Where the subdivision or manufactured home park lie partially or
completely in the special flood hazard areas, the plan map shall include
detailed information giving the location and elevation of proposed roads,
utilities and building sites. All such maps shall also show contours at
intervals of two (2) or five (5) feet depending upon the slope of the land and
identify accurately the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas. A
registered professional engineer or licensed professional surveyor must certify
the site plan.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new developments which
are proposed to take place either fully or partially within the Approximated
Floodplain Area (F4) and which are greater than ten (10) lots or two (2) acres,
whichever is the lesser, shall include Base Flood Elevation data and shall
delineate the Floodway.
         A.   When a Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is available from FEMA, the
data contained in that study must be used to substantiate the Base Flood
Elevation.
         B.   If a FEMA Flood Insurance Study is not available the required
data may be available from an authoritative source, such as the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, U.S. Geological Survey, Natural Resource Conservation Service or
State and Local Water Resource Department.
         C.   If the required data is not available from other sources the
applicant shall develop the technical data using detailed methodologies
comparable to those contained in a Flood Insurance Study. This data shall be
prepared and certified by a registered professional engineer, who shall certify
that the methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts
   Where the subdivision or other development site lies partially in the
special flood hazard area and all proposed development including fill will take
place on natural grade a significant vertical distance above the Approximated
Floodplain Area (Zone A) boundary depicted on the map, development of detailed
Base Flood Elevation data may not be necessary. In these cases the site plan
for the proposed development must show contours at intervals of two (2) or five
(5) feet depending on the slope, and clearly delineate the area to be developed
and the location of the special flood hazard boundary as scaled from the FEMA
map. A registered professional engineer, licensed professional surveyor or
others of demonstrated qualifications must certify the site plan
   
   (e)   Restrictions to Subdivision of Land in Special Flood Hazard Areas.
Subdivision of land in the special flood hazard area shall result in lots that
include a buildable portion outside of the special flood hazard area and be
served by streets within the proposed subdivision having surfaces at or above
the base flood elevation of the line defining the special flood hazard area
limits. All new structures shall be sited on the portion of the subdivided lot
that is located outside of the special flood hazard area. (Ord. 318. Passed 5-
16-23.)

the special flood hazard area.
         B.     Where appurtenant structures not connected to the principal
structure are to be located on sites below the Base Flood Elevation, the
following flood damage reduction provisions apply:
            i.   Use of the structure shall be restricted to parking or limited
storage.
               a.   Structures shall be no more than 300 square feet in size
and valued at less than seven thousand dollars ($7,000).
               b.   Floors shall be at or above grade on at least one (1) side.
               c.   Structures shall be located, oriented and constructed to
minimize flood damage.
               d.   Structures shall be designed (or modified) and adequately
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure
resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of
buoyancy.
               e.   Flood resistant materials as detailed in FEMA Technical
Bulletin 2-93 (FIA-TB-2) shall be used in the construction of the structure
from the lowest structural element to two (2) feet above the Base Flood
Elevation.
               f.   Machinery, electric devices or appliances, and all

                  (ii)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one
foot above grade.
                  (iii)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic
entry and exit of floodwaters.
            ii.   In addition, a Non-Conversion Agreement shall be signed by
the applicant stating that the use of the appurtenant structure or detached or
attached garage shall not be changed from the use permitted, acknowledging that
the structure may be subject to greater flood risk and that higher flood
insurance premiums may be possible, and that a change in use may require full
compliance with this Ordinance. The applicant agrees to notify prospective
purchasers of the existence of the Non-Conversion Agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of the applicant to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement at
closing to the purchaser through notarized signature. A copy of the Non-
Conversion Agreement shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. Failure
to transfer the Non-Conversion Agreement and provide a signed copy to the
Floodplain Administrator shall subject the violator to the penalties set forth
in Section
1713.08(d) of this Ordinance.
      (4)   Recreational Vehicle Placement. Recreational vehicles to be placed
within any special flood hazard area shall either:
         A.   Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and,
         B.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnected utilities, security devices,
and has no permanently attached additions. Or,
         C.   Be installed in accordance with the manufactured home placement
requirements and all other flood reduction requirements contained in this
Ordinance.
      (5)   Fill. The City of Lewisburg officially recognizes the beneficial
functions the Floodplain Area serves in storage and transportation of water
during floods. Placement of fill in the special flood hazard area is
discouraged and should be minimized.
         Placement of fill in other areas of the special flood hazard area
shall be restricted to functional purposes such as elevating a structure. Fill
shall only be permitted in the same permit with the related structure or other
functional purpose. Placement of fill to dispose of spoil from excavation or to
elevate yards, parking lots, or fields will not generally be considered a
functional purpose. The Floodplain Administrator may require the developer to
provide compensatory storage before permitting fill.
         No fill shall be permitted in the Floodway unless it has been
demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance
with currently accepted technical standards that the proposed fill will not
result in any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
         All fill placed in the special flood hazard area shall meet or exceed
the following standards:
         A.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the subject property and adjacent properties. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the applicant to demonstrate through engineering
reports that proposed fill would not adversely affect the subject property and
adjacent properties. When required, hydrologic and hydraulic analyses shall be
undertaken only by a professional engineer who shall certify that the technical
methods used correctly reflect currently accepted technical concepts. The
resulting study shall include a cover letter, signed and sealed by the
responsible professional, providing a statement of findings in basic terms. In
addition, studies, analyses, computations, etc., shall be submitted in
sufficient detail to allow a thorough technical review by the Floodplain
Administrator. During permit review the Floodplain Administrator shall consider
the following issues that have the potential to cause adverse impact to the
subject property and adjacent properties:
            i.   Unacceptable increases in flood heights.
            ii.   Blocking drainage from the subject property and adjacent
properties.
            iii.   Deflection of floodwaters onto adjacent existing structures.
            iv.   Increases to stream velocity initiating or exacerbating
erosion problems.
            v.   Other unique site conditions may be considered when
determining whether fill will cause adverse impact to the subject property and
adjacent properties including, but not limited to, subsidence areas, karst
topography, stream blockages, and steep topography adjacent to the channel.
         B.   Fill shall be used only to the extent to which it does not
adversely affect the capacity of channels or floodways of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch, or any other drainage facility or system.
         C.   A Fill Site must be contoured to drain properly (avoid ponding)
consistent with pre-construction conditions. This provision does not apply to
properly constructed impoundments which comply with the remainder of this
Ordinance and which are properly permitted by the West Virginia Department of
Environmental Protection.
         D.   Fill shall extend beyond a structure for a sufficient distance to
provide acceptable access. For residential structures, fill shall extend
laterally fifteen (15) feet beyond the building line from all points before the
start of sloping required in subsection (a)(5)E. below. For non-residential
structures, fill shall be placed to provide access acceptable for intended use.
         E.   At grade access, with fill extending laterally fifteen (15) feet
beyond the building line shall be provided to a minimum of twenty-five percent
(25%) of the perimeter of a non-residential structure.
         F.   Fill shall consist of soil or rock material only. Sanitary
landfills shall not be permitted; no trash or woody debris shall be buried on
site.
         G.   Fill material shall be compacted to provide the necessary
stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling. Fill compaction
standards must be appropriate to proposed post fill use, particular attention
is necessary when fill is being used to elevate a structure.
         H.   Fill slopes shall be no steeper than one (1) vertical on two (2)
horizontal, unless substantiating data justifying steeper slopes are submitted
to and approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
         I.   Fill site and fill must be protected from erosion.
            i.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of five feet per second or less will be
protected from erosion by covering them with grass, vines, weeds, or similar
vegetative undergrowth.
            ii.   Fill slopes exposed to flood waters with expected velocities
during the occurrence of the base flood of greater than five feet per second
will be protected from erosion by armoring them with stone or rock slope
protection.
         J.   All applicants placing fill in a special flood hazard area shall
obtain a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR-F) from FEMA when directed
to do so by the Floodplain Administrator before a permit can be issued. After
fill is finished the applicant shall convert the CLOMR-F to a Letter of Map
Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F) before a Certificate of Compliance/Occupancy
can be issued. The Floodplain Administrator is hereby appointed as the
designated official to approve a request for a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), and shall
cooperate with the applicant with respect to any requirements of FEMA for
requesting a (CLOMR-F) or (LOMR-F), which includes, but is not necessarily
limited to, approving said request and executing Form 1, "Overview &
Concurrence Form" or other form as may be required by FEMA.
         K.   The applicant shall submit any maps, computations or other
material required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), when
notified by the Floodplain Administrator, and shall pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose.
      (6)   Placement of Structures and other development. All structures and
other development shall be constructed and placed on the property so as to
offer the minimum obstruction to the flow of water and shall be designed to
have a minimum obstruction effect upon the flow and height of floodwater.
         A.   Whenever possible, structures and other development shall be
constructed with the longitudinal axis parallel to the direction of flood flow
and,
         B.   In so far as practicable, structures and other development shall
be placed approximately on the same flood-flow lines as those of adjoining
structures or development.
      (7)   Anchoring.
         A.   All structures and other development including stream crossings
shall be firmly anchored in accordance with accepted engineering practices to
prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, thus reducing the threat to
life and property and decreasing the possibility of the blockage of bridge
openings and other restricted sections of the watercourse
         B.   All air ducts, large pipes, swimming pools, above ground gas and
storage tanks located at or below the Base Flood Elevation shall be firmly
anchored to resist flotation or lateral movement.
      (8)   Flood Protection Setback.
         A.   A Flood Protection Setback equal to twice the width of the
watercourse channel measuring from the top of one bank to the top of the
opposite bank of 50 feet, whichever is less, shall be maintained from the top
of the banks of all watercourses. Specifically, as for oil and gas wells and
well pads, no well pad may be prepared or well drilled within 100 feet from any
perennial stream, natural or artificial lake, pond, reservoir or wetland. [See
W.Va. Code §22-6A-12(b)]. To reduce erosion, natural vegetation shall be
maintained in this area. Where natural vegetation does not exist along the
watercourse and conditions for replanting are suitable, high priority shall be
given to planting vegetation in the setback area to stabilize banks and enhance
aquatic resources.
         B.   Necessary public works and temporary construction may be exempted
from this subsection at the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator.
         C.   At the discretion of the Floodplain Administrator the Flood
Protection Setback requirement can be waived in whole or part if the applicant
demonstrates that it is impossible to allow any development without
encroachment into the Flood Protection Setback Area. The conditions shall be
the minimum necessary and shall be made only after due consideration is given
to varying other siting standards, such as side, front and back lot line
setbacks.
      (9)   Storage.
         A.   No materials that are buoyant, flammable, explosive, or in times
of flooding could be injurious to human, animal or plant life, shall be stored
below Base Flood Elevation except for mineral storage properly and wholly
within the ground in compliance with other State environmental agency(ies)
requirements.
         B.   Storage of other material or equipment may be allowed if not
subject to substantial damage by floods and firmly anchored to prevent
flotation or readily removable from the area within the time available after
flood warning.
         C.   Due to the potential of masking the natural elevation and making
it more difficult to enforce this Ordinance, material that resembles "fill"
material shall not be considered "storage" material for purposes of this
subsection.
      (10)   Utility and Facility Requirements.
         A.   All new or replacement water systems whether public or private,
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems.
         B.   All new or replacement sanitary disposal systems, whether public
or private, shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
         C.   All other new or replacement public or private utilities and
facilities shall be located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood
damage.
         D.   Onsite waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to the system or contamination from the system during flooding.
      (11)   Drainage. Adequate drainage shall be provided to reduce exposure
to flood hazard areas as well as around structures on slopes within zones AH
and AO to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures
      (12)   Backflow Preventers. Back flow prevention valves should be used
for all enclosed structures with sewage or drainage facilities located in the
special flood hazard area Floodplain Area.

or other Ordinances.
   (i)   Certificate of Compliance.
      (1)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to occupy, or
to permit the occupancy, of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof
hereafter created, erected, installed, changed, converted or wholly or partly
altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a Certificate of Compliance
has been issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the building or
land conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance. Occupying or using a
building or premises in violation of this section shall subject the violator to
the penalties described in Section
1713.08(d) of this Ordinance.
      (2)   In the special flood hazard area it shall be unlawful to inspect
and approve a permanent utility connection to any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, installed or rebuilt until
the utility inspector is in possession of a copy of the Certificate of
Compliance issued by the Floodplain Administrator stating that the particular
development being inspected conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance.

development conforms to the requirements of this Ordinance. Installation of
utilities in violation of this section shall subject the violator to the
penalties described in Section
1713.08(d) of this Ordinance.
      (4)   A Certificate of Compliance shall be issued by the Floodplain
Administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in the special
flood hazard.

or encroachment analyses which may have been required as a condition of the
Floodplain Permit approval process.
   (j)   Fees.
      (1)   Floodplain Determination fee shall be assessed on all proposed
development. This shall be a flat fee approved by the City of Lewisburg.
      (2)   Proposed development determined to be occurring in a special flood
hazard area regulated by this ordinance shall be assessed an additional fee,
payable to the City of Lewisburg based upon a set schedule approved by the City
of Lewisburg using the estimated value of the proposed construction as
determined by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the
City of Lewisburg for any additional costs for services necessary for review
and/or inspection of proposed development. Services include, but are not
limited to, professional engineering and surveying. The Floodplain
Administrator may require a deposit towards these additional costs. Additional
costs may include reimbursement for contracted services.
         Due to the increased cost of processing, when any work for which a
permit is required by this ordinance is started or proceeded with prior to
obtaining a permit the fees above specified shall be doubled. The additional
fee is intended to partially reimburse the City of Lewisburg for the additional
cost of processing permits for work already underway. To more fully recover
this cost the fees above shall be tripled for every subsequent occurrence by
the same person. Payment of the increased fee shall not relieve any person from
complying fully with the requirements of this ordinance in the execution of the
work or from other penalties prescribed herein.

of Lewisburg sitting as the Floodplain Appeals Board. Such appeal must be filed
with the Appeals Board or Floodplain Manager in writing, within thirty (30)
days after notification of the decision of the Floodplain Administrator as
announced at a regularly scheduled City Council meeting. Said Appeal shall be
served by the aggrieved person by regular mail on all interested parties on the
date that said Appeal is filed. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Floodplain
Appeals Board shall set a time, date and place not less than ten (10) nor more
than sixty (60) calendar days for the purpose of hearing the appeal. Notice of
the time, date and place of the hearing shall be given to all interested
parties by placing an announcement of said hearing date, time and place on the

and be heard. The determination by the Floodplain Appeals Board shall be final
in all cases, subject to any Appeal to the Circuit or Magistrate Court of
Greenbrier County, West Virginia or any other Court of competent jurisdiction.
   In the event an Appeal is filed wherein a Floodplain Permit grant has been
ruled by the Floodplain Administrator, the Floodplain Administrator shall
immediately issue a Stop Work Order Notice that shall remain in effect until a
resolution of said appeal.
   (b)   Appeal Review Criteria. All appeals contesting only the permit fee,
the cumulative substantial damage requirement, the flood protection setback
requirement, or the freeboard requirements, may be handled at the discretion of
the Floodplain Appeals Board.
   (c)   Variances. If compliance with any of the requirements of this
Ordinance would result in an exceptional hardship to a prospective builder,
developer or landowner, the City of Lewisburg may, upon request, grant relief
from the strict application of the requirements.
     Considerations for the issuance of Variances to this Ordinance shall
adhere to the following criteria:
      (1)   A decision granting or denying the variance request shall only be
issued by the Floodplain Appeals Board upon (i) a showing of good and
sufficient cause, (ii) a determination that failure to grant the permit would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant, and (iii) a determination that
granting the permit will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws,
regulations or ordinances.
      (2)   An affirmative decision granting a variance shall be issued only
upon determination that it is the minimum necessary, considering the Special
Flood Hazard Area, to afford relief. Financial hardship, used as sole criteria,
shall not be considered sufficient justification to grant a variance.
      (3)   An affirmative decision granting a Floodplain variance shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
      (4)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall notify the applicant in writing
and signed by a majority of the Floodplain Appeals Board that (i) the issuance
of a decision to allow construction of a structure below the Base Flood
Elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and (ii)
such construction below the Base Flood Elevation increases risk to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all decisions
as required in this Ordinance; and
      (5)   The Floodplain Appeals Board shall (i) maintain a record of all
decisions including justification for the decisions, and (ii) report such
decisions issued in its biannual report to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
      (6)   An affirmative decision shall not be granted for issuance of a
Floodplain variance for any construction, development use or activity within
any Floodway Area that would cause any increase in the Base Flood Elevation.
   (d)   Penalties. Any person, who fails to comply with any or all of the
requirements or provisions of this Ordinance or direction or Order of the
Floodplain Administrator, or any other authorized employee of, shall be
unlawful and shall be referred to the Prosecuting Attorney who shall
expeditiously prosecute all such violators. A violator shall, upon conviction,
pay a fine to the City of Lewisburg of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) or
more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) plus cost of prosecution. Each day
during which any violation of this Ordinance continues shall constitute a
separate offense. In addition to the above penalties, all other actions are
hereby reserved including an action in equity for the proper enforcement of
this Ordinance. The imposition of a fine or penalty for any violation of, or
non-compliance with, this Ordinance shall not excuse the violation or non-
compliance with the Ordinance or permit it to continue; and all such persons
shall be required to correct or remedy such violations or non-compliance within
a reasonable time. Any structure constructed, reconstructed, enlarged, altered
or relocated in non-compliance with this Ordinance may be declared by the City
of Lewisburg to be a public nuisance and abated as such subject to other
applicable laws and exhaustion of appellate rights.
