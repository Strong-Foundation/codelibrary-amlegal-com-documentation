510.   Supplemental Appropriations
   On the recommendation of the Executive, the Council may make supplemental
appropriations from any contingency appropriations in the Budget; from revenues
received from anticipated sources but in excess of budget estimates; or from

(Res. 24-23, 7-2-2024)
511.   Emergency Appropriations
   To meet an Emergency, as that term is defined in this Charter, the Council
may make emergency appropriations from the sources provided in Section
510 of this Charter. To the extent unappropriated revenues are unavailable to
meet the Emergency, the Council by law may authorize the issuance of emergency
notes, which may be renewed from time to time. Emergency notes and renewals
issued pursuant to this section may not be paid later than the last day of the
next fiscal year succeeding that in which the emergency appropriation was made.
512.   Lapsed Appropriations
   Unless otherwise provided by law and except for grant appropriations or
grant funds deposited in special accounts dedicated to specific functions,
activities or purposes, all unexpended and unencumbered appropriations in the
Operating Budget at the end of the fiscal year shall revert into the treasury.
No appropriation for a Capital Project in the Capital Budget may revert until
the purpose for which the appropriation was made is accomplished or abandoned;
but any Capital Project shall be considered abandoned if three fiscal years
elapse without any expenditure from or encumbrance of the appropriation.
513.   Amendment to Capital Budget after Adoption of the Budget
   Upon recommendation of the Executive and after a public hearing and an
affirmative vote of at least four council members, the Council may amend the
Annual Budget and Appropriations Ordinance to provide funds for a Capital
Project not previously appearing in the Capital Budget for the fiscal year. The
amendment may not increase the total amount of appropriations for the fiscal
year, unless such increased appropriations shall be funded from revenues
received in excess of those budgeted or from unanticipated revenues not
previously budgeted in the Annual Budget and Appropriations Ordinance for the
fiscal year.
514.   Composition and Limitation upon County Funds
   (a)   All revenues and receipts from special services or benefit charges;
special taxes or assessments imposed upon special taxing areas for special or
particular services, purposes or benefits; funds held by the County as trustee
or agent; special grants; or bond proceeds shall be paid into and appropriated
from special funds created for such purposes and may not be used for any other
purpose except the purpose for which a fund was created. All other revenues and
receipts of the County from taxes, grants, State revenues and other receipts
shall be paid into and appropriated from the general fund, which is the primary
fund for the financing of current expenses for the conduct of Government
business.
   (b)   With the recommendation of the Executive, the Council, by the Annual
Budget and Appropriation Ordinance, or by other legislative act, may provide
for the establishment of working capital or revolving funds for the financing
of central stores, equipment pools, or other services common to the agencies of
the Government.
   (c)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, upon recommendation
of the Executive, the Council may establish a reserve fund for permanent public
improvements. The Annual Budget and Appropriation Ordinance may dedicate cash
surpluses, taxes, and other sources of revenue not otherwise appropriated to
this reserve fund.
   (d)   Nothing in this Charter may be construed to prevent the making of
contracts, leases, or other obligations that provide for the payment of funds
at a time beyond the end of the fiscal year in which these contracts are made,
provided the nature of these transactions reasonably requires the making of
these contracts, leases or other obligations. The Council shall authorize by
law any contract, lease, or other obligation in excess of $20,000 that would
obligate the County to appropriate funds in the Operating Budget for more than
a single fiscal year. The amount of $20,000 for such contracts, leases or
obligations may be revised by law from time to time, but no more frequently
than annually, and may not be less than $20,000.

construction sought.
   (B)   Preparation.
      (1)   The Director of P&C will prepare written specifications detailing
the County's requirements for the materials, service or construction. The
Director of P&C may also request that an agency assist with the preparation of
specifications for the procurement.
      (2)   No person who, for compensation, prepares a specification on behalf
of the County shall submit a bid or proposal for that procurement or any
portion thereof, or disclose to any bidder or offeror information concerning
the procurement that is not available to the public. However, the Director of
P&C may permit such person to submit a bid or proposal for the procurement or
any portion thereof if the Director of P&C determines that the exclusion of the
person would limit the number of potential qualified bidders or offerors in a
manner contrary to the best interest of the County.
   (C)   Approval. Both the Agency Director and the Director of P&C will
approve the specification prior to public distribution. If the Agency Director
and the Director of P&C are unable to reach an agreement, the matter will be
referred to the Chief Administrative Officer for resolution.
   (D)   Brand name specification.
      (1)   A brand name specification may be used after the Director of P&C
has determined that sufficient sources for competition exist for the
procurement of the material and that the use of the brand name specification is
not intended to limit or restrict competition.
      (2)   A brand name specification may be used to describe the standard of
quality, performance, and other salient characteristics of a material in lieu
of a description of its physical or functional characteristics and, the
solicitation will state that the use of the brand name is for the purpose of
describing the standard desired and that the substitution of equivalent
materials is permitted.
      (3)   A brand name specification may be used as the sole brand acceptable
after the Director of P&C has determined that alternative products will result
in a higher overall cost to the County, will otherwise harm the County's
financial interests, or will impede the County's administrative functions or
delivery of services to the public.
      (4)   An agency requesting a brand name specification will provide
written evidence to support a brand name determination to the Director of P&C
for approval. Inconvenience of drafting specifications or developing
performance specifications will not be sufficient justification to the use of a
brand name specification.
   (E)   Specifications prepared by other than County personnel. The
requirements and intent of this section regarding nonrestrictive specifications
applies to specifications prepared by non County individuals and entities,
including, but not limited to, architects, engineers, designers, and
consultants for public contracts, or subcontractors. No individual or entity
that prepares specifications on behalf of the County may receive any direct or
indirect benefit from the utilization of those specifications.

         (e)   Evaluation will be conducted by the evaluation team following a
confidential review and evaluation of each proposal and utilizing the criteria
set forth in the solicitation and addenda, which may include oral interview
discussions with all of the highest qualified offerors, requests for
clarification or proposal revisions, reference checks, and request for best and
final offers, etc.
         (f)   The evaluation team will determine a short list of offerors,
after which price submissions of the short-listed entities will be opened and
evaluated. Award will be recommended by the Evaluation Team unanimously based
on the offer that provides the best value to the County. Any non-unanimous
evaluation team results will be determined by the Director of P&C.
         (g)   The Director of P&C is authorized to negotiate the final price
and scope of work with the recommended awardee to obtain the best value for the
County and may allow proposal revisions during negotiation.
         (h)   At the sole discretion of the Director of P&C, a
prequalification process may be conducted prior to the issuance of a request
for proposals to establish a list of prequalified offerors. In the event a
prequalification process is used, the evaluation team will only consider
proposals submitted from the pre-qualified offerors.
      (3)   Qualification based selection for architectural and engineering
services.
         (a)   At the sole discretion of the Director of P&C, a qualification

agencies for different applications, to be provided on an as-needed basis.
         (b)   Indefinite delivery quantity bids or proposals will be solicited
by the appropriate procurement method as determined by P&C. Solicitations will
include a list of potential materials and services sought, typical types of
projects, and the explanation that the list is a representative sample of
materials, services, and projects which may be contracted for. The list will

order may be executed, nor will it prohibit an agency from requesting that P&C
conduct a formal solicitation for similar services for a specific project.
         (c)   An award may be made to one or more bidders or offerors and a
master agreement executed. The master agreement establishes pricing and

master agreement and constitute a binding contract between the County and the
contractor. The agency may require competition among awarded bidders or
offerors when the scope of work is estimated to exceed $50,000 and the task
order will be issued to the bidder or offeror providing lowest pricing. If one
of several IDQ bidders or offerors possesses particular expertise in a field,
is familiar with a specific site or structure, or is better able to complete
the work in the required timeframe, a task order may be issued with or without
competition among awarded bidders or offerors, or to a bidder or offeror that
does not provide the lowest pricing.
         (e)   The total scope of a project to be performed pursuant to an IDQ
Agreement may not be split so that the cost of the task order is under $50,000.

requirements.

is authorized to negotiate an open market purchase order or contract with the
manufacturer at prices and on terms most advantageous to the County.
      (3)   When the County requires supplies, materials, or equipment which

      (4)   When the County requests an estimate for repair of equipment and
the cost to obtain the estimate is significant, the Director of P&C is
authorized to negotiate price, delivery, and terms for the repair to be
completed by the Contractor that provided the estimate, in lieu of expending
additional funds to obtain multiple estimates.
      (5)   The Director of P&C may accept bids which contain alternate or
additional makes, brands, or types. The bidder has the burden to prove to the
satisfaction of the County that the alternate or additional make, brand, or
type is equal in quality and performance to those listed in the solicitation.
      (6)   A contract may be awarded without competition when, after
conducting a good faith review of available sources or in the event competition
was insufficient or no bids, proposals, or submissions were received, or the
goods are used/refurbished, the Director of P&C determines in writing that
there is only one responsible source for the required material, service, or
construction item. If a sole source award is requested by an Agency, written
evidence to support a sole source award must accompany the request. The
Director of P&C may require that negotiations are conducted as to price,
delivery, and terms. The Director of P&C may require the submission of cost or
pricing data in connection with an award under this section.

services, or services may be awarded without competition if the Director of P&C
determines in writing that one (1) or more of the following conditions exists:

software purchases wherein competitive sealed bidding is not practicable or
advantageous to the County.
      (8)   A construction change order which authorizes a new scope of work
under a construction contract may be executed without competition when:
         (a)   The new scope of work is required for the completion of the
improvement under construction pursuant to a competitive bidding or competitive
proposal process;
         (b)   The new scope of work results from the discovery of differing or
unforeseen physical conditions at the site of the improvement under
construction and is required for the completion of the improvement under
construction; and

that it would be in the County's best interest to negotiate with the on-site

Director will immediately notify the Director of P&C, who will either purchase
the required commodity or service or authorize the Agency Director to do so.
      (5)   If an emergency occurs at times other than regular business hours,
the Agency Director may purchase the commodity or service required. The Agency
Director will, whenever possible, secure competitive telephone bids and
purchase from the lowest responsible bidder.
      (6)   The Agency Director must submit to the Director of P&C a complete
explanation of the circumstances of the emergency.
         (a)   If the emergency required expenditure(s) of less than $50,000,
the explanation may be provided via email from the Agency Director to the
Director of P&C.
         (b)   If the emergency required expenditure(s) of $50,000 or more, the

address number shall be displayed on the building or structure and at the end
of each driveway nearest the street or ingress/egress easement providing access

building location, and the like) adversely affect the legibility of numbers,
the Division of Fire and Rescue Services has the authority to prescribe larger
numbers.
         (17)   It shall be the responsibility of each and every property

to dial any other number or set of numbers.
   (J)   Civil fire code infractions.
      (1)   Pursuant to §
2-2-29 of this code, any violation of the provisions of this section is a civil
infraction and shall be called a civil fire code infraction. If after

Each day such violation is permitted to exist shall be considered a separate
infraction.
      (4)   A person who receives a citation may elect to stand trial for the
offense by filing with the Fire Marshal a notice of intention to stand trial.
The notice shall be given at least 5 days before the date of payment of the
fine as set forth in the citation. On receipt of the notice of intention to
stand trial, the Fire Marshal shall forward to the District Court for Frederick
County, Maryland, a copy of the citation and the notice of intention to stand

within 15 days from the date of the notice, the person is liable for a fine
double that as provided above for each infraction. If after 35 days, the
citation is not satisfied, the Fire Marshal may request adjudication of the
case through the District Court. The District Court shall schedule the case for
trial and summon the defendant to appear.
      (6)   Adjudication of an infraction under this section is not a criminal
conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed
by a criminal conviction.
      (7)   In a proceeding before the District Court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Ann. Code, Local Government Article, Title 6. However, the
County Attorney is hereby authorized to prosecute fire code infractions under
this section.
      (8)   If a person is found by the District Court to have committed a
civil fire code infraction, he or she shall be liable for the costs of the
proceedings in the District Court.
      (9)   Depending on the circumstances of each case and after consultation
with the county attorney, the fire marshal has the discretionary authority to
reduce or suspend all or a portion of the fine.
      (10)   Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or prevent the
fire marshal or authorized agent, or anyone else, from seeking other legal
remedies, such as injunctions or criminal prosecution.
      (11)   The fines specified in this section can be modified at any time by
resolution of the county governing body, after a duly advertised public
hearing.

§ 1-2-700. DEFINITIONS.
   The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall

   EQUITY. An intentional and systemic approach to remedy and address
historical practices, policies, and structures that have produced distinct
disparate outcomes which have resulted in the oppression, marginalization,
hindrance to the success of, and restricted access to opportunities and
benefits for historically underrepresented and oppressed populations. The goal
of equity is achievement of equitable outcomes for all.
   INCLUSION. More than simply diversity and numerical representation.
Inclusion exists when historically oppressed and marginalized groups are
empowered to participate in all elements of society in a manner that is
culturally relevant to them, and when their full engagement is both welcomed
and exercised to the degree that it redefines and helps to shape communities
and culture. True inclusion requires changing or eliminating various historical
practices that limit, hinder, and fail to provide opportunities for members of
historically oppressed and marginalized groups to contribute, lead, and
influence decisions and outcomes.

DIVISION 4. CIVIL ANIMAL INFRACTIONS
§ 1-5-53. GENERALLY.
   (A)   Pursuant to Chapter 634 of the Laws of Maryland 1984, being §
2-2-29 of the Frederick County Code, any violation of any of the provisions of
this entire chapter, which is
Chapter 1-5 entitled “Animals and Fowl” is a civil infraction and shall be
called a civil animal infraction. If, after investigation, a civil animal
infraction is believed to exist, the Frederick County Director of Animal
Control or his authorized agent shall deliver a citation or warning to the
animal owner and others responsible for the infraction. If the Director or his
authorized agent is unable to locate the owner personally, the Director or
authorized agent may post the citation or warning in a conspicuous place on the
property of the owner and mail a copy of same to the person, which shall be
sufficient for delivery under this section.
   (B)   The citation or warning, as provided for in this section, shall be in
writing and shall contain the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the person charged or warned;
      (2)   The nature of the violation;
      (3)   The location of the violation;
      (4)   The date(s) of the violation;
      (5)   The amount or potential amount of the fine assessed;

      (8)   A certification by the Director or authorized agent attesting to
the truth of the matters set forth.
   (C)   Whenever an alleged or possible civil animal infraction comes to the
attention of the Animal Control Director, the following procedures shall apply:
      (1)   The Director of Animal Control will investigate whether an
infraction has occurred;
      (2)   If the Director finds that an infraction has occurred, he will
issue a warning to the person(s) responsible in the form and manner as outlined
in this section, with a reasonable time stated to abate or to prevent future
infractions;
      (3)   If the infraction continues or is allowed to occur after the
reasonable time stated, the Director will issue a citation to the person(s)
responsible in the form and manner as outlined in this section. Notwithstanding
the provision of step (2) above, the Director may issue a citation at step (2)
without the prior issuance of a warning.
   (D)   A fine of $50 is hereby imposed upon any person responsible for a
civil animal infraction for the first violation. A fine of $75 will be imposed
for the second violation and a fine of $100 will be imposed for the third
violation or any subsequent violation. Each day such violation is permitted to
exist shall be considered a separate infraction. All fines shall be payable to
the Treasurer of Frederick County, Maryland, in the office of the Animal
Control Center.
   (E)   A person who receives a citation may elect to stand trial for the
offense by filing with the Director of Animal Control a notice of intention to
stand trial. The notice shall be given at least 10 days before the date of
payment of the fines as set forth in the citation. Upon receipt of the notice
of intention to stand trial, the Director shall forward to the district court
of Frederick County, Maryland, a copy of the citation and the notice of
intention to stand trial. Upon receipt of the citation, the district court
shall schedule the case for trial and notify the defendant of the trial date.
All fines, penalties, or forfeitures collected by the district court for any
civil animal infractions shall be remitted to the Treasurer of Frederick
County, Maryland.
   (F)   If a person who receives a citation for an infraction fails to pay the
fine by the date of payment set forth on the citation and fails to file a
notice of intention to stand trial, a formal notice of the infraction shall be
sent to the person’s last known address. If the citation is not satisfied
within 15 days from the date of the notice, the person shall be liable for
double the amount of the initial fine levied for each infraction. If after 35
days the citation is not satisfied, the Director may request adjudication of
the case through the district court by the filing of civil judgment procedures.
   (G)   Adjudication of an infraction under this subsection is not a criminal
conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed
by a criminal conviction.
   (H)   In a proceeding before the district court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Code Ann., Local Government Article, Title 6. However, the
County Attorney is hereby authorized to prosecute all civil animal infractions
under this section.
   (I)   If a person is found by the district court to have committed a civil
animal infraction, that person shall be liable for costs of the proceedings in
the district court.
   (J)   Depending on the circumstances of each case and after consultation
with the County Attorney, the Director has the discretionary authority to
reduce or suspend all or a portion of the fine payable through the animal
control office.
   (K)   Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or prevent the
Director of Animal Control, or any one else, from seeking other legal remedies,
such as injunctions or criminal prosecution.
   (L)   Provisions of this section are in addition to, not in lieu of, those
penalties specified in other sections of this chapter, specifically §§
1-5-9 and
1-5-22.
   (M)   The fines specified in this section can be modified at any time by
resolution of the county governing body, after a duly advertised public
hearing.

civil building infraction. If, after investigation, a civil building infraction
is believed to exist, the Frederick County Planning and Permitting Division
Director ("Director") or authorized agent shall deliver a citation or warning
to the property owner and any others responsible for the infraction. If the
Director or authorized agent is unable to locate the owner or other responsible

responsible person, which shall be sufficient for delivery of the warning or
citation under this section.
   (B)   The citation or warning, as provided for in this section, shall be in
writing and shall contain the following:

shall apply:

violation has occurred;
      (2)   If the Director or administrative authority finds that a violation
has occurred, a warning will be issued to the person(s) responsible in the form
and manner as outlined in this section, with reasonable time stated to abate or
to prevent future infractions;
      (3)   If the infraction continues or is allowed to occur after the
reasonable time stated, the Director or administrative authority will issue a

administrative authority may issue a citation at step (2) without the prior
issuance of a warning.
   (D)   A fine of $200 shall be imposed upon any person responsible for each
civil building infraction. Each day such violation exists shall be considered a
separate civil building infraction. All fines shall be payable to the Treasurer

offense by filing with the Director or administrative authority a notice of
intention to stand trial. The notice shall be delivered to the Director or

the fines as set forth in the citation. Upon receipt of the notice of intention
to stand trial, the Director or administrative authority shall forward to the
District Court of Frederick County, Maryland, a copy of the citation and the
notice of intention to stand trial. Upon receipt of the citation, the district
court shall schedule the case for trial and notify the defendant of the trial
date. All fines, penalties, or forfeitures collected by the district court for
any civil building infractions shall be remitted to the Treasurer of Frederick
County, Maryland.

fails to pay the fine by the date of payment set forth on the citation and
fails to file a notice of intention to stand trial at least 10 days prior to
the payment date, a formal notice of the civil building infraction shall be
sent to the person's last known address. If the citation is not satisfied
within 15 days from the date specified on the notice, the person shall be
liable for a fine of $400 for each infraction. If the citation is not satisfied
within 35 days of the date specified on the formal notice, the Director or
administrative authority may request adjudication of the case through the
district court by following appropriate civil procedures.
   (G)   Adjudication of a civil building infraction under this subsection is
not a criminal conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities
ordinarily imposed by a criminal conviction.
   (H)   In a proceeding before the district court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Code Ann. Local Government Article Title 6. However, the
County Attorney is hereby authorized to prosecute all civil building
infractions under this section.
   (I)   If a person is found by the district court to have committed a civil
building infraction, that person shall be liable for the costs of the
proceedings in the district court.

with the County Attorney, the Director or administrative authority has the
discretionary authority to reduce or suspend all or a portion of the fine(s)
payable through the Permits and Inspections office.
   (K)   Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or prevent the
Director or administrative authority from seeking other legal remedies, such as
injunctions or criminal prosecution.
   (L)   Provisions of this section are in addition to, not in lieu of, those
penalties specified in other sections of this chapter, specifically §
1-6-21.

§ 1-6-61. FINDINGS AND POLICY.
   (A)   In recognition that agriculture is the largest industry in Frederick
County and that it adds many positive benefits to the quality of life, it is
the declared policy of the county to preserve, protect and encourage the
development and improvement of its agricultural land for the production of food
and other agricultural products. When nonagricultural land uses extend into
agricultural areas, agricultural operations can become the subject of lawsuits.
As a result, agricultural operators are sometimes forced to cease or curtail
their operations. Others are discouraged from making investments in
agricultural improvements to the detriment of the economic viability of the
county’s agricultural industry as a whole. It is the purpose of this article to
reduce the loss to the county of its agricultural resources by limiting the
circumstances under which agricultural operations may be deemed to constitute a
nuisance, trespass, or other interference with the reasonable use and enjoyment
of land, including, but not limited to smoke, odors, flies, dust, noise,
chemicals, or vibration; provided that nothing in this article shall in any way
restrict or impede the authority of the state and of the county to protect the
public health, safety and welfare, nor shall it restrict or impede private
covenants.
   (B)   It is in the public interest to promote a more clear understanding
between agricultural operations and nonagricultural neighbors concerning the
normal inconveniences of agricultural operations which follow generally
accepted agricultural practices and do not endanger public health or safety.
   (C)   This article is not intended to and shall not be construed as in any
way modifying or abridging local, state or federal laws, including, but not
limited to, laws relating to health, safety, trespass onto agricultural
property, zoning, licensing requirements, environmental standards (including
those standards which relate to air and water quality and pesticide use), and
the like.
   (D)   An additional purpose of this article is to promote a good neighbor
policy by advising purchasers and users of property adjacent to or near
agricultural operations of the inherent potential problems associated with such
purchase or use. These potential problems include, but are not limited to,
noises, odors, dust, flies, chemicals, smoke, vibration, and hours of operation
that may accompany agricultural operations. It is intended that, through
mandatory disclosures, purchasers and users will better understand the impact
of living near agricultural operations and be prepared to accept attendant
conditions as the natural result of living in or near rural areas. However,
this article shall be effective regardless of whether disclosure was made in
accordance with §
1-6-66 herein.
(Ord. 96-23-175, § 1, 11-12-1996; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)

Future Farmers of America), agro-tourism and alternative agricultural
enterprises; and the like.
   GENERALLY ACCEPTED AGRICULTURAL MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. Those methods used in
connection with agricultural operations which do not violate applicable
federal, state or local laws or public health, safety and welfare and which are

AND DECLARATION.
   (A)   Nuisances which affect public health.
      (1)   Complaints. A person may complain to the Frederick County Health
Department to declare that a nuisance which affects public health exists.
      (2)   Investigations. The health officer may investigate all complaints
of nuisance received against an agricultural operation. When a previous
complaint involving the same condition resulted in a determination by the
health officer that a nuisance condition did not exist, the health officer may
investigate the complaint but the health officer may also determine not to
investigate such a complaint. The Frederick County Health Department may
initiate any investigation without citizen complaint.
      (3)   Declaration of nuisance. If the health officer determines that a
nuisance exists, the Health Department may declare the existence of a nuisance.
In determining whether a nuisance condition exists in connection with an
agricultural operation, the health officer shall apply the criteria provided in
this article. Further, the health officer may consider the professional opinion
of the Frederick County Cooperative Extension Service of the University of
Maryland, or other qualified experts in the relevant field in determining
whether the agricultural operation being investigated is conducted in
accordance with generally accepted agricultural management practices.
   (B)   Resolution of disputes regarding agricultural operations.
      (1)   Should any controversy arise regarding an interference with the use
or enjoyment of property from agricultural operations conducted on agricultural
land, the parties to that controversy shall submit the controversy to the
Agricultural Reconciliation Committee, in writing, through the Frederick County
Planning Department.
      (2)   The FCARC will conduct its proceedings in an informal manner and
the rules of evidence shall not apply. The FCARC has the power, but is not
required hereunder, to hold hearings and to compel testimony under oath and the
production of documents. In each case before it, the FCARC shall issue orders
settling or otherwise resolving controversies arising out of agricultural
operations, including, but not limited to, the invasion of property and
personal rights by agricultural operations conducted on agricultural land.
      (3)   Four FCARC members shall constitute a quorum for purposes of
holding a hearing.
      (4)   If a hearing ends in a tie vote, no action shall be taken on the
complaint that formed the basis of the hearing.
      (5)   Orders of the FCARC shall be binding on the parties as a matter of
law, but their enforcement shall be suspended by operation of law if, within 30
days of the date of the Committee’s judgment, a party appeals such order to the
Circuit Court for Frederick County. Appeals from orders of the Committee shall
be by a trial de novo.
      (6)   If the FCARC or a court finds that the conduct of a party in
bringing or maintaining an action in connection with an agricultural operation
conducted on agricultural land was in bad faith or without substantial
justification, the FCARC or court may require that party to pay to the owner of
the agricultural operation (or any other party opponent) the costs of the
proceeding and the reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees,
incurred by that party in defending against the action.

property by any means, the transferor shall provide the purchaser or lessee a
statement specifically advising the purchaser or lessee of the existence of
this right to farm ordinance, which shall be in substantially the form set
forth in Appendix A.
   (B)   Right to farm notice. In addition, because of the county’s desire to
maintain a good neighbor policy and the county’s desire to provide this
information to county real property owners, the Frederick County Treasurer
shall mail a copy of the “Right to Farm Notice” to all owners of real property
in Frederick County with the annual tax bill, beginning in fiscal year 1997-98,
in substantially the form set forth in Appendix B.
   (C)   Penalty for violation. Any person who violates any provision of this
section is guilty of an infraction punishable by a civil penalty not exceeding
$100. Failure to comply with any provision of the right to farm notice and real
estate transfer disclosure section shall not prevent the recording of any
document, or the title to real property or any mortgage or deed of trust made
in good faith or for value, and it shall not affect the application of this
article.
(Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)
Editor’s note:

(Ord. 02-25-321, 11-21-2002; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014; Bill No. 22-27, 10-18-
2022)
§ 1-6A-5. REQUIREMENT TO BUILD MPDU’S; AGREEMENTS; ALTERNATIVES.
   (A)   Except as provided in §
1-6A-5.1 below, any applicant, in order to record a final plat of subdivision
or obtain a building permit, must submit to the Division of Planning and
Permitting, with the application for a permit, a written MPDU agreement
approved by the Director and the County Attorney. Each agreement must require
that:
      (1)   A specific number of MPDUs, not less than 12.5% of the total number
of dwelling units in the development, must be constructed on an approved time
schedule;
      (2)   In all developments MPDUs constructed must be equivalent in bedroom
count to all market rate units constructed. For example, if the market rate
units consist of 30% 3-bedroom units, 20% one-bedroom units, and 50% 2-bedroom
units, then the constructed MPDUs must also include the same percentages of
units with the same bedroom counts, to the extent practicable, as determined by
the Director.
   (B)   (1)   A one-to-one density bonus is provided when the development at
one location includes construction of at least 12.5% of the total number of
dwelling units in the development; and
         (a)   Is covered by a plan of subdivision; or
         (b)   Is covered by a plan of development or a site plan.
      (2)   A two-to-one density bonus may be approved by the Planning
Commission for MPDUs constructed in specified growth areas as identified in the
Livable Frederick Master Plan.
   (C)   Density bonuses are permitted as part of the MPDU program in the
following districts: Residential (MXD), R1, R3, R5, R8, R12, R16, PUD, Village
Center (VC), and MX. Density bonuses shall not be allowed if an applicant
elects to pay a "per square foot payment in lieu" as outlined in §
1-6A-5.1.
   (D)   In planned development zones and mixed use zones containing flexible
development standards, the number of MPDUs must not be less than either the
number of density bonus units or 12.5% of the total number of dwelling units,
whichever is greater.
   (E)   (1)   In exceptional cases, instead of building the required number of
MPDUs, an applicant may offer to:
         (a)   Build at least 10% more MPDUs at 1 or more other sites in the
same or an adjoining area in the county;
         (b)   Contribute to the Housing Initiative Fund an amount that will
produce at least 10% more MPDUs; or
         (c)   Do any combination of these alternatives that will result in
building at least 10% more MPDUs than required hereunder.
      (2)   If the Director finds that:
         (a)   In the project or subdivision originally proposed by the
applicant, an indivisible package of resident services and facilities to be
provided to all households would cost the occupants of the MPDUs so much that
it is likely to make the MPDUs effectively unaffordable by eligible households;
and
         (b)   An offer made by an applicant under subsection (E)(1) will
achieve at least 10% more MPDUs or units which moderate- income households can
more easily afford; and
         (c)   These public benefits outweigh the benefit of constructing MPDUs
in each subdivision throughout the county and acceptance of the applicant’s
offer will achieve the objective of providing a broad range of housing
opportunities throughout the county; the Director may accept the offer made by
the applicant instead of requiring the construction of MPDUs by the applicant.
If the applicant can feasibly build at least 10% more MPDUs at another site in
the county, the Director must not approve any other alternative under
subsection (E)(1).
      (3)   The procedures for considering and implementing alternative offers
must be established by regulation. To implement an offer, the applicant must
sign an agreement with the Director not later than the time provided in the
regulation.
   (F)   The MPDU agreements must be signed by the applicant, any other parties
having an interest in the property and all other parties whose signatures are
required by law for the effective and binding execution of contracts conveying
real property. The agreements must be executed in a manner that will enable
them to be recorded in the land records of the county. If the applicant is a
corporation, the agreements must be signed by a duly authorized officer on
behalf of the corporation. Partnerships, associations or corporations must not
evade this chapter through voluntary dissolution. The agreements may be
assigned if the county approves and if the assignees agree to fulfill the
requirements of this chapter.
   (G)   An MPDU agreement must be drafted prior to Planning Commission
approval of preliminary plans and site plans. The preliminary plan and site
plan must document the number, type, location, and staging of construction, or
otherwise document how the requirements of this chapter will be met. The DPP
must not record final subdivision plats and must not issue a building permit in
any subdivision or housing development in which MPDUs are required until the
applicant submits an executed MPDU agreement which applies to the entire
development. The MPDU agreement must include the number, type, location, and
plan for staging construction of all dwelling units and such other information
as the Department requires to determine the applicant’s compliance with this
chapter. The MPDU staging plan must be consistent with any applicable land use
plan, subdivision plan, or site plan. The staging plan included in the MPDU
agreement for all dwelling units must be sequenced so that:
      (1)   MPDUs are built along with other dwelling units;
      (2)   The pace of MPDU production must reasonably coincide with the
construction of market rate units;
      (3)   The constructed MPDUs must be equivalent in bedroom count to all
market rate units constructed or to be constructed; and
      (4)   The last building built must not contain only MPDUs. This
subsection applies to all developments, including any development covered by
multiple preliminary plans of subdivision.
   (I)   If an applicant does not build the MPDUs contained in the staging plan
along with or before other dwelling units, the Director of the Department of
Permits and Inspections must withhold any later building permit to that
applicant until the MPDUs contained in the staging plan are built.
   (J)   Recording of covenants. The applicant must execute and record
covenants assuring that:
      (1)   The restrictions of this chapter run with the land for the entire
period of control; and
      (2)   The covenants will bind the applicant, any assignee, mortgagee, or
buyer, and all other parties that receive title to the property. These
covenants must be senior to all instruments securing permanent financing except
when MPDUs are built under §
1-6A-5.2; and
   (K)   Later deeds. The grantor must state, in any deed or instrument
conveying title to an MPDU, that the conveyed property is an MPDU and is
subject to the restrictions contained in the covenants required under this
chapter during the control period until the restrictions are released.
   (L)   Letter of credit. The applicant must submit a letter of credit at the
time of permit application for 125% of the average value of 1 MPDU unit. Once
all MPDUs are completed the letter of credit will be released. Failure to
complete the MPDUs according to the staging plan will cause the letter of
credit to be forfeited and the funds will be deposited in the Housing
Initiative Fund.
   (M)   Subordinate lien. A lien must be placed on each individual MPDU
property at settlement secured by a second position deferred principal mortgage
in favor of the county. The dollar amount of the lien and mortgage will be 80%
of the difference between the market rate value of the MPDU and the MPDU sale
price (including settlement costs) at the time of initial purchase. (Example:
Market rate value $150,000 minus MPDU price including settlement costs
$100,000=$50,000 x 80% = $40,000).

§ 1-6A-5.1. PAYMENT IN LIEU OF BUILDING MPDU'S; AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   In lieu of the option specified under §
1-6A-5, an applicant may elect to pay a "per dwelling unit payment in lieu"
calculated as described below and included in a written MPDU agreement.
   (B)   Each MPDU agreement entered into pursuant to a payment in lieu
election must include the following:
      (1)   The per square foot payment in lieu for each dwelling unit in the
development, which shall be determined as described in subsection (C) below;
and
      (2)   The agreement shall specify that the per square foot payment in
lieu will be paid at the time of building permit application, based on the
then-current per square foot payment in lien.
   (C)   Determination of per square foot payment in lieu: The per square foot
payment in lieu for each dwelling unit in the development, which shall be
determined as follows:
      (1)   Multiply the "Affordability Gap" determined in subsection (D) below
by 12.5%, which results in the base fee per unit.
      (2)   The base fee per unit is then divided by the average square footage
of new dwelling units sold in the county in the preceding three (3) calendar
years.
      (3)   This results in the per square foot payment in lieu to be applied
to all dwelling unit types in the development. The per square foot payment in
lieu is $2.00 per square foot as of October 18, 2022. See subsection (I) below
- Triennial adjustment.
   (D)   The Affordability Gap is determined based on the following factors:
(1) the Frederick County Median Home Price for attached homes (townhouses,
multifamily) for the preceding calendar year; (2) the purchasing capacity of
the moderate income buyer earning 70% of Frederick County Median Income (FCMI),
based on prevailing FHA mortgage loan financing including down-payment
requirements; for the preceding three (3) calendar years; and (3) maintaining a
monthly housing cost burden at or below 30% of net monthly income for a
household earning 70% of AMI. The Affordability Gap will be adjusted on a
triennial basis. See subsection (I) below.
   (E)   The MPDU agreement must be signed by the applicant, any other parties
having an interest in the property and all other parties whose signatures are
required by law for the effective and binding execution of deeds conveying real
property. The MPDU agreement must be executed in a manner that will enable the
agreement to be recorded in the land records of the county. Partnerships,
associations or corporations shall not evade this chapter through voluntary
dissolution. The MPDU agreement shall run with and bind the land and all
subsequent owners of the land.
   (F)   An MPDU agreement that complies with this section must be approved by
the Director and the County Attorney and recorded in the land records prior to
signature and final approval of the site plan, preliminary plan or Phase II
plan for the proposed development.
   (G)   All MPDU payments in lieu shall be deposited into the County Housing
Initiative Fund.
   (H)   If the applicant chooses the payment in lieu option provided under
this section, the County Department of Permits and Inspections shall not accept
a building permit application for the development unless the applicant also
submits the per dwelling unit payment in lieu required under the MPDU
agreement.
   (I)   Triennial adjustment. On or before April 15, 2026, and on or before
April 15 every 3 years thereafter (2029, 2032, etc.), the per square foot
payment in lieu and the Affordability Gap shall be recalculated as of December
31 of the previous year, in accordance with the factors discussed in
subsections (C) and (D) above. The report may propose an adjustment be made by
the County Council. (Ord. 11-20-586, 9-6-2011; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014; Bill
No. 16-08, 8-15-2016; Bill No. 17-10, 6-13-2017; Bill No. 22-27, 10-18-2022)
§ 1-6A-5.2. USE OF GOVERNMENT AFFORDABLE RENTAL HOUSING PROGRAMS TO SATISFY THE
MPDU REQUIREMENTS.
   Under certain circumstances, federal, state, or local government affordable
rental housing programs may be used to fulfill the MPDU requirements. When
these affordable rental housing programs are used to comply with the
requirements of this chapter, the following conditions must be met:
   (A)   Rental rates must be affordable to moderate income households. Maximum
household income for affordable rental units built under this section may not
exceed 60% of the AMI as determined by HUD.
   (B)   The Director must determine that:
      (1)   the controls on the rental rates will contribute to the long term
availability of moderately priced dwelling units in the county; and
      (2)   recorded covenants on the rental units will require a control
period of 40 years.
   (C)   If a rental development is financed, in whole or in part, through the
awarding of tax credits from the Maryland Department of Housing & Community
Development's Low Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC) Program, then compliance
with the requirements of the LIHTC Program, including eligibility, income
limits, rental rates, and rules for operations, will be deemed to satisfy the
eligibility, income and rental rate provisions of this chapter and the county's
eligibility, rental rate and income regulations, except that the control period
for the rental units subject to the LIHTC program shall be extended to 40 years
to ensure long term affordability. In addition, if the rental development is
financed as provided in this subsection (C), an MPDU confirmation sheet, signed
by the applicant and the Director, may be used in place of an MPDU agreement.
   (D)   Subject to the approval of the Director, other federal, state or local
government affordable rental housing programs may be used to satisfy the
eligibility, income and rental rate provisions of this chapter and the county's
eligibility, rental rate and income regulations, provided that the control
period for the rental units subject to the program shall be extended to 40
years to ensure long term affordability.
(Bill No. 05-06, 7-7-15; Bill No. 22-27, 10-18-2022)
§ 1-6A-6. WAIVER OF REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The county, in order to assist in providing moderately priced housing
has enacted zoning standards in §§
1-19-8.620.1 through
8.620.6 of this Code, establishing density bonus provisions which increase the
allowable residential density above the maximum base density of the zoning
classification if MPDUs are built.
   (B)   Waiver of requirements. Any applicant who presents sufficient evidence
to the Director of the Department of Permits and Inspections in applying for a
building permit, or to the Planning Commission in submitting a preliminary plan
of subdivision for approval or requesting approval of a site or other
development plan, may be granted a waiver from part or all of §
1-6A-5. The waiver must relate only to the number of MPDUs to be built and may
be granted only if the Director of the Department of Planning and Development
Review, after consulting with the Department of Housing and Community
Development, finds that the applicant cannot attain the full density of the
zone, because of any requirements of the zoning ordinance or the administration
of other laws or regulations. When any part of the land that dwelling units
cannot be built on for physical reasons is used to compute permitted density,
the applicant’s inability to use the density bonus provisions is not in itself
grounds for waiving the MPDU requirements. Any waiver must be strictly
construed and limited.
(Ord. 02-25-321, 11-21-2002; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014; Bill No. 22-27, 10-18-
2022)
§ 1-6A-7. MAXIMUM PRICES AND RENTS OF MODERATELY PRICED DWELLING UNITS.
   Moderately priced dwelling units must not be sold or rented at prices or
rents that exceed the maximum prices or rents established under this section.
   (A)   Sales.
      (1)   Sales of MPDUs within each development subject to this section,
must meet the following requirements:
         (a)   One-third of the MPDUs for sale in each development must be sold
to a person whose income does not exceed 70% of the FCMI;
         (b)   One-third of the MPDUs for sale in each development must be sold
to a person whose income does not exceed 80% of the FCMI; and
         (c)   One-third of the MPDUs for sale in each development must be sold
to a person whose income does not exceed 90 % of the FCMI.
      (2)   The applicable sales price for each MPDU shall be determined based
on the 70%, 80% and 90% FCMI thresholds to ensure that, within each threshold
band, the respective buyer’s total monthly mortgage payment does not exceed 30%
of their threshold monthly income.
      (3)   The Director may allow an applicant to pay an increased sale price
for an MPDU when the Director finds, in exceptional cases, that a price
increase is justified to cover the cost of modifying the external design of the
MPDUs when a modification is necessary to reduce excessive marketing impact of
the MPDUs on the market rate units in the subdivision. The Director must
approve the amount of any increase for this purpose, which must not exceed 10%
of the allowable base price of the unit.
   (B)   Rentals. Note that this section does not apply to rental of MPDUs
under §
1-6A-5.2.
      (1)   The rent, excluding utilities when they are paid by the tenant, for
any MPDUs within each development subject to this section, shall be set as
follows:
         (a)   One-third of units must be rented at a rate equivalent to 30
percent of the monthly income of a household whose annual income does not
exceed 60% FCMI;
         (b)   One-third of units must be rented at a rate equivalent to 30
percent of the monthly income of a household whose annual income does not
exceed 70% FCMI; and
         (c)   One-third of units must be rented at a rate equivalent to 30
percent of the monthly income of a household whose annual income does not
exceed 80% FCMI;
      (2)   The Director, in setting the maximum rent for the rental units,
must consider the current cost of building MPDUs, available interest rates and
debt service for permanent financing, current market rates of return or
investments in residential rental properties, the value of the MPDU at the end
of the control period, and any other relevant information. The Director must
consult with the rental industry, employers and professional and citizen groups
to obtain statistical information and current general market and economic
conditions which may assist in setting a current maximum rent. The Director
must consider the extent to which, consistent with county codes and housing
standards, the cost of MPDU rental housing units can be reduced by the
elimination of amenities. The Director must also consider from time to time
changes in the income levels of persons of moderate income and their ability to
rent housing.
(Ord. 02-25-321, 11-21-2002; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014; Bill No. 22-27, 10-18-
2022)
§ 1-6A-8. SALE OR RENTAL OF MODERATELY PRICED DWELLING UNITS.
   (A)   Sale or rental to general public.
      (1)   Every moderately priced dwelling unit required under this chapter
must be offered to the general public for sale or rental to a good-faith
purchaser or renter to be used for his or her own residence, except units
offered for sale or rent by a designated housing agency or non-profit
corporation, whose purpose is to provide housing for persons of moderate
income.
      (2)   Before offering any moderately priced dwelling units, the applicant
must notify the Department of the proposed offering and the date on which the
applicant will be ready to begin the marketing to eligible persons. The notice
must set forth the number of units offered, the bedroom mix, the floor area for
each type, a description of the amenities offered in each unit and a statement
of the availability of each unit for sale or rent, including information
regarding any mortgage financing available to buyers of the designated unit.
The applicant must also give the Department a vicinity map of the offering, a
copy of the approved development, subdivision or site plan, as appropriate, and
such other information or documents as the Director finds necessary. The
Department must maintain a list of eligible persons of moderate income and, in
accordance with procedures established by the Director, must notify eligible
persons of the offering.
      (3)   After receiving the offering notice, the Department must determine
whether the offering notice is complete. If the Department finds that the
offering notice is complete, it will offer the units to eligible persons on a
lottery basis. The Department must notify the applicant when the 90 day
priority marketing period for the MPDUs may begin.
      (4)   The Director may establish a buyer and renter selection system that
considers household size, county residency, employment in the county, and
length of time since the person was certified for the MPDU program. Each
eligible person must be notified of the availability of any MPDU which would
meet that person’s housing needs, and be given an opportunity to buy or rent an
MPDU during the priority marketing period in the order of that person’s
selection priority ranking.
      (5)   The priority marketing period for new units ends 90 days after the
initial offering date approved by the Department. The priority marketing period
for resold or re-rented units ends 60 days after the Department notifies the
seller of the approved resale price or vacancy of the rental unit. The
Department may extend a priority marketing period when eligible persons are
interested in buying or renting a unit.
      (6)   Every buyer or renter of an MPDU must occupy the unit as his or her
primary residence during the control period. Each buyer and renter must certify
before taking occupancy that he or she will occupy the unit as his or her
primary residence during the control period. The Director may require an owner
who does not occupy the unit as his or her primary residence to offer the unit
for resale to an eligible person under the resale provisions of §
1-6A-9.
      (7)   During the initial control period after the original sale, and for
as long thereafter as the MPDU is owned by the initial MPDU owner, no liens
will be permitted, without the written approval of the Director, on the MPDU
property other than liens for unpaid real estate taxes or assessments for
infrastructure improvements, except for the original purchase money mortgage
and any liens validly recorded for unpaid homeowner association fees. Upon
application to and approval by the Director, subordinate liens may be placed,
if not prohibited by the purchase money mortgagee’s deed of trust, for
improvements to the MPDU property which would enhance the market value of the
property by at least 110% of the subordinate lien requested.
      (8)   An owner of an MPDU, except a housing agency or nonprofit
corporation designated by the Director, must not rent the unit to another party
unless the Director finds sufficient cause to allow temporary rental of the
unit under applicable regulations, which may include maximum rental levels. Any
MPDU owner who is allowed to rent a unit temporarily must agree to amend the
applicable MPDU covenants to extend the control period for a time equal to the
temporary rental period.
      (9)   Any rent obtained for an MPDU that is rented without the Director’s
authorization must be paid into the Housing Initiative Fund by the owner within
90 days after the Director notifies the owner of the rental violation. Any
amount unpaid after 90 days is grounds for a lien against the unit, and the
Director may obtain a judgment and record the lien.
      (10)   An applicant must not sell or lease any unit without first
obtaining a certificate of eligibility from the buyer or lessee. A copy of each
certificate must be furnished to the Department and maintained on file by the
Department. Before the sale by an applicant or by a designated housing agency
or nonprofit corporation to any buyer of any MPDU who does not possess a
certificate of eligibility, the applicant, agency or non-profit corporation
must ask the Department whether the certificates on file show that the proposed
buyer had previously bought another MPDU. A person must not buy a second MPDU
unless no first-time buyer is qualified to buy that unit. The Director may
waive this restriction for good cause.
      (11)   If an MPDU owner dies, at least 1 heir, legatee, or other person
taking title by will or by operation of law must occupy the MPDU during the
control period under this section, or the owner of record must sell the MPDU as
provided in §
1-6A-9.
   (B)   Designated housing development agency or nonprofit corporation.
      (1)   In view of the critical, long-term public need for housing for
families of moderate income, a housing development agency or nonprofit
corporation designated by the Director has the option to buy or lease, for its
own programs or programs administered by it, up to 40% of all MPDUs which are
not sold or rented under any other federal, state, or local program.
         (a)   The County may buy or lease up to 33-1/3% of the MPDUs not sold
or rented under any other federal, state, or local program. Any designated
agency or nonprofit corporation may buy or lease:
            1.   Any MPDUs in the first 33-1/3% that the County has not bought
or leased; and
            2.   The remainder of the 40%.
         (b)   This option may be assigned to persons of moderate income who
are eligible for assistance under any federal, state, or local programs. The
Director must adopt standards and priorities for designating nonprofit
corporations under this subsection. These standards must require the nonprofit
corporation to demonstrate its ability to operate and maintain MPDUs
satisfactorily on a long-term basis.
      (2)   The Department must notify the designated agency or nonprofit
corporation promptly after receiving notice from the applicant under subsection
(A) of the availability of MPDUs. If the designated agency exercises its
option, it must submit to the applicant, within 30 calendar days after the
Department notifies the agency under subsection (B), a notice of intent to
exercise its option for specific MPDUs covered by this option. Any MPDUs not
bought or leased under this subsection must be sold or rented only to eligible
persons under subsection (B) during the priority marketing period for eligible
persons to buy or lease.
      (3)   In exercising this option, any designated agency or nonprofit
corporation must designate the units by reference to number, type, size and
amenities of the units selected if the designation does not result in any 1
type of unit exceeding by more than 40% the total units of that type which are
sold or rented under this section, unless the applicant agrees otherwise. The
notice required under subsection (B)(2) must state which MPDUs are to be
offered for sale and which are to be offered for rent, and the designated
agency or nonprofit corporation may buy only units which are offered for sale
and may lease only units which are offered for rent. The designated agency or
nonprofit corporation must decide whether it will exercise its option within 45
days after it receives the original notice.
      (4)   The designated agency or non-profit corporation acquiring MPDUs for
the purpose of renting these units are responsible to the Department for the
management of these units so as not to adversely affect the community in which
they are located. Homeowner Associations may file a complaint in writing with
the Department. Complaints which are determined by the Department to be valid
and which are not resolved may result in the designated agency or non-profit
corporation forfeiture of the right to purchase future units.
(Ord. 02-25-321, 11-21-2002; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014; Bill No. 22-27, 10-18-
2022)
§ 1-6A-9. CONTROL OF RENTS AND RESALE PRICES; FORECLOSURES.
   (A)   Resale price and terms. Except for foreclosure proceedings, any MPDU
constructed or offered for sale or rent under this chapter must not be resold
during the control period for a price greater than the original selling price
plus:
      (1)   A percentage of the unit’s original selling price equal to the
increase in the cost of living since the unit was first sold, as determined by
the Consumer Price Index;
      (2)   The fair market value of improvements made to the unit between the
date of original sale and date of resale;
      (3)   An allowance for closing costs which were not paid by the initial
seller, but which will be paid by the initial buyer for the benefit of the
later buyer;
      (4)   A reasonable sales commission if the unit is not sold during the
priority marketing period to an eligible person from the Department’s
eligibility list. The resale price of an MPDU may be reduced if the physical
condition of the unit reflects abnormal wear and tear because of neglect,
abuse, or insufficient maintenance. Any personal property transferred in
connection with the resale of an MPDU must be sold at its fair market value. In
calculating the allowable resale price of an MPDU which was originally offered
for rent, the Department must estimate the price for which the unit would have
been sold if the unit had been offered for sale when it was first rented.
   (B)   Resale requirements during the control period.
      (1)   Any MPDU offered for resale during the control period must first be
offered exclusively for 60 days to the Department. The Department may buy a
unit when funds are available and the Director finds that the Department’s
buying and reselling the unit will increase opportunities for eligible persons
to buy the unit. If it does not buy the unit, the Department must notify
eligible persons and qualified non- profits of the availability of a resale
MPDU. The unit may be sold through either of the following methods:
         (a)   The Department may by lottery establish a priority order under
which eligible persons who express interest in buying the unit may buy it at
the approved resale price;
         (b)   The Department may notify the MPDU owner that the owner may sell
the unit directly to any eligible person under the resale provisions of this
chapter.
      (2)   A resale MPDU may be offered for sale to the general public only
after:
         (a)   The priority marketing period expires; and
         (b)   All eligible persons who express an interest in buying it have
been given an opportunity to do so.
      (3)   The seller is required to submit to the Department, prior to sale,
for approval:
         (a)   A copy of the proposed sales contract, including a list and the
price of any personal property included in the sale;
         (b)   Signed copy of the settlement sheet; and
         (c)   An affidavit signed by the seller and buyer attesting to the
accuracy of all documents and conditions of the sale.
      (4)   A transfer of an MPDU does not comply with this chapter until all
required documents and affidavits have been submitted to and approved by the
Department.
   (C)   First sale after control period ends.
      (1)   If an MPDU originally offered for sale or rent is sold or resold
after its control period ends, the qualified non-profits have the right for 30
days after the offer is made to match any bona fide offer to buy an MPDU.
      (2)   When an MPDU is sold or resold after its control period ends, the
Department must terminate the MPDU controls and execute a release of the
restrictive covenants and subordinate lien.
   (D)   Initial and subsequent rent controls. Except as provided in §
1-6A-5.2, moderately priced dwelling units built or offered for rent under this
chapter must not be rented for 40 years after the original rental at a rent
greater than that established by regulation adopted by the county. Whenever any
moderately priced dwelling unit (other than those built, sold or rented under
any federal, state or local program offered by the County) is offered for rent
during the 40 year control period, it must be offered exclusively for 90 days
to eligible persons, as determined by the Department, for use as his or her own
residence. The County may assign its right to rent such units to persons of
moderate income who are eligible for assistance under any federal, state or
local program administered by an approved non-profit corporation or housing
agency.
   (E)   Purchase money mortgages. Purchase money mortgages for MPDUs will be
written such as to provide that in the event of foreclosure, pre-notification
to the Director is required of the mortgagee. In such event, the Director shall
have 30 days to determine whether to permit the foreclosure to occur in
accordance with § 1-6A-9(F), or if the Director determines that the waiting
list of eligible prospective MPDU purchasers warrants retaining the MPDU unit
in inventory, the Director is authorized to notify the foreclosing mortgagee
(if funding is available) that the Housing Initiative Fund (HIF) guarantees to
the mortgagee payoff of the principal and interest due on the purchase money
mortgage within 90 days, in return for the foreclosure action to be cancelled
with concurrent enforceable eviction acceptance being obtained from the
mortgagor MPDU owner. Should the latter not be obtainable, the foreclosure
would be permitted to proceed but with the condition that upon successful
foreclosure and eviction if necessary, the HIF pays the principal, interest and
incurred fees to the mortgagee, whereupon the title to the MPDU property is
passed to the HIF. The HIF will thereupon re-offer the property in accordance
with the MPDU program to eligible persons, with the requirement that the HIF is
made whole for monies spent in the process of retaining the property in the
MPDU program.
   (F)   Foreclosures or other court- ordered sales.
      (1)   If an MPDU is sold through a foreclosure or other court-ordered
sale, a payment must be made to the Housing Initiative Fund as follows.
         (a)   If the sale occurs during the first 15 years after the original
sale or rental, any amount of the foreclosure sale price which exceeds the
total of the approved resale price under subsection (A), reasonable foreclosure
costs, and liens filed under the Maryland Contract Lien Act, must be paid to
the Housing Initiative Fund. If the remaining balance under the original first
deed of trust or mortgage exceeds the resale price under subsection (A), then
the difference between the foreclosure sales price and the balance of the
original first deed of trust (plus reasonable foreclosure costs) must be paid
to the Fund.
         (b)   If the sale occurs after the first 15 years after the original
sale or rental, the payment to the Fund must be calculated under subsection
(C).
         (c)   If the MPDU is a rental unit, the resale price under subsections
(A) and (C) must be calculated using the maximum sale price in effect when the
unit was originally offered for rent.
         (d)   If the MPDU is sold subject to senior liens, the lien balances
must be included in calculating the sale price.
      (2)   All MPDU covenants and liens must be released after the required
payment is made into the Housing Initiative Fund.
   (G)   Waivers. The Director may waive the restrictions on the resale and re-
rental prices for MPDUs if the Director finds that the restrictions conflict
with regulations of federal or state housing programs and thus prevents
eligible persons from buying or renting units under the MPDU program.
   (H)   Bulk transfers. This section does not prohibit the bulk transfer or
sale of all or some of the rental MPDUs in a subdivision within 25 years after
the original rental if the buyer is bound by all covenants and controls on the
MPDUs.
   (I)   Compliance. The county must adopt regulations to promote compliance
with this section and prevent practices that evade controls on rents and sales
of MPDUs.

§ 1-6A-10. EXCEPTIONS.
   Any existing site plan, preliminary subdivision plat or Phase II PUD plan
approved and having APFO approval prior to the effective date of this chapter
shall be exempt from the MPDU requirement as long as such approved plan or
plat, including any extension or modification thereof, remains valid.
Notwithstanding the above, if any revision or modification of an approved plan
which would otherwise be exempt from this chapter increases the density of the
project, the increased density shall be subject to the requirements of this
chapter.

2014)
§ 1-6A-11. GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS; ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   The Department must maintain a list of all moderately priced dwelling
units constructed, sold or rented under this chapter; and the county may, from
time to time, adopt regulations necessary to administer this chapter.
   (B)   This chapter applies to all agents, successors and assigns of an
applicant. A building permit must not be issued, and a preliminary plan of
subdivision, development plan, or site plan must not be approved unless it
meets the requirements of this chapter. The Director of Permits and Inspections
may deny, suspend or revoke any building or occupancy permit upon finding a
violation of this chapter. Any prior approval of a preliminary plan of
subdivision, development plan or site plan may be suspended or revoked upon the
failure to meet any requirement of this chapter. An occupancy permit must not
be issued for any building to any applicant, or a successor or assign of any
applicant, for any construction that does not comply with this chapter.
   (C)   The Director is authorized to pursue any available remedy, legal or
equitable in nature, to enforce the requirements of this chapter or to prevent
or abate a violation of this chapter.
   (D)   The Director may take legal action to stop or cancel any transfer of
an MPDU if any party to the transfer does not comply with all requirements of
this chapter. The Director may recover any funds improperly obtained from any
sale or rental of an MPDU in violation of this chapter.
   (E)   In addition to or instead of any other available remedy, the Director
may take legal action to:
      (1)   Enjoin an MPDU owner who violates this chapter or any covenant
signed or order issued under this chapter from continuing the violation; or
      (2)   Require an owner to sell an MPDU owned or occupied in violation of
this chapter to an eligible buyer.

§ 1-6A-12. APPEALS.
   Any person aggrieved by any denial, suspension or revocation of a building
or occupancy permit or denial, suspension or revocation of approval of a
preliminary plan of subdivision, development plan, or site plan may appeal to
the Zoning Board of Appeals for a review of such action or decision.

   This chapter applies to all applicants and housing units developed by
applicants, regardless of when an MPDU was originally offered for sale or rent.

   (A)   Pursuant to §
2-2-29 of the Frederick County Code, any violation of any of the provisions of
this entire chapter, which is
Chapter 1-7 entitled "Electricity" is a civil infraction and shall be called a
civil electrical infraction. If, after investigation, a civil electrical
infraction is believed to exist, the administrative authority or authorized
agent shall deliver a citation or warning to the licensed electrical contractor
and others responsible for the infraction. If the administrative authority or
authorized agent is unable to locate that individual personally, the
administrative authority or authorized agent may post the citation or warning
in a conspicuous place on the property of the violation and mail a copy of same
to the person, which shall be sufficient for delivery under this section.
   (B)   The citation or warning, as provided for in this section, shall be in
writing and shall contain the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the person charged or warned;
      (2)   The nature of the violation;

      (8)   A certification by the Director or authorized agent attesting to
the truth of the matters set forth.
   (C)   Whenever an alleged or possible civil electrical infraction comes to
the attention of the administrative authority, the following procedures shall
apply.
      (1)   The administrative authority will investigate whether a violation
has occurred;
      (2)   If the administrative authority finds that a violation has
occurred, the administrative authority will issue a warning to the person(s)
responsible in the form and manner outlined in this section, with reasonable
time stated to abate or to prevent future infractions;
      (3)   If the violation continues or is allowed to occur after the
reasonable time stated, the administrative authority will issue a citation to
the person(s) responsible in the form and manner as outlined in this section.
Notwithstanding the provision of step (2) above, the administrative authority
may issue a citation at step (2) without prior issuance of a warning.
   (D)   A fine of $ 200 is hereby imposed upon any person responsible for a
civil electrical infraction for each violation. Each day that a violation is
permitted to exist shall be considered a separate infraction. All fines shall
be payable to the Treasurer of Frederick County, Maryland, in the office of the
Department of Permits and Inspections.
   (E)   A person who receives a citation may elect to stand trial for the
offense by filing with the administrative authority a notice of intention to
stand trial. The notice shall be given at least 10 days before the date of
payment of the fines as set forth in the citation. Upon receipt of the notice
of intention to stand trial, the administrative authority shall forward to the
district court of Frederick County, Maryland, a copy of the citation and the
notice of intention to stand trial. Upon receipt of the citation, the district
court shall schedule the case for trial and notify the defendant of the trial
date. All fines, penalties, or forfeitures collected by the district court for
any civil electrical infractions shall be remitted to the Treasurer of
Frederick County, Maryland.
   (F)   If a person who receives a citation for an infraction fails to pay the
fine by the date of payment set forth on the citation and fails to file a
notice of intention to stand trial, a formal notice of the infraction shall be
sent to the person's last known address. If the citation is not satisfied
within 15 days from the date of the notice, the person shall be liable for a
fine of $400 for each infraction. If after 35 days the citation is not
satisfied, the administrative authority may request adjudication of the case
through the district court by the filing of civil judgment procedures.
   (G)   Adjudication of an infraction under this subsection is not a criminal
conviction, nor does it impose any civil disabilities ordinarily imposed by a
criminal conviction.
   (H)   In a proceeding before the district court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Code Ann., Local Government Article, Title 6. However, the
County Attorney is hereby authorized to prosecute all civil electrical
infractions under this section.
   (I)   If a person is found by the district court to have committed a civil
electrical infraction, that person shall be liable for the costs of the
proceedings in the district court.
   (J)   Depending on the circumstances of each case and after consultation
with the County Attorney, the administrative authority has the discretionary
authority to reduce or suspend all or a portion of the fine payable through the
Permits and Inspections Office.
   (K)   Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or prevent the
administrative authority, or any one else, from seeking other legal remedies,
such as injunctions or criminal prosecution.
   (L)   Provisions of this section are in addition to, not in lieu of those
penalties specified in other sections of this chapter, specifically §
1-7-48.
   (M)   The fines specified in this section can be modified at any time by
resolution of the county governing body after a duly advertised public hearing.

Statement of purpose and policy.
   (A)   Frederick County, recognizing that our system of representative
government is dependent in part upon the people maintaining the highest trust
in their public officials and employees, finds and declares that the people
have a right to be assured that the impartiality and independent judgment of
public officials and employees will be maintained.
   (B)   It is evident that this confidence and trust is eroded when the
conduct of the county's business is subject to improper influence and even the
appearance of improper influence.
   (C)   For the purpose of guarding against improper influence, the county
enacts this law to require elected officials, officials, employees and
individuals appointed to certain boards and commissions to disclose their
financial affairs and to set minimum standards for the conduct of county
business.
   (D)   It is the intent of the county that this chapter, except for its
provisions for criminal sanctions, be construed liberally to accomplish this
purpose.

cost-of-living changes, pending amendment to this §

      (1)   The structure must be used, or have been used, for non-residential
purposes and be located in a zone permitting commercial or industrial use.
      (2)   A single occupant structure must have been completely vacant for a

the rehabilitation project, over the assessed value before the property was
rehabilitated; or
      (2)   The cost expended for the rehabilitation project.

property tax imposed pursuant to Md. Code Ann., Tax Property Article § 6-202
and shall not be a credit from any special taxing district tax including, but
not limited to tax for fire and rescue services, imposed pursuant to Maryland
or Frederick County law.
   (I)   Property owners shall file annually (on or before April 30 of each
calendar year) an application for the tax credit allowed under this provision

   (B)   To qualify for and remain eligible to participate in this Frederick

receiving any other Frederick County tax credit.
   (C)   To further qualify for this revitalization area rehabilitated
structures tax credit, a structure must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   The structure must be located in a designated revitalization area
as provided for in §
1-8-304(M) below of this tax credit.
      (2)   The structure must be lawfully used, or have been used, for non-
residential purposes prior to rehabilitation for commercial or industrial

portion of the structure.
   (D)   Qualifying structures shall be eligible for this revitalization area
rehabilitated structures tax credit for 7 consecutive years after first
qualifying for this property tax credit. The first tax year the tax credit
shall become available for a qualifying structure shall be the first tax year
in which its county property taxes would otherwise have increased due to the
qualifying rehabilitation project (the "first tax year"). The last tax year
this county property tax credit shall be available shall be the sixth tax year
that follows the first tax year.
   (E)   The amount of this tax credit will be the following percentage of the

      (1)   100% in the first, second and third qualifying taxable years.
      (2)   80% in the fourth qualifying taxable year.
      (3)   60% in the fifth qualifying taxable year.
      (4)   40% in the sixth qualifying taxable year.

   (F)   The amount of a tax credit granted under this program may not exceed
the property tax increase attributable to the increase in the assessment of the
structure over the assessment before the structure is rehabilitated. This
property tax credit will be determined based upon the lesser of:
      (1)   The increase in the assessed value of the property attributable to
the rehabilitation, over the assessed value before the property was
rehabilitated; or
      (2)   The actual cost expended for the rehabilitation.
   (G)   Projects that begin rehabilitation construction more than 5 years
after the geographical revitalization area in which they are located has been
designated for inclusion in this tax credit program shall not be eligible for
tax credits under this program. Qualifying structures that have been accepted
into this tax credit program before such 5 year period expires shall continue
to receive those tax credits as provided for above, assuming these structures
otherwise remain eligible for this program.
   (H)   For purposes of this property tax credit program, "commercial" or

   (K)   In addition to terminating as provided elsewhere in this section, any
tax credit granted under this provision shall also terminate:
      (1)   At the moment ownership of the qualifying structure or real
property on which it sits is transferred or conveyed in any manner whatsoever,
except that this provision shall not apply simply because the structure or real
property is subject to a mortgage or deed of trust granted as part of a
financing of the property;
      (2)   At the moment in which the qualifying structure is substantially
destroyed;
      (3)   At the moment the qualifying structure or real property on which it
sits ceases to be used in whole or part for commercial or industrial purposes;
or
      (4)   At the end of the sixth tax year after the first tax year this
property tax credit was granted.
   (L)   To the extent this tax credit terminates other than at the end of a
tax year, the property owner shall repay, without demand, Frederick County the
amount of the tax credit received for that tax year. Interest shall accrue from
the moment the tax credit ends at the rate established for overdue property
taxes. To the extent permitted by law, any unrepaid tax credit is a lien on the
real property that had received the tax credit and may be collected in the same
manner as unpaid property taxes may be collected under the Md. Code Ann., Tax-
Property Article.

credit shall apply to the following designated revitalization areas as of the
specified effective dates:

requirements under this article and applicable state law have been met.
   (C)   The Director of Finance shall:

the tax credit was earned to verify, to the Director of Finance's satisfaction,
that the business entity continues to satisfy all applicable requirements under

   (D)   A business entity which submits a false or fraudulent application, or
withholds information, to obtain a tax credit under this article must repay the
county for all amounts previously credited for any and all years that the
credits were provided and all accrued interest and penalties that would apply
to those amounts as overdue taxes. A business entity which violates this
subsection is liable for all court costs and expenses of the county in any

Article, which real property tax credit shall be known as the Frederick County
Commercial and Industrial Business Tax Credit.
   (B)   The Frederick County Director of Treasury ("County Treasurer") shall

§ 1-8-443 QUALIFYING CONDITIONS.

must make a substantial investment in developing and operating a facility
within Frederick County.
   (B)   The commercial or industrial business seeking this credit for a
facility must apply for this tax credit with the Frederick County Treasurer on
or before October 1 of the tax year for which the facility is first eligible
for this tax credit.
   (C)   The facility must be in continual operation throughout each tax year

assembling purposes, as such terms are defined for purposes of the Annotated
Code of Maryland, Tax-Property Article.
   (F)   Both single and multiple use properties are eligible to qualify for
this tax credit, assuming all other eligibility requirements are met, although
multiple use properties will only be eligible to receive a tax credit on the
facility portion of the property devoted to active manufacturing, fabricating

   (G)   The commercial or industrial business responsible for the qualifying
facility and the owner of the real property where the facility is located, if
other than the commercial or industrial business, must, if requested, enter

§ 1-8-444 AMOUNT AND DURATION OF CREDIT.
   (A)   A facility shall be eligible for this commercial and industrial
business tax credit for a term not to exceed ten consecutive years after first
qualifying for this property tax credit. The first tax year the tax credit
shall become available for a qualifying facility shall be the first full tax
year in which its county property taxes would increase due to the substantial
investment in new construction or an improvement to an existing facility (the
"first tax year"). The last tax year this property tax credit shall be
available shall be the tenth tax year that follows the increase in county real
property tax due to the substantial investment in the facility.
   (B)   The County Executive shall establish the term and amount of each tax
credit granted under this Article, as the County Executive believes is in
Frederick County's best interest, in an amount expressed as a percent of the
additional Frederick County real property tax imposed as a result of an
increase in assessment due to the new construction or expansion of a qualifying
facility (the "incremental tax"). In the event the average amount of the credit
over the term of the credit would exceed 60% of total incremental tax, the tax
credit must be reviewed and approved by the County Council before the tax
credit is granted.
   (C)   The amount of a tax credit granted under this program may not exceed
the property tax increase attributable to the increase in the assessment of the
facility over the assessment before the substantial investment was made to the
qualifying facility (the "incremental tax").
(Bill No. 15-09, 9-1-2015)
§ 1-8-445 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   This property tax credit shall be a credit only against the county
real property tax imposed pursuant to Maryland Annotated Code Tax-Property
Article § 6-202 and shall not be a credit against any special taxing district
tax including, but not limited to tax for fire and rescue services, imposed
pursuant to Maryland or Frederick County law.
   (B)   Property owners shall file annually on or before April 30 of each
calendar year an affidavit, signed under oath or affirmation subject to
penalties for perjury, with the County Treasurer certifying that the facility
continues to operate in Frederick County and qualifies for this tax credit;
failure to do so shall mean that the otherwise qualifying property shall not be
entitled to receive this tax credit for the following tax year (July 1 through
June 30).
   (C)   In addition to terminating as may be provided in the tax credit
agreement or elsewhere in this Article, any tax credit granted under this
provision shall terminate:
      (1)   At the moment ownership of the qualifying facility or real property
on which it sits is transferred or conveyed in any manner whatsoever, except
that this provision shall not apply simply because the facility or real
property is subject to a mortgage or deed of trust granted as part of a
financing of the property or if the transfer or conveyance is between a parent
business entity and its wholly owned subsidiary business entity or between two
or more subsidiary business entities wholly owned by the same parent business
entity;
      (2)   At the moment in which the qualifying facility is substantially
destroyed;
      (3)   At the moment the qualifying facility ceases to be used in whole or
part for manufacturing, fabricating or assembling purposes, including but not
limited to failing to maintain the minimum employment level required for the
initial substantial investment; or
      (4)   At the end of the tenth tax year after the qualifying facility was
first eligible for this tax credit.
   (D)   To the extent this tax credit terminates other than at the end of a
tax year, the property owner shall repay, without demand, Frederick County the
amount of the tax credit received for that tax year. Interest shall accrue from
the moment the tax credit terminates at the rate established for overdue
property taxes. To the extent permitted by law, any unrepaid tax credit is a
lien on the real property that had received the tax credit and may be collected
in the same manner as unpaid property taxes may be collected under the
Annotated Code of Maryland, Tax-Property Article.
   (E)   In the event the commercial or industrial business making the
substantial investment that qualifies for this tax credit is a lessee of real
property subject to this credit, the amount of this tax credit shall pass
through to the commercial or industrial business that makes the substantial
investment qualifying the facility for this credit, except that the term of the
tax credit may not exceed the remaining term of the lease and may not, in any
event, exceed ten years.
   (F)   In the event a commercial or industrial business qualifies for this
commercial and industrial business tax credit as well as for a second real
property tax credit available from the county and applications are timely filed
for both credits, the qualifying business may elect which credit to receive,
but may not receive both credits. Upon expiration or termination of the
selected credit, if the qualifying business is not then in default of the
qualifications for either tax credit and the tax credits were for different
length terms the business shall then receive the remaining credit available
during any remaining time on the second credit.

the Director of Frederick County Department of Permits and Inspections may
request adjudication of the case through the District Court. The District Court
shall schedule the case for trial and summon the defendant to appear.

§ 1-11-39. CIVIL REFUSE COVERING INFRACTIONS.
   (A)   Pursuant to §
2-2-29 of the Frederick County Code, any violation of any of the provisions of
§
1-11-35(B) of the Code is a civil infraction and shall be called a civil refuse
covering infraction.
   (B)   Whenever an alleged civil refuse covering infraction comes to the
attention of the Sheriff’s office, or the person designated by the Director of
the Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management (hereinafter referred to
as the “designee”), the procedure to be followed is:
      (1)   That the Sheriff or his Deputy shall investigate whether an
infraction has occurred;
      (2)   That, if the investigation indicates that an infraction has
occurred, the Sheriff or Deputy shall issue a citation to the driver of the
vehicle on a State of Maryland citation form;
      (3)   That, if the vehicle is no longer in the area, the Sheriff or his
deputy will issue a citation to the owner of the vehicle on a State of Maryland
citation form;
      (4)   That, whenever an alleged civil refuse covering infraction comes to
the attention of the designee, the designee may issue a citation to the driver
of the vehicle.
   (C)   A fine of $100 is hereby imposed upon any person responsible for a
civil refuse covering infraction. All fines shall be payable to the county in
the office of the Sheriff, or in the office designated by the Director of the
Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management in the case of a citation
issued by the designee, which shall remit the same on a weekly basis to the
County Treasurer.
   (D)   A person who receives a citation may elect to stand trial for the
offense by filing with the Sheriff, or the Division of Utilities and Solid
Waste Management of Frederick County if the citation was issued by the
designee, a notice of intention to stand trial. The notice shall be given at
least 5 days before the date of payment of the fine as set forth in the
citation. On receipt of a notice of intention to stand trial, the Sheriff, or
the Director of the Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management if the
citation was issued by the designee, shall forward to the District Court for
Frederick County, Maryland, a copy of the citation and the notice of the
intention to stand trial. On receipt of the citation, the district court shall
schedule the case for trial and notify the defendant of the trial date. All
fines, penalties, or forfeitures collected by the district court for refuse
covering infractions shall be remitted to the county, through the County
Treasurer.
   (E)   If a person who receives a citation for an infraction fails to pay the
fine by the date of payment set forth on the citation and fails to file a
notice of intention to stand trial, a formal notice of the infraction shall be
sent to the person at his or her employment address. If the citation is not
satisfied within 15 days from the date of the notice, the person is liable for
a fine of $200 for each infraction. If, after 35 days, the citation is not
satisfied, the Sheriff, or the Director of the Division of Utilities and Solid
Waste Management if the citation was issued by the designee, may request
adjudication of the case through the district court. The district court shall
schedule the case for trial and summon the defendant to appear.
   (F)   Adjudication of an infraction under this section is not a criminal
conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed
by a criminal conviction.
   (G)   In a proceeding before the district court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Code Ann., Local Government Article, Title 6. However, the
County Attorney is hereby authorized to prosecute all civil refuse covering
infractions under this section.
   (H)   If a person is found by the district court to have committed a civil
refuse covering infraction, he shall be liable for the costs of the proceedings
in the district court.
   (I)   Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or prevent the
seeking of other legal remedies, such as injunctions or criminal prosecution.

§ 1-11-40. USER FEES.
   Any person using the Frederick County landfill or transfer station and
disposing of any material (excluding tires or mattresses or box springs, which
are provided for in §
1-11-41) shall pay a fee to the county at the rates set by resolution of the
county governing body. Material may be weighed according to the rules of the
Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management, and the fee imposed on the
actual weight of each load, rounded to the nearest 1/100 of a ton (20 pounds).
Alternatively, a disposal fee may be charged on such other basis as may be
established by the county. For example, alternatives to weighing tonnage might
include, but not be limited to, the county governing body establishing flat
rates for the disposal of specific materials and establishing flat rates per
disposal trip such as for use of the landfill's Citizens' Convenience Center.

§ 1-11-42. SCAVENGING UNLAWFUL.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person not authorized by the Director of
the Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management to salvage, scavenge or
otherwise remove, or cause to be salvaged, scavenged or removed, any material
from a bin or other container (including but not limited to residential
curbside bins) placed in the county by the Division of Utilities and Solid
Waste Management for the collection of any material for recycling.
   (B)   Violation of this section shall be punishable by a civil penalty not
to exceed the following:
      (1)   First offense:      $100;
      (2)   Second offense:   $250;
      (3)   Third offense:      $500;

§ 1-11-43. YARD WASTE.
   (A)   For purposes of this article, yard waste shall consist of any
materials normally generated in the maintenance of gardens, yards, lawns, or
landscaped areas, whether residential, commercial or public, including leaves,
grass clippings, plants, shrubs, prunings and trimmings no greater than 8 feet
in length and no greater than 6 inches in diameter. Yard waste does not include
other tree waste, land clearing debris, waste pavement, soil or any edible
product from any garden, yard, lawn or landscaped area.
   (B)   No person shall dispose of yard waste, or cause yard waste to be
disposed, either by itself or by commingling it with solid waste intended for
disposal in the refuse disposal area of the Frederick County Landfill. It is
the county’s intent that yard waste shall not be disposed of in the refuse
disposal area of the landfill. Yard waste may only be disposed of at the
recycling area of the landfill at such composting, mulching or other processing
area as established by the county.
   (C)   Pursuant to §
2-2-29, any violation of subsection (B) of this section shall subject the
violator to removing the yard waste from the refuse disposal area of the
landfill and possible loss of landfill use privileges as provided for under §
1-11-36. In addition, a violation of subsection (B) of this section shall be a
civil infraction identified as a “yard waste disposal infraction,” subject to
all procedures, penalties and costs set forth in §
1-11-39. Yard waste disposal infractions are not subject to §
1-11-37.
(Ord. 06-03-399, 1-17-2006; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-11-44. SYSTEM BENEFIT CHARGE.
   (A)   System benefit charge established. There is a system benefit charge to
pay for a portion of the reasonably anticipated capital costs and operating
costs for the disposal of solid waste.
   (B)   Countywide application. This system benefit charge shall apply
countywide including within the municipalities.
   (C)   Residential system benefit charge. The owner of each dwelling unit
shall be charged a residential system benefit charge. The owner shall pay this
system benefit charge.
   (D)   Amount of residential charge. The amount of the annual residential
system benefit charge for each single family residential dwelling unit shall be
$80 for fiscal year ’09 (July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009) and $84 for fiscal
year ’10 (July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010) and $88 for each fiscal year
thereafter. The amount of the annual residential system benefit charge for each
dwelling unit in a multi-family residential building shall be $44 for fiscal
year ’09 (July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009) and $47 for fiscal year ’10 (July
1, 2009 through June 30, 2010) and $49 for each fiscal year thereafter.
   (E)   Imposition of nonresidential system benefit charge.  The owner of each
nonresidential real property in the county upon which improvements having an
assessed value of greater than $5,000 have been placed shall be charged a
nonresidential system benefit charge. The owner shall pay this nonresidential
system benefit charge.
   (F)   Calculation of nonresidential system benefit charge.
      (1)   Each year the Division must make a determination of which of the
following 5 waste disposal generator categories a particular type of improved
property use falls within:
         (a)   Low generator: 0 to 2 lbs./sq. ft.;
         (b)   Medium low generator: >2 to 4 lbs./sq. ft.;
         (c)   Medium generator: >4 to 6 lbs./sq. ft.;
         (d)   Medium high generator: >6 to 8 lbs./sq. ft.; or
         (e)   High generator: >8 lbs./sq. ft.
      (2)   The Division may make its determination of which of the foregoing 5
generator categories a particular land use falls within by referring to the
most current solid waste generation study conducted by the county. If no
current study is available, the Division may base this classification on solid
waste generation studies from other jurisdictions.
      (3)   The amount of the nonresidential system benefit charge for each
generator category shall be:
 
                                      System Benefit Charge Per Fiscal Year/
Category                Units         Per Unit
                                      FY 09 FY 10 FY 11 and beyond
Nonresidential - low    2,000 sq. ft. $38   $40   $42
Nonresidential - medium 2,000 sq. ft. $113  $119  $125
low
Nonresidential - medium 2,000 sq. ft. $188  $198  $208
Nonresidential - medium 2,000 sq. ft. $272  $286  $301
high
Nonresidential - high   2,000 sq. ft. $336  $354  $372
 
      (4)   For the purpose of calculating the nonresidential system benefit
charge, the gross floor area of improvements on nonresidential real property is
to be expressed in terms of GFA units. For example, if a property has
improvements with a gross floor area of 1 - 2,999 square feet, the total GFA
units for that property is 1. If a property has improvements with a gross floor
area of 3,000 - 4,999 square feet, the total GFA units for that property is 2.
If a property has improvements with a gross floor area of 5,000 - 6,999 square
feet, the total GFA units for that property is 3.
      (5)   The total nonresidential system benefit charge to be paid by a
property owner is determined by multiplying the nonresidential system benefit
charge rate for the generator category by the number of GFA units attributable
to the gross floor area of improvements located on the nonresidential real
property. For example, if a retail store of 10,000 square feet is in the medium
generator category, and the nonresidential system benefit charge rate for that
category is $55 per GFA unit, the nonresidential system benefit charge would be
$55 x 5 GFA units = $275.
   (G)   Appeals process.
      (1)   Right to appeal. A property owner may, on or before September 30 of
the billing year, appeal, in writing, to the Director, with a copy to the
County Treasurer, for reconsideration of: (a) the generator category
determination; (b) the gross floor area used as the basis for determining the
number of GFA units; or (c) the determination of the residential system benefit
charge. Partial year billings may be appealed within 60 calendar days of the
billing date. Only the property owner or an agent duly authorized in writing by
the property owner for the purpose of the appeal, may file an appeal for any
given property. The appeal must be submitted using the form provided by the
Division for the subject levy year. The Division will mail a current year form
to any owner or agent requesting one.
      (2)   Information to include with appeal. The property owner must include
with the appeal a detailed statement of the basis for the appeal and documents
supporting the property owner’s assertion that: (a) the property should be
included in a different solid waste generator category; (b) the gross floor
area used to calculate GFA units is incorrect; or (c) the residential system
benefit charge has been incorrectly determined. If the property owner has
challenged the solid waste generator category in which the property has been
placed, the documents provided by the owner must include evidence reflecting
all of the waste generation at the property, including, but not limited to,
invoices for the most recent 12 months of service from the solid waste
collector(s) for the property. If such invoices do not state the net weights of
waste from the property according to weight tickets issued from state certified
calibrated scales, then the application must also include copies of the
contracts relating the dumpster volumes and frequency of service to the
invoiced amounts. State certification of scale calibration must have occurred
in the year in which the appeal was filed. Affidavits stating an estimate of
tonnage are not acceptable unless accompanied by weight readouts from
calibrated scales. If invoices for waste collection do not exist, the applicant
must certify this, and the Division may inspect the property or require
additional information under subsection (G)(3) of this section to estimate its
waste generation rate. If the property owner has challenged the gross floor
area used to calculate GFA units, the documents provided must include evidence
of the actual gross floor area on the property from assessor’s worksheets at
MSDAT or from architectural plans filed with the county or a municipality.
      (3)   Director’s right to additional information. The Director may
request that the property owner provide additional information which the
Director reasonably believes will assist the Director in deciding the appeal.
The Division may also inspect the property for reasons consistent with this
regulation. If the property owner fails to provide the information within 25
calendar days of the date of the Director’s request, or denies the division
access to the property for an inspection pursuant to this regulation, the
Director may dismiss the appeal.
      (4)   Written determination of appeal. The Director must make a written
determination of the appeal. The written determination of the appeal must be
mailed to the property owner by first class mail with a copy provided to the
County Treasurer. Other than dismissal of an appeal for the reason stated in
subsection (G)(3), the determination must either affirm the system benefit
charge or adjust it based upon evidence presented. The adjustment may decrease
or increase the system benefit charge imposed on the property owner. In the
case of an adjustment of the generator category, and provided there are no
changes in the use of the property, the decision of the Director is valid for 3
years including that in which the appeal takes place.
      (5)   Payment of system benefit charge following appeal. The property
owner must pay the system benefit charge at the same time as real property
taxes are due. Payment of the full system benefit charge should be paid by the
due date stated on the bill in order to avoid interest and penalty. If the
appeal results in a change, a revised bill will be issued. If the bill is
decreased, a refund will be mailed for any overpayment. If an additional
payment is due, the property owner will have 30 days to pay the additional
amount without interest or penalty.
   (H)   Collection of the system benefit charge. The system benefit charge
shall be billed with the tax bill and collected along with taxes on real
property. For improvements that are completed after the beginning of a fiscal
year, the system benefit charge may be billed based upon a partial year. If
system benefit charges are not billed with the tax bill for any reason, the
bill must indicate the portion of the year covered by the invoice. System
benefit charges that are not billed with the taxes are payable within 30 days
of the bill date.
   (I)   Collection. The County Treasurer shall collect and secure the system
benefit charge in the same manner in which taxes on real property are
collected. If the system benefit charge or any portion of it is not paid when
due, the property for which the charge has been made is subject to the same
penalties, procedure, sale, and lien priority in case of delinquency that are
provided for general real property taxes. The property for which the charge has
been made may be sold at tax sale in the same manner as real property is sold
for nonpayment of taxes. The county may also bring suit against the property
owner for any unpaid system benefit charge.
   (J)   Definitions.
      COUNTY. Frederick County, Maryland.
      COUNTY TREASURER.  The Treasurer of Frederick County (sometimes referred
to as the Director of Treasury) or the designee of the County Treasurer.
      DIRECTOR. The Director of the Division of Utilities and Solid Waste
Management for Frederick County or designee of the Director.
      DIVISION. The Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management for
Frederick County.
      DWELLING UNIT. A room or group of rooms forming a single residential unit
containing living, sleeping and cooking accommodations and designed to be used
for living purposes. Each apartment unit or mobile home shall be considered a
dwelling unit. Dwelling units shall not include those units designed primarily
for transient occupant purposes, nor shall they include rooms in hospitals or
nursing homes. In the event the number of dwelling units in a building or
structure cannot otherwise be determined, each 1,000 square foot area, or
portion thereof, in the building or structure shall be deemed to constitute 1
dwelling unit.
      GFA UNIT. The gross floor area of an improvement on real property divided
by 2,000. To determine the number of GFA units, the quotient is rounded to the
nearest increment of 2,000 whole number. Fractions of lower than .5 are to be
rounded downward and fractions of .5 and higher are to be rounded upward. Each

trial. The notice shall be given at least 5 days before the date of payment of
the fine as set forth in the citation. On receipt of the notice of intention to

prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Ann. Code, Local Government Article, Title 6. However, the

            1.   Be located within or adjacent to a Priority Preservation Area;
            2.   Be located within or adjacent to a Rural Legacy Area; or
            3.   Have a soil potential rating greater than 60 out of 100, as
calculated by County staff based on USDA data.
         (c)   The property must total at least 50 contiguous acres, except
that if the applicant is purchasing property adjacent to property they

         (e)   Seventy-five percent of the acreage of the property must be
located within an area zoned either agricultural or resource conservation;
         (f)   The property must be eligible to have additional residential

entity, within the 5 years prior to application.
         (c)   An applicant must be actively engaged in the field of
agriculture and must submit documentation as to their history, involvement, and
experience in agriculture. The applicant must provide supporting documentation
as requested by county staff.
   (C)   Scoring. The evaluation of applications shall be governed by priority
criteria for the Frederick County Agricultural Land Preservation Program, as
approved by the County Executive, at the time of application. County staff
shall apply the priority criteria and determine the score and ranking of each
application.
   (D)   Board recommendation. Information regarding the scoring of each
application will be presented to the Frederick County Agricultural Preservation
Advisory Board (“Ag Board”). In accordance with Md. Code Ann., Agriculture
Article, § 2-504.1(d)(1), the Ag Board shall make a recommendation to the
County Executive as to which applications should be granted preliminary
approval.
   (E)   Preliminary approval. The County Executive may grant preliminary
approval to 1 or more applications, based on availability of funds and the
ranking determined by the County staff and approved by the County Executive.
The County Executive may also determine that none of the applications score
high enough to justify an option to purchase a development rights easement
through the program.
   (F)   Easement evaluation.
      (1)   After preliminary approval, the county will authorize and pay for 2
appraisals of development rights easement values for the properties, in
accordance with the guidelines of the MALPF. The 2 appraisals will be used by
county staff to make a recommendation to the county executive as to the amount
of the offer to made to the applicant.
      (2)   The maximum value of any development rights easement shall be 70%
of the fair market value of the land less the value of the improvements. The
fair market value of the land is the price as of the valuation date for the
highest and best use of the property which a vendor, willing but not obligated
to sell, would accept for the property and which a purchaser, willing but not
obligated to buy, would pay for the property if the property was not subject to
any restriction imposed under the state or county agricultural preservation
programs.
      (3)   When an agreement as to the easement value has been reached, the
county governing body may grant the final approval of the option to purchase
the development rights easement. Preliminary approval by the County Executive
does not obligate the county governing body in any way to grant final approval.
   (G)   Option to purchase easement.
      (1)   After final approval of the offer by the county governing body, the
county will extend a written option offer to the applicant to purchase a
development rights easement on the property in an amount equal to 75% of the
value of the easement, which option shall extend for a period of 5 years.
      (2)   This option shall provide for restrictions on the use of the
property that are substantially the same as the restrictions contained in the
easement agreement used by the MALPF. Once the documents creating this option
are prepared and executed, the appropriate documents shall be recorded in the
Land Records of Frederick County.
   (H)   Easement sale.
      (1)   The recorded option to purchase will require that the applicant and
its heirs or assigns actively pursue, for a period of 5 years, the sale of a
development rights easement to the MALPF at an asking price no less than the
amount of the option to purchase the development rights easement extended by
the county. The applicant must accept any offer fromMALPF that equals or
exceeds the amount of the county option. If the MALPF purchases a development
rights easement from the applicant during this 5 year period, the full amount
paid by the county for the option will be repaid to the county at the
settlement of the easement. Settlement of a MALPF easement and payment of the
proceeds to the county will release the applicant from any additional
obligations related to the option to purchase by the county.
      (2)   If a development rights easement on the property has not been
purchased by MALPF within 5 years, the applicant may rescind the option to
purchase by repaying to the county the full amount paid by the county for the
option, plus interest for the entire period of the option, at the legal rate in
effect at the time of rescission. If the applicant does not cancel the option
and make full repayment to the county, the county will exercise the option
contained in the agreement and purchase the development rights easement from
the applicant for the consideration already paid by the county to the applicant
for the option. Unless otherwise agreed by both the county and the applicant,
the easement agreement will be substantially the same as the standard easement
agreement of MALPF. The easement agreement may be assigned by the county to
MALPF.

§ 1-13-35. INSTALLMENT PURCHASE PROGRAM.
   (A)   Purpose. There is hereby created in Frederick County an installment
purchase program for the purpose of accelerating land preservation easement
purchases and providing an additional land preservation program for the
landowners and citizens of Frederick County. This section is created with the
further purpose to preserve productive agricultural land and woodland which
provides for the continued production of food and fiber for the citizens of the
county and to protect farmland/open space from the impacts from development.
   (B)   Definitions.
      ADVISORY BOARD. The Frederick County Agricultural Preservation Advisory
Board.
      COUNTY. Frederick County, Maryland.
      DEPARTMENT. The Frederick County, Maryland Planning Department.
      EASEMENT. An agricultural land preservation easement, which limits the
land to agricultural or woodland land uses and prohibits residential,
commercial and industrial development except in accordance with the terms of
the easement.
      INSTALLMENT AGREEMENT. An installment purchase agreement between
Frederick County and the seller.
      INSTALLMENT PURCHASE PROGRAM. The Frederick County agricultural land
preservation installment purchase program.
      U.S.D.A. The United States Department of Agriculture.
   (C)   Qualifying criteria.
      (1)   Soil criteria. Properties for which a landowner has made
application for approval under the Frederick County agricultural land
preservation installment purchase program must meet 1 of the following criteria
as defined in the Frederick County soil survey:
         (a)   Minimum of 50% U.S.D.A. Class I, II and III soils;
         (b)   Minimum of 50% U.S.D.A. woodland groups I and II;
         (c)   A combination of farmland and woodland with a minimum of 60%
U.S.D.A. Class I, II and III soils and U.S.D.A. woodland groups I and II.
      (2)   Size criteria. The minimum size for properties entering the
installment purchase program shall be 50 acres provided however farms with less
than 50 acres may enroll in the program if contiguous to a property of 50 acres
or greater which is already under easement in the program or in conjunction
with other applications for properties which in combination meet or exceed 50
acres.
      (3)   Locational criteria. Properties considered for the Frederick County
agricultural land preservation installment purchase program easement shall be
located in a no planned service designation (N.P.S.) in the adopted water and
sewerage plan. The county governing body may approve a property for easement
purchase within a water and sewer service area upon a specific finding that the
land has extraordinary agricultural capability, is of significant size and has
the potential to be part of a larger area of contiguous preserved land. Prior
to any application being forwarded to the county governing body it shall be
referred to the Frederick County Planning Commission for review and comment.
      (4)   Other criteria. Landowners applying for sale of a development
rights easement under the installment purchase program must have further
subdivision rights under the provision of the Frederick County Zoning
Ordinance; provided, however, properties without further subdivision rights may
be permitted to be considered if the property:
         (a)   Is located within 2,000 feet of a growth area as designated on a
region plan; or
         (b)   Adjoins another parcel of land containing at least 50 acres
which is subject to an agricultural conservation easement or other conservation
easement; provided, that any such agricultural or other conservation easement
must preclude further subdivision of such property.
   (D)   Application for sale of development rights.
      (1)   An owner of agricultural land which meets the minimum
qualifications set forth may make application to sell to the county in
subsection (C) above an easement on the entire contiguous acreage of the land
less 1 acre per existing dwelling located on the subject property.
      (2)   The application shall be made on a form provided by the county and
be accompanied by a plat or map of the property at a scale of no smaller than 1
inch equals 600 feet. Each application shall also include a certificate that a
soil conservation plan approved by the Soil Conservation District for the
property has been made or revised within the last 10 years from the date of the
application. Applications for easement sale under the installment purchase
program shall be accepted by the Planning Department annually until September 1
of each year. The County Executive may authorize the Department to accept
applications biannually based upon a recommendation of the Advisory Board. All
applications shall be forwarded to the Advisory Board for review. The County
Executive upon a recommendation from the Advisory Board may limit the number of
applications to be considered based on available funding and the timing to
process the applications and make settlement.
      (3)   Each application shall be reviewed according to the Frederick
County agricultural land preservation installment purchase program ranking
system and ranked from highest score to lowest. The Frederick County
Agricultural Preservation Advisory Board’s recommendation and ranking shall be
forwarded to the County Executive for approval. Offers to purchase agricultural
preservation easements shall be made to the highest ranked farm first with
additional offers made in descending order according to the ranking system. The
county may modify this procedure if adequate funding is not available for the
next ranked property owner who would have received an offer if funds were
available.
   (E)   Ranking. The Advisory Board shall establish a ranking system for the
installment purchase program which shall at a minimum consider soil
productivity, development threats and pressures, contribution to a mass of
preserved land and good soil conservation practices and stewardship. The
ranking system shall be forwarded to the County Executive for approval. The
Frederick County agricultural land preservation installment purchase program
ranking system may be amended or revised from time to time.
   (F)   Valuation of the easement.
      (1)   The base value for acquisition of development rights under the
installment purchase program shall be established by the county governing body
in a separate resolution. Additional value above the base value will accrue for
qualifying properties in accordance with the approved ranking system. The total
value of an easement will be determined by the county governing body after a
recommendation by the Advisory Board.
      (2)   A property which has no further subdivision rights under the
provisions of the Frederick County Zoning Ordinance as of September 26, 2006
may be eligible for the purchase of an easement at the base value, with no
additional value accrued through the ranking system, but only where such
property:
         (a)   Is located within 2,000 feet of a growth area as designated on a
region plan; or
         (b)   Adjoins another parcel of land containing at least 50 acres
which is subject to an agricultural conservation easement or other conservation
easement; provided that any such agricultural or other conservation easement
must preclude further subdivision of such property.
   (G)   Method of payment.
      (1)   The landowner and county shall enter into an installment purchase
agreement (I.P.A.). The agreement shall state the total amount of money that
the county has agreed to pay the landowner and set the terms of the sale,
including the interest rate. The installment purchase agreement shall be for a
term of not less than 10 nor more than 20 years with interest being paid
annually. At the end of the term the landowner will receive a lump sum payment
constituting the principal. This agreement is exempt from the provisions of Md.
Ann. Code, Local Government Article §§ 19-205 and 19-206.
      (2)   Although preference is given to installment purchase easement
acquisitions, a landowner may request that development rights be purchased in
lump sum. Upon a recommendation of the Advisory Board and the Frederick County
Department of Finance, the County Executive may approve a lump sum payment.
   (H)   Recording of the easement. A deed of easement, restricting, in
perpetuity, future development on the property, shall be recorded in the
Frederick County land records. The form of the deed of easement shall be
approved by the County Executive upon a recommendation of the Frederick County
agricultural preservation Advisory Board and the office of the Frederick County
Attorney.
   (I)   Agricultural preservation easement.
      (1)   Upon establishment of an agricultural preservation easement, a
landowner agrees to the following conditions:
         (a)   To maintain the land in agricultural use or properly managed so
that it is available for continued agricultural use from the date that the
easement is recorded in the land records of Frederick County;
         (b)   To implement and maintain a soil and water conservation plan as
prepared by the Soil Conservation District. Such plan shall be kept on file in
the offices of the Department and the district office of the Soil Conservation
Service;
         (c)   That the easement agreement creates an encumbrance upon the land
and binds future owners, heirs, successors or assigns and precludes the
subdivision and utilization of the land principally for uses such as
residential, institutional, commercial or industrial except as contained within
this ordinance or the deed of easement approved by the county. Any agricultural
uses currently permitted would be allowed to continue under this agreement. The
easement agreement shall not provide for public access to any privately owned
land. Purchase of an easement by the county does not create a right of public
access to the land.
      (2)   In addition to any other requirements, the construction of new
buildings or structures on the land, other than farm buildings, is contingent
upon the written application to and approval by the Department, subject to
review by, and recommendation of, the Frederick County Agricultural Advisory
Board.
   (J)   Additions to existing easements.
      (1)   The process for adding land to existing easements shall be the same
as for the initial establishment of an easement. The Advisory Board may
establish a minimum size criterion for the addition of land contiguous to an
existing easement.
      (2)   The landowner of record at the time of easement sale may, at any
time after easement sale, request a tenant home in accordance with conditions
established within the Frederick County Zoning Ordinance for tenants actively
engaged in the farming operation. This request shall be submitted to the
Department for approval, subject to the review and recommendation of the
Frederick County Agricultural Advisory Board.
      (3)   Subject to the succeeding paragraph, a landowner who sells an
easement through the installment purchase program may request a 2 acre lot
exclusion for the exclusive residential use of the owner and each of the
children of the owner as long as the original owner continues to own the land.
This right shall not convey to subsequent landowners.
      (4)   The total number of lot exclusions for the owner and children may
not exceed 1 dwelling unit per 50 acres with a maximum lot size of 2 acres. A
landowner may elect to relinquish the ability to exclude all children’s/owner’s
lots for the right to exclude 1 lot which may be conveyed to persons not an
owner or child of the owner. The maximum 2 acre lot shall include all county
right-of-way requirements. In addition, any landowner of an easement requesting
a lot exclusion shall be required to repay the county for that lot. This
repayment shall be equal to the amount paid per acre by the county to the
landowner plus a pro rata portion of interest previously paid to the landowner
by the county under the installment agreement.
   (K)   Uses of land under agricultural preservation easement.
      (1)   Property under agricultural preservation easement shall be
maintained in agriculture use. A landowner may request accessory, and
compatible commercial uses to an agricultural use of the property, as permitted
under the Frederick County Zoning Ordinance, provided that such use does not
affect the agricultural integrity of the property, minimizes the use of
productive agricultural land and fulfills the purpose and intent of the
agricultural preservation easement.
      (2)   Such a request shall be submitted to the Department and reviewed by
the Advisory Board who shall make specific findings in each request as to the
appropriateness of such use and the impact on the agricultural use of the
property.
      (3)   Accessory and compatible commercial uses must conform to existing
regulations and ordinances.
   (L)   (1)   The county may enter into installment agreements with landowners
to acquire development rights under other state and local land preservation
programs upon compliance with the criteria and procedures of those programs.
      (2)   Installment agreements under other land preservation programs are
not required to comply with the criteria and procedures of the installment
purchase program.

§ 1-14-98. CIVIL PLUMBING INFRACTIONS.
   (A)   Pursuant to §
2-2-29 of the Frederick County Code, any violation of any of the provisions of
this entire chapter, which is
Chapter 1-14 entitled "Plumbing," is a civil plumbing infraction. If, after
investigation, a civil plumbing infraction is believed to exist, the Frederick
County administrative authority or authorized agent shall deliver a citation or
warning to the property owner or any others responsible for the civil plumbing
infraction. If the administrative authority or authorized agent is unable to
locate the owner or other responsible party, the administrative authority or
authorized agent may post the citation or warning in a conspicuous place on the
property and mail a copy of same to the owner or other responsible person,
which shall be sufficient for delivery of the warning or citation under this
section.
   (B)   The citation or warning, as provided for in this section, shall be in
writing and shall contain the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the person charged or warned;
      (2)   The nature of the violation;
      (3)   The location of the violation;
      (4)   The date(s) of the violation;

      (8)   A certification by the administrative authority or authorized agent
attesting to the truth of the matters set forth.
   (C)   Whenever an alleged or possible civil infraction comes to the
attention of the administrative authority, the following procedures shall
apply:
      (1)   The administrative authority or authorized agent will investigate
whether a violation has occurred;
      (2)   If the administrative authority finds that a violation has
occurred, a warning will be issued to the person(s) responsible in the form and
manner as outlined in this section, with reasonable time stated to abate or to
prevent future infractions;
      (3)   If the violation continues or is allowed to occur after the
reasonable time stated, the administrative authority or authorized agent will
issue a citation to the person(s) responsible in the form and manner as
outlined in this section. Notwithstanding the provision of step (2) above, the
administrative authority or authorized agent may issue a citation at step (2)
without the prior issuance of a warning.
   (D)   A fine of $200 shall be imposed upon any person responsible for each
civil plumbing infraction. Each day that a violation exists shall be considered
a separate civil plumbing infraction. All fines shall be payable to the
Treasurer of Frederick County, Maryland, in the Office of the Department of
Permits and Inspections.
   (E)   A person who receives a citation may elect to stand trial for the
civil plumbing infraction by filing with the administrative authority a notice
of intention to stand trial. The notice shall be delivered to the
administrative authority at least 10 days before the due date for payment of
the fines as set forth in the citation. Upon receipt of the notice of intention
to stand trial, the administrative authority or authorized agent shall forward
to the District Court of Frederick County, Maryland, a copy of the citation and
the notice of intention to stand trial. Upon receipt of the citation, the
District Court shall schedule the case for trial and notify the defendant of
the trial date. All fines, penalties, or forfeitures collected by the District
Court for any civil plumbing infraction shall be remitted to the Treasurer of
Frederick County, Maryland.
   (F)   If a person who receives a citation for a civil plumbing infraction
fails to pay the fine by the payment date set forth on the citation and fails
to file a notice of intention to stand trial at least 10 days prior to the
payment date, a formal notice of the civil plumbing infraction shall be sent to
the person's last known address. If the citation is not satisfied within 15
days from the date specified on the notice, the person shall be liable for a
fine of $400 for each civil plumbing infraction. If the citation is not
satisfied within 35 days of the date specified on the formal notice, the
administrative authority may request adjudication of the case through the
District Court by following appropriate civil procedures.
   (G)   Adjudication of a civil plumbing infraction under this subsection is
not a criminal conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities
ordinarily imposed by a criminal conviction.
   (H)   In a proceeding before the District Court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Code, Local Government Article, Title 6. However, the County
Attorney is hereby authorized to prosecute all civil plumbing infractions under
this section.
   (I)   If a person is found by the District Court to have committed a civil
plumbing infraction, that person shall be liable for the costs of the
proceedings in the District Court.
   (J)   Depending on the circumstances of each case and after consultation
with the County Attorney, the administrative authority or authorized agent has
the discretionary authority to reduce or suspend all or a portion of the fine
payable through the Permits and Inspections Office.
   (K)   Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or prevent the
administrative authority or authorized agent from seeking other legal remedies,
such as injunctions or criminal prosecution.
   (L)   Provisions of this section are in addition to, not in lieu of, those
penalties specified in other sections of this chapter.
   (M)   The fines specified in this section may be modified at any time by
resolution of the county governing body.

   Any person, whether individually or as a member or employee of a
partnership, or an officer, agent or employee of a corporation, who directs or
knowingly permits any violation of any of the provisions of this chapter, or
any rule or regulation duly promulgated hereunder, or who aids or assists

fine by the date of payment set forth on the citation and fails to file a
notice of intention to stand trial, a formal notice of the infraction shall be
mailed to the owner of the motor vehicle at his or her address. If the citation
is not satisfied within 15 days from the date of the notice, the person is
liable for a fine of $50 for each infraction. If, after 35 days, the citation
is not satisfied, the Director may request adjudication of the case through the
district court. The district court shall schedule the case for trial and summon
the defendant to appear.

conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed
by a criminal conviction.
   (I)   In a proceeding before the district court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Ann. Code, Local Government Article, Title 6. However, the

§ 1-15.2-1.0. PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain, and enhance the
public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements
and procedures that control the adverse impacts associated with increased
stormwater runoff. The goal is to manage stormwater by using environmental site
design (ESD) to the maximum extent practicable (MEP) to maintain after
development as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff characteristics,
and to reduce stream channel erosion, pollution, siltation and sedimentation,
and local flooding, and to use appropriate structural best management practices
(BMPs) only when necessary. This will restore, enhance, and maintain the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of streams, minimize damage to
public and private property, and reduce the impacts of land development.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter, pursuant to the Md. Code Ann.,
Environment Article, Title 4, Subtitle 2, 2009 replacement volume, are adopted
by the county and shall apply to all development occurring within the
unincorporated areas of Frederick County and may apply to the incorporated
areas within the geographical limits of Frederick County, if the municipal
government adopts these regulations and enters into an enforcement agreement
with the county. The application of this chapter and provisions expressed
herein shall be the minimum stormwater management requirements and shall not be
deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute. The
Frederick County Community Development Division (the "Division") shall be
responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter.

after investigation a civil infraction is believed to exist, the Director shall
deliver a citation or a warning to the property owner and any other person or
persons responsible for the infraction. If the person responsible for the
infraction cannot be located, the Director may post the citation or warning in
a conspicuous place on the property and shall mail a copy of same by registered
mail to the person who obtained the permit, if any, and to the property owner,
which shall constitute notice sufficient for delivery under this section.
   (B)   The citation or warning, as provided for in this section, shall be in
writing and shall contain the following:
      (1)   The name and address of the person charged (or warned);
      (2)   The nature of the violation;
      (3)   The location of the violation;
      (4)   The date(s) of the violation;
      (5)   The amount of the fine assessed (or possible assessment);
      (6)   The manner, location and time in which the fine may be paid (or
violation corrected, if applicable);

applicable); and
      (8)   A certification by the Director or his or her agent attesting to
the truth of the matters set forth.
   (C)   Whenever an alleged or possible civil infraction comes to the
attention of the Director, the procedure will be as follows:
      (1)   The Director will investigate whether an infraction has occurred;
      (2)   If the Director determines that an infraction has occurred, a
warning notice will be issued to the person or persons responsible in the form
and manner as outlined in this section, with a time period of no more than 10
days within which to correct that infraction and to prevent further
infractions;
      (3)   If the infraction continues or is allowed to occur after the time
stated in the warning notice, the Director will issue a citation to the person
or persons responsible and/or the property owner in the form and manner as
outlined in this section.
      (4)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (C)(2) above, the
Director may issue a citation without the prior issuance of a warning notice.
   (D)   A fine of $1,000 shall be imposed upon any person responsible for a
civil infraction for each violation. Each day such violation is permitted to
exist shall be considered a separate infraction. All fines shall be payable
within 20 days to the county and delivered to the Division, which shall remit
same to the County Treasurer.
   (E)   A person who receives a citation may elect to stand trial for the
offense by filing with the Director a notice of intention to stand trial. The
notice shall be given at least 5 days before the date of payment as set forth
in the citation. Upon receipt of the notice of intention to stand trial, the
Director shall forward to the District Court of Maryland for Frederick County a
copy of the citation and the notice of intention to stand trial. Upon receipt
of the citation, the District Court shall schedule the case for trial and
notify the defendant of the trial date. All fines, penalties, or forfeitures
collected by the District Court for civil infractions shall be remitted to the
county, through the County Treasurer.
   (F)   If a person who receives a citation for an infraction fails to pay the
fine by the date of payment set forth on the citation and fails to file a
notice of intention to stand trial, the fine shall be doubled and the person is
liable for the assessed fine. The Director may request adjudication of the case
by the District Court, including the filing of a demand for judgment on
affidavit. The District Court shall schedule the case for trial and summon the
defendant to appear. The defendant's failure to appear to such summons shall
result in the entry of judgment against the defendant in favor of the county in
the amount then due if a proper demand for judgment on affidavit has been made.
   (G)   Adjudication of an infraction under this section is not a criminal
conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed
by a criminal conviction.
   (H)   In a proceeding before the District Court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Ann. Code, Local Government Article, Title 6.
   (I)   If a person is found by the District Court to have committed a civil
infraction, the person shall be liable for the costs of the proceedings in the
District Court; and the Court may permit the county to abate any such condition
at the person's expense, the same as provided in Md. Ann. Code, Local
Government Article, Title 6.
   (J)   Depending on the circumstances of each case and after consultation
with the Office of the County Attorney, the Director has the discretionary
authority to reduce or suspend all or a portion of the fine assessed under this
article.
   (K)   Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or prevent the
Director or Frederick County from seeking other legal remedies, such as
injunctions or criminal prosecution.

fine of not more than $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding 1 year or both for
each violation with costs imposed in the discretion of the court and not to
exceed $50,000. Each day that a violation continues shall be a separate

the county becomes aware of a discharge that enters, or is capable of imminent
discharge to, or to be discharged from, an MS4 or a waterbody within the
county, that may be or include prohibited material, or is the result of an
illicit discharge or an illicit connection, the Manager may seek access to any
premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of inspecting for a violation
of this article.
   (B)   Consent. The Manager may enter private property to inspect for a
violation of this article with the consent of the occupant or owner. If entry
is refused, the Manager may request that the County Attorney seek a court order
to permit entry to the property.
   (C)   Investigations. The Manager may inspect, sample, examine, and
investigate the source, location, and extent of any spill, discharge, the
existence of any illicit connection, the existence of any prohibited material,
or the condition of any BMPs. In support of any investigation under this
article, the Manager may review and copy any records that will assist in

§ 1-15.2-12.3. PREVENTION AND CONTROL OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES, PROHIBITED
MATERIALS, AND ILLICIT CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   Prevention. The owner, tenant, licensee, or any other person who
occupies any premises shall prevent entry into an MS4 of any spills, materials
from an illicit connection, any prohibited material, or illicit discharges
through the use of BMPs or other appropriate measures as directed by the
Manager. In the case of an illicit connection, the owner of the premises shall
disconnect the illicit connection in a manner as directed by the Manager.
   (B)   Control measures. If the Manager determines, after an initial
inspection, that the spill, prohibited material, material from an illicit
connection, or illicit discharge has entered an MS4, the Manager may require
the owner or other responsible person to take steps to abate and mitigate the
material or discharge, including but not limited to: (1) disconnection and
redirection, if necessary, to an approved onsite wastewater management system
or to the public sanitary sewer upon approval of the Frederick County Division
of Utilities and Solid Waste Management or, if applicable, the municipality
that owns and operates the public sewer system; (2) delineation and containment
of the discharge; (3) recovery and proper disposal of the pollutant or
prohibited materials and any impacted media; and (4) restoration of the area of
the discharge to pre- discharge conditions to the county's satisfaction. The

discharge, illicit connection, or prohibited material shall be required to
implement, at the owner's or responsible person's expense, additional BMPs to
prevent the further discharge or introduction of any prohibited material,
illicit discharge, or spilled material from entering into an MS4. Compliance
with the terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge
constitutes compliance with this subsection.
   (D)   Monitoring. The Manager may require a person responsible for a spill,
illicit connection, or illicit discharge to install monitoring equipment if the
nature of the discharge warrants such installation. The sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be calibrated to ensure accuracy and maintained in safe and
proper operating condition at the responsible person's expense.
   (E)   Abatement. If the owner or any person responsible for the spill,
illicit connection, or illicit discharge refuses to follow the required cleanup
and mitigation measures, the county may enter the property and make the
required repairs. The Manager may request that the County Attorney seek a court
order assessing the costs of the abatement against the owner or any other
person that causes or permits a spill, an illicit discharge, illicit
connection, or that has or maintains a prohibited material.
   (F)   Costs. All mitigation and remediation measures under this article
shall be completed at the owner's or responsible person's sole cost and
expense.

regulations. The county’s highways and streets are classified according to the
Comprehensive Plan (highway section) into 1 of the following.
         (a)   RESIDENTIAL LOCAL ACCESS STREET. This is the lowest order street
in the hierarchy. It is intended to carry the least amount of traffic at the
lowest speed and provide the safest and most desirable environment for a
residential neighborhood. Developments shall be designed so that the maximum
number possible of homes will front on this classification of streets.
         (b)   RESIDENTIAL SUBCOLLECTOR STREET.. This is the middle order
street in the residential hierarchy. It will carry more traffic than the
residential access street, have lot access and provide for through traffic and
on-street parking. It shall provide an acceptable if not an optimum environment
for a residential neighborhood.
         (c)   RESIDENTIAL COLLECTOR STREET. This is the highest order street
that could be classed as residential. It will carry the largest volume of
traffic at higher speeds. In large residential developments, this class of
street may be necessary to carry traffic from one neighborhood to another or
from the neighborhood to streets connecting to other areas in the community.
This level of street is unsuitable for providing direct access to homes and
such access shall be avoided.
         (d)   SPECIAL PURPOSE STREETS (RESIDENTIAL). Under special
circumstances, a new residential street may be classified and defined as 1 of
the following.
            1.   ALLEY. A special type of street which provides a limited
(i.e., access to parking or trash collection, cut-through) secondary means of
access to lots. It will normally be on the same level in the hierarchy as a
residential access street, although different design standards will apply.
Refer to § 1.01.12 of the Design Manual.
            2.   MARGINAL ACCESS STREET. A marginal access street is a street
parallel and adjacent to a collector or higher level street which provides
access to abutting properties and separation from through traffic. It may be
designed at the level of a residential access street or a residential
subcollector as anticipated traffic volumes will dictate.
            3.   MEDIAN DIVIDED STREETS. For the purpose of protecting
environment and aesthetic features or avoiding excessive grading, or to provide
tow points of ingress/egress in case of long cul-de-sac, the county may require
that the street be divided. In such a case, the Design Standards shall be
applied to the aggregate dimensions of the 2 street segments.
         (e)   NONRESIDENTIAL STREETS.
            1.   COLLECTORS. Primarily provide intra-county access. They are
spaced to connect residential and employment populations with like generators.
The rural collectors provided service to the scattered smaller communities and
the commercial and industrial collectors accumulate traffic from local urban
streets.
            2.   ARTERIALS. Provide the primary access to the expressway system
and supplement the system by providing inter- and intra-county access through
the more rural areas. Efficient movement is the primary function of arterial
roads; hence, private access and frontage shall be controlled and limited to
high volume generators of vehicle trips.
            3.   FREEWAYS AND EXPRESSWAYS. Limited access interregional
arterial routes (“superhighways”). They are designed exclusively for
unrestricted movement, have no private access and intersect only with selected
arterial highways or major streets by means of interchanges engineered for
free-flowing movement.
         (f)   EXISTING STREETS. Each street abutting or affecting the design
of a subdivision or land development which is not already classified in the
Comprehensive Plan shall be classified to its function,  design and use by the
county at the request of the applicant or during plan review. The
classification of existing streets shall include the hierarchy noted above or
classification of higher order as determined by the county.
      STRUCTURE. Any man-made object having an ascertainable stationary
location on or in land or water, whether or not affixed to the land.
      SUBDIVIDER. See DEVELOPER.
      SUBDIVISION. The division of a lot, tract or parcel of land into 2 or
more lots, plats, sites or other divisions of land for the purpose, whether
immediate or future, of transfer of ownership or for building development. It
includes resubdivision and, when appropriate to the context, relates to the
process of resubdividing or to the land or territory subdivided.
      SURVEY. The process of conducting research, performing field measurements
and observations, and applying mathematical principles to determine or obtain
the data necessary to record, display or indicate, or all of these, land
boundaries, land areas, and the position and characteristics of any natural or
artificial, or both, features on or near the surface of the earth.
      SURVEYOR. A professional land surveyor, a licensed property line
surveyor, or an individual otherwise authorized to practice professional land
surveying or property line surveying as stated in Md. Code Ann., Business
Occupations and Professions Article, Title 15.
      SURVEY PLAT. A drawing prepared at an appropriate scale to show the
results of the findings and conclusions of a survey. A survey plat must be
based on a boundary survey and show accurately to scale the results of the
field survey and office computations which will portray the size and shape of a
certain parcel of land.
      TECHNICAL ADVISORY COMMITTEE. A group composed of county staff members,
and, where appropriate, staff members of the State Highway Administration,
County Health Department, County Soil Conservation District and any other
department or agency concerned with development. See §
1-16-27.
      TRAVELWAY. The vehicle-traveled portion of any road surface, exclusive of
the immediately adjacent drainage ditches, embankments, or grass shoulders not
typically intended to handle daily traffic. Improved shoulders (gravel,
stabilized, or paved) capable of handling occasional traffic or parking can be
considered part of the travelway.
      WALKWAY. As distinguished from a sidewalk and a crosswalk which are
incorporated in a street right-of-way, a WALKWAY is a pedestrian right-of-way
usually extending from a street into a block or across a block to another
street.
      WET SOILS. Soils set forth in the “Soils Interpretation and Water
Features Report” as extracted from the Frederick County, Maryland Soils Survey
Supplement Text and Tables published by the Catoctin and Frederick Soil
Conservation Districts (issued in 2001 or as amended).
      YARD. An area on the same lot with a building or group of buildings,
lying between the building, or outer building of a group, and the nearest lot
or street line, and unoccupied and unobstructed from the ground upward, except
as provided for in
Chapter 1-19 of this Code.

            5.   A certification and dedication by the owner or owners of the
property to the effect that the lot created by public taking as shown on plat
is made with the owner's consent and that the owner desires to record the plat.
         (c)   An agriculturally zoned lot of record created by a public taking
plat shall be considered an original agricultural tract as defined in this
chapter and in §
1-19-7.300 of the zoning ordinance. Any lots created since August 18, 1976
shall be counted against the number of lots that may be subdivided from an
original agricultural tract.
         (d)   Where a property has been the subject of a previously recorded
subdivision plat(s), a lot of record created by public taking may be permitted
if:
            1.   The owner provides the same full road right-of-way dedication
that could have been provided with the previously recorded subdivision plat(s);
and,
            2.   The previously recorded subdivision plat(s) did not create a
new lot that is situated on both sides of the public road.
         (e)   When determining whether a proposed subdivision of a lot created
by public taking is a major or minor subdivision, all subdivision activity that
has occurred since April 6, 1965 on the side of the road where the subdivision
is proposed shall be counted.
         (f)   An unrecorded public taking plat shall become void 3 years after
the application date.
         (g)   When a previously recorded public taking plat must be corrected,
the correction plat requirements and procedures shall be followed.
      (3)   Utility right-of-way. A bona fide division of a tract of land in
order that 1 or more of the resulting parcels may be used as part of an
electric transmission line of right-of-way or other public utility right-of-
way; provided, that if a parcel resulting from such division is ever to be used
for any purpose other than an electric transmission line or other public right-
of-way, then before a building or grading permit may be issued for such other
use, a plat must be filed in accord with this chapter and recorded.
      (4)   Farm lots. If land zoned agricultural or resource conservation is
subdivided in order to transfer land for continuing existing farm activities,
including plowing, tillage, cropping, seeding, cultivating, and harvesting for
production of food and fiber products (except commercial logging and timber
harvesting operations), the grazing and raising of livestock, aquaculture, sod
production, orchards, and other cultivated products, then the general
requirements for subdivision platting shall not be required provided that the
following provisions are met:
         (a)   The proposed farm lot must be at least 25 acres in size and have
fee-simple road frontage.
         (b)   Farm lots shall not be approved if the proposed lots include
existing or proposed sewage disposal systems, potable water systems, or
residential or commercial structures.
         (c)   A farm lot shall not be approved unless the majority of the
proposed lot is unforested and is suitable for farming.
         (d)   Farm lots shall comply with the requirements of the forest
resource ordinance (
Chapter 1-21) prior to lot recordation.
         (e)   A survey plat must be submitted to the Division to establish the
farm lot. The plat shall provide all of the applicable information required for
final plats under §
1-16-88, with the following additions:
            1.   A note shall be placed on the plat stating: the farm lot(s)
shown on this plat (is/are) being created for the sole purpose of transfer for
use as a farm and not for development; such land to be used for crops, pasture,
or other pursuits normally associated with farming. Any future development of
this land, including installation of a sewage disposal system, installation of
a potable water system, application for a residential or nonresidential
building permit, or resubdivision shall require the owner to file an
application for subdivision in accordance with this chapter, and the owner
shall comply with all other applicable state and county laws and regulations.
Approval of farm lots does not guarantee the future approval of a buildable
lot.
            2.   A note to the clerk of the court, stating the plat complies
with §
1-16-5 of the subdivision regulations, must be signed by the Director.
         (f)   Whenever land which is being subdivided for use as a farm
includes or abuts streets designated on the County Comprehensive Plan, the
division shall require, by dedication to public use, adequate right of way, as
described in §
1-16-235 of this chapter.
         (g)   The platting of the remainder parcel shall comply with §
1-16-8(D).
         (h)   If development is ever proposed on a recorded farm lot, the farm
lot must be replatted as a buildable lot in accordance with this chapter. All
subdivision requirements, including road frontage improvements, road adequacy
requirements, and driveway location requirements must be met. All other
applicable county codes, including the adequate public facilities ordinance and
forest resource ordinance must also be complied with.
         (i)   A farm lot plat application shall be valid for 5 years. If the
plat is not recorded within this timeframe, the application will become void.

§ 1-16-6. CORRECTION PLATS.
   (A)   Whenever a change is to be made to a previously recorded plat, a
correction plat may be used as long as no additional lots are created. The
corrected plat shall make reference to the recording reference of the original
plat, shall be filed in accordance with the requirements for the platting and
recording of a subdivision, shall be reviewed by those agencies normally
approving final plats, and shall be recorded by the Division. In the case of a
correction plat the county’s requirement of setting 4 monuments as stated in §
1-16-108 of these regulations will not be required if the proposed plat is in
compliance with the requirements of Md. Code Ann., Real Property Book, Title 3,
Subtitle 1, § 3-108, and as enacted or amended so far as it may concern the
setting of monuments and markers.
   (B)   Correction plats shall not be used to nullify a previously recorded
plat unless:
      (1)   A single owner holds current legal title to the affected property
(ies), and
      (2)   The proposed correction will not violate this chapter,
Chapter 1-19, or any Board of Appeals or Planning Commission decisions related
to the property(ies).
   (C)   Correction plats shall include all of the information shown on the
original plat and shall include a note declaring the purpose of the correction
plat.
   (D)   When revisions to a previously approved septic area are proposed, the
note shall state: “The purpose of this plat is to revise a septic system
easement area. The revised septic system easement area as shown is approved for
on-site sewage disposal.”
   (E)   When the correction plat abandons an existing recorded septic system
easement area, the following note shall be added to the correction plat: “The
purpose of this plat is to abandon the existing sewage disposal area as shown.
This parcel may not be considered for development until such a time as either
the parcel can be served by a community sewage disposal system or evaluation of
the parcel demonstrates that the parcel meets the provisions set forth in the
Code of Maryland Regulations 26.04.02 and 26.04.03, in place at the time the
proposal is submitted. Furthermore, development must be consistent with
applicable state and county codes.”
   (F)   An unrecorded correction plat shall become void 3 years after the
application date.

§ 1-16-7. ADDITIONS TO LOTS.
   (A)   Types of plats.
      (1)   When the owner of a lot or parcel wishes to add additional land to
a lot or parcel, an addition plat must be filed.
      (2)   When 2 or more lots in the same ownership are effectively utilized
so as to virtually eliminate the interior lot lines, such as by the
construction of a permanent structure across lot lines, an addition plat
combining the affected lots, or the affected portions of said lots or property
thereof, into 1 or more property/lot(s) will be required, with the result being
to bring the affected property/lot(s) into conformance with applicable county
regulations.
      (3)   When an addition of land to a lot of record is required in order to
create a buildable lot, a combined preliminary/final subdivision plat and
addition plat must be filed. The applications shall meet all of the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   General requirements of addition plats.
      (1)   An addition plat shall not be approved if it results in the
creation of any lot (or remainder parcel) less than the minimum lot size
required for its zoning district, or results in the creation of any lot (or
remainder parcel) which would be in violation of any other applicable zoning or
health regulations.
      (2)   All resulting lots and any remaining parcels created by an addition
plat shall conform to all existing zoning regulations, with the exception of
preexisting, nonconforming zoning conditions.
      (3)   When an addition parcel adjoins a public road, a right-of-way
dedication must be provided along the addition portion. Road improvements by
the owner will not be required, unless required by the Planning Commission. In
the case of a combined preliminary/final subdivision plat and addition plat,
dedication must be provided along the entire frontage of the new buildable lot,
and road improvements may also be required.
      (4)   Building on addition parcels is permitted; however, building on
addition parcels in agriculturally zoned land must satisfy the criteria in
subsection (5) below;
      (5)   On agriculturally zoned land, no principal dwelling may be built on
the addition parcel unless the criteria set forth in subsection (a) or (b)
below have been met.
         (a)   A principal dwelling may be constructed on the addition parcel
only if the original parcel met the minimum lot size requirements and:
            1.   A house, well, and septic area meeting all applicable
regulations could potentially be located on the original parcel;
            2.   An improvement in lot layout results;
            3.   All other zoning/subdivision requirements have been met; or
         (b)   An addition parcel of 2 acres or less containing an existing
principal dwelling structure may be added to a lot. Other required
improvements, such as septic and wells, may be located on the addition portion.
         (c)   Any modifications to these requirements will require Frederick
County Planning Commission’s approval.
      (6)   Additions shall not be made to agriculturally zoned parcels in
order to create development potential on original parcels which have
floodplain, failed septic percolation test results, size or configuration
limitations, or other features which limit the original parcel's development
potential as determined by the Planning Commission.
      (7)   Accessory structures, including garages, barns, or tenant houses
are allowed on the addition parcel. However, in the agricultural zoning
district, the number of permitted tenant houses will be based on the size of
the lot of record prior to any additions of land from property that is not a
part of the original agricultural tract.
      (8)   Additions shall not be permitted in cluster development so as to
increase individual or average lot sizes above those permitted in the zoning
ordinance or by the approved cluster plan.
   (C)   Methods of recordation.
      (1)   The Director, or a designated staff person, shall be empowered to
approve addition plats and such approval shall be noted on the plat.
      (2)   The approved addition plat shall be recorded with the clerk of the
circuit court of the county.
         (c)   Any modifications to these requirements will require Frederick
County Planning Commission’s approval.
   (D)   Required information. When filing an addition plat, the following
information must be provided:
      (1)   A boundary survey for the land to be added must be provided at the
following scales:
         (a)   For resulting lots less than 3.01 acres, no smaller than 1” =
100’;
         (b)   For resulting lots equal to or greater than 3.01 acres, no
smaller than 1” = 200’.
      (2)   The lot or parcel to which the addition is to be added shall be
shown at the above mentioned scales. If the required information will not fit
on the plat page, the following scales shall be used:
         (a)   For parcels under 25.01 acres, 1” = 200’;
         (b)   For parcels equal to or greater than 25.01 acres, 1” = 400’.
      (3)   For the lot or parcel from which the addition parcel is to be
removed, the following information is required.
         (a)   If less than 5.01 acres remains:
            1.   If the land is unimproved, the original lot or parcel shall be
shown at the scale listed under subsection (2) above, and a note shall be
placed on the plat stating that the remainder is not an approved building lot
until such time as the Health Department approves water and sewer services and/
or proper water and/or sewer classification is obtained for property which will
be served by public water and/or sewer.
            2.   If the land is improved land, the lot or parcel shall be shown
at the scale listed under subsection (2) above. Structures, well and septic
locations and/or proper water and sewer appurtenances shall be shown if they
are visible from above ground or if shown in Health Department records;
         (b)   If 5.01 acres or greater remain, platting of the remaining lot
or parcel is not required, although the vicinity map shall be used to
illustrate the remaining lands. House, well and septic locations shall be shown
if they are within 100 feet of the addition line, and if they are visible or
shown in Health Department records.
      (4)   Vicinity map indicating the location of the property with respect
to surrounding property and streets at a scale no smaller than 1” = 2,000’. Tax
map page and parcel number shall also be shown.
      (5)   The owners’ names and liber and folio deed references for all
adjoining property. In the event that a recorded subdivision adjoins the land,
the subdivision name, lot number, block number and recording reference shall be
indicated. (All this information shall be shown with dashed lines.)
      (6)   North arrow and a statement indicating the origin and method of
determination of the bearings or coordinate system shall be made on the plat.

surveyor. The surveyor must be licensed in the state.
      (9)   A surveyor’s certificate stating how, when, and from whom the
present owner(s) obtained the land and that the plat as shown is correct. The
Division shall specify the exact wording to be used.
      (10)   A certification and dedication by the owner(s) of the property and
all those having an interest in the affected property, to the effect that the
subdivision as shown on the addition plat is made with the owner’s consent, and
that the owner desires to record the plat. The Division shall specify the exact
wording to be used.
      (11)   The owner’s certification and dedication must be notarized in
accordance with applicable law.
      (12)   If a road dedication is required, drafting information for
dedicated areas as described in §
1-16-88.
      (13)   The following note shall be added to the plat:
      “Application is hereby made for your approval of the indicated transfer
of land solely for the purpose of adding to adjoining holdings and not for
development. Any future subdivision or development of this land will be
submitted in the regular manner for approval in accordance with all applicable
regulations.”

      (19)   When an addition is made to a lot of record in order to provide a
means of fee-simple road frontage (such as when a panhandle is added to a
landlocked parcel), or when an addition of land results in a significant
decrease of fee-simple road frontage (such as when an addition creates a
panhandle), it must be demonstrated that: (a) adequate sight distances exist at
the potential future driveway entrance location; or (b) no alternative driveway
entrance location can be provided.

§ 1-16-8. MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   The Director may approve minor subdivisions of land and/or minor
adjustments in lot lines without the necessity of the subdivider following the
separate preliminary plan procedures under this chapter, subject to the
requirements listed in subsection (B) below.
   (B)   A property owner may apply to the Division for approval of up to 5
lots by submitting a combined preliminary/final plat; provided that the
proposed subdivision does not involve a proposed new street or highway, does
not propose or require a public water or sewer reclassification, and the
property does not lie within any proposed park or recreation area. The combined
preliminary/final plat application shall be submitted on forms provided and
fees shall be paid as required under §
1-16-46 of this Code. The combined preliminary/final plat shall follow all
requirements of a normal preliminary plan and final plat as specified in this
chapter. The combined preliminary/final plat shall also contain the following
information.
      (1)   Topographic information according to the following:
         (a)   Existing topography at 2 or 5 foot contour intervals. Elevations
shall be based on government bench marks when available within 1,000 feet of
property or if greater than 1,000 feet then by estimation from U.S. Geological
Survey (USGS) quadrangle maps. Datum shall be stated in all cases together with
elevation. Source of contours shall be stated on the plat, such as field run
topo, or aerial topo, and the date thereof. Interpolation contours from USGS
quadrangle maps will not be accepted.
         (b)   On residential lots of less than 2 acres with new features,
contour lines shall be indicated 25 feet beyond lot lines.
         (c)   On residential lots of 2 or more acres with new features,
topography shall be shown for the proposed developmental area of the lot and
100 feet beyond the house site, septic area, well, driveway, entrance, and
panhandle of the lot(s).
         (d)   On residential plats, where house, well, septic area, and
driveways are existing, topographic information is not required except over any
new panhandles or if requested by the Division or the Health Department.
         (e)   Plats of institutional, commercial and industrial lots shall
show full topography, extending 25 feet beyond the property line.
         (f)   On minor subdivisions or combined preliminary/final plats,
topographical information shall be provided as above, but may be deleted from
the plat prior to recording.
      (2)   All existing pertinent features either natural or manmade that may
influence the design of the subdivision, including important trees or wooded
areas, easements, power transmission towers, existing buildings and structures
and water courses.
      (3)   Location of existing utilities (including gas, water and sewer
lines and electric and telephone poles and wires) and recorded utility
easements on or within 100 feet of the tract with approximate pipe sizes and
directions of gravity flow indicated.
      (4)   Location and extent of stormwater management measures.
      (5)   Soil type(s) information shall be provided and appropriate
boundaries shown on the plat. In the event that residential structures are
proposed on or within 100 feet of “wet soils,” then a soils delineation report
prepared by a licensed soil scientist or professional engineer registered in
the State of Maryland may be required at the time of building permit
application.
      (6)   If a residential structure(s) with a basement(s) is proposed within
“wet soils,” the developer must:
         (a)   Perform 1 of the following at the time of building permit
application:
            1.   Construct a gravity drainage system in accordance with the
Frederick County Building Code (
Chapter 1-6); or
            2.   Utilize another similar solution acceptable to the Division;
or
            3.   Submit a geotechnical report by a registered professional
engineer in the State of Maryland; and
         (b)   Place a note on the plat stating that construction of a
residential structure with a basement within 100 feet of the wet soils boundary
may require a geotechnical report and gravity drainage systems (or other
similar solution acceptable to the County) at the time of building permit
application.
      (7)   The locations of existing or planned facilities shown in the
Comprehensive Plan that may be located on the subject property, including
roads, trails, transit lines, and parks.
   (C)   The Planning Commission shall require that the major subdivision
procedures be followed in the event that any subsequent or concurrently
submitted plat brings the number of lots off the original parcel to 6 or more,
except when the application proposes 5 or fewer lots and involves no new
streets or when a new public water or sewer reclassification is proposed or
required. If these requirements are met, the plat may be processed as a
combined preliminary/final plat with approval by the Planning Commission. The
subject property must be posted according to the regulations found in §
1-16-71(E) of this chapter. Percolation testing and well drilling shall not be
conducted on major subdivision applications until the lot layout is approved by
the Planning Commission.
   (D)   The Planning Commission shall require that the remainder be shown as
stated in the appropriate section below.
      (1)   If less than 5 acres of land remain in the original parcel after
the lots are excluded, then all the tract (lots and remainder) must be platted.
      (2)   If more than 5 acres of land remain in the original parcel after
the lots are excluded, then the owner is not required to plat the remaining
acreage. The owner shall provide a sketch of the tax map showing the entire
acreage and the location of the lots being platted and any previously platted
lots.
      (3)   If the remainder has no further subdivision rights the remainder
shall bear a statement to the effect that the remainder cannot be further
subdivided unless rezoned.
   (E)   The Planning Commission shall require the preliminary plan procedure
to be followed if the minor subdivision is not in the combined preliminary/
final plat form. Preliminary plans for minor subdivisions will be reviewed
within the time periods shown in §
1-16-71(B) and (C).
   (F)   A minor subdivision shall remain immune from any changes to this
chapter for 5 years from the date of the original submission of the minor
subdivision application to the Division.
   (G)   A combined preliminary/final plat application shall be valid for 5
years or the period of APFO approval, whichever is less. If the plat is not
recorded within this timeframe, the application will become void.
   (H)   If the minor subdivision application proposes the creation of more
than one new lot, it shall be the responsibility of the applicant to place a
public notice sign for all minor subdivision applications within 10 feet of
each property line that abuts a public road. If the property does not abut a
public road, a sign shall be placed in such a manner so that it may be most
readily seen by the public.
      (1)   The Division of Permitting and Development Review shall provide the
required sign(s).
      (2)   The sign(s) shall include the project name, case number, a
description of the application, staff contact information, and a final date and
time for requesting information concerning the minor subdivision.
      (3)   The sign(s) shall be placed on the property within 10 business days
after the date on which the first agency review comments are sent to the
applicant. The sign(s) shall remain on the property for at least 30 days.
Failure to post the sign(s) as required will preclude further review of the
application.
      (4)   The sign(s) shall be affixed to a rigid board and maintained at all
times by the applicant until the final date and time noted on the sign for
requesting information concerning the minor subdivision.
      (5)   The applicant shall file a notarized affidavit certifying that the
required sign(s) has been posted for the required 30 day period.
      (6)   If any person removes or tampers with a posted sign during the
posting period, that person, upon conviction, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
   (I)   Whenever a previously recorded lot or lots are being resubdivided to
create an additional lot or lots, then a plat of resubdivision shall be filed
in accordance with the requirements under this chapter. The plat shall be
approved by those agencies normally approving preliminary plans and final plats
and recorded by the Division, together with a notation on the plat, which shall
make reference to the plat book and page number of the original plat. Changes
occurring as a result of highway, road, or street improvements which require
additional right-of-way shall not require a resubdivision plat to be recorded,
but may require approval and recording of a road dedication or road amendment
plat. Resubdivision shall not be permitted in residential cluster development
if the lot areas will be reduced below those lot areas shown on the originally
recorded final plat.

      (2)   Final plat submission shall conform to Division 4, Final Plat.
      (3)   Fees shall be paid as shown in §
1-16-46.
      (4)   Percolation testing and well drilling shall not be conducted on
major subdivision applications until the lot layout is approved by the Planning
Commission through the sketch plan or preliminary plan process.
   (C)   Whenever a previously recorded lot or lots are being resubdivided to
create 6 or more additional lots, then a preliminary plan and final plat of
resubdivision shall be filed in accordance with the requirements under this
chapter. These plans and plats shall be approved by those agencies normally
approving preliminary plans and final plats and shall be recorded by the
division, together with a notation on the plat, which shall make reference to
the plat book and page number of the original plat. Changes occurring as a
result of highway, road, or street improvements which require additional right-
of-way shall not require a resubdivision plat to be recorded, but may require
approval and recording of a road dedication or road amendment plat.
Resubdivision shall not be permitted in residential cluster development if the
lot areas will be reduced below those lot areas shown on the originally
recorded final plat.
   (D)   Subdivision applications shall be processed on a first come-first
serve basis. In the event two or more property owners submit subdivision
applications for development of portions of the same original parcel, and one
or more of the applications proposes the 6th or greater lot off the original
parcel, the determination of which application is a minor subdivision and which
application is a major subdivision will be based on the date and time the
initial complete application is submitted. In the event the plat reviewed as a
minor subdivision becomes void, the voided plat may lose its minor subdivision
status and the later submitted plat may then qualify as a minor subdivision.

§ 1-16-12. PUBLIC FACILITIES.
   (A)   All subdivisions shall be subject to rules, regulations and
restrictions set forth in the Frederick County Adequate Public Facilities
Ordinance (APFO),
Chapter 1-20. In addition, the Planning Commission may disapprove any
subdivision of land if it is found that any 1 of the following public
facilities are not adequately provided to the proposed subdivision.
   (B)   Road adequacy. The proposed subdivision must have access to 1 or more
paved collector or higher classification road(s) either directly, or via
continuous and adequate public roads, in the direction(s) determined by the
Planning Commission. The road(s) which provide the most direct access route to
the proposed subdivision for the closest emergency response service must also
be adequate. The Planning Commission may use maps, the opinions of county
staff, and site inspection to determine if the access routes to the proposed
subdivision are adequate. The Planning Commission will consider the Frederick
County Roads and Streets Design Manual and Division and county policies to
determine:
      (1)   The adequacy of sight distances, both vertical and horizontal;
      (2)   Whether the vertical road alignment meets the safety standards of
the County Design Manual; and
      (3)   Minimum roadway widths and surfaces, in accordance with the
following requirements:
         (a)   For minor subdivisions.
            1.   The width at all points along the access roads from the site
to the nearest collector road(s) must allow for 2 vehicle passability and
provide access for emergency response vehicles and school buses, such that 2
opposing vehicles can safely pass. A 16 foot travelway width shall be the
normal minimum standard required for 2 vehicle passability. Except as provided
under subsection (3) below, travelways falling between 14 feet and 16 feet at
any point may be reviewed by the Planning Commission (or the Director in
accordance with subsection 2. below) on a case-by-case basis to determine
whether 2 vehicles can pass safely and emergency vehicles and school buses have
access. Travelways less than 14 feet at any point will not be considered
adequate. Minor subdivision may occur on gravel, stabilized or paved surfaces.
In cases where the applicant proposes to widen the travelway, construction
methods and materials shall be as specified in the Design Manual. The applicant
must obtain all necessary easements, plan approvals, and permits prior to
commencement of construction.
            2.   The Director shall have the authority to determine that road
access for a minor subdivision is adequate if all of the following conditions
are met;
               (i)   Lot access is on a road that connects directly to a
collector or arterial road; and
               (ii)   The section of road between the lot access and the
collector or arterial road meets the minimum 16-foot road width requirements;
and
               (iii)   The section of road meeting subsections (i) and (ii)
above is the most direct access route for the closest emergency response
services and for the future lot owners; and
               (iv)   The vertical and horizontal sight distances and existing
grades do not pose safety concerns.
            3.   Except as provided in §
1-16-236(K)(2)(b)1., in the agricultural and resource conservation zoning
districts, travelway widths falling between 14 feet and 16 feet at any point
may be approved at staff level. If staff does not support approval of the
travelway, the applicant may request a review by the Planning Commission.
         (b)   For major subdivisions. Lots must directly access a publicly-
maintained road with a continuously paved surface that is at least 20 feet in
width. Except, however, 5 lots or less within a major subdivision (counting
proposed and previously recorded lots) will be permitted to have direct access
on existing gravel or stabilized surface roads with a minimum 16 foot
travelway, provided that the gravel or stabilized surface road is not an access
route for other development on the original parcel and provided that all other
requirements for adequate public facilities are met.
      (4)   The Division may determine that road access for a minor subdivision
is adequate if a bridge crossing is the only point along the road that falls
below the minimum width requirement, and where:
         (a)   There are adequate areas for vehicles to pull to the side of the
road to wait for oncoming traffic that is crossing the bridge; and
         (b)   There is adequate sight distance and/or signage leading to the
approach of the bridge to provide motorists with advance warning of the narrow
travelway.
      (5)   Road access requirements of this section shall not apply to
subdivision of land to create separate lots for each existing residential
structure (built as of November 18, 1992), but no further subdivision will be
permitted on the remainder unless access complies with the provisions of this
section.
      (6)   Subdivisions utilizing existing or proposed dead end streets or
cul-de-sacs shall adhere to the requirements under §
1-16-236 of this Code.
   (C)   Water and sewer facilities. The proposed subdivision shall be
disapproved unless the following provisions are made for the disposal of sewage
and the provision of water:
      (1)   Prior to plat approval the proposed subdivision must be classified
on the county water and sewer plan for the appropriate water and sewer
classifications which are necessary to provide for the method of sewage
disposal and water supply proposed for the subdivision;
      (2)   Prior to plat approval, each building lot has been approved for
individual and/or community sewerage and water facilities by the appropriate
approving authority; and
      (3)   Prior to plat approval, the requirements of §
1-16-106 have been satisfied.

circumstances of shape and topography or other physical features or conditions
of the proposed subdivision, or because of the nature of adjacent developments,
extraordinary hardship may result from strict compliance with this chapter,
there may be granted a modification of this chapter when requested by the
subdivider or developer. However, no such modification shall be granted which
will have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the Comprehensive
Plan, the zoning regulations, this chapter or any other pertinent rules,
regulations or laws of the county. In granting modifications, the Planning
Commission may require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure
substantially the objections of the standards of the requirements so waived or
modified.

Planning Commission. However, immunity from changes in applicable laws and
regulations shall not be extended beyond 5 years from the date of the original
preliminary plan approval.
      (3)   A request for extension of preliminary approval which requires
adequate public facilities ordinance testing for water, sewer or traffic shall
be filed at least 90 days prior to the end of the preliminary plan approval
period.
      (4)   A request for extension of preliminary approval which does not
require adequate public facilities ordinance testing for water, sewer or

to send it in a timely fashion shall not excuse the subdivider from its
obligation to file any request for extension within the time frames described
above.
   (S)   A disapproved or voided preliminary plan has no status and any further
consideration or review submission shall be treated as a new application.
   (T)   An approved preliminary plan shall become void if all of the lots,

§ 1-16-108. MONUMENTS AND MARKERS.
   (A)   The plat shall show the position by coordinates of not less than 4
monuments set in convenient places within the subdivision. These monuments
shall be made of hard durable stone or concrete and shall be planted at least 3
feet into the ground. Existing corner stones and monuments can be used to
satisfy this requirement.
   (B)   If the subdivision lies in an area where a recognized coordinate
system already is established and traverse points of the system can be found
and used, the coordinate values shall be marked in the same datum as those on
the points found and identified by datum on the plat. In this case no markers
are required, but the owner of land shall comply with all other requirements.
   (C)   Markers shall be placed at all points of curvature along the street
line, at all angle breaks and at all lot corners not already monumented.
Markers shall adhere to regulations set forth in COMAR 09.13.03.

by Frederick County. Notation of compliance shall be placed in both the
surveyor's and owner's certification and dedication.
   (E)   The developer shall be responsible and pay all costs necessary to
replace any county grid monuments or control points disturbed by the
development activities. Replacement shall be done only by a registered surveyor
to accurately place such monuments. Such payment to restore any monuments is to

§ 1-16-109. STREET, COMMON DRIVEWAY AND SIDEWALK CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   (1)   The subdivider shall provide for the complete construction of
street improvements, including drainage facilities as provided in §§
1-16-234 through
1-16-241 of this Code and in accordance with the specifications of the Design
Manual.
      (2)   Open-section construction, as specified in the Design Manual, may
be utilized when the lot frontage is at least 80 feet and the minimum lot size
is at least 15,000 square feet. Closed-section construction, as specified in
the Design Manual, shall be utilized where single-family attached, 2 family and
multifamily developments are proposed and where the lot frontage is less than
80 feet or the minimum lot size is less than 15,000 square feet. Closed-section
construction may also be required by the Planning Commission where it would be
desirable to continue closed-section construction that is existing or proposed
in adjoining developments.
      (3)   Sidewalks.
         (a)   When designated, the minimum sidewalk width shall be 4 feet. In
a typical subdivision, sidewalks have the following function:
            1.   Providing for maximum safety of children playing on their
block;
            2.   Protection of children walking to and from schools and
neighborhood parks;
            3.   Providing for adults to walk to and from neighborhood shopping
and transit stops (if any);
            4.   Providing for adults and children a safe pedestrian travelway
to community buildings and facilities;
            5.   Providing for interconnection between subdivisions and other
uses.
         (b)   Sidewalks shall ordinarily be provided along streets used for
pedestrian access to schools, parks, community facilities, shopping areas and
transit stops. Paved sidewalks shall also be provided within pedestrianways
giving midblock access to these types of generators. Wider sidewalks may be
considered next to higher density pedestrian generators, such as schools,
transit stops and churches. For all closed-section roads (with curbs),
sidewalks will be provided on both sides of the road. In open-sections, a
minimum of 1 sidewalk on 1 side of the road will be provided, except in R-
1 density.
         (c)   Depending on appurtenance placement, a meandering of the
sidewalk placement within the border area may be considered. In appropriate
circumstances, sidewalks may be outside the right-of-way, if such alignment is
more visually appealing or allows for the saving of trees or major plantings,
avoids rock outcroppings, and the like. However, this shall not be regarded as
a justification for locating long sections of walk near the street edge.
   (B)   The subdivider shall provide for the complete construction of
sidewalks in developments where 2 family and multifamily are proposed and in
developments where the median lot size for single-family developments is less
than 10,000 square feet. Sidewalks shall be installed on both sides of all
internal streets and on one side of all streets that run along the boundary of
the development. The Planning Commission may also require sidewalks in the
following situations:
      (1)   Where median lot sizes are 10,000 square feet or greater, and the
character of the neighborhood is such that they are considered necessary;
      (2)   If it would be desirable to continue sidewalks that are existing in
adjoining developments; or
      (3)   To provide access to community facilities such as schools, shopping
areas, and recreation areas. All required sidewalks shall be constructed in
accordance with the specifications of the Design Manual and shall be maintained
by the adjoining lot owner, a homeowners’ association or similar organization.
   (C)   The developer shall be required to repair damage to county roads,
drainage facilities, curbs, gutters, and sidewalks as a result of grading and
construction activities in the subdivision.
   (D)   The developer of subdivisions utilizing (private) common driveways (as
in double panhandle lots) shall provide for the complete construction of the
common driveway in accordance with the plat and in accordance with the
following.
      (1)   No more than 5 proposed lots and the remainder may be served from a
common entrance or driveway. A remainder utilizing a common driveway cannot be
further subdivided unless another point of access is provided for any
additional lots off of the remainder and this restriction must be noted on the
plat.
      (2)   When a common driveway is to be utilized for 2 to 4 lots (including
lots of record and remainders) a minimum 12 foot travelway width shall be
provided. A travelway width of up to 16 feet may be required in accordance with
the County Fire Code.
      (3)   When 5 or more lots (generated from either a minor subdivision
proposal or a combination of proposed new lots, the remainder, and lots of
record) will utilize a common driveway, a 16 foot travelway width shall be
provided. When 6 or more new lots are proposed (excluding the remainder), a
common driveway is not permitted and a standard public road system must be
utilized.
      (4)   A common driveway must be constructed with the above-described
travelway widths, but may be reduced in width where only one lot is being
served and when permitted by the County Fire Code.
      (5)   The material of the common driveway (not including the apron) may
be stone or asphalt. (Material for the apron must meet the requirements of the
entrance permit.)
      (6)   Common driveways must be used in the following cases:
         (a)   Where adjoining panhandle portions are 300 feet or greater in
length;
         (b)   Where adjoining panhandles cross floodplains or Class IV or
larger streams; or
         (c)   Where use of a common driveway will eliminate or limit the
impact to a waterbody buffer in accordance with §
1-19-9.400 of the zoning ordinance;
In other cases, the use of a common driveway is at the discretion of the
subdivider.
      (7)   Where multiple single driveway aprons cannot be constructed and
meet entrance spacing requirements, a common driveway apron must be
constructed.
      (8)   When common driveways are to be used, they must be built before
final plat recordation, unless this requirement is waived by the Division, in
which case a guarantee must be posted.
      (9)   All common driveways must comply with the County Fire Code.
      (10)   Easement(s) granting the right of ingress and egress to all the
lots and parcels approved to utilize the common driveway which includes
maintenance provisions must be recorded in the land records and referenced on
the subdivision plat prior to plat recordation.
      (11)   For existing plats of record:
         (a)   The owner of a lot or a remainder parcel shown on the original
plat of record may request approval to access and use the common driveway of
the minor subdivision, if the following conditions are satisfied: Use by the
lot or remainder will not result in the total number of lots or parcels served
by the common driveway to exceed 6;
         (b)   The common driveway width complies with the requirements of this
subsection based upon the increased number of lots or parcels served;
         (c)   A correction plat is submitted by the owner of the lot or
remainder parcel sought to be served by the common driveway, which references
the original recorded minor subdivision plat, with notes including restriction
of further subdivision of a remainder; and
         (d)   All owners and those having an interest in every lot shown on
the original recorded plat (including lienholders) must execute the easement
required to be recorded pursuant to subsection 10 above, and the revised plat
prior to recordation.

      (2)   Recreation land shall be located so as to be reasonably accessible
from all lots in the subdivision and in accordance with the following. Up to
50% of the land area to be dedicated may be steep slopes, streams, lakes or
floodplain. In all instances, 50% of the parkland requirements shall be
suitable for dry ground recreational use. Fifty percent of the dry ground
recreational area shall not exceed a grade of 5%. If no land meeting these
requirements exists in the subdivision, or, if the subdivider/developer chooses
to provide more than the required amount of land meeting the 5% slope criteria,
modifications can be made by the Planning Commission with the recommendation of
the Parks and Recreation Division.
      (3)   Where on-site detention and/or retention facilities are provided,
the detention/retention facilities may only count as part of the recreational
area requirement at the discretion of the Planning Commission, with the
recommendation of the Parks and Recreation Commission.
      (4)   Title to recreation lands and facilities shall be held by an
established homeowners association in which membership is mandatory and
automatic upon conveyance of title to any lot or unit in the subdivision. The
association shall be incorporated and the articles of incorporation shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for review and approval. Upon acceptance
by the Department of Assessments and Taxation of the State of Maryland,
appropriate notations shall be made on the plat as to date of approval and
acceptance. This requirement shall not apply if the county takes title to the
land pursuant to paragraph (5).
      (5)   At the discretion of the Planning Commission, and with the
recommendation of the Parks and Recreation Division, where public ownership is
deemed desirable, the required recreation land may be conveyed to the county.

DIVISION 3. CLUSTER DEVELOPMENTS
§ 1-16-161. RESIDENTIAL CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   The purpose of cluster development is to provide a method of
development that permits variation in lot sizes without an increase in the
overall density of population; that allows home buyers a choice of lot sizes
according to their needs; that preserves green space, tree cover, scenic
vistas, natural drainage ways, or preserves features of outstanding national
topography; in order to prevent soil erosion and provide green areas for rest
and recreation.
   (B)   In approving subdivision plats in any residential district, the
Planning Commission may permit modifications in lot area, lot width, yards
(building restriction areas) including zero lot lines, or other requirements.
Use regulations are governed by the zoning district in which the development is
located.
   (C)   Cluster development is not permitted unless public water and public
sewer are provided. However, if public water cannot be feasibly provided or is
not readily available and the developer can prove that individual water
supplies are feasible by providing a hydrogeologic study and drilling
sufficient test wells, then the Planning Commission may approve a cluster
development with public sewer and individual well with a minimum lot size of
12,000 square feet. In the event that cluster development is approved by the
Planning Commission using individual wells, no building permits shall be issued
for any lot until after a well has been drilled and approved by the Frederick
County Health Department under its regulations.
   (D)   The average dwelling unit density in a residential cluster shall be no
greater than the permitted density for the district in which the units are
located. For the purposes of this division, DENSITY means the maximum number of
dwelling units which could be built on net developable land area in the zoning
district. Net developable land is that land remaining after flooding soils
areas and rights-of-way for principal highways have been deducted from the
gross site area.
   (E)   Requirements.
      (1)   A concept plan shall be submitted to the Planning Commission at
least 60 days prior to the Commission meeting at which the concept plan is to
be considered.
      (2)   The concept plan must show:
         (a)   The type of dwelling unit (such as single-family, townhouse,
garden apartment) and building restriction lines; and
         (b)   Street layout; and
         (c)   Green area system; and
         (d)   Vicinity map (scale: no smaller than 1 inch equals 2,000 feet);
and
         (e)   Topography with minimum 10 foot contours (USGS topographic maps
are permitted for the concept plan); and
         (f)   Number of acres in the entire tract; and
         (g)   Overall dwelling unit density.
      (3)   If the concept plan is approved by the Planning Commission, a
preliminary plan shall then be submitted following the standard preliminary
plan procedures specified in §
1-16-71 of this Code.
      (4)   If the preliminary plan is approved by the Planning Commission, the
developer shall submit a site development plan, in accordance with the zoning
ordinance (
Chapter 1-19). A site development plan is not required if the entire
residential cluster consists of single-family detached units.
      (5)   A final plat shall be submitted in accordance with this chapter for
approval, signatures and recordation. Final plats filed on residential cluster
development shall bear a statement indicating that the land lies within an
approved residential cluster development.
      (6)   Residential cluster development is subject to the following
additional conditions.
         (a)   Development of the land within the cluster is permitted only in
accordance with the approved final plat.
         (b)   Reduction of individual lot areas will be reserved as green
area. The county may accept the conveyance of the green areas or the green
areas shall be conveyed to a nonprofit homeowners association. The agreements
concerning the ownership and maintenance of open space land will be recorded
simultaneously with the final plat.
(1959 Code, § 38A-61) (Ord. 95-15-139, 8-1-1995; Ord. 10-23-558, 10-19-2010;

Chapter 1-19
§ 1-16-162. AGRICULTURAL CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   The purpose and intent of agricultural cluster development is to
encourage the conservation of farmland in the agricultural zoning district by
planning the residential development allowed in the zone to provide for the
best obtainable siting, access and location of lots on a tract, and to provide
for a well-planned development while minimizing the use of prime agricultural
land.
   (B)   Requirements.
      (1)   For the purposes of this subsection, CLUSTERING shall be defined as
directing the subdivision of lots on a single tract of land to meet the
purposes of this section or transferring the authorized subdivision lots from
adjacent tracts to one tract for development. The Planning Commission shall
make the final determination as to whether the agricultural cluster development
can be achieved in keeping with the purposes of this section.
      (2)   When transferring authorized subdivision lots from 1 or more
tracts, the minimum original tract area required for transfer shall be 25
acres. However, adjoining tracts of less than 25 acres under the same ownership
may receive the rights if the Planning Commission determines that this will
preserve prime farmland.
      (3)   Minimum lot size, width and yard areas shall be as specified in the
zoning ordinance requirements for the agricultural district. Lot sizes which
are part of the cluster should be kept to a minimum in order to limit the
impact on the future agricultural use of the remainder. Lot sizes shall average
no more than 1.5 acres and no lots shall exceed 2 acres. The Planning
Commission shall have the authority to grant modifications to these lot size
restrictions based on percolation and other Health Department requirements.
      (4)   Subdivision under this subsection shall be allowed as follows. A
minor subdivision of 3 lots will be permitted on an original agricultural tract
of 25 acres or less. On an original agricultural tract containing more than 25
acres, the Planning Commission may allow 1 additional lot for each additional
50 acres or part thereof above the first 25 acres subject to the requirements
of this section. The Planning Commission may preclude clustering rights where
subdivision under this section will not conserve farmland, such as where the
tract is primarily in wooded areas, floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes and
other areas not in pasture or crop use.
      (5)   All clusters of 6 or more lots shall be served by an internal
public street and shall not be stripped along an existing roadway.
   (C)   Procedures.
      (1)   Concept plan. For the subdivision of tracts eligible for
agricultural cluster lots, a concept plan shall be submitted to the staff a
minimum of 60 days prior to the meeting at which the concept plan is to be
considered by the Planning Commission, showing all standard and potential
cluster rights to determine the feasibility of subdivision rights for the
original tract(s) of land. The cluster plan shall show the following:
         (a)   The lot layout (scale no smaller than 1 inch equals 100 feet)
including building restriction lines and appropriate dimensions;
         (b)   Street layout;
         (c)   Vicinity map (scale no smaller than 1 inch equals 2,000 feet)
showing the tract(s) and total acreages included within the plan;
         (d)   Topography with minimum 10 foot contours (USGS topo.
interpretation is permitted for concept plan);
         (e)   Development rights table indicating acreages and development
rights, both standard and cluster, for each tract and the total;
         (f)   Soils data for the cluster area and the remaining farmland.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall have final approval authority for the
location and layout of the proposed clustering of lots. The Planning Commission
shall consider the following when reviewing concept plans.
         (a)   Soils. The cluster plan should minimize the use of the higher
quality soils (Class I, II and III as designated in the soils classification
study) and maximize the use of steeper sloped areas, areas of poorer soils and
areas which are otherwise less productive for agricultural uses.
         (b)   Surrounding land use and zoning. The cluster plan shall consider
the existing land uses and zoning in the vicinity. Generally, new lots which
are adjacent to existing development or residential zoning are preferred to
creating an isolated cluster of new houses.
      (3)   Concept plan approval shall become null and void at the end of 1
year from the date of approval unless a combined preliminary/final plat or a
preliminary plat has been submitted for approval for the agricultural cluster.
      (4)   If the concept plan is approved by the Planning Commission, the
developer may then proceed with platting of the cluster development in
accordance with this chapter and the approved concept plan. Final plats shall
show all remaining parcels combined into 1 remainder, provided that any
remaining parcel(s) separated by a public road shall be considered separate
parcels and each parcel shall retain 1 development right.
      (5)   The final plat shall bear a statement indicating that "the land
lies within an approved agricultural cluster development and no further
subdivision of the remaining land is permitted unless the property is re-zoned
or further subdivision is allowed by ordinance or regulation of Frederick
County, Maryland."
      (6)   Farm lots shall be counted against the number of allowable lots
that may be subdivided off the original agricultural tract.
      (7)   When filing a subdivision plat for less than the 3 lots allowed to
be subdivided off the original agricultural tract, the remaining parcel must be
designated "remainder" on the subdivision plat or the property will lose all
further subdivision rights allowed under this section.

§ 1-16-163. ADDITIONAL REGULATIONS.
   In addition, the following shall be observed.
   (A)   Resubdivision shall not be permitted in cluster development so as to
reduce lot areas below those permitted in the originally recorded final plat.
   (B)   The development of land within the cluster is permitted only in
accordance with the approved site development plan on file at the Division.
   (C)   The agreements concerning the ownership and maintenance of open space
land shall be recorded simultaneously with the final plat.

DIVISION 4. CONDOMINIUMS
§ 1-16-179. GENERALLY.
   (A)   In any district where a condominium development is to be established,
it shall be subject to the requirements of the Maryland Condominium Act (Md.
Code Ann., Real Property Article, Title 11). The requirements in this chapter
shall be construed and applied with reference to the overall nature and use of
the property without regard to the form of ownership.
   (B)   For a condominium development, the developer shall submit the
preliminary plan and site development plan as required in accordance with this
chapter and the zoning ordinance (
Chapter 1-19). The preliminary plan and site development plan must clearly
indicate the intent to create a condominium development under the Maryland
Condominium Act, and also include an adequate description of the number of
units and elements of common ownership.
   (C)   Where a developer desires to convert an existing or proposed
condominium development into a non-condominium subdivision, the conversion
shall meet the requirements and processes outlined under this chapter and the
zoning ordinance (
Chapter 1-19) and shall be subject to Planning Commission approval. Nothing in
this section authorizes the developer to construct, or the Planning Commission
to allow, additional dwelling units or more commercial or industrial floor
space than was approved in the previously approved preliminary plan or site
development plan.
   (D)   Where a developer desires to convert an existing structure into a
condominium form of ownership, the developer shall submit the necessary
preliminary plan and site development plan as outlined in subsection (B) above.
   (E)   The condominium declaration and bylaws shall be submitted to the
Division at the time of building permit application for review and approval by
appropriate county agencies.
   (F)   The condominium form of ownership shall not be utilized to create a
division of land into two or more lots, plats, sites, or other divisions of
land for the purpose of immediate or future transfer of ownership. When such a
division of land is proposed, the proposal shall be submitted, processed and
reviewed as a subdivision plan under this chapter.
   (G)   Amendments, annexations, and other permissible actions related to
condominiums shall comply with Md. Code Ann., Real Property Article, Title 11,
as amended.
   (H)   It is the responsibility of the developer to record condominium plats
and associated legal documents that meet the requirements of the Maryland
Condominium Act. Failure to accurately depict the condominium as it is shown on
the approved preliminary plan and site development plan will require the
developer and/or owner(s) to make corrections to the recorded plat and/or to
the approved preliminary plan and site development plan.

relationship to adjoining subdivisions and land uses, both proposed and
existing.

§ 1-16-218. BLOCK SHAPE.
   (A)   Block length and width or acreage within bounding streets shall be
such as to accommodate the size of lot required in the area by the zoning
regulations and to provide for convenient access, circulation control and
safety of street traffic.
   (B)   The maximum block dimension shall be 1,800 feet. In the design of
blocks longer than 1,000 feet special construction shall be given to the
provision of pedestrian interior walkways near the center, or wherever most
useful to facilitate pedestrian circulation to a school, park, recreation area,
shopping center, bus stop or other significant neighborhood destination.
Walkways will only be approved if maintained by individual lot owners, a
homeowners’ association or similar organization.
   (C)   Residential blocks shall be of sufficient depth to accommodate 2 tiers
of lots of minimum depth, except where double frontage lots bordering a
controlled-access highway/street or floodplain are used.
(1959 Code, § 38A-73) (Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-16-219. LOT SIZE AND SHAPE.
   (A)   The size, width, depth, shape, orientation and yards of lots shall not
be less than specified in the zoning ordinance for the district within which
the lots are located and shall be appropriate for the type of development, the
use contemplated and future utilities.
   (B)   The relation of the depth of any single- family lot to its width at
the building restriction line shall not be greater than 5 to 1, unless
topography, septic areas or well locations dictate otherwise.
   (C)   Panhandle lots.
      (1)   Panhandle lots are permitted in minor subdivisions.
      (2)   Panhandle lots may be approved by modification of the Planning
Commission in major subdivisions only when it is determined by the Commission
that “excellence of design” will be achieved or that such lots are inaccessible
to the road due to odd shape and/or topographical constraints. In each case,
the Planning Commission will determine “excellence of design” based on the
spatial relationship of the panhandle lot to other lots and the public road.
Only physical design criteria such as odd shape and road inaccessibility,
topography, existing utilities, proposed and existing well and septic
constraints (Health Department criteria) and natural or man-made features shall
be used by the Planning Commission in granting modifications for panhandle lots
in major subdivisions.
      (3)   Not more than 2 panhandle lots of any ownership may have adjoining
entrances to a public right-of-way, except when common driveways are utilized,
and then the number of panhandle lots may not exceed 4.
      (4)   The stacking of panhandle lots to form more than 2 tiers of lots is
prohibited. However, provided that 1 of the following conditions is fulfilled,
the multiple tiering of lots is permitted:
         (a)   Subject to Division staff approval of the BRL, the creation of
up to 3 lots with appropriate BRL which prohibit the front-to-back stacking of
home sites; or
         (b)   A note being placed on the final plat which indicates that
houses will be constructed facing a common driveway so as to eliminate the
fronts of houses facing into the backs of other houses, and the BRLs for such
lots being oriented to a uniform front BRL parallel with a common driveway.
This use of a plat notation and BRLs to mitigate the effects of tiering may be
used on lots which are stacked up to 4 deep, including the remainder.
      (5)   Panhandle lots shall not be created which are unusable due to
topographic or other natural features, with the exception of subdivision for an
existing dwelling which has a usable driveway and for which a usable panhandle
strip cannot be designed.
      (6)   A panhandle lot shall be distinguished from a taper lot in this
way. A taper lot shall be defined as a lot in which the side lot lines
emanating from the street do not break in direction before the minimum lot
width is achieved. If the side lot lines break before these conditions are met,
then such a lot will be defined as a panhandle lot, and therefore, will be
subject to the design limitations presented in this chapter, except where side
lot line breaks are necessitated by proposed septic area and well locations.
      (7)   Panhandles shall not exceed 1,800 feet in length in the
agricultural, resource conservation, R-1 and R-3 zoning districts; 1,000 feet
in length in the R-5 and R-8 zoning districts; or 700 feet in length in the R-
12 and R-16 zoning districts. The length of panhandles in residential portions
of floating zones and in commercial and industrial zoning districts should not
exceed 700 feet and shall require Planning Commission approval. Panhandle
length may exceed the maximum length noted above for the subdivision of a
single lot around an existing dwelling constructed prior to July 17, 1992
provided that the dwelling is habitable, no additional lots or remainders will
be created with a panhandle that exceeds the maximum panhandle lengths, and the
panhandle incorporates the existing driveway serving the dwelling.
   (D)   Side lot lines shall be at right angles or radial to street lines,
unless a variation from this rule will give a better street or lot plan or
unless a variation from this rule will accommodate septic areas or wells as
determined by the Division.
   (E)   Lots which abut 2 streets, other than corner lots, will be permitted
only when necessary to avoid fronting lots on nonaccess streets and highways or
where their use will produce advantages in meeting special situations in
relation to topography, good site planning and proper land use.
   (F)   Lots shall not derive direct access from freeways or expressways. If
lots front on arterial streets or highways, driveway access to the lots shall
be derived from design standards shown under §
1-16-240 of this chapter.
   (G)   Minimum lot areas and widths shall comply with the applicable sections
of the zoning ordinance.

§ 1-16-220. FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   Lots lying entirely within a floodplain may not be created as building
lots.
   (B)   Lots to be used for building development must contain an area outside
the floodplain sufficient for the placement of the proposed structures as well
as any required septic area and wells. Placement of structures shall adhere to
the requirements of
Chapter 1-19 of this Code.
   (C)   Floodplains shall be retained in their natural state and comply with §
1-19-9.110 of the zoning ordinance. If the county does not want to incorporate
the area into the county park system, the developer may reserve an easement
unto a legally constituted community association or homeowners association for
the right to use the area in any manner so long as it is not inconsistent with
the maintenance and preservation of the area as a historic or annual
floodplain, consistent with these regulations.
   (D)   In all areas not covered by subsection (C), the floodplain may be
included within the boundary of the lot if the area of the lot is expanded by
an amount sufficient to allow construction of a house, accessory structures,
well, septic system (if applicable) and drainage field (again, if applicable).
In the event that such land is platted as a part of a buildable lot, there
shall be placed on such platted lot a building restriction line which shall be
located by bearing and distance so as to provide at least 25 foot setback
between any building and the floodplain line and a greater setback, where
necessary, to provide positive drainage between the building and the
floodplain.
   (E)   Building materials and other debris shall not be discarded in
floodplains. No floodplain shall be graded or improved so as to increase the
area of impervious surface and increase the rate of water run-off. No other
work shall be done, except that required or authorized by the Division upon
advice of the Soil Conservation District or the Department of Natural Resources
pursuant to the following:
      (1)   Clearing, grading and vegetative stabilization where needed to
restore the natural state of the floodplain or enhance its channel alignment
and shaping so as to contain the 100 year storm flow;
      (2)   Establish erosion control measures such as energy dissipaters,
flumes, riprap, slope revertment and channel liners with appropriate easements
where needed for critical area protection.
   (F)   Floodplain limits shall be clearly defined and shown on preliminary
plans and final plats along with the floodplain setbacks and waterbody buffer
setbacks as established by
Chapter 1-19 of this Code. Notations shall be added to the plat that document
the floodplain and waterbody buffer requirements of this section and
Chapter 1-19.
   (G)   All necessary permits must be obtained by the developer prior to
commencing work within a floodplain.
(1959 Code, § 38A-75) (Ord. 80-4-156, § 1, 2-13-1980; Ord. 83-18-285, 6-14-

§ 1-16-221. PRESERVATION OF NATURAL COVER.
   Land to be subdivided shall be designed and improved in reasonable
conformity to existing topography in order to minimize grading, cut and fill,
and to retain, insofar as possible, the natural contours, minimize storm water
run-off, and conserve the natural cover and soil. No top soil, sand or gravel
shall be removed from any lots shown on any subdivision plat, except in
accordance with the provisions of the applicable regulations, including
stormwater management (
Chapter 1-15.2) and sediment and erosion control (
Chapter 1-10).
(1959 Code, § 38A-76) (Ord. 10-23-558, 10-19-2010; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)

DIVISION 2. HIGHWAYS, STREETS AND ROADS
§ 1-16-234. GENERALLY.
   In designing highways, streets, roads, or common driveways, the subdivider
shall be guided by the following principles.
   (A)   Design to consider the context of the proposed land use, including the
existing and proposed land development patterns on adjacent parcels.
   (B)   Design for opportunities to create interconnections between adjoining
parcels.
   (C)   Provide for adequate vehicular and pedestrian access to all parcels.
   (D)   Design local residential street systems to minimize through traffic
movement and to discourage excessive speed.
   (E)   Provide reasonable direct access from local street systems to the
primary transportation system.
   (F)   Local transportation systems and land development patterns shall not
conflict with the efficiency of bordering arterial routes.
   (G)   Provide for safety, efficiency, and convenience of all users of the
transportation system.
   (H)   Pedestrian-vehicular conflict points shall be minimized.
   (I)   Design to preserve, enhance, or incorporate natural, community, and
historic resources.
   (J)   Be suitably located and designed/improved to accommodate prospective
traffic, emergency service vehicles, and road maintenance equipment.
   (K)   Sidewalk, street design, right-of-way and paving shall be in
accordance with these regulations and the County Design Manual.
(1959 Code, § 38A-72(a)) (Ord. 80-4-156, § 1, 2-13-1980; Ord. 92-14-049, 7-7-
1992; Ord. 10-23-558, 10-19-2010; Ord. 12-25-620, 9-27-2012; Ord. 14-23-678,
11-13-2014)
§ 1-16-235. RIGHT-OF-WAY AND PAVED SURFACE WIDTHS.
   Streets serving subdivisions shall comply with the following requirements.
   (A)   New streets to be constructed as part of a subdivision or as other
improvements on the land shall require a minimum right-of-way and paved surface
width as stated in the Frederick County Design Manual. The functional
classification of the street shall be as designated on the Highway Plan. If the
proposed new street is not classified on the Highway Plan, then the Planning
Commission shall review the classification of the road as proposed by the
developer to determine if the construction will be adequate to meet the traffic
generated.
   (B)   Whenever a proposed subdivision includes or abuts streets designated
on the Highway Plan section of the Comprehensive Plan, the Planning Commission
shall require, by dedication to public use, adequate right-of-way for the
coordination of roads within the subdivision with other existing, planned or
platted roads. Such dedication to public use shall be to the full extent of the
right-of-way as required in the Highway Plan; except where the right-of-way to
be dedicated is greater than a collector street, then a reservation of land to
meet the right-of-way standards may be required. Before a reservation of land
may be required for future dedication or acquisition for public streets, a
survey plat for the location of the proposed streets must be approved and
recorded in accordance with the provisions of Md. Code Ann., Land Use Article,
Title 6, Subtitle 1, entitled "Street Reservation". When a right-of-way
reservation is required, the Planning Commission may withhold approval for up
to 12 months in order to comply with Md. Code Ann., Land Use Article Title 6,
Subtitle 1. However, if the developer incorporates the recommendation of the
Highway Plan as part of the subdivision plat submission, then the preceding
procedure specified in Md. Code Ann., Land Use Article, Title 6, Subtitle 1 for
reservation shall not be required.
   (C)   Where a proposed street involves state jurisdiction and is designated
on the Highway Plan section of the Comprehensive Plan or the State Highway Plan
and no definite alignment has been established, the Planning Commission may
withhold approval of a subdivision plat for not more than 180 days from the
application date to permit the state highway administration, if they so desire,
to establish an accurate road alignment.
   (D)   In subdivisions that have individual lot access or where egress and
ingress to that subdivision is by use of an existing street that does not meet
the minimum improvement requirements for a local street, said street shall be
improved by the subdivider to the standards of a local street for that portion
of the street which abuts the subdivision in accordance with the following:
      (1)   The improvement standards contained in the Frederick County Design
Manual;
      (2)   If the existing street is designated a collector street or higher
in classification, the subdivider shall improve the street to the standards of
a local street;
      (3)   Where topographic, transitional (from one property to another) or
ownership problems are anticipated to occur, it may not be desirable or
possible to meet all the improvement standards of the Design Manual. The
Division may approve modifications to the requirements of the Design Manual in
order to accomplish the intent and purpose of these regulations, with the
exception of modifications to the separation requirements which shall be
granted only by the Planning Commission;
      (4)   Appeal from the decision of the Division regarding modifications in
street improvement standards may be by any county agency or person to the
County Executive or designee.
   (E)   Coordination with the state highway administration will be required
where existing or proposed state highways are involved.
(1959 Code, § 38A-72(b)) (Ord. 76-1-61, 1-12-1976; Ord. 80-4-156, § 1, 2-13-
1980; Ord. 81-44-234, 12-22-1981; Ord. 83-18-285, 6-14-1983; Ord. 10-23-558,
10-19-2010; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-16-236. OTHER STREET REQUIREMENTS.
   Streets (whether new or existing) serving proposed subdivisions shall comply
with the following requirements.
   (A)   If a subdivision borders or contains a street designated on the Master
Highway Plan section of the Comprehensive Development Plan, the following shall
apply.
      (1)   Where approved by the Planning Commission, the street shall be made
a part of the subdivision street system.
      (2)   Where streets are required to traverse a proposed subdivision and
it is neither possible nor desirable to make them a part of the subdivision
street system or where the right-of-way required to be dedicated is greater
than a collector street or highway, the Planning Commission may allow the
transfer of dwelling units or lots, which were lost through the right-of-way
dedication, to another part of the same property.
      (3)   Where, in the case of freeways, expressways and major or minor
arterials, a portion of the right-of-way is designated as reserved, the
building restriction lines shall then be measured from the outer edge of the
reserved area.
   (B)   The street system layout shall be continuous in alignment and grade
with existing streets, planned or platted, with which they are to connect.
   (C)   Rights-of-way for proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary
lines of the proposed subdivision so that a connection can be made to all
adjacent properties unless such extension is not feasible because of topography
or other physical conditions, or unless, in the determination of the Planning
Commission, such extension is not necessary or desirable for the coordination
with existing streets or the most advantageous development of adjacent tracts.
In any event, no subdivision shall be designed so as to create or perpetuate
the landlocking of adjacent undeveloped land.
   (D)   [Repealed]
   (E)   Wherever there exists adjoining the tract to be subdivided a dedicated
or platted and recorded half-width or partial highway, street or road, the
remaining width may be required to be platted except where essential to the
reasonable subdivision of a tract in conformance with the other requirements
and standards contained herein, and where, in addition, satisfactory assurance
for dedication of the remaining part of the highway, street or road can be
secured.
   (F)   Land dedicated or reserved for street widening shall not be counted in
satisfying the minimum yard or minimum lot area requirements of the zoning
ordinance, but land dedicated or reserved for state and county street widening
may be counted in computing the overall gross density under the zoning
ordinance.
   (G)   Where lots in the proposed subdivision are large enough to permit
resubdivision and/or a portion of the tract is left unsubdivided, then
appropriate rights-of-way shall be provided to permit future subdivision
activity. The above will not apply where recorded restrictions are placed on
resubdivision of the reserved parcel.
   (H)   Street and subdivision names shall be approved by the Division. Such
names shall not duplicate those used elsewhere in the county and must be
approved before the submission of any final plats. In order to change an
existing recorded street name, the above procedure will apply.
   (I)   Street system layout shall provide for the acceptable disposal of
storm water and provision shall be made by the developer to handle storm water
to comply with provisions elsewhere in this chapter and in the Design Manual.
   (J)   The street system layout shall be so designed insofar as practicable
to preserve natural features such as trees, water bodies, hilltops and other
natural features.
   (K)   Subdivisions on cul-de-sac or dead end streets shall be permitted only
if approved by the Planning Commission (or county staff) in accordance with
this division, the Design Manual, and the following provisions, as applicable:
      (1)   For proposed development on new or existing cul-de-sac or dead end
street(s), except existing dead end streets described in subsection (2) below,
the following requirements apply:
         (a)   Applicant must demonstrate the existence of site specific
circumstances that make the design and development of a through street
practically infeasible.
         (b)   In the AG and R-1 zoning district, cul-de-sac or dead end street
(s) shall not exceed 1,800 feet in length and shall not serve more than 30
lots, dwelling units, or parcels. The Planning Commission may approve
development of a greater number of lots and/or on a longer cul-de-sac or dead
end street if the Planning Commission considers the individual property
characteristics and the goals and principles of §
1-16-234 as set forth below in §
1-16-236(K)(1)(c).
         (c)   In the R-3, R-8, R-12, R-16, VC, MX, LI, GI, GC, MXD, ORI, and
PUD zones, the length of cul-de-sac or dead end street(s) may vary based on the
density in the development section or land bay, property shape and size,
topography, environmental constraints, lot size, unit types, and proposed land
use. The density and length of cul-de-sac or dead end street(s) shall be
reviewed by the Planning Commission and approved on a case by case basis. The
Planning Commission shall consider the goals and principles of §
1-16-234 when considering the length and density of streets under this
subsection.
      (2)   For proposed development on existing county-maintained dead end
streets that were not designed as such, but have become dead end streets due to
street or bridge abandonment, construction of highways that bisect the street,
or other natural or man-made causes, the following requirements apply:
         (a)   If the dead end street will not serve more than 30 lots or
dwelling units, no maximum street length restrictions apply and the requirement
for Planning Commission approval under §
1-16-236(K) may be waived if all other requirements of this chapter are met.
         (b)   The Planning Commission may approve a proposed subdivision that
increases the number of lots, dwelling units, or parcels serviced by the dead
end street to more than 30 on a case-by-case basis, if the following
requirements are met:
            1.   The travelway must be at least 16 feet wide, allow for two
vehicle passability, and provide access for emergency response vehicles and
school buses.
            2.   An appropriate turn around at the end of the street shall be
in existence or constructed by the applicant. In the event the end of the
street has not been dedicated to public use and is not owned by the applicant,
an alternative location for a turnaround may be approved.
         (c)   In order to grant the modification described in subsection (2)
(b) above, the Planning Commission shall consider the following factors:
            1.   Environmental or topographical barriers that could limit
accessibility, including falling trees, utility poles, flooding, weather
events, or vehicular accidents, and the number of dwelling units on the dead
end street that could be blocked from access by such a barrier;
            2.   The subdivision potential for other property that could
potentially add more users to the dead end street; and
            3.   The distance between the subdivision and the intersection of
the dead end street with a through street; and
            4.   Other relevant factors, including the recommendations outlined
in the Design Manual.
   (L)    Cul-de-sac streets shall be provided with a paved turnaround at the
closed end in accordance with the provisions of these regulations and the
Design Manual.
   (M)   Where a major subdivision plat includes only part of the tract owned
by the developer, a sketch plat layout of proposed streets and roads, if
applicable, for the entire tract shall be submitted.
   (N)   Unobstructed easements at least 10 feet in width may be required to
facilitate pedestrian walkways to commercial facilities, community recreational
areas, schools or other nearby streets where existing access is inadequate.
   (O)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make impractical
the inclusion of utilities or drainage facilities within the street rights-of-
way, perpetual unobstructed easements for such utilities shall be provided
across property outside the street right-of-way of at least 6 feet in width.
Location is to be determined by the Division.

§ 1-16-237. GRADE.
   (A)   Grades of streets and common driveways shall conform as closely as
possible to the original topography and shall be designed to produce usable
lots.
   (B)   Grades of streets and common driveways shall be designed so as to
locate as many building sites as possible at or above the elevation of the
abutting street, rather than below it.
   (C)   Grades of streets shall adhere to the design standards in the Design
Manual and shall not in general exceed those standards.

   (A)   Multiple intersections involving junctions of more than 2 streets
shall be avoided.
   (B)   Intersections shall be constructed as specified in the Design Manual.
   (C)   Minimum curb radii and paving radii at street intersections shall
adhere to the Design Manual.
(1959 Code, § 38A-72(f)) (Ord. 76-1-61, 1-12-1976; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-16-240. LOT ACCESS TO STREETS.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall have the right to approve or disapprove
any point of ingress and egress to any lot, tract, parcel or development from
any street or highway.
   (B)   The Planning Commission may require the subdivider to provide ingress
and egress to a particular lot or tract through the remainder of the property
or other properties over which the owner has control.
   (C)   In approving ingress or egress from any state highway, the Commission
can only approve those access points that are not in conflict with safety
standards of the state highway administration or with the right-of-way or
through highway line of a limited or denied access highway.
   (D)   (1)   Where a proposed commercial, industrial or residential
subdivision involves frontage on an expressway, freeway, major arterial or a
minor arterial highway or street, the street layout shall provide vehicular
access to such subdivision by 1 of the following means:
         (a)   A parallel street;
         (b)   A series of culs-de-sac;
         (c)   An access driveway;
         (d)   A reserve strip;
         (e)   Common driveways.
      (2)   The specific requirements for each of the above methods shall be as
specified in the Design Manual. If any of the aforementioned arrangements are
used, the statement “vehicular egress and ingress denied” shall be shown along
the limits of the road frontage on the final subdivision plat to prevent
residential, commercial or industrial driveways from having direct access to
freeways, expressways, major arterial and minor arterial highways and streets.

§ 1-16-241. ACCEPTANCE.
   The approval of a final subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute
or imply the acceptance by the county of any street shown on such plat.
Acceptance of streets into the county highway system occurs only after all
public improvements have been completed, in accordance with the requirements of
the county, as expressed in the Design Manual. Common driveways will not be
accepted into the county highway system.

§ 1-16-242. CEMETERY ACCESS.
   For any burial site located on land subject to a subdivision plat, an
appropriate easement shall be provided for ingress and egress to the burial
site by a person who is related by blood or marriage, or who has a cultural
affiliation with the persons interred in a burial site, or who has an interest
in a burial site that the office of the state’s attorney for the county where

infraction for which a civil citation may be issued by the Director of the
Division of Utilities and Solid Waste Management ("Director") or the Director's
authorized agent, as provided in this section.
   (C)   If, after investigation, a civil infraction is believed to exist, the
Director or the Director's authorized agent shall deliver a citation or warning
to the responsible party(ies) for the civil infraction. If the Director or
authorized agent is unable to locate the responsible party, the Director or
authorized agent may post the citation or warning in a conspicuous place on the
property on which the civil infraction occurred and/or mail a copy of same to
the owner of the property or other responsible person, which shall be
sufficient for delivery of the warning or citation under this section.
   (D)   The citation or warning, as provided for in this section, shall be in
writing and shall contain the following:
      (1)   The name and address, or other identifying information if the
address is not known, of the person charged or warned;
      (2)   The nature of the violation;
      (3)   The location of the violation;
      (4)   The date(s) of the violation;

      (8)   A certification by the Director or authorized agent attesting to
the truth of the matters set forth.
   (E)   Whenever an alleged or possible civil infraction comes to the
attention of the Director or authorized agent, the following procedures shall
apply:
      (1)   The Director or authorized agent will investigate whether a
violation has occurred;
      (2)   If the Director finds that a violation has occurred, a warning will
be issued to the person(s) responsible in the form and manner as outlined in
this section, with reasonable time stated to abate or to prevent future
infractions;
      (3)   If the violation continues or is allowed to occur after the
reasonable time stated, the Director or authorized agent will issue a citation
to the person(s) responsible in the form and manner as outlined in this
section. Notwithstanding the provision of step (2) above, the Director or
authorized agent may issue a citation at step (2) without the prior issuance of
a warning.
   (F)   A fine of $200 shall be imposed upon any person responsible for each
civil infraction. Each day that a violation exists shall be considered a
separate civil infraction. All fines shall be payable to the Treasurer of

   (G)   A person who receives a citation may elect to stand trial for the
civil infraction by filing with the Director a notice of intention to stand
trial. The notice shall be delivered to the Director at least 10 days before
the due date for payment of the fines as set forth in the citation. Upon
receipt of the notice of intention to stand trial, the Director or authorized
agent shall forward to the District Court of Frederick County, Maryland, a copy
of the citation and the notice of intention to stand trial. Upon receipt of the
citation, the District Court shall schedule the case for trial and notify the
defendant of the trial date. All fines, penalties, or forfeitures collected by
the District Court for any civil infraction shall be remitted to the Treasurer
of Frederick County, Maryland.
   (H)   If a person who receives a citation for a civil infraction fails to
pay the fine by the payment date set forth on the citation and fails to file a
notice of intention to stand trial at least 10 days prior to the payment date,
a formal notice of the civil infraction shall be sent to the person's last
known address. If the citation is not satisfied within 15 days from the date
specified on the notice, the person shall be liable for $400 for each civil
infraction. If the citation is not satisfied within 35 days of the date
specified on the formal notice, the Director may request adjudication of the
case through the District Court by following appropriate civil procedures.
   (I)   Adjudication of a civil infraction under this subsection is not a
criminal conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities
ordinarily imposed by a criminal conviction.
   (J)   In a proceeding before the District Court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Code, Local Government Article, Title 6. However, the County
Attorney is hereby authorized to prosecute all civil infractions under this
section.
   (K)   If a person is found by the District Court to have committed a civil
infraction, that person shall be liable for the costs of the proceedings in the
District Court.
   (L)   Depending on the circumstances of each case and after consultation
with the County Attorney, the Director or authorized agent has the
discretionary authority to reduce or suspend all or a portion of the fine.
   (M)   Nothing contained in this section shall prohibit or prevent the
Director or authorized agent from seeking other appropriate legal remedies,
such as injunctions or criminal prosecution.
   (N)   Provisions of this section are in addition to, and not in lieu of,
those penalties specified in other sections of the Frederick County Code,
including the Public Local Laws of Frederick County.

to the Community Development Division.
   (D)   A person who receives a citation may elect to stand trial for the
offense by filing with the Zoning Administrator a notice of intention to stand
trial. The notice shall be given at least 5 days before the date of payment as

within 15 days from the date of the notice, the person is liable for a fine of
$200 for each infraction. If, after 35 days, the citation is not satisfied, the
Zoning Administrator may request adjudication of the case through the district
court. The district court shall schedule the case for trial and summon the
defendant to appear.
   (F)   Adjudication of an infraction under this subsection is not a criminal
conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed
by a criminal conviction.
   (G)   In a proceeding before the district court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions in Md. Ann. Code, Local Government Article, Title 6. However, the
County Attorney is hereby authorized to prosecute all civil zoning infractions
under this section.
   (H)   If a person is found by the district court to have committed a civil
zoning infraction, he shall be liable for the costs of the proceedings in the
district court.

§ 1-19-3.210. SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   An application for a special exception may be made only by persons
with a financial, contractual or proprietary interest in the property for which
a special exception is requested.
   (B)   A grant of a special exception is basically a matter of development
policy, rather than an appeal based on administrative error or on hardship in a
particular case. The Board of Appeals should consider the relation of the
proposed use to the existing and future development patterns. A special
exception shall be granted when the Board finds that:
      (1)   The proposed use is consistent with the purpose and intent of the
Comprehensive Development Plan and of this chapter; and
      (2)   The nature and intensity of the operations involved in or conducted
in connection with it and the size of the site in relation to it are such that
the proposed use will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly
development of the neighborhood in which it is located; and
      (3)   Operations in connection with the special exception at the proposed
location shall not have an adverse effect such as noise, fumes, vibration or
other characteristics on neighboring properties above and beyond those
inherently associated with the special exception at any other location within
the zoning district; and
      (4)   Parking areas will comply with the off street parking regulations
of this chapter and will be screened from adjoining residential uses, and the
entrance and exit drives shall be laid out so as to achieve maximum safety.
      (5)   The road system providing access to the proposed use is adequate to
serve the site for the intended use.
   (C)   In addition to the general requirements listed above, uses requiring a
special exception shall be subject to the specific requirements for each use
outlined in §§
1-19-8.320 through
1-19-8.355 of this Code.
   (D)   A special exception approval may be granted in accordance with the
general and specific requirements enumerated in this section. The Board of
Appeals may, in addition to other requirements imposed under this chapter and
is hereby authorized to add to the specific requirements any additional
conditions that it may deem necessary to protect adjacent properties, the
general neighborhood, and its residents or workers. Violation of such
additional conditions, when made a part of the terms under which the special
exception permit is granted, is a violation of this chapter and may be grounds
for termination of the special exception.
   (E)   The Board of Appeals shall not grant a special exception unless and
until:
      (1)   A written application for a special exception is submitted
indicating the section of this chapter under which the special exception is
sought and stating the grounds on which it is requested; and
      (2)   A public hearing has been held; and the Board had made a finding of
fact that the special exception requested meets the general and specific
requirements outlined in this section.
   (F)   The grant of special exception may include approval of customary
incidental accessory uses as reviewed and approved by the Zoning Administrator.
   (G)   No use or activity permitted as a special exception shall be enlarged
or extended beyond the limits authorized in the grant of special exception. All
enlargements, extensions, and changes in use shall require grants of special
exception, as in the case of an original petition.
   (H)   If a grant of special exception is denied, no new petition for the
denied use on the same property shall be accepted by the Board of Appeals for 1
year after the date of denial of the petition.
   (I)   A decision of the Board of Appeals granting a special exception will
be void 5 years from date of approval by the Board of Appeals unless the use is
established, a building permit is issued, construction has begun, or final site
development plan approval has been received in accordance with the terms of the
decision. Upon written request submitted to the Zoning Administrator no later
than 1 month prior to the expiration date and for good cause shown by the
applicant, a 1 time extension may be granted by the Zoning Administrator for a
period not to exceed 6 months.
(Ord. 77-1-78, § 40-91(B), 1-24-1977; Ord. 82-19-263, 9-7-1982; Ord. 00-28-270,

§ 1-19-3.220. VARIANCES.
   (A)   The Board of Appeals may authorize a variance in height, lot area and
yard regulations.
   (B)   An application for a variance shall be filed with the Board of Appeals
only after refusal of zoning approval or an adverse determination has been
issued by the Zoning Administrator.
   (C)   The Board of Appeals shall not grant a variance unless and until a
public hearing is held and all of the following criteria are met:
      (1)   First, the Board of Appeals shall find that special conditions and
circumstances exist which are unique to the land or structure involved and
which are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district.
      (2)   Upon making this finding the Board of Appeals shall also find that
the following criteria are met:
         (a)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the actions of the applicant; and
         (b)   The literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would result in unreasonable hardship and deprive the applicant of rights
commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same district under terms of this
chapter; and
         (c)   That granting the variance will not confer on the applicant any
special privilege that is denied by this chapter to other lands or structures
in the same district; and
         (d)   That the granting of the variance will be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this chapter and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
   (D)   In granting the variance, the Board of Appeals may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms
under which the variance is granted, is a violation of this chapter.
   (E)   Under no circumstances shall the Board of Appeals grant a variance to
allow a use not permissible under the terms of this chapter in the zone
involved, or any use expressly or by implication prohibited by the terms of
this chapter in said zone.
   (F)   Except as specified in §
1-19-4.220(C), the Board of Appeals shall not grant a variance to a
nonconforming structure for the portion of structure determined by the Zoning
Administrator to be nonconforming.
   (G)   A decision of the Board of Appeals granting a variance will be void 2
years from date of approval by the Board of Appeals unless the use is
established, a building permit is issued, construction has begun, or final site
development plan approval has been received in accordance with the terms of the
decision. Upon written request submitted to the Zoning Administrator no later
than 1 month prior to the expiration date and for good cause shown by the
applicant, a 1 time extension may be granted by the Zoning Administrator for a
period not to exceed 6 months.

§ 1-19-3.230. APPEALS.
   (A)   Appeals to the Board of Appeals may be taken by any person aggrieved
or by any officer, department, board or bureau of the jurisdiction affected by
any decisions of the administrative officer. Such appeal shall be taken within
30 days after the date of the action or decision being appealed, by filing with
the officer from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board of Appeals a
notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The officer from whom the
appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers
constituting the record upon which the action appealed from was taken.
   (B)   An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
from, unless the officer from whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board
of Appeals after notice of appeal shall have been filed with him that by reason
of the facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case proceedings shall not be
stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the Board
of Appeals or by a court of record on application on notice to the officer from
whom the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.
   (C)   The Board of Appeals shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of
the appeal, give public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in
interest, and decide the same within a reasonable time. Upon the hearing any
party may appear in person or by agent or by attorney.
   (D)   In exercising the above-mentioned powers such Board may, in conformity
with Md. Ann. Code, Land Use Article, as amended, reverse or affirm, wholly or
partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision, or determination
appealed from and make such order, requirement, decision or determination as
ought to be made, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from
whom the appeal is taken.

DIVISION 3. SITE PLAN REVIEW
§ 1-19-3.300. PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The county has determined that certain uses require site development
plan review and approval by the Planning Commission (see §
1-19-2.160).
   (B)   Site plan review is intended to promote safe and efficient development
that maximizes compatibility and connections with existing or anticipated
surrounding land uses and the natural environment through careful consideration
of site development, transportation and parking, public utilities, natural
features, and common areas, as required by this chapter.
(Ord. 09-22-526, 7-14-2009; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-19-3.300.1 REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   A use subject to site development plan approval as required in §
1-19-5.310 (Use Table) or subject to the site plan review process as otherwise
required in this chapter shall be reviewed through 1 of 3 procedures to ensure
that the proposed development complies with the requirements of this chapter.
The 3 procedures are:
      (1)   Type I - Planning Commission. The purpose of the Type I - Planning
Commission process is to provide for development review involving standards for
design or review of uses permitted by this chapter which may be complex in
nature requiring interpretation of County Comprehensive Plan policies or the
requirements of the Frederick County Code. The Type I application shall be
circulated for multi-agency review prior to Planning Commission review. Type I
- Planning Commission review and approval is required for all of the following:
         (a)   Applications for site development plan approval where review and
approval is not provided for through the Type II - Limited or Type III -
Administrative site plan review processes.
         (b)   Modifications to a Planning Commission approved site development
plan involving an increase in building height or number of floors;
modifications to landscaping or screening that reduce the number of plantings
or opacity required in the initial Type I - Planning Commission approval;
requests for reduction in open space square footage; change in the type or
square footage of an amenity; and modifications that increase the number of
required parking and loading spaces.
      (2)   Type II - Limited. The purpose of the Type II - Limited process is
to provide for development review and approval by Planning Commission
authorized representatives based on standards specified in the zoning
ordinance. The Type II - Limited application shall be processed at staff level
and circulated for multi-agency review. Type II - Limited applications shall be
restricted to modifications provided through the Type III - Administrative
process or any one or more of the following minor modifications to Planning
Commission approved site development plans provided that the modification does
not require Planning Commission review of adequate public facilities, forest
resource ordinance, or stormwater management requirements:
         (a)   Minor modifications to utility location;
         (b)   Minor modifications to parking and loading design required by
physical site constraints that has no detrimental impact upon or that improves
bicycle, pedestrian and traffic safety or circulation;
         (c)   Building footprint modifications;
         (d)   Minor landscaping modifications that do not constitute a
material alteration of the Planning Commission approved site development plan
and that do not require a Type I Planning Commission approval as provided in §
1-19-3.300.1(A)(1);
         (e)   Minor modifications to pedestrian pathway location, open space
or amenity design to improve access, safety, or efficiency, that do not require
Type I Planning Commission approval as provided in §
1-19-3.300.1(A)(1).
      (3)   Type III - Administrative. The purpose of the Type III -
Administrative process is to provide for development review and approval by
Planning Commission authorized representatives based on standards specified in
the zoning ordinance. The Type III application shall be processed as a staff
level single agency review and shall be restricted to any one or more of the
following minor modifications, provided that the modification does not require
adequate public facilities, forest resource ordinance, or stormwater management
review:
         (a)    A change in use approved by the Zoning Administrator;
         (b)    Building footprint modifications of not more than 200 square
feet provided that there is no increase in overall building footprint square
footage;
         (c)   Change of permitted and approved signs;
         (d)   Minor landscaping modifications involving substitution of
species that do not require Type I Planning Commission approval as provided in
§
1-19-3.300.1(A)(1); or
         (e)   Other minor modifications as established by the Zoning
Administrator.
   (B)   An applicant may request a Type I - Planning Commission review at any
time during a Type II - Limited or Type III - Administrative review process.
   (C)   Planning Commission authorized representatives may require a Type I -
Planning Commission or Type II - Limited review for a site development plan
application permitted through the Type II - Limited or Type III -
Administrative review process, where it is determined that the proposed
modification may have an adverse impact on surrounding properties, public
facilities, or is inconsistent with the initial Type I - Planning Commission
approval.
   (D)   Each application involving site development plan approval, together
with the required fee (§
1-19-2.130) and other required plan submissions, including, but not limited to
adequate public facilities ordinance studies, forest resource ordinance plans,
sight-distance studies, stormwater management concepts and the information
described below, shall be submitted to the Community Development Division. The
Community Development Division shall not accept an application if it is
determined that the information submitted is incomplete.
   After the Community Development Division deems that the application is
complete, the site development plan will be scheduled for a Technical Advisory
Committee (TAC) meeting for review by agency representatives and
representatives of the applicant. The applicant may not file for a zoning
certificate and building permit with the Department of Permits and Inspections
before receiving site plan approval. Applications for site plan review shall be
void if approval has not been received within 3 years, beginning on the date
the application was accepted. A void application shall have no further status
and must be resubmitted.
      (1)   For all Type I - Planning Commission site plan review applications,
the applicant shall place a sign within 10 feet of each property line that
abuts a public road. If the property does not abut a public road, a sign shall
be placed in such a manner so that it may be most readily seen by the public.
         (a)   The Community Development Division shall provide the required
sign(s).
         (b)   The sign(s) shall be placed on the property at least 30 days
prior to the initial Planning Commission meeting at which the Type I - Planning
Commission site development plan is to be considered.
         (c)   The sign(s) shall be affixed to a rigid board, protected from
the weather, and maintained at all times by the applicant until the initial
Planning Commission meeting is held.
         (d)   The applicant shall file an affidavit certifying that the sign
(s) has been posted and maintained for the required time period.
      (2)   If any person removes or tampers with a posted sign during the
above 30 day posting period, that person, upon conviction, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, as provided in §
1-19-2.220.
   (E)   The Planning Commission may attach conditions to the approval of a
site development plan in order to ensure that the proposal will conform to the
provisions of this chapter.
   (F)   Approval of a site development plan submitted under the provisions of
this division shall expire 3 years after the date of the decision by the
Planning Commission or its authorized representatives unless construction has
begun as defined by "start of construction" in §
1-19-11.100. The length of site plan approval may not exceed the length of the
approval under the Adequate Public Facilities Ordinance (APFO) if APFO approval
is required.

met the following criteria based upon the standards and provisions of this
chapter:
   (A)   Site development. Existing and anticipated surrounding land uses have
been adequately considered in the design of the development and negative
impacts have been minimized through such means as building placement or scale,
landscaping, or screening, and an evaluation of lighting. Anticipated
surrounding uses shall be determined based upon existing zoning and land use
designations.
   (B)   Transportation and parking. The transportation system and parking
areas are adequate to serve the proposed use in addition to existing uses by
providing safe and efficient circulation, and design consideration that
maximizes connections with surrounding land uses and accommodates public
transit facilities. Evaluation factors include: on-street parking impacts, off-
street parking and loading design, access location and design, vehicular,
bicycle, and pedestrian circulation and safety, and existing or planned transit
facilities.
   (C)   Public utilities. Where the proposed development will be served by
publicly owned community water and sewer, the facilities shall be adequate to
serve the proposed development. Where proposed development will be served by
facilities other than publicly owned community water and sewer, the facilities
shall meet the requirements of and receive approval from the Maryland
Department of the Environment/the Frederick County Health Department.
   (D)   Natural features. Natural features of the site have been evaluated and
to the greatest extent practical maintained in a natural state and incorporated
into the design of the development. Evaluation factors include topography,
vegetation, sensitive resources, and natural hazards.
   (E)   Common areas. If the plan of development includes common areas and/or
facilities, the Planning Commission as a condition of approval may review the
ownership, use, and maintenance of such lands or property to ensure the
preservation of such areas, property, and facilities for their intended
purposes.

§ 1-19-4.110. EXEMPTION OF ESSENTIAL SERVICES.
   (A)   As authorized in Chapter 2-13 of the Code of Public Local Laws of
Frederick County, the county may establish, extend and maintain water,
sewerage, drainage and solid waste systems in the county. As specifically
provided in §
2-13-3(D)(5)(III), in exercising these powers the county shall not be subject
to the provisions of any planning regulations or zoning ordinances enacted
under the provisions of Article 66B of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
   (B)   Government utilities shall be permitted in any district, it being the
intention to exempt such facilities from the application of this chapter;

kilovolts or greater, of any cross country telephone trunk line, including
microwave, transmission pipe line proposed to be created or installed in any
district, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission in adequate time for
its review and recommendation. A nongovernmental utility that is proposed

DIVISION 2. NONCONFORMING LOTS, STRUCTURES, AND USES
§ 1-19-4.200. GENERALLY.
   (A)   Within the zoning districts established by this chapter or amendments
that may later be adopted there exist lots, structures, uses of land, and/or
structures, which were lawful before January 24, 1977 or before this chapter
was amended, but which would not conform to regulations and restrictions under
the terms of this chapter or future amendments thereto, and which could not be
built or used under existing regulations.
   (B)   The purpose of nonconforming lot, structure, and use provisions are to
allow such nonconformities to continue to exist subject to the regulations
contained in this division while not increasing the nonconformity. It is not
the policy of the county to pursue elimination of these nonconformities.
(Ord. 77-1-78, § 40-42, 1-24-1977; Ord. 08-26-502, 10-14-2008; Ord. 09-27-531,
11-3-2009; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-19-4.210. NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   A nonconforming lot is a lot which was legally subdivided and recorded
in the county land records prior to adoption, or amendment, of this chapter and
which after adoption or amendment of this chapter does not comply with the
dimensional requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   In any district where permitted a single-family dwelling and customary
accessory buildings may be erected in any nonconforming lot and in any
commercial or industrial district a principal permitted use and customary
accessory buildings may be erected on any nonconforming lot, provided all of
the following conditions are met in both cases.
      (1)   The lot is located in a district in which the proposed use is
permitted.
      (2)   This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the
requirements for street frontage, area, or width that are applicable in the
district. The yard dimensions of the lot shall conform to the regulations for
the district in which such lot is located.
      (3)   If said lot lacks street frontage, it must be proven that said lot
has an unrestricted right of access.
   (C)   Any lot reduced in area or yard setback to a nonconforming lot by
reason of a re-alignment or dedication of any existing federal, state or county
highway or by reason of a condemnation proceeding is a nonconforming lot of
record and any lawful structure on the lot before such reduction in lot size is
a nonconforming structure and may continue. However, this provision does not
apply to the creation of new streets, roads or courts in a proposed
subdivision.
   (D)   A nonconforming lot due to lack of road frontage may be subdivided
providing the new lot has road frontage that conforms with §
1-19-4.520 and the remainder has an unrestricted right of access and does not
have less road frontage than before subdivision.

§ 1-19-4.220. NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   A nonconforming structure is a structure lawfully existing January 24,
1977 or on the effective date of an amendment of this chapter that could not be
built under the terms of this chapter by reason of restrictions on area, lot
coverage, height, yards, or other characteristics of the structure or its
location on the lot. A nonconforming structure may be continued so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   The conforming portion of a nonconforming structure may be expanded
or modified provided that the expansion or modification does not increase the
portion of the structure determined by the Zoning Administrator to be
nonconforming.
      (2)   The nonconforming portion of a nonconforming structure may be
modified in accordance with the requirements of this chapter provided that the
modification reduces the portion of the structure determined by the Zoning
Administrator to be nonconforming, or if the modification meets the conditions
set forth in subsection (C) below.
      (3)   Such structure once destroyed by any means will not be
reconstructed unless:
         (a)   It is in conformity with this chapter; or
         (b)   The Board of Appeals grants a variance;
      (4)   Such structure once moved, will thereafter conform to the
regulations for the district to which it is moved.
      (5)   This movement does not include minor shifting or settling of the
structure from natural or accidental causes.
   (B)   Except as specified below in subsection (C), the Board of Appeals
shall not grant a variance to a nonconforming structure for the portion of
structure determined by the Zoning Administrator to be nonconforming.
   (C)   The Board of Appeals may grant a variance to expand a nonconforming
portion of an existing nonconforming structure only if the proposed expansion
does not:
      (1)   Increase the original footprint of the nonconforming portion of the
structure;
      (2)   Extend farther into the required setback(s) than the existing
nonconforming portion(s) of the nonconforming structure; or
      (3)   Include the construction of a nonconforming porch, enclosure of an
existing nonconforming porch, or the addition of stories on top of a
nonconforming porch.

§ 1-19-5.120. INTERPRETATION.
   The location of zoning districts as determined from the Official Zoning Map
is subject to the following rules of interpretation.
   (A)   A district name or designation shown on the official map means that
the regulations pertaining to that district extend throughout the whole area
bounded by the district boundary lines.
   (B)   Where the precise location of a district boundary line is determined
by a designated number of feet as shown on the Official Zoning Map, that
distance will control.
   (C)   Where the precise location of a boundary line is shown as within or
along a street or alley, the boundary line is the center line of such street or
alley.
   (D)   Where a boundary line is shown and its location is not fixed by any of
the above rules, its precise location is determined by scaling from fixtures
shown on the map.
   (E)   Where physical features existing on the ground are at variance with
those shown on the official map, or in other circumstances not covered above,
the Board of Appeals shall interpret the district boundaries after receipt of
recommendation from the Planning Commission.

§ 1-19-5.210. RESOURCE CONSERVATION ZONING DISTRICT (RC).
   The purpose of the Resource Conservation Zoning District is to allow low
intensity uses and activities which are compatible with the goal of resource
conservation to be located within mountain and rural wooded areas. Areas within
this district include mountain areas, rural woodlands, and cultural, scenic,
and recreation resource areas. Environmentally sensitive areas within the
resource conservation zone, including FEMA floodplain, steep slopes, wetlands
and the habitats of threatened and endangered species, will be protected from
development.
(Ord. 77-1-78, § 40-51, 1-24-1977; Ord. 95-02-126, 3-2-1995; Ord. 08-26-502,

prevent urbanization where roads and other public facilities are scaled to meet
only rural needs.
(Ord. 77-1-78, § 40-52, 1-24-1977; Ord. 08-26-502, 10-14-2008; Ord. 14-23-678,
11-13-2014)
§ 1-19-5.230. RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   (1)   The purpose of the residential density districts is to promote
healthful and convenient distribution of population with sufficient densities
to maintain a high standard of physical design and community service.
Residential density districts will conform to the County Comprehensive Plan and
will be located within areas identified for residential development. The
districts, as a group, are intended to provide for a variety of dwelling types
and densities and to offer housing choices at various economic levels. It is
further the intent to establish various densities of residential developments
in order to efficiently and effectively provide for necessary public services
and facilities. The following residential density districts and maximum
densities are hereby established.
 
Residential District Residential Density Class Maximum Dwelling Units Per Acre
R-1                  Low                       1
R-3                  Low                       3
R-5                  Medium                    5
R-8                  Medium                    8

      (2)   An exception to the maximum density is allowed under the MPDU
program in accordance with
1-19-8.620.
   (B)   The location of the districts will be consistent with the standards,
criteria, and location as specified in the County Comprehensive Development
Plan.
(Ord. 77-1-78, § 40-53, 1-24-1977; Ord. 02-26-322, 11-21-2002; Ord. 08-26-502,
10-14-2008; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-19-5.240. COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The purpose of commercial districts is to provide sufficient and
convenient locations throughout the county for commercial uses, serving the
needs of local areas, the larger community, and regional users.
   (B)   The Village Center District (VC) is intended to reinforce and enhance
the historically mixed-use areas within rural communities and designated growth
areas. The district provides for the location of a variety of limited
commercial uses and a range of housing types while maintaining the
compatibility of new development with existing development through design
standards. A mix of uses is encouraged in the village center either within a
single structure or as separate uses located throughout the district.
   (C)   The General Commercial District (GC) is intended to provide general
retail commercial and business services. The general commercial district will
be located on roads with a minimum classification of collectors as designated
by the County Comprehensive Plan.
   (D)   The Mixed Use District (MX) is intended to provide for a mixture of
residential, commercial, and employment uses served by publicly owned community
water and sewer within growth areas for the purpose of redevelopment and in-
fill where identified by a County Comprehensive Plan land use designation of
Mixed Use.
(Ord. 77-1-78, § 40-55, 1-24-1977; Ord. 07-27-467, 6-19-2007; Ord. 08-26-502,

678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-19-5.250. INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS.
   (A)   The purpose of the industrial districts is to provide for the
development of varied industrial uses that would supply needed employment
opportunities for the county. Industrial development has inherent
characteristics that require special attention and protection. Due regard must
be given to industrial needs for adequate site locations with concentration on
terrain, availability of water and sewer systems, transportation, and
compatibility with surrounding development.
   (B)   The Limited Industrial District (LI) is intended to provide adequate
area for development of industrial uses whose operations have a relatively
minor nuisance value and provides a healthful operating environment secure from
the encroachment of residential uses and protected from adverse effects of
incompatible industries.
   (C)   The General Industrial District (GI) is intended to provide areas for
industries involving manufacturing or processing and for those industrial uses
which cannot meet the performance criteria of the Limited Industrial District.
   (D)   The Mineral Mining District (MM) is a floating zone established for
the purpose of providing for the development of needed mineral resources in
areas where such resources exist subject to adequate safeguard for the
conservation of the environment.
   (E)   The Office/Research Industrial District (ORI) is intended to provide
for the development of office, research and limited manufacturing uses in high
visibility locations along major highways. Development in this district shall
be characterized by an absence of nuisances in a clean and aesthetically
attractive setting. This district shall permit limited manufacturing,
fabrication or assembly operations which would, by nature of the product, or
magnitude of production, be compatible with research, professional or business
offices. Commercial uses shall be limited to those which are primarily oriented
towards servicing those businesses located within the Office/Research
Industrial District.

   The Euclidean Institutional Zoning District is established to provide for
college or university, public school within the Agricultural Zoning District,
private school, private school in conjunction with a place of worship, or
residential treatment center in conjunction with a private school within the
Agricultural or Resource Conservation Zoning Districts, and a continuing care
retirement community (CCRC) within the Agricultural and R1 Zoning Districts, in

the following table will apply. Parking shall be limited to the number of
spaces required based on an evaluation of each proposed use, hours of
operation, and joint or shared parking agreements. An increase or reduction in
the number of required parking spaces may be granted by the Planning Commission
where the applicant or Planning Commission authorized representative can
demonstrate need based on characteristics of the proposed use, hourly parking
demand studies published by the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or
other documentation as approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   When an increase in the number of required parking spaces is
granted or for the purposes of overflow parking, the Planning Commission may
require the spaces to be constructed of pervious materials.
      (3)   When a reduction in the number of required parking spaces is
granted, the Planning Commission will determine the extent that an accessible
graded and seeded area shall be reserved for future parking.
      (4)   For uses not listed in the following table, parking requirements
shall be determined by the Planning Commission or their authorized
representatives. The requirements shall be based upon similarity to an existing
use listed within the table below, characteristics of the proposed use, or

DIVISION 3. AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT
§ 1-19-7.300. AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
   (A)   In the Agricultural Zoning District, the preferred use is agriculture.
The operation at any time of any machinery used in farming procedures and all
other agricultural operations shall be permitted and have preference over all
other uses.
   (B)   The minimum lot size for single-family dwellings will be 40,000 square
feet and, except as provided in §
1-19-7.300(C), subdivision will be permitted only as follows: a minor
subdivision of 3 lots will be permitted to be subdivided off an original tract
of land; thereafter land will have to be rezoned before additional dwellings,
other than tenant houses, may be built. An original tract of land shall be as
described in the county land records as of August 18, 1976.
   (C)   Clustering.
      (1)   Purpose and intent.
         (a)   To encourage the conservation of farmland in the Agricultural
Zoning District by planning the residential development allowed in the zone to
provide for the best obtainable siting, access and location of lots on a tract.
         (b)   To provide for a well-planned development while minimizing the
use of prime agricultural land.
      (2)   Requirements.
         (a)   For the purpose of this subsection "clustering" shall be defined
as directing the subdivision of lots on a single tract of land to meet the
purposes of this section or transferring the authorized subdivision lots from
adjacent tracts onto one tract for development. The Planning Commission shall
make the final determination as to whether the cluster development can be
achieved in keeping with the purposes of this section.
         (b)   When transferring authorized subdivision lots from 1 or more
tracts, the minimum original tract area required for transfer shall be 25
acres. However, adjoining tracts of less than 25 acres under the same ownership
may receive the rights if the Planning Commission determines that this will
preserve prime farmland.
         (c)   Minimum lot size, width and yard areas shall be as specified in
the Agricultural District. Lot sizes which are part of the cluster should be
kept to a minimum in order to limit the impact on the future agricultural use
of the remainder. Lot size shall average not more than 1.5 acres in size with
no lots exceeding 2 acres. The Planning Commission shall have the authority to
grant modifications to lot sizes based on percolation and other Health
Department requirements.
         (d)   Subdivision under this subsection shall be as follows. A minor
subdivision of 3 lots will be permitted to be subdivided on an original tract
of land 25 acres or less. An original tract shall be as defined in §
1-19-7.300(B). On an original tract of land containing more than 25 acres, the
Planning Commission may allow 1 lot in addition to those allowed on lesser
tracts for each additional 50 acres or part thereof above the first 25 acres
subject to the requirements of this section. The Planning Commission may
preclude clustering rights where subdivision under this section will not
conserve farmland, such as where the tract is primarily in wooded areas,
floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes and other areas not in pasture or crop use.
         (e)   All clusters of 6 or more lots shall be served by an internal
public street and shall not be stripped along an existing roadway.
      (3)   Procedures.
         (a)   Concept plan. For the subdivision of tracts eligible for cluster
lots, a concept plan shall be submitted to the staff a minimum of 60 days prior
to the meeting at which it is to be considered by the Planning Commission
showing all standard and potential cluster rights to determine the feasibility
of subdivision rights for the original tract(s) of land. The plan shall be
prepared in accordance with a "sample" cluster plan and show the following:
            1.   The lot layout (scale no smaller than 1 inch equals 100 feet)
including building restriction lines and appropriate dimensions;
            2.   Street layout;
            3.   Vicinity map (scale no smaller than 1 inch equals 2,000 feet)
showing the tract(s) and total acreages included within the plan;
            4.   Topography with minimum 10 foot contours (USGS Topo.
Interpretation is permitted for Concept Plan);
            5.   Development rights table indicating acreages and development
rights, both standard and cluster, for each tract and the total;
            6.   Soils data for the cluster area and the remaining farmland.
         (b)   The Planning Commission will have final approval over the
location and layout of the proposed clustering of lots. The Planning Commission
shall consider the following when reviewing Concept Plans.
            1.   Soils. The cluster plan should minimize the use of the higher
quality soils (class I, II and III as designated in the soils classification
study) and maximize the use of steeper sloped areas, areas of poorer soils and
areas which are otherwise less productive for agricultural uses.
            2.   Surrounding land use and zoning. The cluster plan shall
consider the existing land uses and zoning in the vicinity. Generally, new lots
which are adjacent to existing development or residential zoning are preferred
to creating an isolated cluster of new houses.
         (c)   Concept plan approval shall become null and void at the end of 1
year from the date of approval unless a combined preliminary/final plat or a
preliminary plat has been submitted for approval for the property.
         (d)   If the concept plan is approved by the Planning Commission, the
developer may then proceed with platting of the clustered development in
accordance with the subdivision regulations and the approved concept plan.
Final plats shall show all remaining parcels combined into 1 remainder except,
however, any remaining parcel(s) separated by a public road shall be considered
separate parcels and each parcel shall retain 1 development right. The plat
shall bear a statement indicating that "The land lies within an approved
agricultural cluster development and no further subdivision of the remaining
land is permitted unless the property is placed in another zone or further
subdivision is allowed by ordinance or regulation of Frederick County,
Maryland."
      (4)   Even though a subdivision plat is not required for land subdivided
for the purpose to be used as a farm, such subdivided land shall be counted as
a lot and will be counted in the number of allowable lots that may be
subdivided off the original tract of land.
      (5)   When filing a subdivision plat for less than the 3 lots allowed to
be subdivided off the original tract of land, the remaining parcel must be
designated "Remainder" on the subdivision plat or lose all further subdivision
rights allowed under this section.

DIVISION 5. COMMERCIAL DISTRICTS
§ 1-19-7.500. VILLAGE CENTER ZONING DISTRICT OVERLAY STANDARDS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. To provide for the location of a mix of commercial
services and residential development within the Village Center Zoning Districts
of rural communities with well and septic, and regional/district communities
where public water and sewer are either existing and/or planned. Village Center
zoning is applied to communities that contain an older village center as well
as historic resources which are unique characteristics of Frederick County. It
is the intent of the overlay standards to distinguish between development in
rural communities and growth area communities that accommodate differing
intensities and densities of growth, as well as sustain the distinctive village
center character and community identity through carefully planned development.
The design standards are to ensure that new development is compatible with the
unique characteristics within each community. The scale and density of new
development shall conform to the existing development patterns of the specific
community in which it is located as depicted within the Village Center Zoning
District design guide.
   (B)   Application.
      (1)   Density. Development within the Village Center Zoning District may
not exceed 3 dwelling units per acre except in the growth area communities. In
growth area communities the density shall not exceed 5 dwelling units per acre.
      (2)   Height. Structures within the Village Center Zoning District may
not exceed a maximum height of 30' and no more than 2 stories. In the growth
area communities the Planning Commission may grant an increase in height of up
to 40' and no more than 3 stories for townhouse, multi-family, transient
housing, and commercial development. The Planning Commission may grant an
increased height when the specific finding is made that such increased height
is:
         (a)   Compatible with the pattern of or relationship to existing
development on adjacent or confronting lots; and
         (b)   Conforms to §
1-19-7.500(C).
      (3)   Setbacks. Front, side, and rear setbacks will be determined based
upon the average setbacks for structures located on all lots facing and
adjacent to the proposed development, but in no event less than the specific
minimum setbacks where provided in §
1-19-6.100. Where facing and adjacent lots are vacant, the setbacks shall be
based upon the average setbacks of the nearest structures. Accessory and
secondary buildings shall not be utilized to determine principal structure
setback averages. Accessory structure setbacks shall be determined as provided
for in §§
1-19-4.300 through
1-19-4.300.1 or §
1-19-8.240, as applicable.
         (a)   Where establishing average setbacks within the Village Center
Zoning District:
            1.   The Zoning Administrator may approve an increase or decrease
in the minimum setback requirements where a specific finding is made that the
increase or decrease is consistent with the purpose and intent of the Village
Center Zoning District overlay standards in §
1-19-7.500. In making this determination the Zoning Administrator may approve
the elimination of an existing setback where the facing or adjacent setback is
found to be significantly inconsistent with other existing setbacks within that
Village Center Zoning District.
      (4)   Mixed uses. Mixed-use development is encouraged within the Village
Center Zoning District, including residential uses on the second or third
floors above ground floor commercial uses. Multiple principal structures on a
single lot may be permitted within the Village Center Zoning District through
the site plan approval process when the Planning Commission specifically finds
that the resulting development will provide an improved design that would not
otherwise be created on multiple lots. In determining whether to allow
development of multiple principal structures on a single lot the Planning
Commission shall require:
         (a)   Improved on-site and off-site traffic circulation for vehicles
and pedestrians;
         (b)   Building placement that provides for the concentration of
service entrances, mechanical equipment, utilities and non-public facilities
(i.e. refuse containers or outside storage) away from public access areas;
         (c)   The provision of a common plaza/green area(s) (not including
swimming pools or playgrounds) to be provided in addition to all other
landscaping and setback requirements. The common plaza/green area(s) shall be
calculated at the following rate: 726 square feet common plaza/green area(s)
per 2,000 square feet of gross floor area or portion thereof;
         (d)   Joint use or shared parking resulting in a reduction in the
number of required off- street parking spaces;
         (e)   A mix of integrated commercial and residential uses;
         (f)   Preservation of a historic structure or historic site where
applicable.
   (C)   Design standards.
      (1)   All new development within the Village Center Zoning District shall
incorporate the following design standards in addition to all other applicable
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. New development will use existing
development as a guide when determining site development, layout, bulk, and
form of proposed structures within the Village Center District. New development
should be designed and built to reflect existing neighborhood characteristics
including shape, height, massing, roof shapes, and door and window placement
and proportions.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall consider these standards in its
review of all development within the Village Center Zoning District. The
concept plan will allow for review of the proposed development in order to
ensure consistency with the intent of the standards and the purpose of the VC
district. The Planning Commission may not approve development applications that
do not comply with the design standards or other requirements of this section.
      (3)   Site development and layout.
         (a)   Buildings shall be oriented such that the principal face of the
building faces the most dominant adjacent public street as determined by the
orientation of existing surrounding structures.
         (b)   Multi-story buildings with commercial use(s) on the ground and
lower floors and residential uses on the upper floor(s) are encouraged.
         (c)   Garage and service doors for commercial development shall not be
oriented to the dominant adjacent public street. Garage and service doors shall
be located to the rear and/or side of buildings allowing for the principal face
of the building to remain the dominant public street feature.
         (d)   All equipment and supplies shall be stored, maintained, and
repaired outside of the front yard area and within completely enclosed
buildings. The Planning Commission may approve outdoor display of products at
the time of site development plan review.
         (e)   Parking shall be located to the rear and/or side of buildings.
Parking lots shall not create long expanses of empty street frontage.
         (f)   Shared parking is strongly encouraged. The Planning Commission
may reduce the minimum parking requirements where the applicant can demonstrate
the need for fewer parking spaces due to availability of on-street parking,
joint parking, community/shared parking as otherwise provided under §
1-19-6.240.
         (g)   Roadside sidewalks shall be provided when sites are developed or
redeveloped. Sidewalks linking adjacent parcels along the primary street shall
be provided wherever practical.
         (h)   Streets and roadways shall link to existing road networks and
follow the established predominant street pattern.
         (i)   Refuse and recycling dumpsters shall be located away from public
access areas and may be required to be screened. The most appropriate screening
shall be determined at site development plan review with materials reflecting
neighborhood characteristics as approved by the Planning Commission.
      (4)   Building massing and bulk.
         (a)   The overall form of proposed buildings, such as height, front
and side yard setbacks, roof pitch, and length of building frontage shall be
similar to the surrounding buildings in order to maintain a consistent pattern
and texture in the built environment.
         (b)   Community or institutional buildings may be granted increased
height allowances for architectural features that signify the function or
importance of the building to the community.
         (c)   Where abutting a public street, townhouse and multi-family
structures shall have a maximum width of three dwelling units.
         (d)   Non-residential buildings shall not exceed a maximum footprint
of 5,000 square feet except within the growth area communities where the
Planning Commission may grant a maximum non-residential building footprint of
up to 8,000 square feet. The Planning Commission may increase the maximum
footprint above 8,000 square feet within growth area communities where:
            1.   The increased footprint is compatible with the pattern of or
relationship to existing or approved development on adjacent or confronting
lots; and
            2.   The proposed building and site design provide a transition
between existing structures on adjacent and confronting lots and the proposed
development; and
            3.   The proposed development results in preservation and
integration of historic resources into the development where applicable; and
            4.   The increased building footprint does not exceed a maximum
total of 10,000 square feet; or the increased building footprint is in
accordance with county community and corridor plans.
         (e)   The Planning Commission may require changes to building and site
design where an increase above 5,000 square feet has been requested, to
minimize negative impacts on surrounding properties that may result from the
increased footprint. The building and site design changes shall be limited to
new construction and may include: location of public access, buffering and
screening, landscaping, lighting, outdoor recreation areas, building location
and orientation. The Planning Commission must make a specific finding
identifying the negative impacts on surrounding properties where changes to
building and site design are required.
         (f)   Building designs shall not include flat roofs, large expanses of
undifferentiated facades, and long plain wall sections.
   (D)   Procedures - concept. Development requiring site plan review must
receive concept approval from the Planning Commission or its authorized
representative as the first step in the development review process. The concept
must demonstrate the manner in which the Village Center Zoning District design
standards have been met by the proposed development. (§

   The following performance standards for Limited and General Industrial
Districts are designed to reduce the impact of industrial districts on
surrounding uses by lessening traffic congestion, protecting the health and
safety of workers and nearby residents, and by preventing detrimental effects
on properties adjoining or in the neighborhood. All applications for a site
plan approval must be accompanied by a registered engineer's certification that
the use complies with all of the applicable standards. Upon receipt of the
certification, the Zoning Administrator will issue a zoning certificate. After
occupancy, if there occurs continuous or frequent, even though intermittent,
violations of the performance standards and provisions of these regulations
without bona fide and immediate corrective work, the Zoning Administrator will
suspend or revoke the zoning certificate of the use and the operation shall
immediately cease until it is able to operate in accordance with this chapter,
at which time the zoning certificate shall be reinstated.

§ 1-19-8.402. CRITICAL DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE FACILITIES.
   The following provisions apply to critical digital infrastructure
facilities.
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   The critical digital infrastructure use is established to provide a
location for facilities consisting of one or more buildings used primarily for
the storage, management, processing, and transmission of digital data, which
houses computer and/or network equipment, systems, servers, appliances, and
other associated components related to digital data operations. The siting of
these facilities is dependent upon several factors, including proximity to
sufficient electrical power and data conveyance infrastructure.
   (B)   Size and location.
      (1)   Critical digital infrastructure use may be established only where:
         (a)   The tract of land where the critical digital infrastructure use
is proposed has a zoning designation of Limited Industrial (LI) or General
Industrial (GI);
         (b)   The tract of land where the critical digital infrastructure use
is proposed is within a community growth area, as designated on the
Comprehensive Plan Land Use map;
         (c)   The tract of land where the critical digital infrastructure use
is proposed is located within 2 miles of existing 69 KV or greater high-voltage
electrical transmission lines;
         (d)   The tract of land where the critical digital infrastructure use
is proposed may not abut land that is zoned residential or is designated
residential on the Comprehensive Plan Land Use map; and
         (e)   Notwithstanding subsection (d), critical digital infrastructure
may be established on a tract of land that abuts land that is zoned residential
or is designated residential on the Comprehensive Plan Land Use map so long as
the front, side, and rear yard setbacks set forth in §
1-19-6.100 for a critical digital infrastructure facility are increased to 200
feet from any property line abutting such residentially zoned or designated
land.
      (2)   The tract of land proposed to be utilized for a critical digital
infrastructure use may not be located within a priority preservation area
(PPA), a rural legacy area (RLA), or a treasured landscape management area.
      (3)   The tract of land proposed to be utilized for a critical digital
infrastructure use may not have a designation of no planned service (NPS) in
the Water and Sewerage Plan.
      (4)   Additional size and location criteria. Applicants must demonstrate
the following:
         (a)   The applicant must demonstrate that the visual impact of the
project on the viewshed, surrounding properties, public roadways, including
roadways with rustic, scenic, or historic designation, and historic sites will
be avoided or minimized to the maximum extent practicable.
         (b)   The applicant must demonstrate that schools, college and
universities, daycare centers, health care facilities, houses of worship,
residences, and other non-industrial uses in the vicinity have been identified
and negative impacts to these uses will be avoided or minimized to the maximum
extent practicable.
         (c)   The applicant must demonstrate that fragile ecosystems and
watersheds in the vicinity have been identified, and negative impacts will be
avoided or minimized to the maximum extent practicable.
         (d)   The applicant must demonstrate that negative impacts to local,
state, and federal recreational amenities and private parks, as defined in §
1-19-11.100, will be avoided or minimized to the maximum extent practicable.
         (e)   The applicant must demonstrate that the siting of the proposed
use(s) will not disproportionately negatively impact overburdened communities
or underserved communities as those terms are defined in Md. Code Ann.,
Environmental Article, § 1-701.
   (C)   Bulk regulations.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may approve a reduction to, but not
elimination of, the required yard setbacks in §
1-19-6.100 between adjoining critical digital infrastructure facilities during
the site plan review process, if the Planning Commission finds that reducing
the setbacks:
         (a)   Increases the size and usability of open space areas;
         (b)   Increases the landscape buffer areas along other adjacent
property lines with different land uses;
         (c)   Provides additional buffer areas for environmentally sensitive
areas or resources; or

§ 1-19-8.620 MODERATELY PRICED DWELLING UNIT (MPDU).
§ 1-19-8.620.1. PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION.
   The purpose of the MPDU program is to substantially increase the county's
supply of moderately priced housing units as a natural function of the
development process. This program permits an increase in density above the
total number of dwelling units permitted by the standard method of development
if MPDUs are actually constructed and the applicant does not choose to pay a
per square foot payment in lieu. Construction of MPDUs also permits a reduction
in certain area and dimensional requirements where certain criteria are met
(see also §
1-19-8.620.5). Alternative options to the production of MPDUs in residential
developments may be granted in exceptional cases (Chapter 6A, § 1-6A-5(E) of
the MPDU program). The site plan approval procedures of §
1-19-2.160 and §
1-19-3.300 through §

§ 1-19-8.620.2. SCOPE AND REQUIREMENTS.
   The provisions of this division shall apply to all residential developments
consisting of 25 units or more on public water and sewer. Residential
developments consisting of 25 units or more are required to provide no less
than 12.5% of the total units as MPDUs. This includes all developments in VC,
R-1, R-3, R-5, R-8, R-12, R-16 residential districts, MX, MXD, and PUD
districts.

§ 1-19-8.620.3. DENSITY BONUS.
   (A)   If at least 12.5% of the total number of dwelling units are
constructed as MPDUs in accordance with
Chapter 1-6A:
      (1)   Density bonuses at a one-to one ratio will be provided; for each
MPDU built, one unit of density bonus is earned.
      (2)   A two-to-one density bonus may be approved by the Planning
Commission for MPDUs constructed in specified growth areas as identified in the
Livable Frederick Master Plan.
   (B)   The density bonus dwelling units must be the same unit type as the
MPDUs. Density bonus units will not be approved if the additional density would
cause the development to violate any applicable State or County regulations, or
to exceed a dwelling unit cap, if any, established at the time of rezoning.

along the exterior boundary of the solar array. The buffer must be designed to
provide four-season visual screening of the solar facility and include multi-
layered, staggered rows of overstory and understory trees and shrubs that are a
mix of evergreen and deciduous vegetation, with an emphasis on species that are
native to Frederick County.
         (b)   Applicant must submit a landscape, buffering, and screening plan
as part of the site plan application addressing the requirements and timing of
plantings. Screening and buffering must be installed as early in the
development process as possible and prior to activation of the solar facility.
Screening and buffering requirements must be installed in accordance with the
approved site plan.

planting must be 3 gallon or larger. Trees and shrubs larger than the minimum
sizes listed above will be required where the minimum planting sizes will not
provide adequate screening or buffering within 2 years. Vegetation used to
establish a visual screen must not be trimmed so as to stunt upward and outward
growth or to otherwise limit the effectiveness of the visual screen.
         (d)   A berm or fence may be used in combination with vegetation to
satisfy the screening requirement where deemed appropriate by county staff and
the Planning Commission. Fences must be made of quality materials and enhance
rather than detract from the beautification of the site. Berms and fences must
be designed to avoid long, undifferentiated facades and long, plain sections by
including a combination of the following design elements: variations in height,
step-backs or recesses, changes in material, patterns, textures, colors, or use
of accent materials.
         (e)   If security fencing is proposed, vegetative screening must be
placed between the fence and the public view. Fencing must be made of high-
quality materials. Chain-link and similar woven metal or plastic fencing must
not be used. No barbed or razor wire may be used on the security fencing around
the solar panels and accessories.
         (f)   If forest or hedgerows exist where screening or buffering is
required, it must be preserved to the maximum extent practicable and
supplemented with new plantings where necessary to provide the desired
screening or buffering.
         (g)   All landscaping, screening, and buffering must be maintained in
living condition.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may approve a modification to the
landscaping, buffering, and screening standards where an alternate landscaping,
buffering, and screening plan is proposed that meets the purpose and intent of
these design requirements.
   (G)   Lighting. If lighting is proposed, then a lighting plan must be
submitted in accordance with §
1-19-6.500. Lighting will provide the lowest level of illumination practicable
to reduce impact on adjoining properties.
   (H)   Removal and restoration of the property.
      (1)   The property owner will provide a decommissioning and restoration
plan as part of the site plan submission unless a decommissioning and
restoration plan is included in the Public Service Commission's conditions of
CPCN approval.
      (2)   The property owner will ensure the removal and disposal of all of
the solar energy generating panels and accessories and the restoration of the
site to its prior condition, by posting an acceptable monetary guarantee with
the county on forms provided by the office of the Zoning Administrator. The
guarantee must be for an amount equal to a cost estimate approved by the Zoning
Administrator for the removal and disposal of the solar facility, plus a 15%
contingency, ("guarantee amount"). The financial guarantee must be provided
prior to the issuance of a building permit or grading permit, whichever is
applied for first. Notice must be provided to the Zoning Administrator within
30 days of the sale or transfer of the lease and a new financial guarantee must
be provided by the new lease holder. If a guarantee for the cost of removal and
disposal of the solar panels and accessories and the restoration of the
property is required by and provided to a state entity, the Zoning
Administrator may accept documentation of the posting of the guarantee with the
state entity as satisfaction of this requirement.
      (3)   When the commercial solar facility ceases to generate electricity,
does not input electricity into the electric grid for 6 months, or the lease
for the site expires, the site plan approval will terminate automatically and
without notice from the county.
      (4)   Removal of the solar energy generating panels and accessories will
begin within 90 days after termination of the site plan approval, and
restoration of the property to the condition that existed prior to the
installation of the solar energy generating panels and accessories will be
completed within 6 months of the start of solar panel removal.
      (5)   Restoration will include the removal from the property of all
above-ground facilities, as well as all underground footings, supports, wires,
materials, fences, and berms.
   (I)   Notice to county. The property owner or owner of the solar energy
generating panels and accessories must provide notice to the Zoning
Administrator when the lease for the site expires, and when the commercial
solar facility ceases to generate electricity or does not input electricity
into the grid for 60 days or longer, unless due to routine maintenance
activity.

DIVISION 1. FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 1-19-9.100. FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The Floodplain District is established to protect
human life and health, minimize property damage, encourage appropriate
construction practices to minimize future damage, to protect water supply,
sanitary sewage disposal, and natural drainage. For purposes of this chapter,
and other applicable ordinances, the Floodplain District will be considered to
be the most extensive of the following:
      (1)   FEMA Floodplain;
      (2)   Flooding soils; and
      (3)   Wetland areas.
   (B)   Establishing the Floodplain District. The Floodplain District is an
overlay to the underlying zoning districts as shown on the zoning map. The
provisions of the Floodplain District are supplementary to the regulations of
the underlying zoning district. Where there is any conflict between the
provisions or requirements of the Floodplain District and those of any
underlying district, the more restrictive provisions pertaining to the
Floodplain District will apply.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator shall establish a Floodplain District and
an official map. The Floodplain District will be considered to be the most
extensive of the following: FEMA floodplain, flooding soils, and wetlands. The
Zoning Administrator may also utilize available historic data in determining
the limits of the Floodplain District, including without limitation photographs
and high water elevations.
      (2)   Within the FEMA floodplain, the source of this delineation shall be
at a minimum the most recent effective Flood Insurance Study and Digital Flood
Insurance Rate Map (D-FIRM) for Frederick County, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, as amended.
      (3)   The FEMA floodplain is established with emphasis on the 100-year
flood elevation where defined rather than the area graphically delineated on
the official floodplain maps. Where map boundaries and elevations disagree,
elevations prevail, with no approval from FEMA required.
      (4)   The delineation of the FEMA floodplain may be revised, amended and
modified by the Zoning Administrator in compliance with the National Flood
Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Maryland Department of the Environment, when:
         (a)   There are changes through natural or other causes to flood
elevations and boundaries; or
         (b)   Changes are indicated by detailed hydrologic and hydraulic
information and studies.
         (c)   As soon as practicable, but not later than 6 months after the
date such information becomes available, the Zoning Administrator shall notify
the Federal Insurance Administrator of the changes by submitting technical and
scientific data in accordance with 44 CFR part 65. All such changes shall be
subject to the review and prior approval of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and the Maryland Department of the Environment.
      (5)   The location and limits of flooding soils are determined by the
Soil Survey of Frederick County and Web Soil Survey, as amended.
      (6)   The location and limits of wetlands are determined by the Maryland
Department of the Environment Wetland and Waterways Program.
      (7)   Any dispute of the FEMA floodplain shall be appealed to Federal
Emergency Management Agency through the Zoning Administrator. Disputes
regarding wetlands shall be appealed to the Maryland Department of the
Environment.
   (C)   Administration. The Zoning Administrator is hereby appointed to
administer and implement these regulations and is referred to herein as the
Floodplain Administrator.
      (1)   The Floodplain Administrator may delegate duties and
responsibilities set forth in these regulations to qualified technical
personnel, plan examiners, inspectors, and other employees.
      (2)   The Floodplain Administrator will review permits to assure sites
are reasonably safe from flooding for new construction and substantial
improvements in flood prone areas. Where BFE data are utilized, the Floodplain
Administrator will obtain and maintain records of lowest floor and
floodproofing elevations for new construction and substantial improvements.
      (3)   The County may enter into written agreements or contracts with
other political subdivisions of the State of Maryland or a private sector
entity to administer specific provisions of these regulations. Administration
of any part of these regulations by another entity will not relieve the County
of its responsibilities pursuant to the participation requirements of the
National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal
Regulations (CFR).
   (D)   Disclaimers. The degree of flood protection required by these
regulations are considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and based on
scientific and engineering considerations.
      (1)   Larger floods can and will occur, and flood heights may be
increased by man-made or natural causes. Compliance with these regulations does
not mean that land outside of the special flood hazard areas or uses that are
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage.
      (2)   These floodplain regulations do not create liability on the part of
Frederick County, any officer or employee thereof, the Maryland Department of
the Environment (MDE) or the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), for
any flood damage that results from reliance on these floodplain regulations or
any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (E)   FIS and FIRMs. For the purposes of these regulations, the minimum
basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and base flood elevations is
the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Frederick County, Maryland dated 8/1/23, or
the most recent revision thereof, and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map
(s) (FIRMs) and all subsequent amendments and revisions to the FIRMs. The FIS
and FIRMs are retained on file and available to the public at the Offices of
the Zoning Administrator at 30 N. Market Street, Frederick MD 21701.

§ 1-19-9.110. ACTIVITIES WITHIN FLOODPLAIN DISTRICT.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   A permit is required for all development within the FEMA
floodplain, flooding soils, and wetlands. It shall be granted only after all
necessary permit applications are approved by Federal, State, and County
agencies.
      (2)   The issuance of any permits by the State of Maryland or Corps of
Engineers does not permit development within the Floodplain District except in
conformity with provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator may use tax assessment records to
determine substantial improvement when an improvement is proposed to an
existing structure. Substantial improvement will be calculated on a cumulative
basis.
      (4)   Any substantial improvement or replacement approved shall be in
conformance with the requirements of the permit program of the Maryland
Department of the Environment and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
      (5)   Within the FEMA floodplain, substantial improvements, substantial
improvements due to existing structures substantial damage, replacement or
relocated dwelling units (including manufactured homes), the addition of
accessory buildings, the expansion or replacement of an existing nonconforming
use, or development of an existing parcel of record lying totally within the
FEMA floodplain, require approval by the Board of Appeals (§
1-19-9.120 (A)).
      (6)   Within a danger reach area, the replacement of dwelling units
(including manufactured homes) damaged by flood, the substantial improvement of
habitable area within existing structures, the addition of habitable area to an
existing structure, or development of an existing parcel of record lying
partially within a danger reach area require approval by the Board of Appeals
(§
1-19-9.220(A)).
   (B)   Land development.
      (1)   FEMA Floodplain and Wetlands. Within the FEMA floodplain and
wetlands, no new development, including agricultural structures, residential or
nonresidential buildings, parking lots impervious to water, or fill, or
excavation operations in conjunction with development will be permitted.
Substantial improvements, substantial improvements due to existing structures
substantial damage, replacement or relocated dwelling units (including
manufactured homes), the addition of accessory buildings, the expansion or
replacement of an existing nonconforming use, or development of an existing
parcel of record lying totally within the FEMA floodplain shall be permitted
only with approval by the Board of Appeals. Open shelters, pole-type structures
(open on all sides and without walls), open fences and recreational uses, and
recreational equipment which are not contained in a building, are exempt from
the requirements of this section upon obtaining a zoning certificate in order
to ensure the type of construction will not alter the flood elevation, except
as outlined in §
1-19-9.110(D).
      (2)   Watershed Management Plans. All substantial improvements,
replacements or other developments within the FEMA floodplain shall be
consistent with watershed management plans where such plans exist. Structures
slated for acquisition under future flood hazard management projects may not be
improved or replaced.
      (3)   Floodplain and stream setbacks. A minimum setback of 25 feet shall
be provided from all Floodplain district boundaries, except as otherwise
approved through the mitigation process described in §
1-19-9.110(B)(7), or a minimum setback of 50 feet shall be provided from the
bank of any perennial or intermittent stream, whichever is greater.  In any
area designated as a special flood hazard area, the setback must be 100 feet
from the top of bank of a watercourse. All setback areas shall be maintained or
planted with natural vegetation.
      (4)   Subdivisions and site plans. All new subdivisions or site plans
shall have stream setbacks as well as the 100-year floodplain and floodway
delineations and elevations, as reflected on Frederick County's Flood Insurance
Study and Digital FIRM published by FEMA clearly shown and certified by a
registered professional engineer, registered professional land surveyor, or
registered property line surveyor. The plan shall demonstrate that development
will avoid the FEMA floodplain. No new lots shall be created unless they have
adequate buildable area outside of designated FEMA floodplain areas.
      (5)   Approximate FEMA floodplain. For development proposed in the
approximate floodplain Zone A (no water surface elevations or floodway data
provided), the applicant must use the best available information to determine
the elevation of the 100-year flood and the extent of the floodway, and must
delineate these on the site plan submitted for approval. For new subdivisions,
the applicant must have the 100-year flood elevations certified by a registered
professional engineer based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses which include
a floodway analysis. For individual lot development if no data are available,
methods described in FEMA Publication #265 "Managing Floodplain Development in
Approximate Zone A Areas" should be used to determine the 100-year flood
elevation at the site.
      (6)   Floodway restrictions. No new development shall be permitted in the
floodway except as provided in §
1-19-9.110(D).
      (7)   Flooding soils. No new development shall be permitted in areas of
flooding soils unless approved through a mitigation process including the
following:
         (a)   Submission by the applicant of a geotechnical report and soils
report prepared by a registered professional engineer in the State of Maryland
and a soil scientist with full membership in a State Soils Professional
Organization or that meets certification requirements. The report shall address
soil characteristics to include flooding frequency, duration, and surface water
depth.
         (b)   Determination of buildable areas by the Community Development
Division.
         (c)   Submission by the applicant of a mitigation plan for approval by
the Community Development Division. The mitigation plan shall include such
factors as:
            1.   Retention pond releasing at predevelopment rates to include
capacity for temporary inundation as determined in §
1-19-9.110 (B)(7)(a).
            2.   Use of techniques to reduce off-site runoff and ensure
adequate groundwater recharge.
   (C)   Building standards. Development within the FEMA floodplain shall meet
the standards as provided in subsection 1 through 5 below. Replacement or
relocated dwelling units (including manufactured homes) or substantial
improvements due to existing structures substantial damage or addition of
accessory buildings will not be permitted without the approval of the Board of
Appeals and then only if the lowest floor is elevated 1 foot above the
elevation of the 100 year flood and the dwelling or improvement is placed on a
permanent foundation or securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement.
      (1)   Elevation.
         (a)   The elevation of the lowest floor (see definition of "lowest
floor") of all substantially improved or replaced structures shall be at least
1 foot above the elevation of the 100 year flood. Basements are prohibited.
         (b)   All applicants shall agree in writing to provide an elevation
certificate completed by a registered professional engineer or surveyor to
certify the lowest floor (as built) of any structure is elevated above the 100-
year flood. An Elevation Certificate must be submitted before a Zoning
Certificate may be approved.
      (2)   Enclosures below lowest floor. The relocation or substantial
improvements to existing structures or the addition of accessory structures
containing fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (including, but not
limited to crawl spaces, solid footings and continuous foundations) shall be
designed to meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of 2 openings having a total net area of not less than
1 square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall
be provided.
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above
grade.
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
      (3)   Anchoring. All structures shall be firmly anchored in accordance
with acceptable engineering practices to prevent flotation, collapse, and
lateral movement during flooding. All large pipes and storage tanks located
below the Flood Protection Elevation shall be firmly anchored to prevent
flotation.
      (4)   Utilities.
         (a)   Electric: All electric utilities to the building side of the
meter, both interior and exterior to the building, must comply with all
requirements of this chapter. Distribution panel boxes must be at least 2 feet

areas shall be either elevated or adequately anchored to prevent flotation up
to the Flood Protection Elevation. All fuel oil storage tanks installed in the
floodplain must be either elevated or securely anchored to prevent flotation up
to the Flood Protection Elevation. Vent pipes must extend to or above the Flood
Protection Elevation and fill caps below the Flood Protection Elevation must be
screw type with a tight fitting gasket to prevent mixing of water with oil.
         (e)   Water supply and sanitary facilities: Water supply distribution
and sanitary disposal collection systems must be designed to minimize or
eliminate the infiltration of flood waters into the systems or discharges from
the systems into flood waters and shall be located and constructed so as to
minimize or eliminate flood damage. On-site sewage disposal systems shall meet
these same standards.
      (5)   Floodproofing.
         (a)   Floodproofing for substantial improvement of existing
nonresidential buildings may be allowed in nontidal waters of the State.
         (b)   If floodproofing is proposed, structures shall:
            1.   Be designed to be dry floodproofed such that the building or
structure is watertight with walls and floors substantially impermeable to the
passage of water to the level of the Flood Protection Elevation plus 1.0 foot;
            2.   If located in an area of shallow flooding (Zone AO), be dry
floodproofed at least as high above the highest adjacent grade as the depth
number specified on the FIRM plus 3 feet, or at least 5 feet if a depth number
is not specified;
            3.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic
and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;
            4.   Have floodproofing measures that are designed taking into
consideration the nature of flood-related hazards; frequency, depth and
duration of flooding; rate of rise and fall of floodwater; soil
characteristics; flood-borne debris; at least 12 hours of flood warning time
from a credible source; and time necessary to implement any measures that
require human intervention;
            5.   Have at least one door above the applicable flood elevation
that allows human ingress and egress during conditions of flooding;
            6.   Have an operations and maintenance plan that is filed with
local emergency management officials and that specifies the owner/occupant's
responsibilities to monitor flood potential; the location of any shields,
doors, closures, tools, or other goods that are required for implementation;
maintenance of such goods; methods of installation; and periodic inspection;
and
            7.   Be certified by a licensed professional engineer or licensed
architect, through execution of a Floodproofing Certificate that states that
the design and methods of construction meet the requirements of this section.
The Floodproofing Certificate shall be submitted with the construction drawings
as required in §
1-19-9.110 (c)(5).
   (D)   Exemptions. This section does not prohibit the placement or repair of
road crossings; water impoundments for stormwater management; retention areas;
agricultural activities not requiring zoning certificate approval; public
utility lines; environmental mitigation projects; or other minor wetland fill
activities (less than 5,000 square feet of wetland impact) within designated
FEMA floodplain, flooding soils, or wetlands. These floodplain activities must
obtain all federal, state and local permits required and for minor wetland
fills receipt of a letter of no significant impact from the responsible federal
or state agency.
   (E)   Inspections. The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections of development permitted in special flood hazard areas, at
appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to monitor
compliance. Such inspections may include:
      (1)   Stake-out inspection, to determine location on the site relative to
the flood hazard area and designated floodway.
      (2)   Foundation inspection, upon placement of the lowest floor and prior
to further vertical construction, to collect information or certification of
the elevation of the lowest floor.
      (3)   Inspection of enclosures below the lowest floor, including crawl/
underfloor spaces, to determine compliance with applicable provisions.

§ 1-19-9.120. PROCEDURES FOR ACTIVITIES WITHIN THE FEMA FLOODPLAIN.
   (A)   The Board of Appeals shall review the following activities within the
FEMA floodplain: substantial improvements, substantial improvements due to
existing structures substantial damage, replacement or relocated dwelling units
(including manufactured homes), the addition of accessory buildings, the
expansion or replacement of an existing nonconforming use, or development of an
existing parcel of record lying totally within the FEMA floodplain.
Applications to allow new structures or fill to be placed in the floodway shall
not be considered. The Board of Appeals may grant an application for approval
for activity within the FEMA floodplain when the Board specifically finds that:
      (1)   Failure to grant the application for approval would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (2)   The granting of an application for approval would not increase
flood heights, add threats to public safety, result in extraordinary public
expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or victimization of the public or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances; and
      (3)   The granting of an application for approval would not allow new
structures or fill to be placed in the floodway; and
      (4)   The granting of an application for approval is the minimum
necessary considering the flood hazard to provide relief and that public funds
may not be available to mitigate the results of the approval; and
      (5)   All new structures and substantial improvements to existing
structures will have the lowest floor elevated to the greatest extent possible
with respect to the 100 year flood elevation, but at least to the Flood
Protection Elevation, and a FEMA elevation certificate filed. In addition, all
structures, including manufactured homes, must be firmly anchored in accordance
with acceptable engineering practices (i.e., FEMA publication 85 "Manufactured
Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas"); and
      (6)   The granting of a permit by the Maryland Department of the
Environment if located within a FEMA floodplain; and
      (7)   The action is duly recorded with the deed of the property on which
the application for approval is granted prior to the issuance of a building
permit. Any expense incurred by the recording is the responsibility of the
applicant.
      (8)   The Board of Appeals shall not grant approval of the above
activities for lots containing floodplain created after June 6, 1989.
   (B)   The Board of Appeals will notify the applicant of approval in writing
through the Zoning Administrator. The decision of approval and findings shall
include the notification that:
      (1)   The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a structure
below the 100 year flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance;
      (2)   Such construction below the 100 year flood level increases risks to
life and property.
   (C)   The Board of Appeals will maintain a record of all decisions,
including justification for their issuance, and the Zoning Administrator will
report such decisions in the county biennial reports submitted to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.

2008; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-19-9.130. WATERCOURSE RELOCATION OR ALTERATION.
   In the event that a proposed development requires the relocation or
alteration of a watercourse, evidence shall be presented as part of the permit
application that all adjacent communities and the Maryland State NFIP
Coordinating Office, Maryland Department of the Environment have been notified
by certified mail and have approved of the proposed alteration or relocation.
Copies of these notifications shall then be forwarded to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, Federal Insurance Administration. In addition, the developer
shall assure the Zoning Administrator, in writing, that the flood-carrying
capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse in question
will be maintained.

§ 1-19-9.220. PROCEDURES FOR ACTIVITIES WITHIN DANGER REACH AREAS.
   (A)   Within the danger reach area the Board of Appeals may grant an
application for approval for the replacement of dwelling units (including
manufactured homes) damaged by flood, the substantial improvement of habitable
area within existing structures, the addition of habitable area to an existing
structure, or development of an existing parcel of record lying partially
within a danger reach area. The Board of Appeals may grant an application for
approval for activity within a danger reach area when the Board specifically
finds that:
      (1)   Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship
to the applicant; and
      (2)   The granting of an application for approval would not increase
flood heights, expand the danger reach area, or threaten public safety; and
      (3)   The granting of an application for approval is necessary
considering the flood hazard to provide relief; and
      (4)   All new structures and substantial improvements to existing
structures will have the lowest floor elevated to the greatest extent possible
with respect to the danger reach elevation and an elevation certificate is
filed with the Zoning Administrator; and
      (5)   A waterway construction permit, or other approval, by the Maryland
Department of the Environment if improvements are to be located within an area
subject to state regulatory authority; and
      (6)   If any portion of the improvement is within the danger reach area,
the action shall be recorded with the deed to the property on which an
application for approval is granted prior to the issuance of a building permit.
Any expense incurred by the recording is the responsibility of the applicant.
   (B)   The Board of Appeals may approve within the danger reach area the
substantial improvement of habitable area within existing structures or the
addition of habitable area to an existing structure or permit development of an
existing parcel of record lying partially within a danger reach area if:
      (1)   The (lowest) habitable floor is elevated at least 1 foot above the
elevation of the danger reach area and the dwelling or improvement is placed on
a permanent foundation system to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement; and
      (2)   The relocation or substantial improvements to existing structures
or the addition of accessory structures containing fully enclosed areas below
the lowest floor (including, but not limited to crawl spaces, solid footings
and continuous foundations) shall be designed to meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
         (a)   A minimum of 2 openings having a total net area of not less than
1 square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall
be provided.
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than 1 foot above
grade.
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices, provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of
floodwaters.
   (C)   The Board of Appeals will notify the applicant of approval in writing
through the Zoning Administrator. The decision of approval and findings shall
include the notification that:
      (1)   The issuance of a decision to allow construction of a structure
within the danger reach area may result in increased premium rates for
insurance;
      (2)   Such construction in the danger reach area may increase risks to
life and property.
   (D)   The Board of Appeals shall not grant approval to build within the
danger reach area for lots created after the enactment of these provisions.
   (E)   With respect to existing lots affected by the danger reach area, the
Zoning Administrator may, by the issuance of a zoning certificate, approve the
following:
      (1)   The location on a lot of open shelters, pole-type structures (open
on all sides and without walls), open fences and recreational uses, and
recreational equipment which are not contained in a building, provided that the
type of construction will not increase the flood elevation or expand the danger
reach area;
      (2)   The replacement of a habitable structure or portion thereof damaged
or destroyed other than by flooding;
      (3)   The expansion of a structure to add nonhabitable improvements,
including, but not limited to, porches, decks, patios, etc., when such
improvements will be located within the danger reach area, provided that the
construction will not increase the flood elevation or expand the danger reach
area;
      (4)   The expansion of a structure to create additional habitable areas,
provided that the additional habitable area does not fall within the danger
reach area.

DIVISION 3. WET SOILS
§ 1-19-9.300. STRUCTURES WITH BASEMENTS NEAR WET SOILS.
   (A)   (1)   No zoning certificate or building permit shall be issued for
construction of a residential structure with a basement if proposed on or
within 100 feet of "wet soils" until a soils delineation report is prepared by
a licensed soils scientist or professional engineer registered in the State of
Maryland. The soils report shall be submitted for review prior to the Zoning
Administrator's approval of the certificate or permit unless such a report was
completed at an earlier stage of the development review process.
      (2)   If a residential structure(s) with a basement(s) is proposed within
"wet soils," the developer must:
         (a)   Perform one of the following:
            1.   Construct a gravity drainage system in accordance with the
BOCA Code; or
            2.   Utilize another similar solution acceptable to the permits
office; or
            3.   Submit a geotechnical report by a registered professional
engineer in the State of Maryland; and
      (b)   Place a note on the plat requiring that all construction shall be
in conformance with the approved solution.

DIVISION 4. WATERBODY BUFFER REQUIREMENTS
§ 1-19-9.400. WATERBODY BUFFER REQUIREMENTS.
   A parcel, lot, or tract of land submitted to Frederick County for
subdivision or resubdivision review and approval shall be subject to the
following waterbody buffer requirements. The requirements in this section shall
not apply to existing structures.
   (A)   All subdivision plans shall have waterbody buffers clearly shown and
certified by a professional engineer, registered professional land surveyor, or
registered property line surveyor. To meet the requirements of this section,
applicants shall use best available data.
   (B)   All waterbody buffer areas shall be maintained in a natural vegetative
state unless otherwise utilized for reforestation or afforestation to satisfy
forest resource ordinance obligations or for environmental enhancement projects
administered or approved by federal, state, or local government agencies.
   (C)   Waterbody buffer widths shall be determined in accordance with the
requirements described below and shall apply to each side of a waterbody. As
used herein, the term "moderate slope" means a slope with a gradient of 15% to
less than 25%; and the term "steep slope" means a slope with a gradient of 25%
or greater.
      (1)   The waterbody buffer width shall be derived by calculating the
gradient of the slope within a 175-foot cross-section on each side of a
waterbody, drawn perpendicular to the direction of water flow. Cross-sectional
measurements shall be taken every 50 feet along the bank(s) of the waterbody.
      (2)   The minimum waterbody buffer shall be 100 feet.
      (3)   Except as provided in subsection (C)(4) below, if 60% or more of
the 175-foot cross-section includes moderate (15% to less than 25%) slopes,
then the waterbody buffer shall be increased to 150 feet for that side of the
waterbody.
      (4)   If the toe and the crest of a moderate (15% to less than 25%) slope
and the adjoining backslope are located within the 175-foot cross-section, the
waterbody buffer will extend to the crest of the moderate (15% to less than
25%) slope, or 100 feet, whichever is greater, for that side of the waterbody.
      (5)   Waterbody buffer widths may be greater than those provided herein
if floodplain and wetlands extend beyond the waterbody buffer area.
      (6)   Except as provided in subsections (C)(7) or (C)(8) below, if 60% or
more of the 175-foot cross-section includes steep (25% or greater) slopes, then
the waterbody buffer shall be increased to 175 feet, for that side of the
waterbody.
      (7)   Within the Linganore Watershed Protection Area only, if the 175-
foot cross-section includes a steep (25% or greater) slope and the steep slope
extends beyond 175 feet, the waterbody buffer shall be extended to include the
entire steep slope area(s) for that side of the waterbody.
      (8)   If the toe and the crest of a steep (25% or greater) slope and the
adjoining backslope are located within the 175-foot cross-section, the
waterbody buffer will extend to the crest of the steep slope, or 100 feet,
whichever is greater, for that side of the waterbody.
   (D)   No buildings, structures, or impervious surfaces, and no activities
requiring clearing or grading over 5,000 square feet will be permitted in
waterbody buffers, except for stormwater management facilities, structures and
appurtenant conveyances; environmental restoration or mitigation projects;
utilities; public and private roads; driveways; bikeways, and trails.
Utilities, public and private roads, and driveways must meet the requirements
of subsection (F) below or qualify for the exemption in subsection (G) below in
order to be located within the waterbody buffer.
   (E)   Sewage disposal systems, including but not limited to septic tanks and
their associated piping, drainfields, septic reserve areas or sand mound
systems, receiving approval after August 15, 2008 shall be located outside the
waterbody buffer area. If Frederick County Health Department-administered
percolation tests outside the waterbody buffer fail and the applicant can
demonstrate that an alternative location outside the waterbody buffer is not
feasible, the Frederick County Health Department may approve a sewage disposal
system within the waterbody buffer area provided all Code of Maryland
regulations are met.
   (F)   (1)   Public and private roads, driveways, and utilities may be
permitted in the waterbody buffer only if the applicant has clearly
demonstrated that no feasible alternative exists, and that every reasonable
effort has been made to locate the public and private roads, driveways, and
utilities outside of the buffer area.
      (2)   In order to locate public and private roads, driveways, or
utilities in the waterbody buffer, the applicant must submit a justification
statement to the appropriate county agency or division, including: (a) an
evaluation of at least one alternative location for the requested public and
private roads, driveways, and utilities; and (b) the reasons why the
alternative location or locations are not feasible.
      (3)   Public and private roads, driveways, and utilities that are allowed
in the buffer area must be located to create the least disturbance to existing
vegetation, grade, and wetlands.
      (4)   Where feasible, utility easements shall be set back a minimum of 50
feet from all waterbodies or outside wetlands and their buffers, whichever is
greater.
      (5)   Utility, bikeway or trail easements or rights-of-way within the
waterbody buffer shall be co-located whenever possible.
   (G)   Upgrades, maintenance or repair of existing public and private roads,
driveways, utilities, bikeways and trails shall be exempt from the requirements
of subsection (F) above.
   (H)   Sediment and erosion control structures or facilities may be allowed
as a temporary use in the waterbody buffers. At a minimum, grading must be at
least 25 feet from the bank of the waterbody and from any wetlands.
   (I)   Deposition or stockpiling of any material, including excavated rock,
topsoil, stumps, shrubs, or any building or construction material, within the
designated waterbody buffer is prohibited. However, stockpiling which is
necessary to restore an area within a utility easement or temporary sediment
control area may be approved by the appropriate county agency or division on a
temporary basis.

DIVISION 1. CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT
§ 1-19-10.100. PURPOSE.
   The purpose of cluster development is to provide a method of development
that permits variation in lot sizes without an increase in the overall density
of population; that allows home buyers a choice of lot sizes according to their
needs; that preserves green space, tree cover, scenic vistas, natural
drainageways, or preserves features of outstanding national topography; in
order to prevent soil erosion and provide green areas for rest and recreation.
(Ord. 77-1-78, § 40-71(A), 1-24-1977; Ord. 08-26-502, 10-14-2008; Ord. 14-23-
678, 11-13-2014)
§ 1-19-10.100.1. SCOPE.
   The provisions of this division shall apply only to cluster developments.
MPDU projects are excluded from the provisions of this division.
(Ord. 02-26-322, 11-21-2002; Ord. 08-26-502, 10-14-2008; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-
2014)
§ 1-19-10.100.2. DISTRICTS WHERE PERMITTED.
   In all R Districts, the Planning Commission in approving subdivision plats,
may permit modifications in lot area, lot width, yards (building restriction
areas) including zero lot lines, or other requirements. Use regulations are
governed by the zoning district in which the development is located. Cluster
development is not permitted unless public water and public sewer are provided.
However, if public water cannot be feasibly provided or is not readily
available and the developer can prove that individual water supplies are
feasible by providing a hydrogeologic study and drilling sufficient test wells,
then the Planning Commission may approve a cluster development with public
sewer and individual well with a minimum lot size of 12,000 square feet. In the
event that cluster development is approved by the Planning Commission using
individual wells, no building permits shall be issued for any lot until after a
well has been drilled and approved by the Frederick County Health Department
under its regulations.
(Ord. 77-1-78, § 40-71(B), 1-24-1977; Ord. 82-11-255, 6-8-1982; Ord. 84-6-302,

accessory uses for the benefit or convenience of the residents and their guests
including but not limited to: kitchen and dining facilities, restaurants,
places of worship, indoor and outdoor recreational uses, retail and banking
facilities, beauty salon and barbershops, gift shops, classrooms, medical
offices, medical clinic, laboratory services, exercise and vocational activity
areas. A complete listing and range of square footage for each individual
accessory use must be shown on the Phase I plan. The County Council may deny or
reduce the size, type, location, and/or mixture of the various accessory uses
if determined that it is inappropriate for the site or overall area of the
CCRC.
   (B)   Residential land use mixture within the PUD District. A goal of the
PUD district is to provide an optimal mixture of housing types, including
single family dwellings, townhouses, and multifamily dwellings. It is
recognized that each development project is unique and will benefit from its
own mixture of housing types. The specific mixture of housing types for each
development project shall be established by the County Council at Phase I,
based on an evaluation of the following:
      (1)   Existing County Comprehensive Plan land use designation and the
intended dwelling type and density.
      (2)   Need for a particular dwelling type based on existing and proposed
residential dwelling types surrounding the tract of land receiving the PUD
district.
      (3)   The County Comprehensive Plan community design policy of including
a variety of dwelling types in all communities in Frederick County.

the mixture of land uses in the PUD District the County Council shall include
an evaluation of the relationship between proposed residential land uses and
surrounding existing and proposed commercial land uses. This evaluation shall
establish whether existing and proposed commercial land uses can adequately
provide retail, business, and personal services to the proposed residential
land use. Where it is determined that existing and proposed commercial and
employment land uses will not adequately provide for the proposed residential
land use, a minimum amount of commercial and employment land uses shall be
required as part of the proposed development. The requirement of additional
commercial and employment land uses shall be determined based on an evaluation
of the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the number and type of existing or proposed commercial/
employment land uses located within a distance that may be reasonably expected
to serve a majority of the proposed residential dwelling units adequately
provide retail, business, and personal services to the proposed residential
land use.
      (2)   Whether the design of the proposed development maximizes use of
alternate modes of transportation (pedestrian, bicycle, and transit) reducing
the need for vehicular movement between residential and commercial/employment
land uses.
      (3)   Whether the proposed development reflects a land use mixture
consistent with the County Comprehensive, Community, and Corridor Plans.
   (D)   Open space/green area within the PUD District.
      (1)   Open space/green area within the proposed PUD development shall be
calculated based on gross project area, and provided at the following minimum

12-20 du/acre 40%
 
      (2)   The County Council may require public parks and recreation
facilities in addition to open space/green area. (See also §
1-19-10.500.8(A).)
      (3)   A reduction of not more than 50% of the open space/green area
requirement may be granted where the County Council finds that open space/green
area requirements are met through the use of low impact development techniques,
environmental site design techniques, open space green area located in close
proximity to the proposed development (to include public park facilities), or a
combination thereof. (See also §
1-19-10.500.8(A)).
   (E)   Building square footages will be used to determine the land use
percentages within mixed-use buildings.
   (F)   The County Council may in its sole discretion, deny, reduce, or
increase the size, type, location, and/or mixture of the various land use
components if it determines that the change is appropriate for the site or
overall area of the PUD.
   (G)   As part of Phase II execution, the Planning Commission may approve
minor modifications to individual land use location (such as single-family
detached, duplex, or townhouse), provided that the location of the overall land
use component (residential) within the site has not been modified. Any change
in the amount or percentage mix of commercial and/or residential development of
a PUD project having Phase I approval, must be approved by the County Council
under the provisions of this division.

Medium Density Residential                     6-12 du/ac
High Density Residential                       12-20 du/ac
 
         (b)   Where the tract of land receiving the PUD District has 2 or more
residential land use designations, then the density may be calculated as a
weighted average of the density ranges as specified for the residential land
use designations in which the PUD is proposed.
         (c)   Where the tract of land receiving the PUD District has both
residential and natural resource land use designations, the density may be
calculated based on the combined area of the land use designations. (See also §
1-19-10.500.9(B)(2).)

DIVISION 9. INSTITUTIONAL FLOATING ZONING DISTRICT
§ 1-19-10.900. INSTITUTIONAL FLOATING ZONING DISTRICT (I).
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   The Institutional District is a floating zone established to
provide for the location and development of large-scale public and private
institutional uses including public airports, college or universities, private
schools, or public schools in areas with an agricultural/rural or institutional
County Comprehensive Plan land use designation. Institutional uses fulfill the
important function of providing for the educational, health, and social well-
being of residents. However, large institutional facilities, because of their
size, scale, and intensity, may create adverse impacts on surrounding
properties and neighborhoods. These adverse impacts include noise, significant
traffic volumes, and consumption of large areas of land for parking,
infrastructure, and related facilities. Review and siting of these facilities
through a floating zone process will maintain the purpose of the agricultural/
rural areas identified by the County Comprehensive Plan by directing
development to areas contiguous to concentrations of growth rather than where
only services intended for rural and agricultural activities have been
provided, will mitigate or minimize impacts to surrounding properties and
mitigate or avoid traffic congestion which improves pedestrian and roadway
safety.
   (B)   Size and location.
      (1)   The Institutional District may be established where:
         (a)   The tract of land receiving the Institutional District has a
County Comprehensive Plan land use designation of either agricultural/rural or
institutional. The Institutional District may be applied to a County
Comprehensive Plan land use designation of Rural Residential (RurR), Low
Density Residential (LDR), or Natural Resource (NR) where the RurR, LDR, or NR
land use designations are a minor portion of the overall institutional project
or a minor portion of the overall tract(s) receiving the Institutional
District. Those portions of the project having a land use designation of
Natural Resource may only be developed as provided in §
1-19-10.900(G)(5); and
         (b)   The tract of land receiving the Institutional District has
frontage on and direct access to a roadway with at least a collector status, as
designated on the County Comprehensive Plan, and is built to said
classification requirements. The County Council may waive or modify this
requirement where the tract of land receiving the Institutional District is
within 2 miles of an existing grade separated interchange constructed on a
controlled access freeway/expressway or within 2 miles of a proposed grade
separated interchange constructed on a controlled access freeway/ expressway as
shown on the Frederick County Comprehensive Plan; and
         (c)   The tract of land receiving the Institutional District is within
½ mile of a community growth boundary or is contiguous or within a community
growth boundary as designated by the County Comprehensive Plan. For the
purposes of this subsection, a property separated from a community growth
boundary by a transportation or utility right- of-way (whether fee simple
estate or lesser interest in realty) is deemed to be contiguous along the
length of such right-of-way; or
         (d)   Where multiple contiguous parcels of land under one ownership
constitute a project, at least one parcel is within or contiguous to a
community growth boundary as designated on the County Comprehensive Plan.
      (2)   The tract of land receiving the Institutional District shall total
no more than 100 acres except where the applicant can demonstrate that the
increased size is required to meet the needs of the proposed development.
   (C)   Approval criteria.
      (1)   Approval or disapproval of a request for the application of the
Institutional Zoning District shall be determined through evaluation of several
criteria to establish whether the proposed project meets the purpose and intent
of the zoning district. In addition to the requirements in §
1-19-3.110.4(A)(1)-(6), the Planning Commission and County Council shall
evaluate the project on the following criteria:
         (a)   The project provides facilities that are planned and located in
accordance with the Frederick County community design guidelines and
development principles while considering the purpose and intent of the
agricultural/rural or institutional land use designation;
         (b)   The proposed use will be compatible with existing or anticipated
surrounding uses in terms of size, building scale and style, intensity,
setbacks, and landscaping, or the proposal provides for mitigation of
differences in appearance or scale through such means as setbacks, screening,
landscaping or other design features. Anticipated surrounding uses shall be
determined based upon existing zoning and land use designations;
         (c)   The project provides a safe and efficient arrangement of land
use, buildings, traffic and pedestrian circulation systems, and infrastructure;
         (d)   The transportation system is adequate to serve the proposed use
in addition to existing uses in the area. Evaluation factors include roadway
capacity and level of service, on-street parking impacts, access requirements,
a traffic management plan, neighborhood impacts, and pedestrian safety;
         (e)   Natural features of the site have been adequately considered and
utilized in the design of the project. Evaluation factors include the
relationship of existing natural features to man-made features both on-site and
in the immediate vicinity;
         (f)   Fire/rescue and law enforcement facilities are adequate to serve
the proposed project within established county standards.
         (g)   If the tract of land receiving the Institutional Floating Zoning
District is designated other than No Planned Service (NPS) on the water and
sewerage master plan then the project will be developed using publicly owned
community water and sewer or a duly approved multi-use system. Those tracts of
land receiving the Institutional Floating Zoning District and reflecting a
designation of NPS shall utilize methods other than publicly owned community
water and sewer meeting the requirements of and receiving approval from the
Maryland Department of the Environment/the Frederick County Health Department.
         (h)   Environmental, geological, and hydrological features of the site
and surrounding area have been adequately considered in the design of the
project.
   (D)   Review and approval procedures.
      (1)   Phase I justification and floating zone reclassification. The
procedure for Phase I approval will be the same as for zoning map amendments as
established in §§
1-19-3.110.1 through

DIVISION 10. OPEN SPACE RECREATION FLOATING ZONING DISTRICT
§ 1-19-10.1000. OPEN SPACE RECREATION FLOATING ZONING DISTRICT (OSR).
   (A)   Purpose and intent.
      (1)   The Open Space Recreation District is a floating zone established
to provide for the location and development of large-scale recreational uses
including recreational vehicle campgrounds, golf courses, zoo/botanical garden/
arboretums, and fairgrounds in areas with an agricultural/rural County
Comprehensive Plan land use designation. These types of development provide for
active and/or passive recreation adding to the opportunities for outdoor
exercise, appreciation of scenic areas, and enjoyment and access to open space.
As natural resource dependent uses, large recreational developments can consume
large areas of land for parking, infrastructure, and related facilities leading
to adverse impacts on surrounding properties and neighborhoods. Review and
siting of these facilities through a floating zone process will enable the
location of these facilities to areas contiguous to a community growth boundary
to provide a transition between growth areas and existing agricultural uses, to
mitigate or minimize impacts to surrounding properties, mitigate or avoid
traffic congestion which improves pedestrian and roadway safety, and to
maintain the purpose of the agricultural/rural areas identified by the County
Comprehensive Plan.
   (B)   Size and location.
      (1)   The Open Space Recreation District may be established where:
         (a)   The tract of land receiving the Open Space Recreation District
has a County Comprehensive Plan land use designation of agricultural/rural; and
         (b)   The tract of land receiving the Open Space Recreation District
has frontage on and direct access to a roadway with at least a collector
status, as designated by the County Comprehensive Plan, and is built or will be
upgraded by the applicant to said classification requirements. The County
Council may waive or modify this requirement where the tract of land receiving
the Open Space Recreation District is within two miles of a grade separated
interchange on a controlled access freeway/ expressway; and
         (c)   The tract of land receiving the Open Space Recreation District
is within two miles of a grade separated interchange on a controlled access
freeway/expressway, or the tract of land is within or contiguous to a community
growth boundary as designated on the County Comprehensive Plan. For the
purposes of this subsection, a property separated from a community growth
boundary by a transportation or utility right-of-way (whether fee simple estate
or lesser interest in realty) is deemed to be contiguous along the length of
such right-of-way; or
         (d)   Where multiple contiguous parcels of land under one ownership
constitute a project, at least one parcel is within or contiguous to a
community growth boundary as designated on the County Comprehensive Plan; and
      (2)   The tract of land receiving the Open Space Recreation District
shall have a minimum parcel size of: 10 acres for a recreational vehicle
campground, and a minimum of 25 acres and a maximum of 200 acres for
fairgrounds except where the applicant can demonstrate the increased size is
required to meet the needs of the proposed development.
   (C)   Approval criteria.
      (1)   Approval or disapproval of a request for the application of the
Open Space Recreation Zoning District shall be determined through evaluation of
several criteria to establish whether the proposed project meets the purpose
and intent of the zoning district. In addition to the requirements in §
1-19-3.110.4(A)(1)-(6), the Planning Commission and County Council shall
evaluate the project on the following criteria:
         (a)   The project provides facilities that are planned and located in
accordance with the Frederick County community design guidelines and
development principles while considering the purpose and intent of the
agricultural/rural land use designation;
         (b)   The proposed use will be compatible with existing or anticipated
surrounding uses in terms of size, building scale and style, intensity,
setbacks, and landscaping or the proposal provides for mitigation of
differences in appearance or scale through such means as setbacks, screening,
landscaping or other design features. Anticipated surrounding uses shall be
determined based upon existing zoning and land use designations;
         (c)   The project provides a safe and efficient arrangement of land
use, buildings, traffic and pedestrian circulation systems, and infrastructure;
         (d)   The transportation system is adequate to serve the proposed use
in addition to existing uses in the area. Evaluation factors include roadway
capacity and level of service, on-street parking impacts, access requirements,
neighborhood impacts, and pedestrian safety;
         (e)   Natural features of the site have been adequately considered and
utilized in the design of the project. Evaluation factors include the
relationship of existing natural features to man-made features both on-site and
in the immediate vicinity;
         (f)   Fire/rescue and law enforcement facilities are adequate to serve
the proposed project within established county standards.
         (g)   If the tract of land receiving the Open Space Recreation
Floating Zoning District is designated other than No Planned Service (NPS) on
the water and sewerage master plan then the project will be developed using
publicly owned community water and sewer. Those tracts of land receiving the
Open Space Recreation Floating Zoning District and reflecting a designation of
NPS shall utilize methods other than publicly owned community water and sewer
meeting the requirements of and receiving approval from the Maryland Department
of the Environment/the Frederick County Health Department.
         (h)   Environmental, geological, and hydrological features of the site
and surrounding area have been adequately considered in the design of the
project.
         (i)   When a tract of land for which the Open Space Recreation Zone is
proposed, is located wholly or partly within a Frederick County Priority
Preservation Area (PPA), the project shall in addition to the other
requirements of this section be evaluated to ascertain consistency with the
purpose and intent of the PPA. This evaluation shall include the following
factors: existence of prime farmland soils as identified in the USDA Soil
Survey for Frederick County, existing agricultural easements surrounding the
tract, development potential, and the tract size and location within the PPA.
In the event the approving body determines the project as proposed is
inconsistent with the purpose and intent of the PPA, the approving body may
impose conditions to mitigate the inconsistency or deny the application.
   (D)   Review and approval procedures.
      (1)   Phase I justification and floating zone reclassification. The
procedure for Phase I approval will be the same as for zoning map amendments as
established in §§
1-19-3.110.1 through

      (2)   Phase II execution.  The procedure for Phase II approval shall
follow the applicable subdivision or site development plan approval process.
Prior to applying for Phase II where publicly owned community water and sewer
are available to serve the proposed project, a classification of W-5, S-5 on
the Frederick County Water and Sewerage Master Plan shall be obtained.
Subdivision shall occur in accordance with county subdivision regulations. Site
development plan review shall occur in accordance with §§

course, may not be proposed as the sole means to satisfy this requirement. Only
the physical structure (i.e. footprint) of the clubhouse/multi-purpose building
(s), not the parking area(s), will be considered in determining the area of
active recreational open space;
         (d)   Passive recreational space, including but not limited to, picnic
areas, gazebos, pocket parks and/or other similar passive recreational
amenities; and
         (e)   An appropriate phasing schedule in each phase of development to
meet the needs of the residents.
      (6)   If the age-restricted community is an adaptive reuse of an existing
structure or structures, or if, due to unusual circumstances of shape and
topography or other physical features or conditions of the development, or
because of the nature of adjacent developments, or due to the existence of
resources that will be shared with adjacent developments, extraordinary
hardship will result from strict compliance with the requirements set forth in
subsections (F)(5)(a) through (F)(5)(d) of this section, the Planning
Commission may grant a modification of these requirements. The applicant must
submit a justification statement with its request for the modification,
together with evidence that the development meets the requirements stated above
for the requested modification. However, the Planning Commission may not grant
a modification that will have the effect of substantially altering or
nullifying the intent and purpose of this section. In granting modifications,
the Planning Commission may require such conditions as are deemed necessary by
the Planning Commission in its sole judgment.
      (7)   Prior to granting APFO approval for the project, the County
Planning Commission must review and approve the proposed restrictive covenants
applicable to the project to ensure that the project is limited exclusively to
housing for older persons as specified under subsection (F)(3) above, and
excludes secondary school-aged or younger children from residency. These
covenants must require that appropriate enforcement mechanisms be in place to
enforce the age restriction and also ensure compliance with the requirements to
qualify as housing for older persons under the Fair Housing Act. The
restrictive covenants must also provide that any subsequent revisions or
modifications of the covenants pertaining to age limits for occupancy shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission for approval prior to recordation. These
revisions or modifications will require the re-approval of the Phase II plan,
site plan, zoning certificate, and subdivision plat(s), as necessary.
      (8)   Prior to recordation of subdivision plats and issuance of building
permits or the zoning certificate for the project, the restrictive covenants
described above in subsection (F)(7) must be recorded in the county land
records.
      (9)   Before any revision or modification to the project at any time in
the future, whether the project is built out and occupied or not, which has the
effect of removing or substantially modifying the age restriction for
residents, the project must first comply with the schools adequacy requirements
under this chapter.
      (10)   Any project approved under this section shall meet the
requirements of the sections of this chapter requiring that roads, public water
and sewerage facilities be adequate.
      (11)   "Appropriate enforcement mechanisms" as used in this section means
that the restrictive covenants for the project require the homeowners
association or similar entity, through a property management agent, to enforce
the age restrictions and ensure compliance with the requirements to qualify as
housing for older persons under the Fair Housing Act such that secondary
school-aged or younger children will be excluded as residents. If more than 1
homeowners association or similar entity is established for the project, then
the homeowners association or similar entity governing the housing for older
persons project shall have the primary responsibility for enforcing the age
restrictions and ensuring compliance with the requirements to qualify as
housing for older persons under the Fair Housing Act such that secondary
school-aged or younger children shall be excluded as residents.

a time period less than that shown above, when the decreased approval period
can be justified by the developer.
      (5)   If a developer is seeking concurrent subdivision and site plan
approval, the APFO testing shall be required as part of the subdivision
approval. Notes shall be placed on both documents specifying approved use(s).
   (E)   At the request of, and upon submission of adequate justification by,
the developer, the Planning Commission may extend the approval of adequate
public facilities beyond the time frame provided in division (D) above if the
Commission finds:
      (1)   All conditions of approval are being met; and
      (2)   All unrecorded lots or unbuilt site plan structures meet the
requirements for adequate school, road, water and sewerage capacity; or
capacity is vested for improvements constructed for roads (§

1-20-41(E)), or sewer (§
1-20-51(E)).
   (F)   The Planning Commission may grant APFO approval for time frames beyond
those specified in division (D) if preexisting conditions of rezoning or other
required phasing limitations, such as those provided in subsections (L) and (M)
below, warrant such action.
   (G)   If the preliminary plan or site plan approval expires or is voided
prior to the recording of all lots, the unrecorded lots or in the case of site
plans, unconstructed portion of the development, shall meet the requirements of
this chapter prior to again obtaining preliminary subdivision or site plan
approval.
   (H)   A developer seeking preliminary subdivision or site plan approval of a
development must comply with the county subdivision regulations and zoning
ordinance.
   (I)   Prior to recordation of final plats all Health Department and county
requirements must be met.
   (J)   For all developments which were exempt from this chapter or for which
APFO approval was granted, the subdivision lots must be recorded, or where no
subdivision is required, substantial construction pursuant to the site plan
must be commenced in order to remain exempt from future APFO testing.
   (K)   (1)   The developer may request that the time of approval for adequate
public facilities for a development be extended if a moratorium has been
imposed.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall grant the extension if the developer
establishes each of the following:
         (a)   The county imposed a moratorium;
         (b)   The development had APFO approval at the time the moratorium was
imposed;
         (c)   The Division of Water and Sewer Utilities certifies that water
and sewer capacity is adequate to serve the development or such portion as
required.
      (3)   The duration of the extension of the time of the APFO approval
shall be the longer of:
         (a)   The length of time remaining for the APFO approval at the time
the moratorium was imposed; or
         (b)   One year.
      (4)   Retesting of public facilities, other than water or sewer
facilities, shall not be required.
      (5)   The developer must make this request within six months after the
moratorium expires.

§ 1-20-10. CONDITIONAL APPROVAL.
   (A)   Conditional site plan, or preliminary plan, approval may be granted to
a development that does not have adequate public facilities at the time of
Planning Commission consideration, provided that the developer agrees to
provide the necessary improvements to make the facility adequate as allowed for
in §
1-20-11. If the developer improvements will not result in adequate capacity,
conditional approval shall not be granted, and preliminary plan and site plan
approval shall be denied.
   (B)   If any conditions of a Phase II or preliminary plat approval have not
been met, approval shall not be granted to a final subdivision plat.
   (C)   If conditional site plan approval has been granted, a building permit
shall not be issued until the conditions have been satisfied and the public
facilities have been determined to be adequate.

§ 1-20-11. DEVELOPER OPTION.
   A developer shall have the option to: (1) provide the public facility
improvements necessary to support the proposed development and to ensure
adequacy of public facilities set forth in this chapter; or (2) wait for public
facilities to become adequate by improvements made pursuant to the CIP or other
sources. A county, state or municipal agency may participate in the
improvements.

§ 1-20-12. ESCROW ACCOUNTS FOR CONTRIBUTIONS TO ROAD IMPROVEMENTS FOR LIMITED
IMPACT DEVELOPMENTS.
   (A)   In lieu of either providing the public facility improvements or
waiting for public facilities to become adequate as provided in §
1-20-11, the developer of a limited impact development shall have the option of
contributing money to an escrow account as set forth in this section, provided
the Planning Commission determines that the developer has fulfilled each of the
requirements of this section for such contribution.
   (B)   The amount of money the developer shall be required to place in the
escrow account (whether the escrow account is established or to be established)
for its limited impact development shall be the proportionate share of the
costs attributable to that limited impact development of making the road
improvements required to satisfy the roads adequacy requirements in §
1-20-31 for that limited impact development. This proportionate share shall be
based on an equitable allocation of traffic trips in the peak hour, and in the
critical direction or movement, that the proposed limited impact development is
estimated to cause, when measured against and accounting for the additional
capacity that the proposed road improvement will create. In arriving at the
equitable allocation for that limited impact development, the Planning
Commission shall consider the traffic impact of the limited impact development
as it relates to the entire road improvement being proposed. The Planning
Commission shall determine the equitable allocation based on the procedures
outlined in the Guidelines.
   (C)   The limited impact development applicant may request that the proposed
road improvement be designed or re-designed to create more new capacity than
that which is required for that limited impact development to satisfy the
adequacy requirements in §
1-20-31, if the Planning Commission determines that the road link or
intersection to be improved by the road improvement will require greater
improvement to accommodate other additional future development in the area
consistent with the County Comprehensive Plan.
   (D)   Once a road improvement is approved for a particular road link or
intersection and an escrow account is established, subsequent development
applications for limited impact developments shall either: (i) contribute its
equitable allocation of the approved road improvement to that escrow account,
until such time that the account is closed by the county; or (ii) build the
approved road improvement.
   (E)   The Planning Commission shall approve the escrow account contribution
request for a limited impact development if the Planning Commission determines
(based on the approved TIA and the Guidelines) that it would not be equitable
to impose the entire cost of the required road improvements on that limited
impact development because it would not have a substantial adverse impact on
traffic.
   (F)   The Planning Commission may approve a fee-in-lieu escrow account
contribution request, as determined by the state or county, which shall not be
subject to proportionate share requirements, if the constructed improvements
necessary to establish adequacy are practically infeasible due to circumstances
beyond the control of the applicant but which may be feasible if constructed as
a public or a public-developer partnership project. The applicant shall provide
justification for the request and the proposed fee-in-lieu payment shall be
consistent with the scope of the project, but not less than 5 percent of the
estimated cost of the improvements.
   (G)   The Planning Commission may disapprove the escrow account contribution
request for a limited impact development which will impact a roadway by between
15% and 30% of one level of service, if the Planning Commission determines that
50% or more of the escrow account funds, including the limited impact
development applicant's proportionate share, have been accumulated in an escrow
account for that road improvement. In determining whether a development has a
limited impact, the Planning Commission shall consider the general requirement
in §
1-20-6(B) that the developer not avoid the intent of this chapter by submitting
piecemeal applications and may deny an escrow request for a piecemeal
application.
   (H)   Once an escrow account is established, any non-exempt developer
generating more than 5 trips during the peak hour of the adjacent street, as
defined in §
1-20-5, having an impact on the road improvement project shall be required to
pay its proportionate share into the escrow account or, if applicable, make the
road improvements as provided in §
1-20-11 to gain adequate public facilities approval to allow development to
proceed.
   (I)   The escrow account shall be maintained by the county in an interest
bearing account and shall be used solely for road improvements benefitting the
property as determined by the county. While in most cases the escrow payments
will be explicitly allocated to specific improvements at certain locations,
escrow funds may be reallocated for any transportation improvements within the
same link or intersection, as outlined in the Guidelines, so long as the
transportation improvements provide an identifiable benefit to the roadway
links or intersections affected by that development. If, after 10 years from
the date of the first escrow account contribution, the county determines that
there is no reasonable probability of implementing the transportation
improvements described above in the next 6 years, the escrow account may be
closed. The funds in the escrow account may be transferred to another escrow
account within the same planning region, at the discretion of the Planning
Commission, for the purpose of constructing other unbuilt escrow account
projects. If the money paid into an escrow account for road improvements
exceeds actual costs, the applicant may seek a refund. Any application for
refund must be filed with the Director of Finance within 1 year of the time at
which the funds become available for refund.
   (J)   If the Planning Commission approves an escrow fund for road
improvements under this section and the development meets all other
requirements under this chapter, then the Planning Commission shall grant APFO
approval to the development.
   (K)   If a developer constructs road improvements for which an escrow
account has been established pursuant to this section, the funds in the escrow
account shall not be transferred to any other improvement and shall be made
available to the developer to defray the construction costs of the improvements
minus that developer's proportionate share of the improvement in a manner
outlined in the Guidelines.
   (L)   A county, state or municipal government agency may participate in the
construction of or reimbursement for road improvements for which an escrow
account has been established.

§ 1-20-30. THRESHOLDS.
   (A)   Except where an APFO escrow account (§
1-20-12 (H)) has already been established, this article does not apply to
developments which are expected to generate 50 or less total vehicle trips
during the highest daily peak hour of the adjacent street traffic, as defined
by the most recent edition of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE)
"Trip Generation Manual," or the Frederick County Guidelines for the use
category determined by the Division. Site generated trips are the sum of all
peak hour traffic trips in and out of the proposed site.
   (B)   In determining whether a proposed development exceeds the thresholds
described in §
1-20-30(A), all land at one location within the county under common ownership
or control by a developer shall be included. A developer shall not purposefully
avoid the intent of this section by submitting piecemeal applications for
preliminary plans or site plans. However, a developer may seek approval of only
a portion of a subdivision or development, even if the site would generate less
trips than the thresholds in this section, provided that upon seeking approval
of the remaining subdivision or development which generates trips greater than
the thresholds, including that approved previously under this subsection, the
development shall comply with the requirements of this section.

§ 1-20-31. DETERMINATION OF ADEQUACY.
   (A)   If a development application meets or exceeds the thresholds outlined
in §
1-20-30, a traffic impact analysis (TIA) shall be prepared, and the Planning
Commission shall determine if the road adequacy requirements of this chapter
have been or will be met. The portion of existing road(s) required to be
adequate shall be determined by the Division, based on the completed and signed
Notice of Intent to Develop (NID), as required in the guidelines, and either a
pre-study conference or documented correspondence between the county and the
developer. The Division shall use the guidelines to adopt a reasonable study
area based on sound traffic engineering knowledge of the site and the
surrounding area. Upon finalization of the study area or scope, the Division
shall make this documentation available to the public on the county website.
Any disputes regarding study area or scope, whether raised prior to or after
the adoption of a study area, shall be resolved by the Planning Commission.
      (1)   All freeway and expressway mainlines and the uninterrupted flow
portion of ramps shall be exempt from the requirements herein.
      (2)   All other roads and intersections in the county shall be subject to
the requirements herein.
   (B)   Review of the TIA shall be the responsibility of the Division or its
designee. The Division will determine if the TIA adequately and accurately
examines the existing roads and intersections within the identified study area
or scope and determine if the TIA meets the provisions of this chapter, the
Guidelines, and the policies of the Division. Upon acceptance of the TIA, the
Division shall provide the completed documentation to the Planning Commission
and make a copy available to the public on the county website.
   (C)   The TIA shall be prepared for the design hours, which are defined as
the peak hours which will be most affected by the proposed development; i.e.,
any combination of a.m., mid-day, p.m., evening, weekend peak hour of the
adjacent street, or peak hour of the generation by the land use as determined
by the Division. The TIA shall include, but not be limited to:
      (1)   Vehicle trip generation by the proposed development and traffic
expected to be generated by approved development in the study area as outlined
in the guidelines and as determined by the Division. The latest edition of the
ITE "Trip Generation Manual" shall be used unless specifically applicable rates
are identified in or permitted by the guidelines;
      (2)   LOS capacity analysis of all required roadway corridors,
intersections and links for existing conditions and specified intermediate and
future conditions with and without the proposed development as delineated in
the guidelines;
      (3)   In cases where traffic safety is identified as an issue by the
County, Sheriff's Office, or Maryland Department of Transportation State
Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), reported traffic crashes for the last 3
years for which data is available;
      (4)   Transportation improvements currently fully funded for construction
in the most recent CIP or CTP by or before the year of expected completion of
the project or project phase, assuming the project buildout criteria in §
1-20-8;
      (5)   Other improvements approved and permitted by the county, state or a
municipality, or under construction, with a certification by that agency that
construction is likely to be completed concurrent with the opening of the
development project; and
      (6)   Any other information that may reasonably be required by the
Division to effectively evaluate the road network or application.
   (D)   All TIAs shall use the analysis procedures and methodologies set forth
in the guidelines.
   (E)   Using methodologies specified in the guidelines, the following level
of service criteria shall be met to determine road adequacy.
      (1)   For developments which are expected to generate greater than 100
total vehicle trips during the highest daily peak hour of the adjacent street
traffic, then:
         (a)   Signalized intersections and roundabouts will be considered
adequate if a LOS "D" or better is maintained.
         (b)   All other roadway links, unsignalized intersections and
corridors, when required by the Division, based on sound traffic engineering
principles, will be considered adequate if a LOS "D" or better is maintained,
or mitigation is provided in accordance with the guidelines.
      (2)   For developments which are expected to generate 100 or fewer total
vehicle trips during the highest daily peak hour of the adjacent street
traffic, then:
         (a)   Signalized intersections and roundabouts located within
designated growth boundaries in the County Comprehensive Plan will be
considered adequate if a LOS "E" or better is maintained.
         (b)   Signalized Intersections and roundabouts located outside of
these growth areas shall be considered adequate if a LOS "D" or better is
maintained.
         (c)   All other roadway and ramp links, unsignalized intersections and
corridors when required by the Division, based on sound traffic engineering
principles, shall be determined to be acceptable if a LOS "D" or better is
maintained or mitigation is provided in accordance with the guidelines.
      (3)   Upon sufficient justification by the applicant, the Planning
Commission may modify the mitigation standard specified in paragraph (1) above,
and apply the standard specified in paragraph (2). In making such decision, the
Planning Commission must determine that the following criteria have been met:
         (a)   Regularly scheduled public transportation is available in the
immediate area impacted by the proposed development; and
         (b)   The proposed location of the development is within designated
growth boundaries in the County Comprehensive Plan.
      (4)   For land uses resulting in seasonal or irregularly scheduled
special events or activities, which will generate relatively large amounts of
traffic, generally not impacting the peak hour of the adjacent streets,
adequacy may be determined by review of a traffic management plan (TMP), if
required by the Division. The projected number of vehicle trips for each
special event, the classification and character of the roads which will be
utilized to transport vehicles to and from the event, and the number of days
per year the event will be held, shall be considered. The TMP shall be in
accordance with the guidelines and supplement the specific standards set forth
in subsections (B) and (C) above, as determined by the Planning Commission. In
the event the facility would also contain permanent regular uses, in addition
to special events, the regular peak period uses of the facility must be
reviewed and comply with all parts of this article.
   (F)   Master plan bicycle and/or pedestrian facilities, as well as any
sidewalks, shall be constructed or improved if these facilities are either non-
existent or deemed inadequate by the Division. The Planning Commission may
approve a fee-in-lieu of an improvement if justified by the Developer.
   (G)   If the road facilities are determined to be inadequate to accommodate
the traffic flow projected by the TIA, the preliminary plan or site plan
approval shall be denied, except as provided for in §
1-20-10.
   (H)   Transportation facilities necessary to mitigate inadequacies shall be
determined by the Planning Commission after reviewing the entire record,
including the TIA, TMP, safety considerations, sight distance, horizontal
curvature, vertical grades, roadway section, structural adequacy of roads and
bridges, bike and pedestrian needs, and MDOT SHA comments; and improvements,
when justified to support or complement the development, or mitigate its
impacts, may be provided by the developer as prescribed in §
1-20-12.
   (I)   A development shall be responsible only for the construction of
roadway improvements that mitigate those trips that will be generated by the
development.
   (J)   If the development provides full mitigation (construction or fair
share contribution to escrow accounts as required under the LOU or DRRA) of
APFO road improvements for a development within the APFO approval period, the
APFO road approval shall be vested for the capacity created by the improvements
and shall not be subject to further APFO roadway testing unless there is an
increase in site trips or a significant redistribution of site traffic because
of a change in land use or increase in site density, as defined in the
guidelines.

§ 1-20-41. DETERMINATION OF ADEQUACY.
   (A)   A public or private community water system shall be considered
adequate if, given existing connections, future connections from buildings
under construction, recorded lots for which allocations have been made and
multi-year tap agreements:
      (1)   The source facilities, storage tanks and local pumping stations
have sufficient available capacity to provide maximum day demand to the
proposed development and meet peak hour demand in addition to fire flow; and
      (2)   The distribution system is capable of providing normal required
pressure as well as minimal residual pressure to the proposed development. It
should be noted that water taps are not guaranteed for the project until such
taps are purchased or a multi- year tap agreement has been executed between the
county and developer.
   (B)   A public or private community water system may also be considered
adequate if improvements to or construction of facilities necessary to comply
with standards established in subsection (A) are scheduled in the first 2 years
of the CIP. However, where improvements to or construction of facilities
necessary to comply with subsection (A) are in the first 2 years of the CIP and
are developer-funded, no other proposed development may utilize the capacity
created by the developer-funded improvements or facilities to determine
adequacy under this article until the improvements or facilities are completed,
subject to subsection (E) of this section. If only a portion of the
improvements or facilities in the first 2 years of the CIP are developer-
funded, that portion of the improvements or facilities may not be used to
determine adequacy of any other proposed developments until the improvements or
facilities are completed, subject to subsection (E).
   (C)   If a public or private water system is found to be inadequate, site
plan, PUD or MXD Phase II or preliminary subdivision approval shall be denied
except as provided for in §
1-20-10.
   (D)   Improvements necessary to meet the standards herein shall be
determined by the Planning Commission and may be provided by the developer as
allowed for in §

   (A)   The sewerage system shall be considered adequate if, given existing
connections, future connections from buildings under construction, recorded
lots for which allocations have been made and multi-year tap agreements, the
systems designed to serve the proposed development are sufficient to
accommodate ultimate peak flows. It should be noted that sewer taps are not
guaranteed for the project until such taps are purchased or a multi-year tap
agreement has been executed between the county and developer.
   (B)   The sewerage system may also be considered adequate if improvements to
or construction of facilities necessary to comply with standards established in
subsection (A) are scheduled in the first 2 years of the CIP. However, where
improvements to or construction of facilities necessary to comply with
subsection (A) are in the first 2 years of the CIP and are developer-funded, no
other development may utilize the capacity created by the new or improved
facilities to determine adequacy under this article until the improvements or
facilities are completed, subject to subsection (E) of this section. If only a
portion of the improvements or facilities in the first 2 years of the CIP are
developer-funded, then that portion of the improvements or facilities may not
be used by any other development to determine adequacy under this article until
the improvements or facilities are completed, subject to subsection (E).

§ 1-20-61. DETERMINATION OF ADEQUACY.
   (A)   Scope. All public elementary, middle and high schools serving the
proposed subdivision shall be adequate.
   (B)   APFO test data.
      (1)   The Frederick County Public Schools will publish actual enrollment
data for the last school day of September, December, March and June and the
state rated capacity for each elementary and secondary school. Adequacy of
every elementary, middle and high school serving the proposed development shall
be determined as of the APFO test date, using the most recent quarterly
enrollment data published by the Frederick County Public Schools. If approval
has not been received from the Planning Commission within 6 months of the APFO
test date, the most recent quarterly school enrollment data must be utilized by
the Commission for APFO review unless a delay occurs not attributable to the
applicant.
      (2)   Pupil generation rates shall be determined using the formulas
adopted by the Frederick County Public Schools and shall reflect the
characteristics of the school attendance area within which the proposed
development is located. Pupil yield from the proposed development shall be pro-
rated over the number of years for which APFO approval is sought. State rated
capacities and pupil generation rates approved for use by the Frederick County
Public Schools shall be used in all calculations.
   (C)   Adequacy testing. Schools shall be considered adequate if the
enrollment for each school serving the development is less than 100% of state-
rated capacity during the entire period for which APFO approval is granted by
the Planning Commission. School adequacy shall be determined based on:
      (1)   Background enrollment growth, extrapolated over the number of years
for which APFO approval is requested;
      (2)   Projected enrollment growth, including pupils anticipated to be
generated by "approved developments", as defined in §
1-20-5(B);
      (3)   Pupils anticipated to be generated by the proposed development
using pupil generation rates adopted by the Frederick County Public Schools;
      (4)   Actual capacity expected to be provided by new schools and school
additions scheduled for construction in the first 2 years of the CIP (provided
that the CIP project and the proposed development are located within the same
school attendance boundaries, including areas where redistricting boundaries
have been approved) after taking the factors listed above in (C)(1), (2) and
(3) into account; and
      (5)   Other enrollment data, trends and factors, including phasing in of
new school capacity, that may impact the capacity of the schools serving the
proposed development, as determined by the BOE or its designee.
   (D)   Procedure. County staff shall send a written request to the BOE or its
designee, requesting a school adequacy test, and specifying: (1) the number of
years for which the development should be tested; (2) the number and types of
residential units to be tested; and (3) data concerning the approved
developments in the school attendance areas that should be factored into the
test. The BOE or its designee shall forward its school adequacy test results to
county staff for presentation to the Planning Commission. After consideration
of the school adequacy test results at a public meeting, the Planning
Commission shall determine whether the proposed development meets the school
adequacy requirements in this Article VI.
   (E)   Request to redistrict. If a school is not adequate as defined in §
1-20-61(C) and an adjoining school district at the same level is at least 20%
below state rated capacity, then the applicant may request the Frederick County
Board of Education (BOE) to determine the viability of redistricting to
accommodate the new development. If the BOE determines that redistricting is a
viable alternative, and the BOE approves a specific redistricting plan that
would result in all the schools serving the proposed development meeting the
standards established in §
1-20-61(C), then the schools shall be considered adequate.
   (F)   Denial. If a school is not adequate and the BOE has not approved a
specific redistricting plan that would result in the school meeting the
standards established in §
1-20-61(C), then the preliminary subdivision, PUD or MXD Phase II or site plan
approval shall be denied, except as allowed for in §
1-20-10.
   (G)   Mitigation. Improvements necessary to meet the standards herein shall
be determined by the Planning Commission and may be provided by the developer
as allowed for in §
1-20-11.
   (H)   New school or addition. If a new school or school addition is required
to be wholly or partially funded by a developer in order for a proposed
development to obtain APFO approval under §
1-20-11 of this article, and if the new school or school addition is approved
by the BOE:
      (1)   The portion of the school capacity funded by the developer and
required for APFO approval for the development may not be utilized by any other
development to obtain APFO approval until the expiration of the APFO approval
period for the development that funded the school improvements.
      (2)   Upon the completion of construction of the new school or school
addition, the development that funded the school improvements shall not be
subject to further APFO testing for the school level at which the developer-
funded improvements were provided (elementary, middle or high school) unless
the density or intensity of the development increases.
   (I)   School renovations.
      (1)   For the purposes of determining adequacy under this section, the
available capacity of a school which is completely or partially closed for
renovation shall be the percentage of the school state- rated capacity
available and certified for use by the Board of Education or designated FCPS
staff. One hundred percent of the available state-rated capacity of the school
under renovation shall be considered to be available 6 months prior to the
expected renovation completion date as certified by the Board of Education or
designated FCPS facilities staff.
   (2)   For the purposes of determining adequacy under this section, the
available capacity of a school which is being utilized to serve students from
another school which is under renovation shall be the percentage of the school
state-rated capacity available and certified for use by the Board of Education
or designated FCPS staff. One hundred percent of the available state-rated
capacity of the school shall be considered to be available 6 months prior to
the expected renovation completion date as certified by the Board of Education
or designated FCPS facilities staff.
   (J)   Multifamily residential developments.
      (1)   A multifamily residential development may retain its APFO school
adequacy approval if the multifamily residential development satisfies both of
the following requirements:
         (a)   The Planning Commission has previously granted both site plan
and APFO approvals for the multifamily residential development; and
         (b)   Prior to expiration of APFO approval, the developer has recorded
in the land records a plat of the multifamily residential development property
that includes a note indicating the following information, on which the
Planning Commission approval was based:
            (i)   The number and type of multifamily dwelling units approved,
and
            (ii)   The total number of students projected to be generated by
the multifamily residential development.
      (2)   The County Attorney's office must approve the language of the plat
note described in subsection (J)(1)(b) prior to plat recordation.
      (3)   The Planning Commission may approve a change in the number and type
of multifamily dwelling units, so long as the total number of students
projected to be generated by the revised multifamily residential development
does not exceed the total number of students stated in the plat note described
in subsection (J)(1)(b).
      (4)   Recordation of a plat in accordance with this subsection shall not
prevent site plan expiration.

§ 1-20-62 SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION FEE OPTION.
   (A)   The provisions of this section shall apply only to those developments
approved to use the school construction fee option, as documented by an APFO
Letter of Understanding or development rights and responsibilities agreement
(DRRA) fully executed by the developer and the county on or prior to July 20,
2016. No new developments may choose to use the school construction fee option
after July 20, 2016.
   (B)   School construction fees shall be paid in addition to, and not in lieu
of, public school development impact fees under
Chapter 1-22 of the Frederick County Code.
   (C)   If a development has not entered into a DRRA with the county but was
approved to use the school construction fee option prior to July 20, 2016 by a
fully executed APFO Letter of Understanding, and if that APFO Letter of
Understanding has expired, the development may apply for APFO re-testing and
mitigate school capacity by using the school construction fee option, provided
that all of the following requirements are met as of the APFO Test Date:
      (1)   The total size of the development is equal to or less than 60
dwelling units;
      (2)   More than 50% of the dwelling units in the development are built
out and have certificates of occupancy;
      (3)   The total number of projected students upon re-testing does not
exceed ten, including all school levels;
      (4)   No school serving or proposed to serve the development exceeds 120%
of State Rated Capacity, taking into account actual capacity expected to be
provided by new schools and school additions scheduled for construction in the
first two years of the CIP;
      (5)   All public roads in the development have been built to county
standards and accepted by the county for public maintenance; and
      (6)   All unplatted lots remaining in the development must be included in
the APFO re-testing in accordance with this subsection. A development may not
submit piecemeal applications for re-testing portions of an uncompleted
development.
   (D)   The APFO Letter of Understanding and any DRRA for the development
shall incorporate provisions for payment of the school construction fees.
   (E)   School construction fees due to the county shall be listed on the
Department of Permits and Inspections fee schedule.
   (F)   School construction fees shall be paid at the time of recording of
subdivision plats for each unit, except for multi-family units, which shall be
paid not later than the time of building permit application. The school
construction fees to be applied to each residential unit shall be the fees in
effect at the time of plat recordation or building permit application.
   (G)   Annual adjustment. On July 1, 2021, and on July 1 of each year
thereafter in which the school construction fee is in effect, the amount of the
school construction fee per dwelling unit and school level, shall be adjusted
annually as follows:
      (1)   On or before January 15, 2021, and on or before January 15 of each
year thereafter, the county executive shall provide to the County Council a
report which proposes an annual adjustment to the school construction fee. The
adjustment shall be calculated by taking into account the most recent data from
the State of Maryland School Construction Cost Index. For purposes of this
calculation, the "State of Maryland School Construction Cost Index" shall be
the statewide per-square-foot school building and site development cost as
established and adjusted annually by the State of Maryland interagency
committee on school construction.
         (a)   The annual adjustment to the school construction fee may also
include changes to other factors and data components in the fee calculations.
         (b)   A component of the fee calculation is the pupil yield rate,
which is the average number of pupils expected to be generated per housing unit
type and school level. Whenever possible, the pupil yield rates used in the fee
calculation shall be the pupil yield rates calculated for the developments
currently paying the school construction mitigation fee. Otherwise, the pupil
yield rates used in the fee calculation shall be the pupil yield rates
calculated for developments of similar location and composition.
      (2)   The proposed annual adjustment shall take effect on July 1, the
first day of the fiscal year immediately following receipt of the report,
unless the County Council enacts a bill that takes effect on or before June 30
of the same year as the report, to change or maintain the current school
construction fee.
   (H)   School Construction Fee Account.
      (1)   A School Construction Fee Account is hereby established.
      (2)   All school construction fees that the county collects shall be
deposited into the School Construction Fee Account.
      (3)   The School Construction Fee Account shall be interest bearing.
      (4)   All interest earned on monies deposited to this account shall be
credited to and shall be considered funds of the account.
      (5)   The county shall establish and implement necessary accounting
controls to ensure that the school construction fee funds are properly
deposited, accounted for, and appropriated in accordance with this chapter, and
any other applicable legal requirements.
      (6)   The county may appropriate funds from the School Construction Fee
Account for:
         (a)   Public school facility expenditures as defined in §
1-20-5(B), and
         (b)   The payment of principal, interest and other financing costs on
contracts, bonds, notes or other obligations issued by or on behalf of the
county or other applicable local governmental entities to finance public school
facility expenditures.
      (7)   The Finance Division shall document each appropriation from the
School Construction Fee Account.
   (I)   The payment of the school construction fee or the obligation to pay
the school construction fee under the terms of an APFO Letter of Understanding
or DRRA shall not satisfy the public school adequacy requirement for any other
development served by the same school or schools as the proposed development.
   (J)   Upon payment of all school construction fees applicable to the
proposed development, the development shall not be subject to further testing
for school adequacy under the APFO for the duration of the APFO approval period
under the DRRA or APFO Letter of Understanding, unless the density or intensity
of the development increases.

regeneration area meets the conditions of §
1-21-25(B)(1) the balance of the guarantee shall be returned or released.
      (4)   For projects containing existing forest retention, forestation, or
a combination of retention and forestation, 50% of the financial guarantee

§ 1-21-29. FOREST BANKING PROGRAM.
   (A)   Creation and purpose.
      (1)   In general. The Frederick County Forest Banking Program allows a
person to create new forest areas or designate certain existing forest areas to
be held in reserve (or “banked”), in order to be used to meet future
forestation requirements imposed on regulated activities by this chapter.
      (2)   Definitions.
         EXISTING FOREST. Forest that:
            1.   Meets or exceeds the definition of “standard forest density”
provided in §
1-21-5 when the forest banking applicant submits a forest conservation plan; or
            2.   Met or exceeded the standard forest density at any time in the
5 years prior to the submission of the forest conservation plan, and that was
subject to either an agricultural or a commercial forestry declaration of
intent.
         NEW FOREST. Forest newly created on land that does not meet the
definition of “standard forest density” at the time the forest banking
applicant submits a forest conservation plan, and that was not the subject of
forest cutting subject to either  an agriculture or commercial forestry
declaration of intent within the last 5 years.
   (B)   Forest banking areas. Only the following target areas may be admitted
into the forest banking program:
      (1)   New or existing forests that provide buffers for streams, creeks,
floodplains, wetlands or other hydrologically-sensitive areas on lands that
either are zoned Agriculture or in the judgment of the Department are primarily
in bona fide agricultural use, as defined by the Frederick County Zoning
Ordinance,
Chapter 1-19. The extent of the forest buffers acceptable for inclusion in the
forest banking program shall be the largest allowed by the following, unless
otherwise approved by the Department for reasons pertaining to ecological
benefit or improvement:
         (a)   Where floodplain(s) exist, forest buffers shall be limited to 25
feet outside of the floodplain(s).
         (b)   Where no floodplain(s) exist, forest buffers shall be limited to
100 feet in width on each side of a stream bank.
         (c)   Where moderate slopes of 15% or more are immediately adjacent to
hydrologically- sensitive area(s), forest buffers shall be limited to the
extent of the steep slopes within the area that is 200 feet in width on each
side of a stream bank or hydrologically-sensitive area.
         (d)   Where steep slopes of 25% or more are immediately adjacent to
hydrologically- sensitive area(s), forest buffers shall be limited to the
extent of the steep slopes within the area that is 500 feet in width on each
side of a stream bank or hydrologically-sensitive area.
      (2)   Existing forest that is critical habitat for threatened or
endangered plant or sedentary animal species. Determination of the presence of
threatened or endangered species shall be made by the Department of Natural
Resources.
      (3)   Other areas that are:
         (a)   Water re-charge zones for municipal or county public water
supplies as designated by bona fide hydrological studies, or are listed in §
1-21-40(B) of this chapter;
         (b)   Not owned by a municipality or other local, state or federal
governmental entity;
         (c)   Not otherwise substantially protected by either this chapter or
the Frederick County Zoning Ordinance requirements; and
         (d)   Of such significance that loss of forest or the lack of creation
of forests on such areas would cause a deleterious effect on the health, safety
and welfare of the citizens.
      (4)   For all areas covered under subsection (B)(3), the first 50 acres
shall be credited at a 1:2.5 ratio, as described in subsection (E) of this
section. For all areas that exceed 50 acres, the mitigation ratio shall be 1:4,
meaning that for every 1 acre of required forestation, 4 acres of off-site,
existing forest must be protected and conserved. In no case shall the total
acres of such an application exceed 200 acres.
      (5)   All applications under this subsection (B) shall provide
substantial protection of substantially all of the target areas on a parcel or
a set of contiguous parcels owned by the applicant, unless otherwise approved
by the Department or the Planning Commission for reasons pertaining to
ecological benefit or improvement, other hydrological protection measures
implemented by other governmental programs, accommodation of existing farm
buildings and residences, or drinking water access for grazing animals. The
requirements of "substantial protection" shall be determined by the Department.
Applications that offer protection of only unserviceable or unusable areas for
inclusion in the banking program, but omit other substantial target areas, such
as stream buffers, within a subject parcel or set of contiguous parcels owned
by the applicant, shall not be accepted into the banking program.
   (C)   Administration. The Department shall administer the forest banking
program, review for approval all forest conservation plans, and keep records of
all forest banking sites and any transfers of forest bank credits from one
person to another. The Department shall review and have the authority to
approve all credit transfers for compliance with forest banking area
requirements. The Department shall perform all site inspections as required
herein, and as described in §
1-21-20, and shall administer required financial guarantees associated with
approved forest conservation plans.
   (D)   Conditions of approval. For a potential forest banking site to be
accepted into the Frederick County Forest Banking Program, all the conditions
set forth below must be satisfied.
      (1)   Forest conservation plan. The forest banking applicant shall submit
a forest conservation plan for review and approval by the Department.
      (2)   Standards and specifications.
         (a)   To create “new forest,” the applicant must follow forestation
specifications and standards provided in the technical manual or this chapter,
including (but not limited to) species selection, control of exotic species,
and stocking/survival ratios.
         (b)   For approval of “existing forest,” the applicant must
demonstrate that the forest ecosystem is in a healthy condition, or provide
remedial measures to bring the forest into a healthy condition, such as
providing eradication measures to control invasive, exotic species.
      (3)   Legal documents and financial guarantees. The applicant shall
execute and submit to the Department all necessary documents and financial
guarantees as follows:
         (a)   A long-term protective agreement, as described in §
1-21-10;
         (b)   A short-term protective agreement (a Forest Improvements and
Protection Agreement (FIPA)), as described in §
1-21-10 and any associated, required financial guarantee, as described in §
1-21-25; and
         (c)   A forest banking agreement that describes the rights and
obligations of the banking applicant with regard to the forest easement credit
transfers.
      (4)   Site inspection. Before the Department approves a transfer or use
of forest banking credits, the Department shall verify from the Department
inspector’s site review that the conditions of the approved final forest
conservation plan have been met with regard to establishment of protective
features and planting specifications; and that any:
         (a)   “Existing forest” meets the definition of “standard forest
density,” or is covered by an acceptable financial guarantee, as provided in §
1-21-25;
         (b)   “New forest” has been planted, and either:
            1.   Has matured to meet the definition of “standard forest
density;” or
            2.   Is covered by an acceptable FIPA and a financial guarantee, as
provided in §
1-21-25; has been planted in accordance with the final forest conservation
plan; and has been inspected and approved by Department inspectors.
      (5)   Financial agreements. Any financial agreements between persons
regarding approved forest bank transfers shall occur solely as a private
transaction. Neither the Department nor the county shall become a party to the
financial aspects of any transfers.
      (6)   Official notification of credit transfer. Both the grantor and
grantee of any forest credit transfer shall notify the Department in writing of
the agreement to transfer forest credit using forms approved by the Department.
   (E)   Credit ratios. Forest bank transfers of:
      (1)   “Existing forest” shall be credited at a 1:2.5 ratio, meaning that
for every 1 acre of required forestation, 2.5 acres of existing forest must be
acquired;
      (2)   “New forest” shall be credited at a 1:1 ratio, meaning that for
every 1 acre of required forestation, only 1 acre of new forest must be
acquired.
   (F)   Species diversity requirements. The acres of existing forest combined
with new forest shall meet the species diversity requirements stipulated in §
1-21-43(B)(2).

         (b)   Other forested areas that because of their size, location,
species composition, or quality are deemed by the Department as being worthy of
conserving permanently.
   (C)   Priority sequence for on-site forestation. After every reasonable
effort to minimize the cutting and clearing of trees and other woody plants in
on-site priority areas listed in §
1-21-40(B) has been exhausted, the following areas shall be considered the
priority sequence for on-site forestation:
      (1)   Buffers adjacent to intermittent and perennial streams to widths of
at least 50 feet from stream banks;
      (2)   Areas in 100 year floodplains and all other floodplains listed in
the Zoning Ordinance, §
1-19-9.100;
      (3)   Corridors to connect existing forests within or adjacent to the
development site with a minimum width of 300 feet where practical to facilitate
wildlife movement;
      (4)   Buffers adjacent to critical habitats where appropriate;
      (5)   Slopes of 25% or greater and slopes of 15% or greater with a soil K
value greater than 0.35, including the slopes of ravines or other natural
depressions;
      (6)   Areas identified as green infrastructure network and/or sensitive
species areas in the green infrastructure sector of the Livable Frederick
Master Plan;
      (7)   Buffers between differing land uses that are deemed to be
noncompatible by the Department or buffers adjacent to highways; and
      (8)   Lands adjacent to existing forests to increase the overall area of
contiguous forest cover, when appropriate.
   (D)   Priority sequence for forestation or mitigation off-site. After every
reasonable effort has been made to minimize the clearing of trees and other
woody plants in on-site priority areas listed in §
1-21-40(B), and after every reasonable effort has been made to afforest or
reforest priority areas listed in §
1-21-40(C), the following shall be considered the priority sequence for
forestation or mitigation off-site:
      (1)   Purchase of credits through the Frederick County Forest Banking
Program;
      (2)   Forestation of hydrologically-sensitive areas, preferably in
agriculturally zoned or used land;
      (3)   Protection of existing off-site forest at a 1:2.5 ratio, as
provided in subsection (G) of this section, in areas closely associated with
streams, wetlands, or floodplains, preferably in agriculturally zoned or used
land, when such land is not already substantially protected by the Zoning
Ordinance or other long-term protective instruments in perpetuity; and
      (4)   Payment into the fee-in-lieu program.
   (E)   Flexibility of priorities. A sequence other than the one described in
subsections (C) and (D) of this section may be used for a specific project, if
necessary, to achieve the objectives of the County Comprehensive Plan or county
land use policies or to take advantage of opportunities to consolidate forest
conservation efforts.
   (F)   Minimum forest areas.
      (1)   Forest areas to be retained or created by means of forestation
shall be a minimum of 10,000 square feet and shall be at least 35 feet wide.
Disjointed or noncontiguous forest areas shall be used only when more
continuous forest areas cannot be practically preserved or created, as
determined by the Department.
      (2)   Forest areas that utilize miscellaneous credits as provided in §
1-21-44 shall be a minimum of 2,500 square feet for each area, except for
individual trees in nonforested areas, which may be credited on a tree-by-tree
basis.
   (G)   Off-site existing forest mitigation. When off-site existing forest is
used to mitigate forestation requirements, the applicant must mitigate at a 1:
2.5 ratio, meaning that for every 1 acre of required forestation, 2.5 acres of
off-site existing forest must be protected and conserved.
   (H)   Easement restrictions. No FRO easements (long-term protection) shall
be allowed:
      (1)   Over septic areas or wells;
      (2)   On lots less than 40,000 square feet. However, forest in these
areas may be protected as “tree save area,” as provided in §
1-21-44; or
      (3)   Over existing preservation or utility easements.

§ 1-21-41. AFFORESTATION AND AFFORESTATION THRESHOLD.
   (A)   Definitions restated. AFFORESTATION under this section means the
planting of trees where no or little forest exists on-site, in order to meet
the afforestation thresholds. AFFORESTATION THRESHOLD means the percentage of a
net tract area up to which establishment of forest is required if the existing
forest area is less than the threshold, as determined by the land use category.
   (B)   Applicability. A person making application for a regulated activity
subject to this chapter, excluding those development projects listed in
subsection (C) of this section, shall comply with the afforestation
requirements provided in this section.
   (C)   Exceptions. Afforestation requirements shall not apply to the
following.
      (1)   Utility and linear projects that involve no change in land use.
      (2)   Those portions of residential subdivision lots over 3.0 acres, in
which:
         (a)   A pre-existing agricultural or open space land use will remain
unchanged for a period of at least 5 years; and
         (b)   The area over 3.0 acres is approved by the Department.
   (D)   Afforestation requirements. Afforestation on a tract or development
project shall be in accordance with the following requirements:
      (1)   A tract or development project having less than 20% of the net
tract area in forest cover shall be afforested to at least 20% of the net tract
area for the following zoning categories:
         (a)   Agriculture;
         (b)   Resource conservation; and
         (c)   R-1 residential.
      (2)   A tract or development project having less than 15% of the net
tract area in forest cover shall be afforested to at least 15% of the net tract
area for the following zoning categories:
         (a)   Institutional uses in any zone;
         (b)   R-3, R-5, R-8, R-12, R-16 residential zones and mobile home
parks;
         (c)   Mixed Use and Planned Development zones; and
         (d)   Commercial and Industrial Use zones.
   (E)   Forest removal below afforestation thresholds. Replacement
requirements for removal of forest, even if below the afforestation threshold,
are addressed in the reforestation formulas listed in §
1-21-42(D)(3) and applicants do not need to calculate replacement values
separately under this section.
(Ord. 01-20-294, 9-25-2001; Ord. 07-25-465, 7-19-2007; Ord. 09-26-530, 9-29-

§ 1-21-42. REFORESTATION AND CONSERVATION THRESHOLD.
   (A)   Applicability. A person making application for a regulated activity
under this chapter (including utility and linear projects) shall comply with
the reforestation requirements provided in this section. Required reforestation
shall be incorporated into the Final Forest Conservation Plan (FFCP).
Reforestation per the FFCP shall be accomplished in accordance with the
priorities listed in §
1-21-40(C) and (D).
   (B)   Calculation of requirements. There are two methods to calculate
reforestation requirements. The method that results in the most reforestation
shall be used.
      (1)   The first method shall require a 1:1 replacement. This means that
for every one acre (or portion thereof) of forest removed, one acre must be
planted.
      (2)   The second method, the "Standard Method", is set forth in §
1-21-42(D).
   (C)   Definitions restated. REFORESTATION under this section means the
planting of trees to replace forest that has been recently or is proposed to be
removed by development. CONSERVATION THRESHOLD means the percentage of the net
tract area at which the reforestation requirement changes from a ratio of one-
quarter acre planted for every 1 acre removed to a ratio of 2 acres planted for
every 1 acre removed according to the land use categories as listed below:
      Category of Use            Threshold
                        Percentage
(1)   Agricultural and Resource
   Conservation Zones, except for
   cluster developments therein which
   shall utilize R-1 values            50

(3)   Institutional use areas in any zone      20
(4)   R-3, R-5, R-8, R-12, R-16 and
   Mobile Home Park zoned areas         20
(5)   Mixed Use and Planned Unit
   Development zoned areas            15
(6)   Commercial and Industrial Use
   zoned areas                  15
Required reforestation under the Standard Method shall be calculated according
to the formulas provided in subsection (D) of this section.
   (D)   Standard Method calculations.
      (1)   For all existing forest cover cleared on the net tract area above
the applicable conservation threshold established by subsection (C) of this
section, the area of forest removed shall be reforested at a ratio of one
quarter acre planted for every acre removed.
      (2)   For all existing forest cover cleared on the net tract area below
the applicable conservation threshold, the area of forest removed shall be
reforested at a ratio of 2 acres planted for each acre removed.
      (3)   For each acre of forest retained on the net tract area above the
applicable conservation threshold, credit shall be given against the total
number of acres required to be reforested under subsection (D)(1) of this
section.
   (E)   Accuracy Standards. All calculations of reforestation requirements
shall be calculated to the nearest one-hundredth acre and shall be in
accordance with the worksheet provided in the Technical Manual and approved by
the Department. However, forest field measurements may be measured to the
nearest one-tenth acre.

   (C)   Invasive exotic species.
      (1)   Invasive exotic species listed in the Technical Manual, or by the
Department of Natural Resources, or the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service, shall not be used for forestation or landscape planting.
      (2)   Areas significantly infested, as determined by the Department, with
invasive exotic tree or shrub species shall be subject to a suppression effort
guided by a suppression plan prepared as part of the Final Forest Conservation
Plan.
   (D)   Stocking and survival rates. The stocking and survival rates of trees
and shrubs planted as part of forestation requirements in Frederick County
shall be as follows.
      (1)   Bare root seedlings and whips shall have a minimum stocking ratio
of 600 per acre and shall have a 75% survival rate, or at least 450 per acre.
Both overstory tree and understory tree/shrub species may be counted as part of
the 600 seedling/acre requirement; however, overstory trees (deciduous and
evergreen) shall constitute at least 75% of the total number of seedlings
planted.
      (2)   Container grown seedling tubes (with a minimum cavity width of 1.5
inches) shall have a minimum stocking ratio of 450 per acre and shall have a
75% survival rate, or at least 338 per acre. Both overstory tree and understory
tree/shrub species may be counted as part of the 450 seedling requirement;
however, overstory trees (deciduous and evergreen) shall constitute at least
75% of the total number of seedlings planted.
      (3)   Seedlings and whips planted with tree shelters, or container-grown
1, 2, or 3 gallon plants shall have a minimum stocking ratio of 350 per acre,
and shall have a 75% percent survival rate, or at least 260 per acre. Both
overstory tree and understory tree/shrub species may be counted as part of the
350 seedling requirement; however, overstory trees (deciduous and evergreen)
shall constitute at least 75% of the total number of seedlings planted.
      (4)   One-inch caliper balled and burlapped (B&B) overstory trees shall
have a minimum stocking ratio of 200 per acre and shall have a 75% survival
rate, or at least 150 per acre and shall be supplemented with understory tree/
shrub plantings using 1, 2, or 3 gallon containers planted at 100 per acre,
with a 75% survival rate, or at least 75 per acre.
      (5)   Two-inch caliper B&B overstory trees shall have a minimum stocking
ratio of 100 per acre and shall have a 100% survival rate, or at least 100 per
acre and shall be supplemented with understory tree/shrub plantings using 1, 2,
or 3 gallon containers planted at 100 per acre, with a 75% survival rate, or at
least 75 per acre.
   (E)   Natural regeneration. For areas that are designated as “natural
regeneration” on the Final Forest Conservation Plan (FFCP), or for forestation
areas designated on the FFCP:
      (1)   The areas should not be cleared or graded without approval by the
Department, after the applicant has demonstrated the benefits of such activity.
      (2)   Volunteer seedlings of native tree or shrub species that emerge in
the forest easement areas as a result of natural regeneration may satisfy
forestation requirements, provided the whips meet a stocking/survival ratio of
at least 400 living seedlings per acre during and at the end of the 3-year
maintenance period.
      (3)   Volunteer seedlings may be counted pro rata in conjunction with
planted trees and shrubs, in accordance with their respective required
stocking/survival ratios. Planting requirements for a particular area will be
met if the percentage of the stocking/survival ratio met by volunteer seedlings
added to the percentage of the stocking/survival ratio met by the planted trees
or shrubs totals 100% or more.
   (F)   Site preparation. For forests in proposed development projects:
      (1)   Proposed forest easement areas that are near planned wooded home
sites created by selective clearing may need to receive selective cutting,
pruning or other treatments designed to create a healthy forest. Reductions of
overstocked forests to not less than 80 square feet of basal area/acre should
be considered. Any such forest cutting or thinning shall be approved by the
Department and done pursuant to a plan prepared by a licensed forester;
      (2)   Selective cutting, but not clearing, of trees and other woody
plants in areas to be retained as forest easement areas may be permitted prior
to the submission of a development project application without loss of credit
for forest retention in worksheet calculations if the:
         (a)   “Standard forest density” is maintained or exceeded;
         (b)   Selective cutting is approved by the Department prior to the
commencement of forest cutting activities;
         (c)   Enhancement of forest health and quality is intended; and
         (d)   Selective cutting is done in accordance with a plan prepared by
a licensed forester.

(Ord. 00-30-272, 12-21-2000; Ord. 14-07-662, 6-17-2014; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-
2014; Bill. No. 21-12, 12-21-2021; Bill No. 22-26, 10-25-2022)
§ 1-22-4. PROCEDURES FOR IMPOSITION, CALCULATION AND COLLECTION OF DEVELOPMENT
IMPACT FEES.
   (A)   In general. An applicant shall be notified by the county or by the
municipality within which new development is located of the applicable
development impact fee requirements at the time of application for a building
permit/zoning certificate. At such time, the development impact fees shall be
calculated by the Director and shall be paid by the applicant before the
issuance of a building permit/zoning certificate.
   (B)   Calculation.
      (1)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit/zoning
certificate, the Director shall determine:
         (a)   Whether it is a residential use;
         (b)   The specific category (type) of residential development, if
applicable; and
         (c)   If residential, the number of new dwelling units.
      (2)   Upon receipt of an application for a building permit/zoning
certificate, the Director shall determine whether it is for a change in use. In
such cases, the development impact fee due shall be based only on the
incremental increase in the fee for the additional public facilities needed for
the change in use. An applicant shall not be entitled to a refund where the
change of use is to a category of development which imposes a lower demand on
public facilities.
      (3)   After making these determinations, the Director shall calculate the
applicable development impact fee by multiplying the demand added by the new
development by the amount of the applicable development impact fee per unit of
development, incorporating any applicable offset if set forth in the particular
development impact fee calculation methodology.
      (4)   If the type of land use proposed for new development is not
expressly listed in the particular development impact fee ordinance and
schedule, the Director shall:
         (a)   Identify the most similar residential development type listed
and calculate the development impact fee based on that residential development
type; or
         (b)   At the option of the applicant, or the Director determine the
basis used to calculate the fee pursuant to an independent impact analysis for
development impact fee calculation. This option shall be requested by the
applicant on a form provided by the county for such purpose. If this option is
chosen, the following shall apply.
            1.   The applicant shall be responsible, at its sole expense, for
preparing the independent impact analysis, which shall be reviewed for approval
by the Director, before payment of the fee.
            2.   The independent impact analysis shall measure the impact that
the proposed development will have on the particular public facility at issue
and shall be based on the same methodologies used in the development impact fee
calculation methodology report and shall be supported by professionally
acceptable data and assumptions.
            3.   After review of the independent impact analysis submitted by
the applicant, the Director shall accept or reject the analysis and provide
written notice to the applicant of its decision within 45 days. If the
independent impact analysis is rejected, the written notice shall provide an
explanation of the insufficiencies of the analysis.
            4.   The final decision of the Director may be appealed pursuant to
§
1-22-6 herein.
      (5)   An applicant may, at any time, request a non-binding estimate of
development impact fees due for a particular new development by filing a
request on a form provided for such purpose by the Director; provided, however,
that such estimate may be subject to change when a formal application for a
building permit/zoning certificate for new development is made. Such non-
binding estimate is solely for the benefit of the prospective applicant and
shall in no way bind the county nor preclude it from making amendments or
revisions to any provisions of this chapter or the development impact fee
schedules.
      (6)   The calculation of development impact fees due from a multiple-use
new development shall be based upon the type and number of dwelling units
created in the new development.
      (7)   The calculation of development impact fees due from a phased new
development shall be based upon the development impact fees due for each
dwelling unit within the phase of development for which building permits/zoning
certificates are requested.
      (8)   Development impact fees shall first be calculated based on the
development impact fee amount in effect at the time of application for a
building permit/zoning certificate, but the amount of the development impact
fee due is the amount of the development impact fee in effect on the date of
issuance of the building permit/zoning certificate.
   (C)   Reserved.
   (D)   Collection.
      (1)   The Director shall collect all applicable development impact fees
at the time of issuance of a building permit/zoning certificate and shall issue
a receipt to the applicant for such payment unless:
         (a)   The applicant has been determined to be entitled to a full
credit or offset; or
         (b)   The applicant has been determined to be not subject to the
payment of a development impact fee; or
         (c)   The applicant has filed an appeal, and a letter of credit in the
amount of the development impact fee, as calculated by the Director has been
posted with the county. Such letter of credit must first be approved by the
County Attorney and Director of Finance.
      (2)   The Director shall collect a development impact fee at the time of
issuance of a building permit/zoning certificate even if development impact
fees were paid by the applicant at an earlier time in the development permit or
approval process, including at the time of application for a building permit/
zoning certificate, if the amount of the development impact fees has increased
since such prior approval. The applicant shall only be liable for the
difference between the development impact fees paid earlier and those in effect
at the time of issuance of the subsequent building permit/zoning certificate.

§ 1-22-5. ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE ACCOUNTS; APPROPRIATION OF
DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE FUNDS; AND REFUNDS.
   (A)   Development impact fee accounts. A development impact fee account
shall be established
by the county for each category of public facilities for which development
impact fees are imposed. Such account shall clearly identify the category,
account, or fund for which the development impact fee has been imposed. All
development impact fees collected by the county or a municipality shall be
deposited into the appropriate development impact fee account or subaccount,
which shall be interest bearing. All interest earned on monies deposited to
such account shall be credited to and shall be considered funds of the account.
The funds of each such account shall be capable of being accounted for
separately from all other county funds, over time. The county shall establish
and implement necessary accounting controls to ensure that the development
impact fee funds are properly deposited, accounted for, and appropriated in
accordance with this chapter, and any other applicable legal requirements.
   (B)   Appropriation of development impact fee funds.
      (1)   In general. Development impact fee funds may be appropriated for
public facilities, for public facility expenditures as defined in §

the county or other applicable local governmental entities to finance such
public facilities and public facility expenditures. All appropriations from
development impact fee accounts shall be documented by the Finance Division.
      (2)   Restrictions on appropriations. Development impact fees shall be
appropriated only for the particular category of public facilities for which
they were imposed, calculated and collected.
   (C)   Procedure for appropriation of development impact fee funds.
      (1)   The Director of Finance shall each year identify public facility
projects anticipated to be funded in whole or in part with development impact
fees. The public facilities so identified shall be based upon such information
as may be relevant and may be part of the county’s annual budget and capital
improvements programming process.
      (2)   All such identification of public facility projects shall be
consistent with the provisions of this chapter or other applicable legal
requirements and any guidelines adopted by the county.
      (3)   The county may include development impact fee-funded public
facilities in the county’s annual budget and capital improvements program.
Before including these public facilities in the budget and capital improvements
program, the county shall consider the nature of the facility, the location of
the public facility, the capacity to be added by the public facility, the
service area of the public facility, the need/ demand for the public facility,
and the anticipated timing of completion of the public facility.
      (4)   The county may authorize development impact fee-funded public
facilities at such other times as may be deemed necessary and appropriate by
the county governing body.
      (5)   The County Executive shall verify that adequate development impact
fee funds are or will be available from the appropriate development impact fee
account for the particular public facility.
   (D)   Refunds.
      (1)   Eligibility for refund.
         (a)   Expiration or revocation of building permit/zoning certificate.
An applicant who has paid a development impact fee for a new development for
which the necessary building permit/zoning certificate has expired or for which
the building permit/zoning certificate has been revoked before construction
shall be eligible to apply for a refund of development impact fees paid on a
form provided by the county for such purposes.
         (b)   Abandonment of development after initiation of construction. An
applicant who has paid a development impact fee for a new development for which
a building permit/zoning certificate has been issued and pursuant to which
construction has been initiated, but which construction is abandoned before
completion and issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall not be eligible for
a refund unless the uncompleted building is completely demolished.
         (c)   Administrative fee. A 2% administrative fee, not to exceed $500,
shall be deducted from the amount of any refund granted and shall be retained
by the county to defray the administrative expenses associated with the
processing of a refund application.
      (2)   Except as provided in subsections (D)(1)(a) and (b) hereof, refunds
shall be made only to the current owner of property on which the new
development was proposed or occurred.
      (3)   Applications for a refund shall be made on a form provided by the
county for such purposes and shall include all information required in
subsection (D)(4) hereof, as appropriate. Upon receipt of a complete
application for a refund, the Director shall review the application and

information and evidence as may be deemed relevant and make a determination as
to whether a refund is due. Refunds by direct payment shall be made following
an affirmative determination by the Director.
      (4)   Applications for refunds due to abandonment of a new development
beforecompletion or due to expiration or revocation of a building permit/zoning

demolition of the structure pursuant to a valid county-issued demolition
permit.
         (d)   Failure to apply for a refund within 60 days following
expiration or revocation of the building permit/zoning certificate or
demolition of the structure shall constitute a waiver of entitlement to a
refund. No interest shall be paid by the county in calculating the amount of
the refunds.
      (5)   The county may, at its option, make refunds of development impact
fees by direct payment, by offsetting such refunds against other development
impact fees due for the same category of public facilities for new development
on the same property, or by other means subject to agreement with the property
owner.

§ 1-23-6.1. DELISTING PROPERTIES FROM HISTORIC DESIGNATION.
   (A)   In order to delist (remove) a property or a Historic District from the
County Register, the Historic Preservation Commission must find, and the County
Council must confirm, that the property or properties have ceased to meet the
criteria for historic designation as set forth in §
1-23-6(B) because the qualities that caused the property or properties to be
included in the original designation have been lost or destroyed.
   (B)   In addition to the requirements of subsection (A) above, delisting of
an entire historic district will require approval by: (1) owners of at least
the same percentage of the assessed valuation of the real property located
within the historic district as initially approved the designation of the
historic district; and (2) owners of at least the same percentage of the real
property located within the historic district that initially approved the
designation of the historic district.
   (C)   Delisting applications will not be considered in cases of demolition
by neglect or other self-created hardships.
(Bill No. 24-01, 4-16-2024)
§ 1-23-7. APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL AND COMMISSION REVIEW.
   (A)   Application for certificate of approval. Before the construction,
alteration, reconstruction, moving, or demolition is undertaken of a designated
landmark, site, or structure, or site or structure within a designated
district, if an exterior change is involved which would affect the historic,
archaeological, or architectural significance of a designated landmark, site,
or structure, or site or structure within a designated district, the person,
individual, firm, or corporation proposing to make the construction or change
shall file an application for a certificate of approval with the Commission for
permission to construct, alter, reconstruct, move, or demolish the landmark,
site, or structure. Every application shall be referred to and considered by
the Commission and accepted or rejected by the Commission. An application which
is identical to a rejected application may not be resubmitted within a period
of 1 year after the rejection. No certificate of approval shall be granted
until the Commission has acted thereon as hereinafter provided.
   (B)   Application review.
      (1)   In reviewing applications, the Commission shall give consideration
to the historic, archaeological, or architectural significance of the landmark,
site, or structure and its relationship to the historic, archaeological, or
architectural significance of the surrounding area; the relationship of the
exterior architectural features of a landmark or structure to the remainder of
the landmark or structure and to the surrounding area; the general
compatibility of proposed exterior design, scale, proportion, arrangement,
texture, and materials to the landmark, site, or structure and to the
surrounding area; and any other factors, including aesthetic factors which the
Commission deems to be pertinent.
      (2)   The Commission shall consider only exterior features of a landmark
or of a structure within a historic district, and its appurtenances and
environmental setting, and shall not consider any interior arrangements.
      (3)   The Commission shall not disapprove an application except with
respect to the several factors specified in paragraph (1) above.
      (4)   The Commission shall be strict in its judgment of plans for sites
or structures determined by research to be of historic, archaeological, or
architectural significance. The Commission shall be lenient in its judgment of
plans for sites or structures of little historic, archaeological, or
architectural significance, or of plans involving new construction, unless in
the Commission’s judgment such plans would seriously impair the historic,
archaeological, or architectural significance of surrounding sites or
structures. The Commission is not required to limit construction,
reconstruction, or alteration to the architectural style of any 1 period.
   (C)   Commission decision. The Division Staff shall issue a letter to the
applicant documenting the Commission’s approval, modification, continuance, or
rejection of each application and plans submitted to the Commission for review.
The Division Staff shall issue a certificate documenting the Commission's
approval or modification of each application and plans submitted to the
Commission for review. Work shall not be commenced and no building permit shall
be issued on any project until notification of approval of a certificate of
approval has been received by the Department of Permits and Inspections. The
failure of the Commission to act upon a completed application within 45 days
from the date the completed application was filed shall be deemed to constitute
automatic approval of the proposed changes unless an extension of this 45 day
period is agreed upon mutually by the applicant and the Commission or the
application has been withdrawn.
   (D)   Routine maintenance. Nothing in this chapter shall be taken or
construed to prevent maintenance that will have no material effect on the
exterior fabric or features of a designated landmark, site, structure, or
district, or to prevent customary farming operations or landscaping that will
have no material effect on the historic, archaeological, or architectural
significance of a designated landmark, site, structure, or district.
   (E)   This section shall not apply to areas within a designated district
which have been identified as advisory due to existing agricultural
preservation easements.
(Ord. 97-16-194, 12-2-1997; Ord. 10-19-554, 7-13-2010; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-
2014; Bill No. 23-01, 2-7-2023; Bill No. 24-01, 4-16-2024)
§ 1-23-8. RELOCATION OR DEMOLITION OF NON-DESIGNATED SITES OR STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to:
      (1)   All applications for Type 1 site plans, preliminary plans, grading
plans, individual zoning map amendments, floating zone reclassifications,
concept plans, and sketch plans (hereinafter a "Plan" or "Plans") that include
a proposal to move or demolish all or a portion of a non-designated site or
structure that is 50 years old or older, whichever Plan is submitted first.
      (2)   Any revised Plan that includes a proposal to move or demolish all
or a portion of a non-designated site or structure that is 50 years old or
older, whichever Plan is submitted first.
      (3)   An application (that does not involve any of Plan or Plans
described in subsection (A)(1) above) submitted to the Department of Permits
and Inspections for the moving or demolition of all or a portion of a non-
designated site or structure that is 50 years old or older.
   (B)   Assessment of significance.
      (1)   If a Plan or application is submitted for the moving or demolition
of all or a portion of a non-designated site or structure that is 50 years old
or older, the Plan or application will be forwarded to Historic Preservation
staff to determine whether the site or structure has historical, cultural,
architectural, or archaeological significance. A property has historical,
cultural, architectural, or archaeological significance if it meets the
criteria in §
1-23-6(B) above. If no significance is determined, the Plan or application for
moving or demolition of all or a portion of the site or structure may move
forward. If the site or structure is determined to be significant, Historic
Preservation staff shall forward the Plan or application to the Commission for
a decision as to whether the site or structure possesses unusual historic
value.
      (2)   If the Commission considers the site or structure to be of unusual
historic value to Frederick County, the state, or the nation, the Commission or
its designee shall attempt to formulate an economically feasible plan with the
owner(s) of the site or structure, who will act in good faith, for the
preservation of the site or structure. If the Commission determines that the
site or structure does not possess unusual historic value to Frederick County,
the state, or nation, the plan or application for moving or demolition of all
or a portion of the site or structure may move forward.
      (3)   If a Plan or application is submitted for the moving or demolition
of a site or structure that the Commission considers to be of unusual historic
value and no economically feasible plan can be formulated, the Commission or
their designee shall have 90 days, from the time it concludes that no
economically feasible plan can be formulated, to negotiate with the owner and
other parties in good faith in an effort to find a means of preserving the site
or structure. If no means of preserving the site or structure is agreed upon,
the Plan or application shall be approved unless a petition for designation has
been filed with the Division in accordance with §
1-23-6(C). If the County Council votes favorably and the property is designated
to the Frederick County Register of Historic Places, the Plan or application
shall be reviewed under §
1-23-7.
   (C)   Special merit exception. Even if a non-designated site or structure is
50 years old or older and is determined by the Commission to be of unusual
historical value to Frederick County, the state, or nation, the Commission may
approve a Plan or application that proposes moving or demolition of the site or
structure if:
      (1)   The site or structure is a deterrent to a major improvement program
that will be of substantial benefit to the local jurisdiction; or
      (2)   The retention of the site or structure would:
         (a)   Cause economic hardship to the owner as defined in §
1-23-9; or
         (b)   Not be in the best interests of a majority of persons in the
community.
(Bill No. 24-01, 4-16-2024; Bill No. 25-01, 2-18-2025)
§ 1-23-9. ECONOMIC HARDSHIP.
   Any owner seeking an exemption from the operation of the provisions of this
chapter due to economic hardship has the burden of proof to show by clear and
convincing evidence that the owner does not have the financial ability to
comply with the requirements of this chapter. In making its determination, the
Historic Preservation Commission shall consider a justification statement and
any additional evidence submitted by the owner and shall give due consideration
to whether the property was designated on the county's initiative, under the
procedure defined in §
1-23-6(C)(6).
(Bill No. 24-01, 4-16-2024)
§ 1-23-10. DEMOLITION BY NEGLECT.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to prevent the gradual deterioration of
designated historic resources on the Frederick County Register of Historic
Places due to a failure to provide normal and customary maintenance such that
the unique attributes and character of the historic resource or district might
be lost due to decay, deterioration, or structural defects.
   (B)   The property owner of an individually designated landmark, site, or
structure, or of a site or structure within a designated historic district
shall not permit such landmark, site, or structure to fall into a state of
disrepair which may result in the deterioration of any exterior appurtenance or
architectural feature so as to produce or tend to produce, in the judgment of
the Commission, a detrimental effect upon the character of the district as a
whole or the life and character of the landmark, site, or structure in
question, including:
      (1)   Deterioration of exterior walls, foundations, or other vertical
support that causes leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or buckling;
      (2)   Deterioration of flooring or floor supports, roofs, or other
horizontal members that cause leaning, sagging, splitting, listing, or
buckling;
      (3)   Deterioration of external chimneys that causes leaning, sagging,
splitting, listing, or buckling;
      (4)   Deterioration or crumbling of exterior plasters or mortars;
      (5)   Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, and
foundations, including broken windows or doors;
      (6)   Defective protection or lack of weather protection for exterior
wall and roof coverings, including lack of paint, or weathering due to lack of
paint or other protective covering;
      (7)   Deterioration of exterior stairs, porches, handrails, window and
door frames, cornices, entablatures, wall facings, and architectural details
that causes delamination, instability, loss of shape and form, or crumbling;
      (8)   Deterioration of landscape features relevant to the historic
integrity of the structure or site, including but not limited to: fences,
gates, and accessory structures.
   (C)   In the event of demolition by neglect, the Commission may request the
Director of the Department of Permits and Inspections or their designee to
notify, in writing, the property owner of record as reflected on the tax rolls
of Frederick County, and the occupant or other person responsible for the
maintenance of the property, of the deterioration. The notice shall specify the
minimum items of repair or maintenance necessary to correct the deterioration
or prevent further deterioration.
   (D)   Prior to the issuance of a written notice, the Commission may request
that Division Staff establish a record of demolition by neglect. Such a record
may include dated materials such as photographs and written reports of the
condition of the property so as to record or measure the deterioration.
   (E)   The notice shall provide that corrective action shall commence within
30 days of the receipt of said notice and be completed within a reasonable time
thereafter. The notice shall state that the owner of record of the property, or
any person of record with any right, title, or interest therein, may, within 10
days after the receipt of the notice, request a hearing on the necessity of the
items and conditions contained in the notice. In the event a public hearing is
requested, it shall be held by the Commission upon 30 days’ written notice
being mailed to all persons of record with any right, title, or interest in the
property and to all citizens and organizations which the Director of the
Department of Permits and Inspections or their designee determines may have an
interest in the proceedings.
      (1)   If, after the public hearing, the Commission determines that the
corrective actions remain necessary, the Commission may request the Director of
the Department of Permits and Inspections to issue a final notice to comply
with the corrective action notice within 30 days of the date of the
Commission’s determination.
      (2)   Upon failure, neglect, or refusal of the property owner or other
responsible person, duly notified, to take the corrective action specified in
the corrective action notice within the time required, the Commission may
request that the Director of the Department of Permits and Inspections or their
designee enter the building or premises affected by the order and cause the
building or premises to be repaired, or cause any dangerous condition to be
remedied, as the case may be, at the expense of the owner.
      (3)   If the property owner fails to repay the county for expenses
incurred under subsection (D)(2) above within 30 days after written demand has
been mailed to their last known address, the Director of Permits and
Inspections shall notify the County Treasurer and a tax lien in favor of the
county for the amount of the expenses incurred under subsection (D)(2) shall
attach to the property. The property may be sold at tax sale to satisfy the
lien.
      (4)   Failure to comply with the original or final correction notice
shall constitute a violation of this chapter for each day that such violation
continues and shall be punishable as set forth in §
1-23-16 of the Frederick County Code.
(Ord. 97-16-194, 12-2-1997; Ord. 14-23-678, 11-13-2014; Bill No. 24-01, 4-16-
2024)
§ 1-23-11. ARCHAEOLOGICAL PROTECTION.
   (A)   Archaeological resources. The purpose of this section is to identify,
evaluate, and protect archaeological resources in Frederick County, which are
defined in §
1-23-3 above. Archaeological resources are non-renewable resources that
tangibly connect the county's history across hundreds and thousands of years.
   (B)   Applicability. This section applies to:
      (1)   All applications for Type 1 site plans, preliminary plans,
individual zoning map amendments, and floating zone reclassifications

Planning Commission for consideration. Compliance with this section is
recommended for concept plans and sketch plans.
      (2)   For Type 1 site plans, preliminary plans, floating zone
reclassifications, and individual zoning map amendments, compliance with this
section must be completed prior to a Plan being scheduled for Planning
Commission review.
      (3)   Any revised Plan that extends the limits of disturbance of the
original Plan may also be subject to this section. Applicants should contact
the Division to determine if the revisions constitute a need for additional
archaeological review.
      (4)   This review process cannot be completed in lieu of any state or
federal review process that a project may be subject to.
   (C)   Administration. This section shall be administered by the Division,
which may adopt reasonable procedures for its administration, consistent with
applicable law. All reviews will be conducted by a professional archaeologist
working for the Division and whose professional qualifications meet or exceed
those established by the Secretary of the Interior.
      (1)   All archaeological work must be designed and completed by a
professional archaeologist in accordance with the Standards & Guidelines for
Archaeological Investigations in Maryland. Failure to submit the required
materials for archaeological review may cause delays in the plan review
process.
   (D)   Archaeological significance. The significance of archaeological
resources identified within the area of potential impact will be evaluated by a
professional archaeologist working for the Division, applying the National
Register of Historic Places Criteria for Evaluation (Criteria). The
archaeological resources will be considered significant if they possess one or
more of the qualities of significance as defined by the Criteria, can be
associated with a historic context, and retains historic integrity. The
National Register of Historic Places Criteria for Evaluation state that the
quality of significance in American history, architecture, archaeology, and
culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects that
possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship,
feeling, and association, and:
      (1)   Criteria A: That are associated with events that have made a
significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history;
      (2)   Criteria B: That are associated with the lives of persons
significant in our past;
      (3)   Criteria C: That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type,
period, or method of construction or that represent the work of a master, or
that possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
      (4)   Criteria D: That have yielded, or may be likely to yield,
information important in prehistory or history.
   (E)   Assessment of archaeological potential. Prior to the submission of any
applicable Plans to the Division, applicants must participate in a scoping
meeting with the Division's Professional Archaeologist to discuss the
archaeological potential of the property and the scope of any potential
archaeological studies.
      (1)   At least 45 days prior to the scoping meeting, the applicant must
submit a request for an assessment of archaeological potential for the proposed
project. This request includes, but is not limited to, full and accurate
information about all ground disturbing activities proposed at the site,
existing conditions survey, a contour map of the project area, photographs of
the site, and any known historic resources on the site.
      (2)   Following the submission of the above information by the applicant,
the Division will research and perform on-site inspection to create an
assessment of the archaeological potential of the proposed project area, which
will be presented to the applicant at the scoping meeting. The applicant will
coordinate with the Division's professional archaeologist for site visits as
needed. No archaeological identification study should be started prior to the
review of the archaeological potential of the proposed project area by the
Division's professional archaeologist.
      (3)   Exemptions may be made at the discretion of the Division's
professional archaeologist if the area of potential impact is less than 5,000
square feet, if the area has significant existing disturbance that has already
destroyed potential archaeological sites, or if a previously conducted survey
unrelated to the Plan being applied for has concluded that archaeological
resources are non-existent.
   (F)   Archaeological studies. Following the archaeological assessment
scoping meeting, if the applicant was not granted an exemption, the applicant
must:
      (1)   Undertake an archaeological identification study (Phase I) and an
archaeological evaluation study (Phase II), as determined in the scoping
meeting, by a Professional Archaeologist for the area determined in the scoping
meeting to identify and evaluate intact archaeological resources in accordance
with standards outlined in the most current edition of the Standards and
Guidelines for Archeological Investigations in Maryland. A copy of the
archaeological identification and evaluation report and completed or updated
Maryland Inventory of Historic Properties (Archaeology) forms must be submitted
to the Division for review and comment.
      (2)   The Division shall have 30 days to comment on the materials
submitted by the applicant. After the Division's comments have been addressed
by the applicant and their professional archaeologist, a final copy of the
archaeological identification or evaluation report and a copy of the Maryland
Inventory of Historic Properties (Archaeology) forms must be submitted to the
Division. A copy of the report and forms shall be forwarded by the Division to
the Maryland Historical Trust. A redacted copy of the archaeological
identification or evaluation report must be submitted to the Division.
         (a)   If no archaeological resources are identified as the result of
the archaeological identification and evaluation studies, a summary letter of
negative findings must be submitted to the Division by the applicant's
professional archaeologist.
         (b)   If archaeological testing identifies archaeological resources,
but determines that they are not significant, in accordance with subsection (D)
above, then the archaeological identification and evaluation report must be
submitted to the Division. The Division will have 30 days to confirm that the
identified resources are not significant, in accordance with subsection (D)
above.
         (c)   If archaeological testing identifies significant archaeological
resources in accordance with subsection (D) above, an archaeological resource
management plan must be submitted to the Division. The Division will render a
determination in writing regarding the acceptability of the proposed
archaeological resource management plan within 30 days after receipt of the
studies and management plan, unless written consent to extend such period is
given by the applicant. The applicant maintains the right to amend their
application to avoid areas of high archaeological potential or known
archaeological resources.
      (3)   The county will treat archaeological resource locations and reports
with discretion.
   (G)   Archaeological identification and evaluation report and resource
management plan.
      (1)   When required under the provisions of this section, the applicant
must submit, as part of the Plan application an archaeological identification
report, an evaluation study, and archaeological resource management plan, as
necessary, prepared by a professional archaeologist. All archaeological
investigations, reports, and plans will conform with the most current edition
of the Standards and Guidelines for Archaeological Investigations in Maryland.
      (2)   An archaeological identification and evaluation report must include
a detailed evaluation of the archaeological significance of the archaeological
resources on the property, specifically addressing the proposed disturbance
within the Plan area, including a detailed assessment of the information
potential of identified resources according to the criteria outlined in
subsection (D) above.
      (3)   An archaeological resource management plan must include reasonable
measures for the preservation or mitigation of adverse effects on significant
archaeological resources within the Plan's area of proposed disturbance,
including but not limited to additional archaeological testing, archaeological
data recovery (Phase III), site construction monitoring, archaeological
resource avoidance, field recording, photography, laboratory analysis,
conservation of organic and metal artifacts, curation of the collection (e.g.,
artifacts, notes, photographs), public interpretation, and the preparation of
reports.
      (4)   The archaeological resource management plan must provide reasonable
measures for further archaeological study, stabilization, conservation,
curation of recovered artifacts by an appropriate public or private curation
facility or museum, and in situ preservation of archaeological resources found
within the site plan area, as required by the Planning Commission.
   (H)   Review of archaeological evaluation report and resource management
plan. The archaeological identification and evaluation studies and
archaeological resource management plan must be reviewed and approved,
disapproved, or approved with modifications or conditions, as part of the
applicable plan review process.
      (1)   This review will be completed and summarized in writing by the
Division's professional archaeologist. In the case of a substantive
disagreement between the county and the applicant regarding the findings, the
county can request a review by and consultation with the Maryland Historical
Trust. The findings by the Maryland Historical Trust will be nonbinding.
   (I)   Appeal. An applicant has 30 days from the date of the Division's final
determination to file an appeal for a hearing with the Division Director. The
Division Director will use best efforts to hold the hearing within 30 days of
the appeal request. If an applicant is still aggrieved by the Division
Director's decision, they may appeal to the Circuit Court, pursuant to Maryland
Rules Title 7, Chapter 200.
   (J)   Unanticipated discoveries. If the applicant or the applicant's
employees or assignees uncover unanticipated discoveries during soil
disturbance, work in the immediate vicinity must cease immediately and the
Division must be notified. Construction activities in the vicinity must not
resume until such time that all relevant parties have agreed upon a course of
action. If any human remains, funerary objects, or other features or artifacts
associated with a cemetery are uncovered, refer to the procedure in §
1-23-12(F).
(Bill No. 24-01, 4-16-2024)
§ 1-23-12. CEMETERIES.
   (A)   Preamble. Burial sites, human remains, and funerary objects are
significant cultural resources and should be treated with dignity and respect
in all circumstances. Disturbing or disinterring burial sites, human remains,
or funerary objects, when not requested by descendants, associated indigenous
people, or required by applicable law or regulation, should not be pursued
unless there are no other alternatives available, and only after consultation
with descendants or other legally authorized individuals or groups and fully
considered avoidance of impact and preservation in place. The burial sites,
human remains, and funerary objects of certain groups of people, including but
not limited to indigenous people and enslaved persons and their descendants,
have a higher probability of being unmarked and undocumented and are thus more
likely to be affected by development activity.
   (B)   Applicability. This section applies to all preliminary plans, site
plans, plats, concept plans, sketch plans, and grading permits for properties
that have a cemetery on the site.
   (C)   Cemetery identification. The location and boundary of an onsite
cemetery must be determined by one of the following methods, in consultation
with the Division:
      (1)   A survey using professionally acceptable methods and techniques
performed by a professional, including archival research, professional
archaeology, geophysical survey methods, and/or other nondestructive approved
techniques;
      (2)   Observations in the field including visible gravestones or markers,
a pattern of depressions indicative of graves, or associated fence boundaries;
or
      (3)   Reference to a modern map or plat or evidence found on historic
maps or documents.
   (D)   Preservation. A property owner/developer must preserve an onsite
cemetery by meeting the following requirements:
      (1)   Grading, construction, or subsurface disturbance within 25 feet of
the known cemetery boundary is prohibited; however, if a developer
professionally surveys the cemetery as described in subsection (C)(1) above,
the boundary of no disturbance may be decreased to 15 feet from the surveyed
cemetery boundary;
      (2)   Appropriate measures must be taken to protect the cemetery during
construction, such as a field-delineated limit of disturbance zone, orange
blaze safety fencing, or other appropriate physical markings.
   (E)   Reinterment. If a property owner/developer disinters and reinters
human remains at a burial site or sites, they must follow reinterment law
outlined in the Criminal Law Article of the Maryland Code, specifically, Title
10: Crimes Against Public Health, Conduct, and Sensibilities, Subtitle 4:
Crimes Relating to Human Remains, Md. Code Ann., Criminal Law Article, § 10-402
(d-f) and, if applicable, consult with the Maryland Historical Trust as
outlined in Md. Code Ann., Real Property Article, § 14-121.1. Proper treatment
of burial site in existence for more than 50 years.
   (F)   Discovery. If any person discovers the existence of previously unknown
human remains, grave markers, funerary objects, or other evidence of a cemetery
which reasonably indicates the presence of a cemetery in the course of grading,
construction, or work of any kind, that person must stop work immediately in
the discovery area and must give notice of the discovery within 24 hours to the
State's Attorney, the Division and, if applicable, consult with the Maryland
Historical Trust as outlined in Md. Code Ann., Real Property Article, § 14-
121.1. Proper treatment of burial site in existence for more than 50 years. All
permits issued relating to the discovery area will be suspended and the
property owner/developer must stop all work in the discovery area until a
determination is made pursuant to subsection (C) above. If reasonably
identifiable, the property owner will notify the nearest descendent of the
discovery.
      (1)   Determination. The Division will determine, in consultation with
the State's Attorney Office, if the discovery area is a cemetery. In making
this determination, the Division may require the property owner to comply with
the cemetery identification portions of subsection (C) above. If the Division
determines that the area is not a cemetery, the stop-work order will be lifted,
and the suspended permits released by the Division.
      (2)   Cemetery protection. If it is determined that the discovery area is
a cemetery, the property owner must comply with the requirements of cemetery
preservation listed in subsection (C) of this section and any requirements from
the State's Attorney Office.
   (G)   Subdivision and site development plan review.
      (1)   Inventory of cemetery elements and cemetery narrative descriptions.
An inventory of existing cemetery elements (such as walls, gates, landscape
features, and grave markers, including a record of their inscriptions) and
their condition must be submitted as part of any preliminary plan or site
development plan application. All plan submissions are required to provide a
narrative description and map identifying the location of cemeteries and known
historic and archaeological resources on the site.
      (2)   Establish a permanent fence. When a proposed preliminary plan or
site plan includes a known cemetery within the site, the applicant must provide
and maintain an appropriate fence or wall constructed of stone, brick, metal,
or wood to delineate the cemetery boundaries. The design of the proposed
enclosure and a construction schedule must be approved by the Planning
Commission, or its designee, prior to the issuance of any permit. The Division
may waive this requirement on a case-by-case basis.
      (3)   Right-of-way. A 15-foot right-of-way from the nearest public or
private road will be required to maintain family or person of interest access
to the cemetery.
      (4)   Non-buildable and open space lots. Property owners or developers
must accommodate the cemetery within a major subdivision by: i) placing the
cemetery in a non-buildable lot with a cemetery designation; ii) dedicating the
cemetery to a homeowner's association or a preservation, conservation, or
religious organization; iii) providing that the cemetery remains as a cemetery
in perpetuity; and iv) providing individuals related by blood or marriage or a
person of interest access to the cemetery. Any land placed in a non-buildable
cemetery lot designation pursuant to this section may be counted towards open
space requirements. Alternatively, a property owner or developer may transfer
the cemetery to the private ownership and care of a family member or descendant
group.
   (H)   Grading permit review. All grading permit submissions are required to
provide a narrative description and map identifying the location of known
cemeteries, the distance from the grading activity to the known cemetery
boundary, and known historic and archaeological resources on the site.
   (I)   Plat review. All submitted plats must include the known boundaries of
all known cemeteries within the plat.
(Bill No. 24-01, 4-16-2024)
§ 1-23-13. COUNTY-OWNED HISTORIC PROPERTIES.
   Division Historic Preservation staff will be consulted for any alteration to
a county-owned property that is designated as historic or eligible for historic
designation, per §
1-23-6, to determine if the proposed alteration would affect that property's
historic integrity.
(Bill No. 24-01, 4-16-2024)
§ 1-23-14. MARYLAND HISTORICAL TRUST.

§ 2-2-5. Public facilities bonds.
   (a)   As used herein, the term COUNTY means the body politic and corporate
of the State of  Maryland known as the County Commissioners of Frederick
County. PUBLIC FACILITIES means the costs of construction and reconstruction of
capital projects, including, but not limited to, landfill projects, public
schools, roads, bridges, flood control projects, solid waste facilities, water
and leachate treatment facilities, libraries, and communication systems,
including development of property, acquisition, and installation of equipment
and furnishings, together with any related architectural, financial, legal,
planning, or engineering services.
   (b)   The county is hereby authorized to finance any part or all of the
costs of the facilities described in section 1 of this Act, and to borrow money
and incur indebtedness for that purpose, at one time or from time to time, in
an amount not exceeding, in the aggregate, $21,400,000.00 and to evidence its
borrowing by the issuance and sale upon its full faith and credit of general
obligation bonds in like par amount, which may be issued at one time or from
time to time, in one or more groups or series, as the county may determine.
   (c)   (1)   The bonds shall be issued pursuant to a resolution of the county
which shall describe generally the public facilities for which the proceeds of
the bond sale are intended and the anticipated amount needed for those
purposes. The county shall have and is hereby granted full and complete
authority and discretion in the resolution to fix and determine with respect to
the bonds of any issue: the designation, date of issue, denomination or
denominations, form or forms and tenor of the bonds; the rate or rates of
interest payable thereon, or the method of determining the same, which may
include a variable rate; the date or dates and amount or amounts of maturity,
which need not be in equal par amounts or in consecutive annual installments,
provided only that no bond of any issue shall mature later than thirty years
from the date of its issue; the manner of selling the bonds, which may be at
either public or private sale, for such price or prices as may be determined to
be for the best interests of the county; the manner of executing the bonds,
which may be by facsimile; the terms and conditions, if any, under which bonds
may be tendered for payment or purchase prior to their stated maturity; the
terms or conditions, if any, under which bonds may or shall be redeemed prior
to their stated maturity; the place or places of payment of the principal of
and the interest on the bonds, which may be at any bank or trust company within
or without the State of Maryland; and generally all matters incident to the
terms, conditions, issuance, sale and delivery thereof.
   The county may enter into agreements with agents, banks, fiduciaries,
insurers, or others for the purpose of enhancing the marketability of and
security for the bonds and for the purpose of securing any tender option that
may be granted to holders of the bonds.
   In case any officer whose signature appears on any bond ceases to be such
officer before delivery, the signature shall nevertheless be valid and
sufficient for all purposes as if the officer had remained in office until
delivery. The bonds and their issue and sale shall be exempt from the
provisions of sections 2C, 9, 10 and 11 of Article 31 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland.
   If the county determines in the resolution to offer any of the bonds by
solicitation of competitive bids at public sale, the resolution shall fix the
terms and conditions of the public sale and shall adopt a form of notice of
sale, which shall outline the terms and conditions, and a form of
advertisement, which shall either be published in one or more daily or weekly
newspapers having a general circulation in the county or with appropriate
financial information services and which may also be published in one or more
journals having a circulation primarily among banks and investment bankers.
   Upon delivery of any bonds to the purchaser or purchasers, payment shall be
made to the treasurer of Frederick County or such other official of the county
as may be designated to receive payment in a resolution passed by the county
commissioners of Frederick County before delivery.
   For purposes of issuance and sale, bonds authorized hereunder may be
consolidated into a single issue with any other bonds authorized to be issued
by the county.
   (d)   The net proceeds of the sale of bonds shall be used and applied
exclusively and solely for the public facilities for which the bonds are sold.
If the net proceeds of the sale of any issue of bonds exceeds the amount needed
to finance the public facilities described in the resolution, the excess funds
shall be applied to the payment of the next principal maturity of the bonds or
to the redemption of any part of the bond which has been made redeemable or to
the purchase and cancellation of bonds, unless the county adopts a resolution
allocating the excess funds to the construction, improvement, or development of
other public facilities.
   (e)   The bonds hereby authorized shall constitute, and they shall so
recite, an irrevocable pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing
power of the county to the payment of the maturing principal of and interest on
the bonds as and when they become payable. In each and every fiscal year that
any of the bonds are outstanding, the county shall levy or cause to be levied
ad valorem taxes upon all the assessable property within the corporate limits
of Frederick County in rate and amount sufficient to provide for or assume the
payment, when due, of the principal of and interest on all the bonds maturing
in each such fiscal year and, if the proceeds from the taxes so levied in any
fiscal year prove inadequate for such payment, additional taxes shall be levied
in the succeeding fiscal year to make up any deficiency. The county may apply
to the payment of the principal of and interest on any bonds issued under this
Act any funds received by it from the State of Maryland, the United States of
America, any agency or instrumentality of either, or from any other source. If
such funds are granted for the purpose of assisting the county in financing the
construction, improvement, development, or renovation of the public facilities
defined in this Act and, to the extent of any such funds received or receivable
in any fiscal year, taxes that might otherwise be required to be levied under
this Act may be reduced or need not be levied.
   (f)   The county is hereby further authorized and empowered, at any time and
from time to time, to issue its bonds in the manner hereinabove described for
the purpose of refunding, upon purchase or redemption, any bonds issued under
this Act. The validity of any refunding bonds are in no way dependent upon or
related to the validity or invalidity of the obligations being refunded. The
powers granted under this Act with respect to the issuance of bonds shall be
applicable to the issuance of refunding bonds. Such refunding bonds may be
issued by the county for the purpose of providing it with funds to purchase in
the open market any of its outstanding bonds issued under this Act, prior to
their maturity, or for the purpose of providing it with funds for the
redemption prior to maturity of any outstanding bonds which are, by their
terms, redeemable. The proceeds of the sale of any refunding bonds shall be
segregated and set apart by the county as a separate trust fund to be used
solely for the purpose of paying the purchase or redemption prices of the bonds
to be refunded.
   (g)   The county may, prior to the preparation of definitive bonds, issue
interim certificates or temporary bonds, exchangeable for definitive bonds when
such bonds have been executed and are available for delivery. The county may,
by appropriate resolution, provide for the replacement of any bonds issued
under this Act which may have become mutilated or lost or destroyed upon
whatever conditions and after receiving whatever indemnity as the county may
require.
   (h)   Any and all obligations issued under this Act, their transfer, the
interest payable on them, and any income derived from them from time to time
(including any profit made in their sale) shall be and are hereby declared to
be at all times exempt from state, county, municipal or other taxation of every
kind and nature whatsoever within the State of Maryland.
   Nothing in this Act shall prevent the county from authorizing hereunder the
issuance and sale of bonds the interest on which is not excludable from gross
income for federal income tax purposes.
   (i)   The authority to borrow money and issue bonds conferred on the county
by this Act shall be deemed to provide additional, alternative, and
supplemental authority for borrowing money and shall be regarded as
supplemental and additional to powers conferred upon the county by other laws
and may not be regarded as in derogation of any power now existing; and all
previously enacted laws authorizing the county to borrow money are hereby
continued to the extent that the power contained in them is continuing or has
not been exercised, unless any law is expressly repealed by this Act, and the
validity of any bonds issued under previously enacted laws is hereby ratified,
confirmed, and approved. This Act, being necessary for the welfare of the
inhabitants of Frederick County, shall be liberally construed to effect its
purposes. All Acts and parts of Acts inconsistent with the provisions of this
Act are hereby repealed to the extent of any inconsistency.
   (j)   This Act shall take effect June 1, 1995.

15 working days after the close of each quarter. In the event that the county
budget officer certifies that revenues will be insufficient to fund the
approved budget, the budget officer shall submit within 10 working days a
listing of recommended reductions sufficient to balance the budget. The
reduction may not include appropriations for the payment of state taxes, the
principal and interest of the county debt and salaries and obligations affixed
by law. The county commissioners will consider the recommended reductions in
public session and will take such action as necessary to ensure that a deficit
fiscal condition does not result for the fiscal year.

federal legislation or grants issued by state or federal agencies or other
sources that are provided to accomplish specific goals, objectives, or services
through the expenditures of the restricted revenue funds.
   (B)   (1)   After January 1 of any fiscal year, if the board of county
commissioners reasonably anticipates that revenues for a fiscal year will be
sufficient to fund increased expenditures, the board of county commissioners
may increase the expenditures adopted in the budget for the fiscal year by an
amount not to exceed the increased fiscal year revenues.
      (2)   These increased expenditures may only be used to repay debt.

authority to make the loan.

July first on which the taxes are due, the county treasurer shall, within one
month after the first day of July in each year or within one month after the
discovery of any property belonging to such delinquent, levy upon such portions
as may be necessary to pay the taxes, interests, costs and fees, as therein
provided, of the personal property assessed to such delinquent taxpayers, in
the same manner as the sheriff of the county is authorized by law to levy upon
property upon execution on judgments issued out of the circuit court for the
county.
   (b)   He shall advertise and sell such personal property in the same manner
as is required by law in case of sales of personal property by the sheriff of

county, executing executions on judgments of the circuit court for the county,

arrears thereon and interest. The surplus, if any, shall be paid over to such
delinquent taxpayer.

officer had remained in office until delivery.

any state or county officer or any agency or political subdivision of the state
for any purpose for which the deposit of bonds or obligations of the state is
authorized by law.
   (K)   The powers granted under this section shall be regarded as
supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws and may not be
regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing.
   (L)   This section, being necessary for the welfare of the state and its
residents, shall be liberally construed to effect the purpose stated in
subsection (B)(2) of this section.
   (M)   Before the final adoption of an ordinance or resolution under this
section that designates a community development authority, authorizes the
issuance of bonds, or levies ad valorem taxes or special taxes or fees, the
county commissioners shall hold a public hearing after giving not less than 10
days notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
   (N)   (1)   As an alternative to levying ad valorem taxes under this
section, the county commissioners may levy special taxes or fees on property in
a community development authority to cover the costs of infrastructure
improvements.
      (2)   In determining the basis for and the amount of the tax or fee, the
cost of an improvement may be calculated and levied:
         (I)   Equally per front foot, lot, parcel, dwelling unit, or square
foot;
         (II)   According to the value of the property as determined by the
county commissioners, with or without regard to improvements on the property;
or
         (III)   In any other reasonable manner that results in fairly
allocating the cost of the infrastructure improvements.
      (3)   The county commissioners may provide by ordinance or resolution
for:
         (I)   A maximum amount to be assessed with respect to any parcel of
property located within a community development authority;
         (II)   A tax year or other date after which no further special taxes
or fees under this section shall be levied or collected on a parcel; and
         (III)   The circumstances under which the special tax or fee levied
against any parcel may be increased, if at all, as a consequence of delinquency

creation, the commission replaced and succeeded the district (a body politic
and corporate) created in Frederick County pursuant to the provisions of §§ 645
to 673, inclusive, of Article 43 of the Annotated Code of Maryland (1971
Replacement Volume and 1978 Supplement). Upon the creation of the commission,
such district ceased to exist as a body politic and corporate on June 1, 1968.
   (b)   Chapter 629 of the Acts of 1974, created § 2-2-33 of this Code,
effective July 1, 1974, and provided, among other matters, that the board could
abolish the commission by a certain procedure and create a department of public
works. The board took action on February 14, 1978 by adopting Ordinance No. 78-
6-104, codified as §§ 1-18-1 through 1-18-4 of this Code which abolished the
Frederick County Metropolitan Commission and created the Frederick County
Department of Public Works. This chapter does not impair any power of the board
pursuant to § 2-2-33 of this Code or other authority to create a department of
public works and to assign the department responsibilities to implement the
board’s actions under this chapter.
(Code 1959, § 10A-2; 1979, Chapter 723, § 1)
§ 2-13-2.1. Statement of purpose.
   On February 14, 1978, the Frederick County Metropolitan Commission ceased to
exist as a separate entity. It is the intent and purpose of the General
Assembly of Maryland that on and after February 14, 1978, the county shall
succeed to and exercise all the powers previously exercised by the commission,
and the county shall undertake and thereafter perform any and all obligations
of the commission, either as successor to any district or incurred on its own
behalf. All property, real, personal, and mixed owned by the metropolitan
commission or any predecessor is hereby conveyed and transferred to the board
without the necessity of any deeds or other writings.

§ 2-13-3. Effect of chapter upon acts of predecessor agencies; validation of
prior acts; notice of changes in rates, charges or assessments; general powers
of county.
   (a)   This chapter does not impair or affect in any way the validity or
enforceability of any proceeding or action taken, or any obligations or

board on behalf of the county pursuant to Article 43 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland prior to June 1, 1968; or
      (2)   By the commission, by the county, or by the board on behalf of the
county pursuant to Article 11 of the Public Local Laws of Maryland, Chapter
10A, prior to May 29, 1979.
   (b)   All proceedings and actions taken by the district, by its governing
body, by the county, or by the board on behalf of the county pursuant to
Article 43 prior to July 1, 1968, and all proceedings and actions taken by the
commission, by the county, or by the board on behalf of the county pursuant to
Chapter 609 of the Acts of 1968, as amended and supplemented, and pursuant to
Chapter 629 of the Acts of 1974, prior to July 1, 1979, are hereby ratified,
validated, and confirmed; the authorization, sale, and issuance of all bonds
and other obligations issued pursuant to said Article 43 and pursuant to
Chapter 609 of the Acts of 1968, as amended and supplemented, prior to May 29,
1979, are ratified and confirmed, and all of these bonds and other obligations
are validated as being validly authorized, sold, and issued. It is the intent
and purpose that the county, on and after February 14, 1978, shall undertake
and satisfy in all respects any and all obligations evidenced by such bonds and
other obligations in accordance with their terms.
   (c)   In the event that the Board decides that any modification of an
existing rate, charge, or assessment previously established:
      (1)   By the district, by its governing body, by the county, or by the
board on behalf of the county pursuant to Article 43 prior to July 1, 1968; or
      (2)   By the commission, by the county, or by the board on behalf of the
county pursuant to Chapter 609 of the acts of 1968, as amended and
supplemented, prior to July 1, 1979, is necessary or desirable, the board
promptly shall give notice of the proposed rates, charges, and assessments in
at least one newspaper of general circulation in Frederick County. Thereafter
the board shall conduct a public hearing on the necessity or advisability of
the proposed rates, charges, or assessments.
   (d)   Without in any way limiting the provisions of this chapter or of any
other provisions of law, the county has and may exercise all powers necessary
or convenient for carrying out the purposes set forth in this chapter,
including, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following.
      (1)   To sue and be sued, implead and be impleaded, complain, and defend
in all courts.
      (2)   To appoint officers, attorneys, accountants, agents, employees, and

solid waste systems in Frederick County.
      (5)   Frederick County is declared to be a sanitary district for the
purpose of the exercise of the powers vested by this chapter in the board;
provided:
         (I)   That the board shall exercise no authority over the operation or
construction of the sewerage, water, drainage, and solid waste facilities of
any incorporated municipality, including the extension of such facilities
beyond the corporate limits of any municipality as such extensions may exist on
July 1, 1968; and
         (II)   That the extension of such facilities beyond the corporate
limits of any municipality after July 1, 1968 shall be subject to the approval
and authority of the board, except that such approval shall not be required in
the event of annexation pursuant to Article 23A of the Annotated Code of
Maryland; and
         (III)   That in exercising the powers granted by this chapter, the
board shall not be subject to the provisions of any planning regulations or
zoning ordinances enacted under the provisions of Article 66B of the Annotated
Code of Maryland.

purposes of this chapter.
(Code 1957, § 10A-4; 1979, Chapter 723, § 1; 1991, Chapter 194, § 1)
§ 2-13-4. Advisory council.
   The board may create and appoint an advisory council to the board under this
chapter. The advisory council may consist of all or any of the former members
of the commission, or any other members as the board may deem necessary or
desirable. The advisory council may review and recommend rates, policies, and
plans for the maintenance, design, construction, or establishment of any water,
sewerage, drainage, or solid waste system existing or to be constructed or
established in Frederick County.
(Code 1959, § 10A-32; 1979, Chapter 723, § 1; 1991, Chapter 194, § 1)
§ 2-13-5. Power to construct, operate and maintain water, sewerage, drainage,
and solid waste systems; hearing required prior to construction; transfer of
powers to county.
   (a)   To provide for the general health and welfare of the residents of
Frederick County, the county may acquire, construct, operate, and maintain such
water, sewerage, drainage and solid waste systems as it deems to be in the
public interest, the county may cause surveys, plans, specifications, and
estimates to be made for such systems. The county shall construct any such
system or extension thereof only after a public hearing held by the board,
after giving notice thereof in one newspaper of general circulation published
in Frederick County at least seven (7) days prior to the hearing, and in the
case of drainage systems, only after a drainage area has been established
pursuant to §
2-13-8 of this chapter. At the hearing, a description of the proposed
improvements shall be presented together with the estimated costs thereof and
estimated revenues to be derived therefrom.
   (b)   The power and authority conferred upon the county by this chapter may
be exercised by it throughout Frederick County, provided that the board may
provide for subservice areas within the county.
      (1)   That any municipal corporation may by appropriate ordinance or
resolution transfer the jurisdiction, power, and control of any sewerage,
water, drainage, or solid waste system of such municipal corporation to the
county upon terms and conditions approved by the board and may consent to be
included within the service area.
      (2)   That any municipal corporation in which there is no existing
sewerage, water, drainage, or solid waste system may consent to be included
within the service area.
(Code 1959, § 10A-6; 1979, Chapter 723, § 1; 1991, Chapter 194, § 1)
§ 2-13-6. Bids for construction of water, sewerage, drainage, or solid waste
systems; systems constructed by private persons.
   (a)   Whenever the plans and specifications for water, sewerage, drainage,
or solid waste systems or extensions have been completed and the board has
decided to proceed with construction, it shall solicit bids for the
construction of the system or systems, in part or as a whole, it judges
advisable. The contract shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder or the
board may reject any or all bids. If in its judgment the prices quoted are
unreasonable or unbalanced, it may obtain bids for the work or any part of it
or may do any part or all of the work by day labor. At any time the board may
expend by day labor for construction and for supplies and equipment an amount
not exceeding $5,000 without advertising and receiving bids. All such contracts
shall be protected by such bonds, penalties, and conditions as required by the
board, all of which shall be enforced in any court having jurisdiction.
   (b)   (1)   Instead of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the
board may authorize a private person to have plans and specifications for a
water, sewerage, or drainage system prepared at the expense of the person.
      (2)   The board also may allow the person to obtain price quotations or
bids for the construction of water, sewerage, or drainage systems and to enter
into contracts for the construction of the system.
      (3)   When constructed in accordance with the specifications and under
this inspection of the board of county commissioners, the system shall become
county property and included in the water, sewerage, or drainage systems of the
county.
      (4)   The systems authorized by this subsection may be constructed with
funds provided by the private person.
      (5)   The board may participate in the cost of construction in accordance
with the board’s regulations when the board determines that its financial
participation is required in the construction of a water and sewer system
undertaken by a private developer that provides facilities beyond the
requirements of the system.
      (6)   Under the provisions of this section, the board may participate
financially only to the extent that the costs of materials or other costs
totaling $10,000 or less exceed the requirements of the private project.

§ 2-13-7. Power of county to require applicants for water, sewerage or drainage
systems to bear costs of engineering studies.
   If the residents of any unincorporated locality in Frederick County make
application for a water, sewerage, or drainage system, or part thereof to be
constructed in their locality, the county may require the applicants to bear
the reasonable costs for any preliminary engineering studies that the board
deems necessary to determine whether it is feasible to construct the
improvements. Upon receipt of such reasonable costs as the board determines to
be necessary to conduct the studies, the board shall have the studies made and
within a reasonable time thereafter advise the applicants of the results
thereof, together with the board’s determination with respect to the
application.
(Code 1959, § 10A-7; 1979, Chapter 723, § 1)
§ 2-13-8. Preparation of drainage plan; creation of tax districts to finance
same; adoption of manuals.
   (a)   The board may prepare a plan or plans which in its judgment are
necessary or required for the control and disposition of surface waters within
the limits or any part of the service area and shall then divide the service
area, or any part of the service area, into separate drainage areas. Each
separate drainage area shall comprise, insofar as practicable, all land from
which surface water drains by gravity along a stream or a natural water course
to its nearest major outlet to tidewater. The division of the service area, or
any part of the service area, into drainage areas shall be effected by a
resolution adopted by the board, after a hearing held not less than 10 days
after notice of the hearing is published in a newspaper having general
circulation in the drainage area to be created. The resolution shall contain a
definite description of the boundaries of the drainage area or areas and shall
identify each drainage area by a distinctive name. After the passage of the
resolution, the board shall cause a plat of the drainage area or areas to be
prepared. One copy of the plat shall be filed with the administrative officer
to the board and one copy shall be indexed and filed among the land records of
Frederick County. Upon the filing of this plat, any drainage area shown on the
plat is designated and constituted for the purpose of this chapter to be a
separate drainage area and a taxing district for the purpose of imposing the
drainage area assessments and taxes authorized by §
2-13-18 of this chapter. The filing of this plat shall constitute legal notice
to the public of the action of the board.
   (b)   The board may adopt storm water and drainage manuals providing for the
type of installations necessary in various areas to accommodate the proper
drainage of given locations.
(Code 1959, § 10A-8; 1979, Chapter 723, § 1; 1991, Chapter 19, § 1)
§ 2-13-9. Condemnation of property.
   (a)   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the county to take or acquire any
land, structure, or building, or any stream bed, waterway, water rights, or
watershed, either in fee or as an easement, within or without Frederick County,
for the construction, extension or maintenance of any water main, sewer, or
appurtenance thereof, or any sewage treatment plant, reservoir, water treatment
plant, storage tank, or pumping station or any surface water drainage facility
or any solid waste facility or for the execution by the county of any other
power or function vested in it by this chapter, the county, if it be unable to
acquire the property of right by purchase, may condemn the property or right by
proceedings in the circuit court for the county in which the property or right
is located, as provided for condemnation of land in the Public General Laws of
Maryland, now or hereafter in effect; and the county may likewise condemn the
interest of any tenant, lessee, or other person having any right or interest in
the property. At any time after ten (10) days after the return and recordation
of the verdict or award in such proceedings, the county may enter and take
possession of the property so condemned, upon first paying to the clerk of the
court the amount of the award and all costs taxed to that date, notwithstanding
any appeal or further proceedings upon the part of the defendant. At the time
of said payment, however, the county shall give its corporate undertaking to
abide by and fulfill any judgment in any such appeal or further proceedings.
   (b)   In the condemnation of privately-owned water, drainage, or sewerage
systems, the jury shall take into consideration as a part of its award any
payment, contribution, or tax upon the respective lot owners or purchasers
toward the construction of the system, and where the system or systems have
been built in connection with or for the purpose of developing home sites,
subdivisions, or villages, or by any individuals, firm, or corporation, and
such system or systems have been offered as an inducement for the purchase of a
lot or land therein, the jury shall deduct from the determined value of the
plan or system such sum as it may reasonably determine was added to the
purchase price of the land or lots in the sale thereof for the purpose of
constructing the systems.
   (c)   Privately-owned systems shall be taken under condemnation by the
county free and clear of all debts and liens, but the county shall make a party
defendant of any person, firm, or corporation having any recorded lien or
encumbrance against the same, and the circuit court may determine the
respective amounts due the defendants; and from and after payment into court or
to the proper parties as herein above provided, the county is authorized to
take possession of, maintain, and operate the system, which shall be subject to
the same regulations and penalties as though the system so acquired had been
constructed and put into operation by the county under the provisions of this
chapter; provided, however, that no building or premises actually connected in
an adequate manner with the acquired water or sewerage system shall be required
to pay any connection charge.
   (d)   Whenever there is in existence a privately- owned water supply,
drainage or sewerage system which in the judgment of the board is unsuitable in
whole or in part for incorporation into the county’s system, the board may
disregard the existence of the system or unsuitable part thereof and extend its
system to serve the area tributary to the existing system or unsuitable part
thereof and all the provisions of this chapter relating to systems constructed
by the county apply thereto.

§ 2-13-11. Purchase or acquisition by gift of water, sewerage, drainage, or
solid waste systems.
   (a)   The county may purchase or acquire by gift any existing water,
sewerage, drainage, or solid waste system, or parts thereof, including those
owned, operated by, or serving any municipality, or any land, structure,
buildings, stream bed, water rights, or watershed, either in fee or as an
easement, which in its judgment is desirable or necessary for the purpose of
providing adequate water, sewerage, drainage, or solid waste service or any of
them for the residents of the service area. Any such purchase may be made upon
such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon, but before any part of the
purchase price is paid, other than a nominal sum of money to bind the
agreement, it is the duty of the vendor or agent to furnish a statement to the
board setting forth all names and addresses of persons having any interest or
claims against the property whatsoever, which shall be verified by an oath in
writing.
   (b)   Thereupon, it is the duty of the board to notify personally or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, all persons having any
interest whatever in the property, and in addition the board shall give three
weeks’ notice of its intention to purchase the property, in a newspaper or
newspapers published within the service area where the property is located; and
each person having any claim whatever against the property shall file its, his,
or her claim with the board on or before the expiration date mentioned in the
notice at which time any and all persons shall be heard.
   (c)   Any municipality whose system or any portion thereof is acquired by
the county by purchase may use the amount paid to it for the system for the
purchase or redemption of any bonds or debt which may be outstanding against
the same; or the county, as part of the purchase price of the system, may
assume the payment of any such bond or debt. The county may purchase any
existing water, sewerage or drainage systems, in whole or in part, which are
necessary or desirable for the purpose of carrying out the powers vested in it
by this chapter.

§ 2-13-12. Contracts with governmental agencies authorized.
   The county has full power and authority to enter into any contract for the
connection of its water supply, sewerage, drainage, or solid waste systems,
with those of any municipality or adjoining county, or any other governmental
agency, for the purchase of water and for the disposal of sewage, drainage, or
solid waste, and to enter into any other agreement concerning any matter deemed
by the board to be necessary, advisable, or expedient for the proper
construction, maintenance, and operation of the water, sewerage, drainage, or
solid waste systems under its control, or those under the control of any
municipality or county or other governmental agency. The county is further
empowered to enter into contracts with any municipality or other political
subdivision for the joint acquisition, construction, ownership, and operation
of any water, sewerage, drainage, or solid waste system or any portion thereof.

§ 2-13-13. Bonds authorized generally.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing funds for the design, construction,
establishment, purchase, or condemnation of water, sewerage, drainage, and
solid waste systems in Frederick County pursuant to this chapter, the County is
hereby authorized and empowered to borrow money, from time to time, and to
evidence such borrowing by the issuance of bonds, which shall constitute a
pledge of the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power of the County.
   (b)   The bonds of each issue shall be designated, shall be dated and shall
bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature in such amount or amounts and
at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their date or dates of issue,
as may be determined by the County, and may be made redeemable before maturity,
at the option of the County, at such price or prices and under such terms and
conditions as may be fixed by the County prior to the issuance of the bonds.
The County may provide for creation of a sinking fund or funds for the payment
of the bonds at or prior to their maturity date or dates. The County shall
determine the form of the bonds, including any interest coupons to be attached
thereto, and the manner of execution of the bonds, and shall fix the
denomination or denominations of the bonds and the place or places of payment
of principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company, and any
other matter relating to the form, terms, conditions, issuance, sale and
delivery of the bonds. In case any officer whose signature shall appear on any
bonds or coupons shall cease to be such officer before the delivery of such
bonds or shall become such after the date of issue thereof, such signature
shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes the same as if he
had remained in office until such delivery or had held said office on said date
of issue. The bonds may be issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as
the County may determine, and provision may be made for the registration of any
coupon bonds as to principal alone, or as to both principal and interest, and
for the reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both
principal and interest. The County may sell such bonds in such manner, either
at public or private sale, and for such price, as the County may determine to
be in the best interest of the County. At any time prior to the issuance of any
such bonds the County may, in addition to any sums appropriated under any other
provision of law, advance such sums as may be necessary to cover the expense of
issuance of such bonds, which shall be treated and repaid as part of the cost
of the project or projects financed with the proceeds of any such bonds.
   (c)   The proceeds of such bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the
cost of the project or projects on account of which such bonds are issued and
the cost of issuance of such bonds and shall be disbursed in such manner and
under such restrictions, if any, as the County may provide in the authorizing
resolution. If the proceeds of such bonds, by error of estimates or otherwise,
shall be less than such cost, additional bonds may in like manner be issued to
provide the amount of such deficit, and, unless otherwise provided in the
authorizing resolution, shall be deemed to be of the same issue and shall be
entitled to payment from the same fund without preference or priority of the
bonds first issued for the same purpose.
   (d)   In every case where the proceeds of any such issue of bonds are
expended for the cost of one or more projects, the County shall cause separate
capital accounts to be created for each such project,
among which the bond proceeds shall be divided and from which the separate
costs of each such project shall be paid. In connection with the proceeds of
any issue of bonds expended for the purchase, expansion or development of water
and sewer systems to be acquired, constructed or reconstructed by the County
and consolidated with the County’s system and to the extent practicable after
giving due consideration to the financial condition of the County and the
County’s ability to incur indebtedness for any other purposes, the County shall
endeavor to provide for annual debt service on such issue of bonds from the
funds provided by connection charges described in §
2-13-22. If necessary, the County shall levy special assessments or other
charges with respect to each such system in such a manner as to provide a
proportionate share of the annual debt service on the issue of bonds equal to
the proportion of the proceeds of the issue expended for the system.
   (e)   The County’s full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power shall be
unconditionally pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on any
bonds issued pursuant to this section. In the event that the funds available to
the County from all sources are insufficient to pay any bonds issued hereunder,
together with the interest due thereon, the County, in each and every fiscal
year in which bonds are outstanding, shall levy and collect ad valorem taxes
upon all the legally assessable property within the corporate limits of
Frederick County in rate and amount sufficient to provide for such payments
when due, together with accrued interest to the date of payment. In the event
the proceeds from the taxes so levied in any fiscal year are inadequate for the
above purposes, the County shall levy additional taxes in the succeeding fiscal
year to make up any deficiency.

§ 2-13-14. Revenue bonds.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing funds for the design, construction,
establishment, purchase, or condemnation of water, sewerage, drainage, and
solid waste systems in Frederick County pursuant to this chapter, the County is
hereby authorized and empowered, in addition to the authority and power
conferred by §
2-13-13 of this chapter, to borrow money in such amounts as may be needed for
said purpose and to evidence such borrowing by the issuance and sale of its
revenue bonds, payable as to principal and interest solely from the proceeds of
special benefit assessments and other charges imposed and made by the County on
the project or projects so financed with the proceeds of the bonds, which
revenues the County is hereby authorized to pledge to such payment. The County
is hereby authorized and empowered to fix and determine the form and tenor of
said revenue bonds, the denominations thereof, the rate or rates of interest
payable thereon, the maturity date or dates thereof, the place or places of
payment thereof, the method and manner of sale thereof and all other matters
related to the form, terms, conditions, issuance, sale, and delivery of the
revenue bonds, all as provided in §
2-13-13 of this chapter. The amount of such revenue bonds which may be issued
by the County shall be limited only by the cost of the project or projects to
be financed thereby. Such revenue bonds shall not constitute an obligation of,
or a pledge of the faith and credit of, the County or the State of Maryland,
but on the contrary, the principal and interest thereof are payable solely from
the revenues prescribed therein or in the resolution or trust indenture
authorizing the same and each revenue bond shall so state.
   (b)   The County is hereby authorized and empowered, in its discretion, to
secure any revenue bonds issued hereunder by an appropriate trust indenture by
and between the County and a corporate trustee, which may be any trust company,
or bank having trust powers, within or outside the state. Every such trust
indenture shall clearly recite that such bonds are limited obligations of the
County, payable solely from the revenues therein prescribed, and do not
constitute general obligations of the County or of the State of Maryland and
that the faith and credit and taxing power of the County or the State of
Maryland are not pledged to the payment of the bonds. Any such trust indenture
may contain covenants on the part of the county, not contrary to law, deemed
necessary or appropriate by the County for the proper security of the
purchasers of any such bonds, but the County shall not enter into any covenant
which will permit the trustee or bondholders in any manner to sell or otherwise
divest the County of its title to any project or projects financed with the
proceeds of any such bonds, without the prior written consent of the County.
Subject to the foregoing limitation, any such trust indenture may contain
covenants for the protection of bondholders relating to all or any of the
following:
      (1)   The nature, extent and procedure for acquiring or constructing any
project or projects and the supervision thereof;
      (2)   The maintenance and operation of any such project or projects and
the supervision thereof and the employment of consulting engineers, auditors,
attorneys and other experts in connection with any such acquisition,
construction, maintenance or operation;
      (3)   The terms and provisions of the bonds and the securing of the
proceeds thereof, the imposition and collection of assessments, charges and
rentals for the use of any such project or projects and the use, application
and security of any revenues so collected, including the establishment, deposit
and securing from any such revenues for debt service on, or prior redemption
of, any such revenue bonds, or for the maintenance, operation and improvement
of any such project or projects;
      (4)   The insurance on any such project or projects;
      (5)   The issuance of additional revenue bonds for any such project or
projects and the limitations thereon;
      (6)   The powers, duties and indemnification of any trustee, or its
successor party to any such trust indenture;
      (7)   The rights and remedies of said trustee and of bondholders in the
event of any default by the County under any such trust indenture, which rights
and remedies may include the taking over of any operation by said trustee or by
a receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction of the project or
projects financed with the proceeds of any such issue of revenue bonds secured
by such trust indenture, and the marshaling of the revenues from any such
project or projects for the use and benefit of bondholders. In addition to the
covenants enumerated above but subject to the limitations herein contained, the
County is hereby authorized and empowered to make such further additional
covenants in any such trust indenture, of like or different character as, in
its judgment, may be necessary, convenient or desirable for the better security
of any issue of its revenue bonds secured by any such trust indenture or as
will, in its judgment, tend to make any such bonds more marketable.

pursuant to the provisions of Title 9, Subtitle 6 of the Environment Article of
the Annotated Code of Maryland;

which are then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium
thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or any subsequent
date of redemption, purchase or maturity of the bonds. Refunding bonds may be
issued in an amount in excess of that of the bonds to be refunded, but the
proceeds of sale of refunding bonds, after payment of all costs of issuance of
said bonds, may only be used to refund the bonds described in this paragraph.
The powers granted and the limitations imposed by §§

mutilation and cremation of any such instruments after an appropriate
accounting therefor, and the County may also provide for the replacement of any
of them which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or lost, upon receipt of
such indemnification, and the payment of the expenses of replacement as the
County in its discretion may deem proper or requisite.

   (1)   Such bonds are investment securities under the laws of this state,

§ 2-13-18. Special assessments for water or sewerage systems.
   (a)   For the purpose of paying the interest on and principal of the bonds
issued by the County as in this chapter provided for the water and sewerage
systems to be constructed, purchased, or established under this chapter, the
County may fix an annual assessment on all properties, improved or unimproved,
binding upon a street, road, lane, alley, or right-of-way in which a water main
or sewer has been built. The annual assessment shall be made upon the front
foot basis, and the first payment shall be collected during the year in which
the construction is completed on the water supply or sewerage system or in
which the systems are purchased or acquired. All sums collected by the County
for benefits levied against the property for water or sewerage construction
shall be set aside as a separate fund to be known and designated as the front
foot benefit assessment fund.
   (b)   The County for the purpose of assessing benefits shall divide all
properties binding upon a street, road, lane, alley, or right-of-way, in which
a water pipe or sanitary sewer is to be laid, into four (4) classes, namely:
agricultural, small acreage, industrial or business, and residential, and the
County may subdivide each of these classes in such manner as it deems to be in
the public interest. Whenever any water or sewerage project in the service area
has been completed and declared ready for service, the County shall fix and
levy an assessment for the remainder of the fiscal year on a pro rata basis
upon all property in the service area abutting upon the water main or sewer, in
accordance with the classification or subdivision thereof; and it shall in
writing notify all owners of the properties into which class and subdivision
their respective properties fall and the charge determine upon, naming also in
the notice a time and place, when and at which time the owner will be heard.
Such notice may be mailed to the last known address of the owner, or served in
person upon any adult occupying the premises or in case of a vacant or
unimproved property, posted upon the premises.
   (c)   The classification of and the benefit assessment made against any
property by the County is final, subject only to revision at the hearing. The
County may change the classification of properties from time to time as the
properties change in the uses to which they are put. The benefit assessment
shall be levied for water supply and sewerage construction and shall be based
for each class of property upon the number of front feet abutting upon the
street, lane, road, alley, or right-of-way in which the water pipe or sewer is
placed; provided, however, that in the case of any irregular shaped lot
abutting upon a road, street, lane, alley, or right-of-way in which there is or
is being constructed a water or sewer system at any point, the lot shall be
assessed for such frontage as the County may determine to be reasonable and
fair; and provided further that no residential property may be assessed on more
than one side unless it abuts upon two (2) parallel streets, that corner lots
may be averaged and assessed upon such frontage as the County may deem
reasonable and fair, and that all lots in the residential and industrial or
business classification shall be assessed even though a water main or sewer may
not extend along the full length of any boundary; and provided further, that no
land classified as agricultural by the County shall be assessed a front foot
benefit when it has constructed through it or in front of it a sewer or water
main until such time as the water or sewer connection is made, and when so made
and for every connection such land is liable to a front foot assessment for
such reasonable frontage not exceeding three hundred (300) feet, or as may be
determined by the County, and shall be immediately assessed at the rate of
assessment determined by the County for agricultural land. Any land owned by a
religious body upon which there is erected a church or a parsonage and which is
used exclusively for customary religious purposes, in the discretion of the
County, may be exempted from front foot benefit assessment for that frontage
not exceeding one hundred fifty (150) feet.
   (d)   Front foot benefit assessments for water supply and sewerage
construction shall be as nearly uniform as is practicable for each class or
subclass of property for any one year, and no benefit charge, once levied, may
be increased; provided, however, that whenever the County acquires an existing
system other than a municipal system, the construction of which has been added
in whole or in part to the purchase price of land or lots abutting upon the
system and which contribution the County has determined to be a factor in the
cost to the County of such system, the County in its discretion may levy such
lesser assessment as may take into account this factor.
   (e)   The amount of the assessment per front foot for each class of property
for water and sewer systems may be reduced from time to time by the County in
its discretion, if cost and conditions are deemed by it to justify the
reduction, but may be subsequently increased to the amount of the original
assessment in the event revenues prove to be insufficient. The benefit
assessments shall be paid annually by all properties located as above specified
for a period of years coextensive with the period of maturity of the bonds out
of the proceeds of which such construction was done.
   (f)   The County may permit a connection with a water main or sewer by a
property owner whose property does not abut on the water main or sewer. The
entire cost of extending the system to the property to be connected
(specifically including, but without limitation, the cost of engineering and
feasibility studies, and of acquiring necessary easements) shall be paid by the
property owner requesting service. However, if the size of the extension
required by the County exceeds that which may be necessary to serve the
property of the owner requesting service, then the cost of the excess shall be
paid by the County. The costs to be paid by the property owner, as estimated by
the County, plus a reasonable reserve for contingencies, shall be deposited by
the property owner with the County before the County enters into any contract
or incurs any expense in connection with the proposed extension. The cost of
the extension required to be paid by the property owner shall be in addition to
those front foot benefit assessments as may be assessed according to this
chapter, and those connection charges as may be imposed.
   (g)   The annual benefit assessment or other charge as above specified is a
lien upon the property against which it is assessed until paid, any statute of
limitations to the contrary notwithstanding, subject only to prior State and
County taxes. If any property is sold for State or County taxes, or both, by
the County Treasurer, and if after the sale there is a surplus after all costs
and expenses incident to the sale have been paid, the County upon proper
petition to the circuit court shall be allowed any balance from the surplus,
and shall be a preferred lienor to the extent of its lien; and for the purpose
of giving notice to the general public as to existing liens and charges against
any property within Frederick County abutting upon any water or sewer main, or
connected thereto, the County shall keep a public record of all names or owners
of property, locations of said property, lot numbers when of record, and the
amount of such benefit assessments, water service charges, or such other
charges that may become liens from time to time. The records shall be kept in
the office of the County as a public record, and when so kept shall be legal
notice of all existing liens within Frederick County. The County shall request
the County Treasurer to print a notice on the State and County tax bills that
benefit assessments and other charges for water and sewer services must be paid
in the office of the County or elsewhere as the County may designate.
   (h)   The County may reserve sewerage or water treatment capacity for the
development of schools or other public buildings, facilities or services, or
industrial development. The amount of capacity held in reserve may not exceed
fifteen (15) percent of the system.
   (i)   In addition to the authority to fix assessments on a front foot
benefit basis as described in this section, the County may fix assessments on a
basis that is similar and reasonably reflects the benefit to the property,
subject to County regulations. The assessments may be levied on all property
benefitted by a particular system or systems or may be levied on all property
benefitted by water, sewer, or drainage systems.

§ 2-13-19. Special assessments for drainage systems.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing for the payment of the principal of and
the interest on the bonds issued by the county under the terms and conditions
of this chapter for the construction of drainage systems, there may be levied
by the board, on behalf of the county, a special assessment to be known as a
drainage area assessment against all of the properties within the drainage area
served by the system, whether immediately or remotely, which the board may
determine to be specifically benefitted by the system, based on the area or on
the assessed value of all of the property belonging to any owner within the
drainage area and so benefitted, which special assessment shall be uniform
throughout the area affected. This special assessment shall be made on either
an area basis or on an assessed valuation basis, whichever is deemed more
equitable and just by the board, and the selection made by the board shall be
final and conclusive. The special assessment, if levied, shall be levied
annually in an amount deemed equitable and just (taking into account the
benefit to the properties in the drainage area) by the board and shall be used
to meet all or a part of the principal and interest requirements of the bonds
outstanding, the proceeds of which were used for the construction, and related
expenses, of the drainage system installed in the drainage area. Before the
special assessment as provided by this section of this chapter is levied, the
board shall mail to the owners of all properties within the drainage area or
part thereof upon which it proposes to levy a special assessment, at the
address of the owner as appears from the tax records of Frederick County,
notice that the special assessment is to be levied and giving the property
owners an opportunity to be heard thereon at a time and place fixed in the
notice. At the hearing, the board may adjust the special assessment,
maintaining, however, the uniformity of the base rate or percentage of levy.
   (b)   In any event, the board shall levy annually, on behalf of the county,
an ad valorem tax upon all legally assessable property in a drainage area in a
sufficient amount, together with any drainage and assessments and any other
funds available for the purpose, to meet the principal and interest
requirements, when due, of any bonds outstanding, the proceeds of which were
used for the construction and related expenses of a drainage system installed
in a drainage area.
(Code 1959, § 10A-26; 1979, Chapter 723, § 1)
§ 2-13-20. County to provide water and sewer connections; power to require
connections; prohibited runoff; power to make connections at expense of
property owner.
   The county may provide a service connection for each property abutting on a
street or right-of-way in which a water service line or sewer service line is
laid, when the property has the appropriate water/sewerage service designation,
and plant capacity is available to service the property. The water/sewer
service connection shall be extended as required from the water and sewer
service line to the property line of the abutting lot. The water service pipe
and the connection with the sewer shall be constructed by and at the expense of
the county, subject to any charge for the connection as provided in §
2-13-22 of this chapter, which shall be paid by property owners at the office
of the board. When any water main or sewer is declared by the board to be
complete and ready for the delivery of water or the reception of sewage, every
abutting property owner, after notice, shall connect all spigots or hydrants,
toilets and waste drains with the water main or sewer within the time
prescribed by the board. If these fixtures do not exist or are of a nature
which, in the judgment of the board, is improper or inadequate, satisfactory
equipment shall be installed by the owner of the premises. The equipment shall
consist of at least one water closet and one sink or washbasin, both of which
shall be properly connected with the sewer of the county. A private water or
sewerage system may not be connected to any water or sewerage system owned or
operated by the county. All private water systems discharging waste water into
the county sewerage system and cesspools, sink drains, and privies located on
properties connected to sewers provided by the county shall be abandoned,
closed, and left in a sanitary condition so that no odor or nuisance will
arise. No roof or other drainage facilities shall discharge into the county’s
water and sewerage facilities. Whenever any property owner, after notice, fails
to connect with a water main or sewer, or fails to abandon all cesspools,
drains and privies, as provided for in this chapter, the board may have the
connections made or cause the cesspools, drains and privies to be closed and
abandoned, or both, and to charge the costs of the connection or closing, or
both, to the owner of the property affected. The costs shall be a lien against
the property affected until paid and may be collected in the same manner as
county or municipal taxes are collected. Any violation of the provisions of
this section is a misdemeanor punishable under §
2-13-31 of this chapter.

§ 2-13-21. Plumbing permits and fire hydrants.
   (a)   Before any plumbing, waterworks, or sewer construction is done in any
building or upon any private property within Frederick County, the person,
firm, or corporation doing the construction shall first obtain a permit from
the county and pay therefor such reasonable sum as the board may prescribe. The
work shall be done under and pursuant to such rules, regulations, and
requirements as the board may from time to time formulate, and subject to such
inspection as it may deem necessary; provided, that, to avoid duplication of
supervision, the board may waive this provision if the state department of
health and mental hygiene issues the permits and makes the inspections required
by this subsection in a manner satisfactory to the board.
   (b)   The county shall have full and complete jurisdiction over all fire
hydrants connected with its water system; and no person, firm or corporation
may operate, use, or make connection with the system without the written
authority of the board, except that no restriction shall apply to any bona fide
fire department in the discharge of its duties. No person, firm, or corporation
may tamper with, deface, damage, or obstruct any fire hydrant. A violation of
any of the provisions of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable under
section §
2-13-31 of this chapter.

meaning the installation of waterlines, sanitary sewers, storm drainage and
related appurtenances, done from the property line of any property to a point
not less than five feet from the foundation wall of any building or structure
on the property shall be performed only under a valid permit and by a utility
contractor who is licensed under Article 56, § 180 or by a licensed master
plumber. The provisions of this section shall prevail, notwithstanding any
other provisions of law.

§ 2-13-22. Water or sewerage connection charges.
   (a)   For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this chapter, the
county may make a charge for every sewer and water connection. The funds
derived from these charges may be used for payment of principal and interest on
bonds, accumulating funds for capital improvements, for acquisition and
construction of water and sewerage systems and the operation and maintenance
thereof and for the purchase of equipment and supplies necessary to the
operation of the board. Connection charges may be established by the board.
These charges may be based upon reasonable classifications as the board may
determine and those classifications may vary within any water or sewer system
and among any of those systems depending on any special circumstances which the
[commission] board finds exist. The charges provided are not to be limited to
the costs to the board for making those connections. The board is empowered to
determine the manner in which charges shall be payable.
   (b)   The board may permit a connection with a water main or sewer by a
property owner whose property does not abut on the water main or sewer. The
entire cost of extending the system to the property to be connected
(specifically including, but without limitation, the cost of engineering and
feasibility studies and of acquiring necessary easements) shall be paid by the
property owner requesting service. However, if the size of the extension
required by the county exceeds that which may be necessary to serve the
property of the owner requesting service, then the cost of the excess shall be
paid by the board. The costs to be paid by the property owner, as estimated by
the board, plus a reasonable reserve for contingencies, shall be deposited by
the property owner with the board before the county enters into any contract or
incurs any expense in connection with the proposed extension. The cost of the
extension required to be paid by the property owner shall be in addition to
those front foot benefit assessments as may be assessed according to §
2-13-18 of this chapter and those connection charges as may be imposed
according to subsection (A) of this section.

§ 2-13-23. Other water and sewerage authorized charges.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing funds for maintaining, repairing, and
operating its water and sewerage systems and for its operation and other
expenses, including property depreciation allowances, and for interest on and
the retirement of bonds as specified in this chapter, the board may make the
following charges:
      (1)   A water and sewer service charge. The rates for water and sewer
service shall consist of a minimum or ready-to-serve charge which shall be
based upon the size of the meter on the water connection leading to the
property, and of a charge for water used, which shall be based upon the amount
of water passing through the meter during the period between the last two
readings. The meter shall be required to be placed on each water connection by
and at the sole expense of the county, and it shall remain the property of the
county. The rates shall be classified within Frederick County in whatever
manner the board deems advisable. However, the classification shall be based
upon the quantities of water used and shall be, insofar as possible, uniform
throughout Frederick County. If the board at any time does not have meters
available to install in all the properties in a given locality that are
connected to the system, then a flat rate shall be charged on properties in
which meters have not yet been installed. That rate shall be uniform in each
system and based upon the ready-to-serve charge and the amount of water used.
Bills for water and sewer charges shall be sent either quarterly or
semiannually, as the board determines, to each property served and shall be
payable at the office of the board or whatever other place the board
designates. The charges shall be a lien upon the property served and
collectible as elsewhere provided. If any bill remains unpaid 30 days after the
date it was sent, the board, after written notice left upon the premises or
mailed to the last known address of the owner, shall turn off the water from
the property in question. The water may not be turned on again until the bill
has been paid, including a penalty in a reasonable amount to be established by
the Board of County Commissioners.
      (2)   A charge for the upkeep of water and sewer systems against all
properties benefitted by any such system or having a connection with any water
main or sewer under its operation or ownership. The charge for the upkeep of
the water and sewer system, if any, shall be made upon a reasonable basis
determined by the board and shall be collected annually in the same manner as
are front foot benefit assessments against all property benefitted by or having
a connection with a water main or sewer under the operation or ownership of the
county. It shall be a lien against the property. The charges shall be based
upon the classifications the board establishes and shall be uniform throughout
each system within each classification. A charge for the upkeep of water and
sewer systems may not be made against any property in any year for which the
property is currently subject to a front foot benefit assessment as provided in
this chapter.
   (b)   Before any sewer or water system is added to a consolidated system for
either sewer or water rates, the board of county commissioners shall conduct a
duly advertised public hearing on the subject. A consolidated system is an
arrangement in which a sewer and water system or any combinations thereof are
combined as one unit for the establishment of uniform rates.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the provisions of
chapter 2-13, the county may consolidate the income and outlays for all water
systems, sewer systems, drainage systems, and solid waste systems it owns for
the purpose of:
      (i)   Maintaining, repairing, and operating water, sewer, drainage, and
solid waste systems;
      (ii)   Establishing rates, charges, and assessments; and
      (iii)   Paying the principal and interest on any authorized indebtedness.

§ 2-13-24. Charges and assessments are liens; tax sales to collect.
   Front foot benefit assessments, drainage assessments, water and sewer system
upkeep charges, connection charges, and other charges which the board is
empowered to make shall be liens upon the property served or benefitted and, in
addition to being enforced by actions at law, may be enforced by a bill in
equity against the property so served or benefitted. In addition to being
enforced by actions at law and a bill in equity, the county tax collector, if
directed by the board, shall sell the property of the delinquent property owner
in the same manner as other properties are sold at a tax sale. The liens shall
be subject only to liens for state and county taxes. Such charges shall be due
when made and after thirty (30) days from that date may bear interest at the
rate of up to one percent per month as established by a resolution of the
board. Neither the due dates nor the interval between such dates need be
uniform throughout Frederick County. If a property owner fails to connect to a
sewer or a water system which is declared by the board to be complete and ready
for the delivery of water or the reception of sewage under §
2-13-20 of this code, the property owner shall pay the minimum charge
established for that system from the time that the property owner is given
notice and fails to make connections with the water main or sewer line.

   Ch. 723 of the 1979 Acts designated the above section as section 10A-29 of

§ 2-13-25. Entry powers of county employees; power to order work to provide
conservation of water or to eliminate improper use of sewers.
   Any employee or agent of the county has the right of entry, at all
reasonable hours, upon any private premises and into any building in the
service area while in pursuit of his official duties, after reasonable notice
and upon first presenting proper credentials from the board. The board or the
county’s agent or employees may order and require such changes in plumbing,
water usage, drainage, water or sewer connections as it deems necessary to
eliminate leakage, loss of water, unnecessary or improper use of sewers. The
board shall exercise control of the water supply at all times and in case of
shortage of water or, for any other reason, the board, in the exercise of its
discretion, may determine that the water supply should be conserved. The
consumers, upon notice from the county, its agents or employees, or upon notice
published in one newspaper published in Frederick County for one insertion
shall comply with any order passed by the board to conserve the water supply.
In addition to any other penalty herein prescribed, the county may turn off the
water supply of any person violating such an order at any time without further
notice. Any unreasonable restraint or hindrance offered by any owner, tenant,
or agent or any other person to the right of entry in this section provided or
any violation of any order issued pursuant to this section is a misdemeanor
punishable under section [10A-23] 10A-30 of this chapter. Nothing in this
section is applicable within any municipality or to any water and sewerage
system operated by a municipality unless authorized in accordance with §
2-13-6 of this chapter.

§ 2-13-26. Private water, sewer or drainage systems.
   No sewerage, water, or drainage system or extension thereof serving two or
more properties in Frederick County may be constructed by any private owner
without the prior approval of the board. If upon application for the
construction or extension of any such system the board determines that the
construction or extension is inexpedient or impracticable at that time, owing
to the remoteness from its general system or other considerations, the
applicant may build and operate the system or extension thereof at its own
expense; but it shall be constructed only under plans and specifications which
have been submitted to and approved by the board and its maintenance and
operation shall be under the general control or supervision of the board. No
such system or part thereof or no water main, sewer, storm water drain, water
purification or sewage treatment plant or no connection with any of them shall
be constructed or installed except as in this section provided, and any
violation of this provision shall be a misdemeanor punishable under §
2-13-31 of this chapter. The applicant for the construction or extension of any
such privately-owned system shall bear the reasonable costs that the board may
incur for the review and approval of any such plans and for the supervision by
the board of the maintenance and operation of the system. All construction and
operating records, including cost records, shall be filed with the board, which
shall be empowered at any time to take over the system or part thereof or the
water main, sewer, storm water drain, water purification or sewer treatment
plant or connection with any of them in the same manner as provided under §
10A-9. Nothing in this section impairs the rate making powers of the public
service commission nor eliminates the requirements of the law for the approval
of the [department of health] department of health and mental hygiene in the
construction and maintenance of the facilities. No private sewerage, water, or
drainage systems or extensions thereof authorized by this section shall be
approved if the construction and operation of the system or systems will cause
water pollution endangering the water supply of any municipality or other
public agency or private utility corporation supplying water and sewer services
in Frederick County. If a private system approved under the authority hereof
causes such pollution, then the county is authorized to require such
modifications as may be necessary to eliminate the pollution and to take such
other legal steps as may be necessary to enforce its orders eliminating the
nuisance of water pollution.

§ 2-13-27. Excavation on roads.
   The board may enter upon and excavate any state or county street, road, or
way, or any other public highway within the service area for the purpose of
installing, maintaining, and operating the water, sewerage, or drainage systems
provided for under this chapter; and it may construct in any such street, road,
way, or public highway, a water main, sewer, or drain or any appurtenances
thereof, without the receipt of a permit or the payment of a charge; provided,
that whenever any state or county highway within the service area is to be
disturbed, the public authority having control thereof shall be duly notified;
and provided further, that the highway shall be repaired and left by the board
in the same condition or in a condition not inferior to that existing before it
was torn up, and that all costs incident thereto shall be borne by the county.

§ 2-13-28. Removal of structures, pipes, etc. impeding construction, plans for
poles, pipes, etc. in public ways to be approved by board.
   All individuals, firms, or corporations having buildings, conduits, pipes,
tracks, poles, or other structures or obstructions in, on, over, under, or
through any public road, street, or way, which blocks or impedes the
construction and establishment of the county’s water, sewerage, or drainage
systems, or other works, upon reasonable notice from the board, shall promptly
shift, adjust, accommodate, or remove structures or obstructions as fully to
meet the exigencies occasioning the action; provided, however, that the
reasonable cost of the changes shall be borne by the county. Every public
service corporation, company, or individual, before it or they shall begin any
excavation or construction in street, road, way, or public highway, shall file
with the board plans of such work and construction showing the location and
depth in the street, road, way, or public highway of the proposed main,
conduit, pole, pipe, or other structure, and such construction or work shall
not be begun until the plan is approved by the board, nor shall any change be
made in the approved plan or in the work or construction as shown by the plan,
except on further approval of the board. Whenever any main, conduit, pole,
pipe, or other structure is installed without the filing of plans with the
Board and the approval thereof by it, or when any change is made in the
location of the main, conduit, pipe, pole, or other structure as shown upon the
plans approved by the Board, or any approved change therein, the board, if and
when such conduit, main, pipe, or pole, or other structure interferes with the
construction of or operation of the water, drainage, or sewerage system, or
other works, may remove the conduit, main, pipe, pole, or other structures or
change the location thereof at the cost and expense of the party putting them
in, or their heirs, assigns, or successors, and without any liability upon the
part of the county for damage that might be done to the same by reason of the
board’s operation in constructing or maintaining the system or works. Any
violation of the provisions of this section is a misdemeanor punishable under §
2-13-31 of this chapter.

§ 2-13-29. Annual audit of accounts.
   The county shall annually have any accounts which are maintained to
implement this chapter audited by a certified public accountant to be selected

   (b)   In addition to its own power to adopt appropriate rules and
regulations, the board may adopt and enforce regulations of the state

or both, fixing standards of construction for water and sewer facilities or
installations.
   (c)   Prior to the adoption of any such rules and regulations other than
those of the state department of health and mental hygiene or the Frederick
County Health Officer, the board shall give public notice of the rules and
regulations which it proposes to adopt by publishing a fair summary of the same
in at least one newspaper of general circulation published in Frederick County
at least twice not less than fifteen (15) days prior to a public hearing, the
date, time and place of which shall be specified in the notice.

   Every act or omission designated as a misdemeanor in this chapter, unless
otherwise provided, shall be punishable by any court of competent jurisdiction,
and the offender, upon conviction, is subject to a fine not exceeding one
hundred dollars ($100.00) or confinement in the county jail for not more than

continuation of the offense subsequent to the first or any succeeding
conviction. In addition, the Board may enforce this chapter by injunctions or

   (b)   The provisions of this chapter are severable, and it is the intention
to confer the whole or any part of the powers herein provided for, and if any
of the provisions of this chapter shall be held unconstitutional by any court
of competent jurisdiction, the decision of such court shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions of this chapter. It is hereby declared
to be the legislative intent that this chapter would have been adopted had such
unconstitutional provision not been included therein.
