their duty. The commissioners, or a majority of them, after having carefully
run out, marked and located the dividing line as described, shall cause two
plats to be made out, and also two certificates under their hands and seals,
specifying the courses according to the true meridian, the distances and the

   (b)   (1)   The County Commissioners may remove any nuisance or menace to
the public health or safety arising from the growth of weeds, the accumulation
of refuse, an abandoned well, the presence of stagnant water, or the presence
of combustible material after 15 days’ advance notice to the owner or occupant
of the property upon which the nuisance or menace is found.
      (2)   Except as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the growth of
weeds may not constitute a nuisance or menace if:

fide agricultural purpose; or

menace to the public health or safety exists by reason of the growth of weeds,
accumulation of refuse, an abandoned well, the presence of stagnant water, or
the presence of combustible material shall constitute prima facie proof that
the nuisance or menace exists. It shall be the duty of the County Health
Officer to investigate all complaints of a nuisance or menace to the public
health or safety, as described in this section.
   (g)   If for any reason the County Health Officer refuses or fails to
investigate a complaint of nuisance due to the growth of weeds, the County may
investigate the complaint and may, on a determination that the vegetation is
lawn or weeds and is at or exceeds a height of 12 inches, determine the growth
to be weeds which constitute a nuisance under the provisions of this section.
   (h)   Lands that are enrolled in a State or Federal program that removes the
land from crop production for a specified period of time and that has caused
the lands to be established and maintained in plant cover to conserve soil,
improve wildlife habitat, or serve other public benefit purposes may not be

of the State or Federal agency administering the applicable program.

   (a)   Subject to the provisions of §
3-804 of this subtitle, the County Attorney, when requested in writing by any
officer or employee of the County, may defend any criminal action instituted in
the Courts of this State or of the United States against the officer or

the absence of gross negligence and in the scope of employment. However, if the
County Attorney determines that representation is appropriate, special counsel
shall be appointed to appear and defend the criminal action.
   (b)   (1)   Subject to the provisions of §
3-804, the County Attorney, when requested in writing by any officer or
employee of the County shall appear and defend any civil action or special
proceeding instituted in the courts of this State or of the United States
against the officer or employee by reason of any act done or omitted to be done
without malice and in the absence of gross negligence and in the scope of his
employment. The defense may be rendered by the County Attorney, by an
assistant, by any special counsel when directed to do so by the County
Attorney, or by private counsel retained by the County Attorney. The defense of
the case shall include the right to assert counterclaims and to engage in third
party practice on behalf of the officer or employee.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the County
Attorney may decline to represent an officer or employee who retains private
counsel.
   (c)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive any officer or
employee of the right to select counsel of the officer’s or employee’s own
choice at the officer’s or employee’s own expense, nor does this section
prevent the County Attorney from entering an appearance in a case to protect
the interests of the County even though no request for such appearance has been
forthcoming from the officer or employee named as a defendant.
3-804. Investigation by County Attorney.
1980, ch. 811; 1999 Supp., sec. 3-70; 2000, ch. 601.
Before undertaking any defense, the County Attorney shall conduct an
investigation of the facts on which the action or special proceeding is based.
If the County Attorney determines that the officer or employee was not acting
within the scope of the officer’s or employee’s employment or that the act or
omission was malicious or grossly negligent, the investigation shall proceed no
further, and no defense may be provided for the officer or employee pursuant to
this section or §
3-803 of this subtitle. The investigation required may be accomplished by the
County Attorney, any assistant, or by any other attorney or person when
directed to do so by the County Attorney. If it appears that the officer or
employee is covered by a policy of insurance under the terms of which the
carrier is required to provide counsel in these actions or special proceedings,
the County Attorney may terminate further investigation and provide no
representation for the officer or employee. Subject to the provisions of this
section and §
3-803 of this subtitle, the County Attorney has sole discretion to assume the
defense of any officer or employee.
3-805. Same; reimbursement of expenses.
1980, ch. 811; 1999 Supp., sec. 3-71; 2000, ch. 601.
If the County Attorney determines, pursuant to §
3-804 of this subtitle, not to assume the defense of a county officer or
employee, and it is judicially determined that the injuries arose out of an act
or omission of the officer or employee during the performance of the officer’s
or employee’s duties and within the scope of the officer’s or employee’s
employment and that the act or omission of the officer or employee was not
malicious, or grossly negligent, or it is established that the defense of
immunity is available to the officer or employee, the County is liable to the
officer or employee for reasonable expenses in prosecuting the officer’s or
employee’s own defense, including court costs and attorneys’ fees. These
expenses shall be paid with the approval of the County Attorney by the agency,
board, commission, or department by which the officer or employee was employed
at the time the act or omission complained of in the action occurred. This
section is not applicable if the expenses are reimbursed to the officer or
employee pursuant to the provisions of § 
3-809 of this subtitle. The decision of the County Attorney not to defend an
officer or employee is not admissible as evidence in any legal action or
special proceeding and no reference to the decision may be made in any trial or
hearing. In any action or proceeding against an officer or employee that
results in a final judgment or other disposition, the court or jury shall
return a special verdict in the form of written findings which determine if the
officer or employee was acting within the scope of the officer’s or employee’s
employment; if the alleged act or omission by the officer or employee was
malicious or grossly negligent; if the defense of immunity is available to the
officer or employee.
3-806. Same; confidentiality.
1980, ch. 811; 1999 Supp., sec. 3-72; 2000, ch. 601.
Any and all information obtained by the County Attorney by virtue of the
provisions of §§
3-803 through
3-810 of this subtitle shall be considered confidential and shall not be
admissible as evidence in any legal action or special proceeding, and no
reference to this information may be made in any trial or hearing.
3-807. Same; special counsel.
1980, ch. 811; 1999 Supp., sec 3-73; 2000, ch. 601.
   (a)   The County Attorney may employ special counsel whose compensation
shall be fixed by the County Attorney and approved by the County Commissioners,
if the County Attorney determines that it is impracticable or uneconomical for
such legal service to be rendered by the County Attorney or one of the County
Attorney’s assistants.
   (b)   The compensation for special counsel shall be paid out of the funds
appropriated for the administration of the agency, board, commission, or
department employing the officers and employees defended.
3-808. Same; representation of employee.
1980, ch. 811; 1999 Supp., sec 3-74; 2000, ch. 601.
The County Attorney, prior to the defense of an officer or employee, shall
require the officer or employee to enter into an agreement which provides,
among other things:
   (1)   The County Attorney, if the County Attorney determines it appropriate,
may require the officer or employee to reimburse the County for all expenses,
including court costs and reasonable attorneys’ fees, if it is judicially
determined that the injuries complained of did not arise out of an act or
omission of the officer or employee occurring during the performance of the
officer’s or employee’s duties and within the scope of the officer’s or
employee’s employment or that the act or omission of the officer or employee
was malicious or grossly negligent, and the defense of immunity as to the
officer or employee is not available; but such reimbursement may not be
required if the information provided to the County Attorney by the officer or
employee was complete and was neither false nor misleading. These costs
constitute a debt due to the County and may be collected by appropriate
judicial proceedings.
   (2)   That, if a judgment is rendered against the officer or employee, the
County, its agency, board, commission, or department thereof, is not
responsible for the payment of the judgment, and the legal representation by
the County Attorney, the County Attorney’s assistants, or special counsel of an
officer or employee in no manner constitutes an obligation on the part of the
County to pay the judgment or a settlement of a claim, but that the officer or
employee may make written application to the County Commissioners.
   (3)   That the County Attorney may not compromise or settle any claim
without the written consent of the officer or employee. If the officer or
employee does not consent to the compromise or settlement, the County Attorney
may withdraw from the representation subject to the appropriate rules of court;
and in that event the County is not responsible for any further costs.
3-809. Same; judgment.
1980, ch. 811; 1999 Supp., sec. 3-75; 2000, ch. 601.
In an action or proceeding against an officer or employee, if a judgment is
rendered in favor of the officer or employee, and if the court finds that the
action or proceeding was instituted in (1) bad faith or (2) without substantial
justification, the court shall require the moving party to pay the County or
the officer or employee, as the case may be, the amount of the cost of the
action or proceeding and the reasonable expenses incurred, including reasonable
attorneys’ fees. The Court shall require the moving party to pay the costs and
expenses directly to the County or to its appropriate agency, board,
commission, or department thereof, if prior payment of costs and expenses to
the officer or employee has been made pursuant to the provisions of §
3-805 of this subtitle.
3-810. Same; immunity.
1980, ch. 811; 1999 Supp., sec. 3-76; 2000, ch. 601.
The consent of the County Attorney to defend actions or proceedings against
County officers and employees may not be construed to deprive any agency,
board, commission, department, officer, or institution, or any employee
thereof, of its immunity as it existed prior to July 1, 1980.
3-811. Penalties.
1987, ch. 97; 1999 Supp., sec. 3-77; 2000, ch. 601.

12-103. Bond authorization.
For the purpose of providing funds to pay the costs of solid waste projects,
the County is authorized and empowered to borrow money, in an aggregate amount
not to exceed $6,000,000 from time to time, and to effect the borrowing by the
issuance and sale of bonds. The bonds may be issued at one time, or from time

shall by resolution fix the maturity of any of the bonds, provided that the
bonds may not mature later than 30 years from the date of their issue, and
provided further that the bonds may be issued on the serial maturity plan or
other plan as the Board finds and determines to be necessary or desirable in
connection with the issuance and sale of the bonds. The resolution may fix the
denomination of the bonds, the form and tenor of the bonds, which (without
limitation) may be issued in “registered form” within the meaning of Section 30
of Article 31 of the Annotated Code of Maryland as effective from time to time,
the rate or rates of interest payable thereon, or the method of determining the
same, which may include a variable rate, the manner and place of payment, the

   (a)   In the discretion of the Board, the principal of and interest on any
bonds issued under this title may be made payable solely from the proceeds of
solid waste collection or disposal rates or charges imposed under this title,
which revenues the County is authorized to pledge to the payment. The County
may covenant to fix the rates and charges for the use of any solid waste
project, or the system of which it forms a part, as will generate sufficient
revenues to pay the annual cost of maintenance and operation of the project and
to pay the maturing principal of and interest on any bonds issued under this
title when due. Bonds secured as provided in this title do not constitute an
obligation of the faith and credit of the County but, on the contrary, shall
recite that the principal and interest are payable solely from the revenues
prescribed in the resolution or indenture authorizing the bonds.
   (b)   If the Board determines it to be appropriate, the County may pledge
the full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power of the County to the
payment of the principal and interest on all or any part of a series of bonds
issued under this title. Those bonds may be secured as provided in this
subsection only to the extent that the total of the par value of such bonds,
together with all other outstanding bonded indebtedness of the County secured
or guaranteed by the full faith or credit of the County, less the amount of any
sinking funds or reserves for payment of bonds previously issued, does not
exceed 15 percent of the total assessed valuation of all property in Carroll
County subject to unlimited county taxation during the fiscal year of the
County most recently concluded. In the event that the funds available to the
County from all sources are insufficient to pay any bonds guaranteed under this
subsection, together with the interest due on the bonds, the Board, on behalf
of the County, in each and every fiscal year in which bonds are outstanding
shall levy and collect ad valorem taxes on all the legally assessable property
within the corporate limits of Carroll County in rate and amount sufficient to
provide for the payments when due, together with accrued interest to the date
of payment. In the event the proceeds from the taxes so levied in any fiscal
year are inadequate for the above purposes, the Board, on behalf of the County,
shall levy additional taxes in the succeeding fiscal year to make up any
deficiency. Bonds secured as provided in this title, in the Board’s discretion,
also may be secured by any revenues or pledge authorized under subsection (a)
of this section.
12-107. Same; security.
   (a)   The County may enter into agreements with agents, banks, fiduciaries,
insurers, or other for the purpose of enhancing the marketability of and
security for the bonds and for the purpose of securing any tender option that
may be granted to holders of the bonds. As additional security for the payment
of the principal of and interest on the bonds, the County may convey or assign
any real or personal property which constitutes a solid waste project or the
system of which it forms a part. The pledge, conveyance, or assignment shall be
valid and binding against any person having a claim of any kind against the
County, irrespective of whether the person has notice.
   (b)   (1)   Any trust indenture entered into under this section may contain
covenants on the part of the County deemed necessary or appropriate by the
Board for the proper security of the purchasers of the bonds, but the County
may not enter into any covenant which permits the trustee or bondholders in any
manner to sell or otherwise divest the County of its title to any solid waste
project or projects financed with the proceeds of the bonds, without the prior
written consent of the County. Subject to the foregoing limitation, a trust
indenture may contain covenants for the protection of bondholders, relating to
all or any of the following:
         (i)   the nature, extent and procedure for acquiring or constructing
any solid waste project or projects and the supervision of the solid waste
project or projects;
         (ii)   the maintenance and operation of any solid waste project or
projects, and the supervision of the solid waste project or projects, the
employment of consulting engineers, auditors, attorneys and other experts in
connection with the acquisition, construction, maintenance or operation;
         (iii)   the terms and provisions of the bonds and the securing of the
proceeds, the imposition and collection of rates and charges for the use of the
project or projects and the use, application and security of any revenues so
collected, including the establishment, deposit and securing from the revenues
for debt service on, or prior redemption of, the bonds, or for the maintenance,
operation and improvement of any solid waste project or projects;
         (iv)   the insurance on any solid waste project or projects;
         (v)   the issuance of additional bonds for any solid waste project or
projects and the limitations of the bonds;
         (vi)   the powers, duties and indemnification of any trustee, or its
successor, party to any such indenture;
         (vii)   the rights and remedies of the trustee and of bondholders in
the event of any default by the County under the trust indenture, which rights
and remedies may include the taking over of any operation by the trustee or by
a receiver appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction of the project or
projects financed with the proceeds of the issue of bonds secured by the trust
indenture, and the marshaling of the revenues from the project or projects for
the use and benefit of bondholders.
      (2)   In addition to the covenants enumerated above but subject to the
limitations contained in this section, the County is authorized to make
additional covenants in any trust indenture, of like or different character as,
in its judgment, may be necessary, convenient or desirable for the better
security of any issue of its bonds secured by the trust indenture or as will,
in its judgment, tend to make the bonds more marketable.
12-108. Fees in solid waste collection or disposal.
For the purposes of carrying out the provisions of this title, the County, by
resolution, may impose reasonable rates and charges for solid waste collection
or disposal. The funds derived from the rates and charges shall be used to pay
the costs of the County’s solid waste projects, including (without limitation)
the principal of and interest on bonds issued under this title. The resolution
may establish a reasonable basis for setting the rates and charges, prescribe a
schedule of rates and charges, and designate solid waste collection or disposal
service areas within the County. The resolution may provide that the rates and
charges are chargeable against all or part of the occupied lots or parcels of
land in the County or in service areas established by the County and constitute
a first lien on such property and may establish reasonable times and methods
for collection of the rates or charges, which may be levied and collected and
have the same priority and rights and bear the same interest and penalties and
in every respect be treated the same as taxes of the County. The County may
modify the amount of the rates and charges by a resolution or by other action
authorized by the resolution imposing the rates and charges. Before setting or
modifying the rates and charges, the County shall give notice of the proposed
rates or charges in at least one newspaper of general circulation in the County
and hold a public hearing on the necessity or advisability of the proposed
rates or charges. The powers granted by this section are in addition to other
powers of the County granted under law and may not be restricted by any debt or
tax rate limitation in any general or local law. Rates and charges imposed
under this section are not subject to the jurisdiction of any authority or
other unit of government.
12-109. Contracts authorized.
The County is empowered to make any contract or agreement the Board determines
to be necessary or incidental to the execution of the purpose of and the powers
granted by this title, including contracts with the federal or any state
government, or any unit, instrumentality, municipality, or subdivision, or with
any person on terms and conditions the Board approves, relating to:

   (5)   The employment or retention of consulting and other engineers,
superintendents, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, and such other
employees, advisors or agents as in the judgment of the Board may be deemed
necessary or desirable.
12-110. Regulations authorized.
The County by resolution may require the delivery of all or any portion of the
solid wastes generated or disposed of within Carroll County to facilities
designated by the Board and located within Carroll County or to facilities
located outside of Carroll County if the County has contracted for capacity at
or service from such facilities. However, recyclable material which has been
removed or segregated from solid wastes may be disposed of at any facilities
which accept and process such recyclable material. The County may provide in
the resolution that it is unlawful for any person to dispose of solid wastes in
or at any other place. The County may impose a civil penalty of up to $1,000
for the first violation of the resolution and up to $5,000 for each subsequent
violation. The County may provide further in the resolution that a violation of

matters, that the Board could abolish the Commission by a certain procedure and
create a Department of Public Works. The Board determined that, in the interest
of the efficiency and economy of County operations, the County should undertake
the powers and functions of the Commission on July 1, 1979. Appropriate
amendments have been made in this subtitle, effective July 1, 1979, to
implement this determination without the necessity of any further action by the
Board, whether by ordinance or resolution or otherwise. This subtitle does not
impair any power of the Board pursuant to §
3-901 of this Article or other authority to create a Department of Public Works
and to assign the department responsibilities to implement the Board’s actions
under this subtitle.

On July 1, 1979, the Commission shall cease to exist as a separate entity. It
is the intent and purpose of the General Assembly of Maryland that on and after

as amended and supplemented, prior to July 1, 1979, are ratified and confirmed,
and all of these bonds and other obligations are validated as being validly
authorized, sold, and issued. It is the intent and purpose that the County, on
and after July 1, 1979, shall undertake and satisfy in all respects any and all
obligations evidenced by such bonds and other obligations in accordance with
their terms.
   (c)   In the event that the Board decides that any modification of an
existing rate, charge, or assessment previously established by the district, by
its governing body, by the County, or by the Board on behalf of the County
pursuant to Title 9 of the Environment Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland prior to June 1, 1967, or by the Commission, by the County, or by the
Board on behalf of the County pursuant to Chapter 754 of the Acts of 1967, as
amended and supplemented, prior to July 1, 1979, is necessary or desirable, the
Board promptly shall give notice of the proposed rates, charges, and
assessments in at least one newspaper of general circulation in Carroll County.
Thereafter, the Board shall conduct a public hearing on the necessity or
advisability of the proposed rates, charges, or assessments.
   (d)   Without in any way limiting the provisions of this title or of any
other provision of law, the County has and may exercise all powers necessary or
convenient for carrying out the purposes set forth in this title, including but

systems in Carroll County other than in any municipal corporation which existed
on June 1, 1967, and in those areas within 1 mile of the present corporate
limits of any existing municipal corporation or the corporate limits as may be
established by an existing municipal corporation unless such water, sewerage,
and drainage systems are approved in accordance with §
14-106 of this title.
      (5)   to enter into contracts with any third person to effect the
purposes of this title.

ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
The County shall annually have any accounts which are maintained to implement
this title audited by a certified public accountant to be selected by the
Board; all fees incurred by such accountant in connection with the audit shall

   (a)   To provide for the general health and welfare of the residents of
Carroll County, the County may acquire, construct, operate, and maintain the
water, sewerage, and drainage systems as it deems to be in the public interest.
The County may cause surveys, plans, specifications, and estimates to be made
for the systems. Unless all owners of land which will be served by any proposed
improvements consent in writing to the improvements being made, the County
shall construct any system or extension only after a public hearing held by the
Board, after giving notice in two newspapers of general circulation published
in Carroll County at least seven days before the hearing, and in the case of
drainage systems, only after a drainage area has been established pursuant to §
14-201 of this title. At the hearings, a description of the proposed
improvements shall be presented together with the estimated costs and estimated
revenues to be derived therefrom.
   (b)   The power and authority conferred upon the County of this title may be
exercised by the County throughout Carroll County. Provided, however; except as
otherwise provided in this title, the service area within which the County may
exercise power and authority under this title shall not include any municipal
corporation which existed on June 1, 1967, and the County shall exercise no
authority over the operation or construction of the sewerage, water and
drainage systems of any municipal corporation which existed on June 1, 1967,
including the extension of such systems beyond the corporate limits of such
municipality as such extensions existed on June 1, 1967.
      (1)   The County shall not provide for the operation or construction of
any water, sewerage, or drainage systems within areas one mile from the present
corporate limits of any existing municipal corporation or one mile from the
corporate limits of any existing municipal corporation which may be created by
annexation pursuant to Article 23A of the Annotated Code of Maryland except
when the municipal corporation shall by appropriate ordinance, resolution or
approval provide that the County may exercise authority over the operation or
construction of water, sewerage, and drainage systems within the areas. On the
request of the County to construct water, sewerage and/or drainage systems
within one mile of any existing municipal corporation the municipal corporation
shall within six months either agree to provide the water, sewerage, and
drainage systems or grant approval to the County to provide the water,
sewerage, and drainage systems.
      (2)   That any municipal corporation which existed on June 1, 1967, may
by appropriate ordinance or resolution transfer the jurisdiction, power and
control of any sewerage, water or drainage system of the municipal corporation
to the County on the terms and conditions approved by the Board and may consent
to be included within the service area.
      (3)   That any municipal corporation which existed on June 1, 1967, in
which there is no existing sewerage, water or drainage system may consent to be
included within the service area.

If the residents of any unincorporated locality in Carroll County make
application for a water, sewerage or drainage system, or part thereof, to be
constructed in their locality, the County may require the applicants to bear
the reasonable costs for any preliminary engineering studies that the Board
deems necessary to determine whether it is feasible to construct the
improvements. Upon receipt of such reasonable costs as the Board determines to
be necessary to conduct the studies, the Board shall have the studies made and
within a reasonable time thereafter advise the applicants of the results
together with the Board’s determination with respect to the application.
14-108. Surface waters.
1978, ch. 739; 1999 Supp., sec. 15-4A; 2000, ch. 601.
The Board may prepare a plan or plans which in its judgment are necessary or
required for the control and disposition of surface waters within the limits,
or any part of, the service area and shall then divide the service area, or any
part, into separate drainage areas. Each separate drainage area shall comprise,
insofar as practicable, all land from which surface water drains by gravity
along a stream or a natural water course to its nearest major outlet to
tidewater. The division of the service area, or any part, into drainage areas
shall be effected by a resolution adopted by the Board, after a hearing held
not less than 10 days after notice of the hearing, published in a newspaper
having general circulation in the drainage area to be created, which resolution
shall contain a definite description of the boundaries of the drainage area or
areas and shall identify each drainage area by a distinctive name. After the
passage of the resolution, the Board shall cause a plat of the drainage area or
areas to be prepared, one copy of which plat shall be filed with the Clerk of
the Board and one copy of which shall be indexed and filed among the land
records of Carroll County. Upon the filing of this plat, any drainage area
shown on the plat is designated and constituted for the purpose of this
subtitle to be a separate drainage area and a taxing district for the purpose
of imposing the drainage area assessments and taxes authorized by §
14-703 of this title, and the filing of this plat shall constitute legal notice
to the public of the action of the Board.
14-109. Rules and regulations.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439Y; 1976 Code, sec. 15-25; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
The Board may prescribe all needful rules and regulations for the
administration and enforcement of this title. In addition to its own power to
adopt appropriate rules and regulations, the Board may adopt and enforce
regulations of the State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and the
Carroll County Health Officer fixing standards of construction for water and
sewer facilities or installations. Before the adoption of any rules and
regulations other than those of the State Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene or the Carroll County Health Officer the Board shall give public notice
of the rules and regulations which it proposes to adopt by publishing the same
in at least two newspapers of general circulation published in Carroll County
at least twice but not less than fifteen (15) days before a public hearing, the
date, time and place of which shall be specified in the notice.
14-110. Reservation of capacity for public purposes.
1978, ch. 164; 1999 Supp., sec. 15-25A; 2000, ch. 601.

treatment capacity for the development of schools or other public buildings,
facilities or services, or industrial development. The amount of capacity held
in reserve may not exceed 15 percent of the system.
14-111. Advisory Council.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439Z; 1976 Code, sec. 15-26; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
The Board may create and appoint an advisory council to the Board under this
title. The advisory council may consist of all or any of the former members of
the Commission, or any other members as the Board may deem necessary or
desirable. The advisory council may review and recommend rates, policies and
plans for the maintenance, design, construction or establishment of any water,
sewerage or drainage system existing or to be constructed or established in
Carroll County.
Subtitle 2. Acquisition of Property.
14-201. Acquisition of property.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439E; 1976 Code, sec. 15-5; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
   (a)   Whenever it is deemed necessary by the County to take or acquire any
land, structure, or buildings, or any stream bed, waterway, water rights, or
watershed, either in fee or as an easement, within or without Carroll County,
for the construction, extension or maintenance of any water main, sewer, or
appurtenance thereof, or any sewage treatment plant, reservoir, water treatment
plant, storage tank, or pumping station or any surface water drainage facility
or for the execution by the County of any other power or function vested in it
by this title, the County, if it be unable to acquire the property or right by
purchase, may condemn the property or right by proceedings in the Circuit Court
for the county in which the property or right is located, as provided for
condemnation of land by public service corporations in the Public General Laws
of Maryland, now or hereafter in effect; and the County may likewise condemn
the interest of any tenant, lessee, or other person having any right or
interest in the property or right. At any time after ten days after the return
and recordation of the verdict or award in a proceeding under this section, the
County may enter and take possession of the property so condemned, upon first
paying to the Clerk of the Court the amount of the award and all costs taxed to
that date, notwithstanding any appeal or further proceedings upon the part of
the defendant. At the time of payment, however, the County shall give its
corporate undertaking to abide by and fulfill any judgment in any such appeal
or further proceedings provided, however, that the County shall have no
authority to condemn, take or acquire any stream bed, waterway, water rights or
drainage area used by or for which plans are being made to be used by any
municipal corporation which existed on June 1, 1967, without the approval of
such municipal corporation and no authority to condemn sewerage, water, or
drainage systems owned and operated by any municipal corporation which existed
on June 1, 1967.
   (b)   In the condemnation of privately-owned water, sewerage or drainage
systems the jury shall take into consideration as a part of its award any
payment, contribution, or tax upon the respective lot owners or purchasers
toward the construction of the system, and where the system or systems have
been built in connection with or for the purpose of developing home sites,
subdivisions, or villages, or by any individuals, firm, or corporation, and the
system or systems have been offered as an inducement for the purchase of lot or
land therein, the jury shall deduct from the determined value of the plant or
system a sum as it may reasonably determine was added to the purchase price of
the land or lots in the sale thereof for the purpose of constructing systems.
   (c)   Privately-owned systems shall be taken under condemnation by the
County free and clear of all debts and liens, but the County shall make a party
defendant of any person, firm, or corporation having any recorded lien or
encumbrance against the privately-owned systems, and the Circuit Court may
determine the respective amounts due the defendants; and from and after payment
into Court or to the proper parties as provided in this subsection, the County
is authorized to take possession of, maintain, and operate the system, which
shall be subject to the same regulations and penalties as though the system so
acquired had been constructed and put into operation by the County under the
provisions of the title; provided, however, that no building or premises
actually connected in an adequate manner with an acquired water or sewerage
system shall be required to pay any connection charge.
   (d)   Whenever there is in existence a privately-owned water supply,
sewerage or drainage system which in the judgment of the Board is unsuitable in
whole or in part, for the incorporation into the County’s system, the Board may
disregard the existence of the system or unsuitable part of the system and
extend its system to serve the area tributary to the existing system or
unsuitable part of the system, and all the provisions of this title relating to
systems constructed by the County apply thereto.
14-202. Acquisition by purchase or gift.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439F; 1976 Code, sec. 15-6; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
   (a)   The County may purchase or acquire by gift any existing water,
sewerage, or drainage systems, or parts, including those owned, operated by, or
serving any municipality, or any land, structure, buildings, stream bed, water
rights, or watershed, either in fee or as an easement, which in its judgment is
desirable or necessary for the purpose of providing adequate water, sewerage or
drainage service or any of them for the residents of the service area. Any such
purchase may be made upon such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon, but
before any part of the purchase price is paid, other than a nominal sum of
money to bind the agreement, it is the duty of the vendor or agent to furnish a
statement to the Board setting forth all names and addresses of persons having
any interest or claims against the property whatsoever, which shall be verified
by an oath in writing.
   (b)   Thereupon it is the duty of the Board to notify personally or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, all persons having any
interest in the property, and in addition the Board shall give three weeks’
notice of the Board’s intention to purchase the property, in a newspaper or
newspapers published within the service area where the property is located; and
each person having any claim against the property shall file the person’s claim
with the Board on or before the expiration date mentioned in the notice at
which time any and all persons shall be heard.
   (c)   Any municipality whose system or any portion of the system is acquired
by the County by purchase may use the amount paid to the municipality for the
system for the purchase or redemption of any bonds or debt which may be
outstanding against the municipality; or the County, as part of the purchase
price of the system, may assume the payment of any such bond or debt. The
County may purchase any existing water, sewerage or drainage systems, in whole
or in part, which are necessary or desirable for the purpose of carrying out
the powers vested in it by this title.
Subtitle 3. Contracts; Permits; Connections; Bids.
14-301. Contracts for systems.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439G; 1976 Code, sec. 15-7; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
The County has full power and authority to enter into any contract for the
connection of its water supply, sewerage, or drainage systems, with those of
any municipality or adjoining county, or any other governmental agency, for the
purchase of water and for the disposal of sewage or drainage, and to enter into
any other agreement concerning any matter deemed by the Board to be necessary,
advisable, or expedient for the proper construction, maintenance, and operation
of the water, sewerage, or drainage systems under its control, or those under
the control of any municipality or county or other governmental agency. The
County is further empowered to enter into contracts with any municipality for
the joint acquisition, construction, ownership, and operation of any water,
sewerage, or drainage system or any portion thereof.
14-302. Permits for work; fire hydrants.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439H; 1976 Code, sec. 15-8; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
   (a)   Before any plumbing, water works, or sewer construction is done in any
building or upon any private property within Carroll County, the person, firm,
or corporation doing the construction shall first obtain a permit from the
Board and pay to the Board a reasonable sum as the Board may prescribe. The
work shall be done under and pursuant to the rules, regulations, and
requirements as the Board may from time to time formulate, and subject to such
inspection as it may deem necessary; provided that, to avoid duplication of
supervision, the Board may waive this provision if the Department of Health and
Mental Hygiene issues the permits and makes the inspections required by this
subsection in a manner satisfactory to the Board.
   (b)   The County shall have full and complete jurisdiction over all fire
hydrants connected with its water system; and no person, firm or corporation
may operate, use, or make connection with the system without the written
authority of the Board, except that no restriction shall apply to any bona fide
fire department in the discharge of its duties. No person, firm, or corporation
may tamper with, deface, damage, or obstruct any fire hydrant. A violation of
any of the provisions of this section is a misdemeanor, punishable under §
14-801 of this title.
   (c)   Nothing in this section is applicable within any municipality or to
any water and sewerage system operated by a municipality unless authorized in
accordance with §
14-106 of this title.
14-303. Connections; conditions; procedure.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439-I; 1976 Code, sec. 15-9; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
The County shall provide for each and every property abutting upon a street or
right-of-way in which a water main or sewer is laid, when service to the
property is feasible, a water service pipe and sewer connection, which shall be
extended as required from the water and sewer mains to the property line of the
abutting lot. The water service pipe and the connection with the sewer shall be
constructed by and at the expense of the County, subject to any charge for
connection as provided in §
14-704 of this title, which charge shall be paid by all property owners at the
office of the Board. When any water main or sewer is declared by the Board to
be complete and ready for the delivery of water or the reception of sewage,
every abutting property owner, after due notice, shall make a connection of all
spigots or hydrants, toilets and waste drains with the water main or sewer
within the time prescribed by the Board. If these fixtures do not exist or are
of a nature which, in the judgment of the Board, is improper or inadequate,
satisfactory equipment shall be installed by the owner on the premises
consisting of at least one water closet and one sink or washbasin, both of
which shall be properly connected with the sewer of the County. No private
water or sewerage system shall be connected to any water or sewerage system
owned or operated by the County. All private water systems discharging waste
water into the county sewerage system, and cesspools, sink drains, and privies
located on properties connected to sewers provided by the County shall be
abandoned, closed, and left in a sanitary condition so that no odor or nuisance
will arise therefrom. No roof or other drainage facilities shall discharge to
the County’s water and sewerage facilities. Any violation of the provisions of
this section is a misdemeanor punishable under §
14-801 of this title.
14-304. Bid and contracts for work done.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439M; 1971, ch. 608, sec. 439M; 1976 Code, sec. 15-13;
1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
Whenever the plans and specifications for water, sewerage, or drainage systems
or extensions shall have been completed and the Board has decided to proceed
with construction, the Board shall, when required by this title, by notice in
one newspaper published in Carroll County and newspapers and technical press as
it may deem proper, advertise for bids for the construction of the system or
systems, in part or as a whole, as in its judgment may appear advisable. The
contract shall be let to the lowest responsible bidder, or the Board may reject
any or all bids; and, if in its discretion the prices quoted are unreasonable
or unbalanced, the Board may readvertise the work or any part of the work or
may do any part or all of the work by day labor; provided that any time the
Board, in its discretion, may expend by day labor for construction and for
supplies and equipment an amount not exceeding $5,000 without advertising and
receiving bids. All such contracts shall be protected by bonds, penalties, and
conditions as the Board may require, all of which shall be enforced in any
court having jurisdiction.
14-305. Work on private systems; restrictions.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439N; 1976 Code, sec. 15-14; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
No sewerage, water, or drainage system or extension serving two or more
properties in Carroll County may be constructed by any private owner without
the prior approval of the Board. If upon application for the construction or
extension of any such system the Board determines that the construction or
extension is inexpedient or impracticable at that time, owing to the remoteness
from its general system or other considerations, the applicant may build and
operate the system or extension thereof at its own expense; but it shall be
constructed only under such plans and specifications as have been submitted to
and approved by the Board, and its maintenance and operation shall be under the
general control or supervision of the Board. No system or part of the system or
no water main, sewer, storm water drain, water purification or sewage treatment
plan or no connection with any of them shall be constructed or installed except
as in this section provided, and any violation of this provision shall be a
misdemeanor punishable under §
14-801 of this title. The applicant for the construction or extension of any
such privately-owned system shall bear the reasonable costs that the Board may
incur for the review and approval of any plans and for the supervision by the
Board of the maintenance and operation of the system. All construction and
operating records including cost records shall be filed with the Board, which
shall be empowered at any time to take over the system or part of the system or
the water main, sewer, storm water drain, water purification or sewage
treatment plant or connection with any of them in the same manner as provided
under §
14-201 of this title. Nothing in this section impairs the rate making powers of
the Public Service Commission nor eliminates the requirements of the law for
the approval of the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in the construction
and maintenance of the facilities. No private sewerage, water or drainage
systems or extensions of the systems authorized by this section shall be
approved if the construction and operation of the system or systems will cause
water pollution endangering the water supply of any municipality or other
public agency or private utility corporation supplying water and sewer services
in Carroll County. If a private system approved under the authority of this
title causes pollution, then the County is authorized to require modifications
as may be necessary to eliminate the pollution and to take other legal steps as
may be necessary to enforce its orders eliminating the nuisance of water
pollution.
Subtitle 4. Inspections.
14-401. Employees right of entry.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439J; 1976 Code, sec. 15-10; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
Any employee or agent of the County has the right of entry, at all reasonable
hours, upon any private premises and into any building in the service area
while in pursuit of his official duties, after reasonable notice and upon
reasonable notice and first presenting proper credentials from the Board. The
Board or the County’s agent or employees may order and require changes in
plumbing, water usage, drainage or water or sewer connections as it deems
necessary to eliminate leakage, loss of water, unnecessary or improper use of
sewers. The Board shall exercise control of the water supply at all times and
in case of shortage of water or, for any other reason, the Board, in the
exercise of its discretion, may determine that the water supply should be
conserved. The consumers, upon notice from the County, its agents or employees,
or upon notice published in one newspaper published in Carroll County for one
insertion, shall comply with any order passed by the Board to conserve the
water supply. In addition to any other penalty prescribed in this title, the
County may turn off the water supply of any person violating the order at any
time without further notice. Any unreasonable restraint or hindrance offered by
any owner, tenant, or agent or any other person, to the right of entry in this
section provided or any violation of any order issued under this section is a
misdemeanor punishable under §
14-801 of this title. Nothing in this section is applicable within any
municipality or to any water and sewerage system operated by a municipality
unless authorized under §
14-106 of this title.
14-402. Entry upon public way.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439K; 1976 Code, sec. 15-11; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
The Board may enter upon and excavate any State or county street, road, or way,
or any other public highway within the service area, for the purpose of
installing, maintaining, and operating the water, sewerage, or drainage systems
provided for under this title. The Board may construct in any street, road,
way, or public highway, a water main, sewer, or drain or any appurtenances,
without the receipt of a permit or the payment of a charge; provided that
whenever any State or county highway within the service area is to be disturbed
the public authority having control shall be duly notified; and provided
further, that the highway shall be repaired and left by the Board in the same
condition or in a condition not inferior to that existing before it was torn
up, and that all incidental costs shall be borne by the County.
Subtitle 5. Obstructions.
14-501. Obstructions to systems.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439L; 1976 Code, sec. 15-12; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
All individuals, firms, or corporations having buildings, conduits, pipes,
tracks, poles, or other structures or obstructions in, on, over, or through any
public road, street, or way, which blocks or impedes the construction and
establishment of the County’s water, sewerage, or drainage systems, or other
works, upon reasonable notice from the Board, shall promptly shift, adjust,
accommodate, or remove structures or obstructions as fully to meet the
exigencies occasioning action; provided, however, that the reasonable cost of
the charges shall be borne by the County. Every public service corporation,
company, or individual before it or they shall begin any excavation or
construction in any street, road, way, or public highway shall file with the
Board plans of the work and construction showing the location and depth in the
street, road, way, or public highway of the proposed main, conduit, pole, pipe,
or other structure, and the construction or work shall not begin until the plan
is approved by the Board, nor shall any change be made in the approved plan or
in the work or construction as shown by the plan, except on further approval of
the Board. Whenever any main, conduit, pole, pipe, or other structure is
installed without the filing of plans with the Board and the approval by it, or
when any change is made in the location of the main, conduit, pipe, pole, or
other structure as shown upon the plans approved by the Board, or any approved
change, the Board, if and when such conduit, main, pipe, or pole, or other
structure interferes with the construction of or operation of the water,
sewerage or drainage system, or other works, may remove the conduit, main,
pipe, pole, or other structures or change the location at the cost and expense
of the party so putting them in, or their heirs, assigns, or successors, and
without any liability upon the part of the County for damage that might be done
to the conduit, main, pipe, pole, or other structures by reason of the Board’s
operation in constructing or maintaining the system or works. Any violation of
the provisions of this section is a misdemeanor punishable under §
14-801 of this title.
Subtitle 6. Loans; Bonds.
14-601. Loans for work on facilities.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439-O; 1976 Code, sec. 15-15; 1978, ch. 739; 1980, ch. 225;
2000, ch. 601.
   (a)   For the purpose of assisting in the engineering and the construction
of needed water, sewerage and drainage systems, the Board may make general fund
appropriations or borrow funds for this purpose, upon any terms and conditions
as they deem right and proper.
   (b)   Any enterprise fund as that term is used in accounting, created for
the purpose of complying with this title, shall reimburse the County’s general
fund for any expense attributable to work performed by the County out of its
general fund. Each year, the Board may determine a reasonable amount, by
estimate, to satisfy the requirements of this section, which may be paid to the
County from the enterprise fund by appropriation or any other lawful method.
   (c)   If no payment is made under the provisions of this section, then the
amount established under subsection (b) of this section shall act as an
appropriation under subsection (a) of this section.
14-602. Sale of bonds; use of proceeds; payment.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439P; 1969, ch. 494, sec. 439P(a); 1970, ch. 283, sec. 439P
(a); 1970, ch. 363, sec. 439P(a); 1976 Code, sec. 15-16; 1978, ch. 739; 2000,
ch. 601.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing funds for the design, construction,
establishment, purchase, or condemnation of water, sewerage and drainage
systems in Carroll County pursuant to this title, the County is authorized and
empowered to borrow money, from time to time, and to evidence the borrowing by
the issuance of bonds, which shall constitute a pledge of the full faith and
credit and unlimited taxing power of the County. The authority conferred under
this section is subject to the limitation that the County shall issue no amount
of bonds pursuant to this section if, by the issuance, the total unpaid bonded
indebtedness under this section, less the amount of any sinking funds or
reserves for payment of bonds previously issued, shall exceed fifteen percent
of the total assessed valuation of all property in Carroll County subject to
unlimited County taxation during the fiscal year of the County most recently
concluded. The bonds of each issue shall be dated, shall bear interest at the
rate or rates, shall mature at the time or times not exceeding forty years from
their date or dates, as may be determined by the County, and may be made
redeemable before maturity, at the option of the Board, at the price or prices
and under the terms and conditions as may be fixed by the Board before the
issuance of the bonds. The Board shall determine the form of the bonds,
including any interest coupons to be attached, and the manner of execution of
the bonds, and shall fix the denomination or denominations of the bonds and the
place or places of payment of principal and interest, which may be at any bank
or trust company. In case any officer whose signature or a facsimile of whose
signature shall appear on any bonds or coupons shall cease to be an officer
before the delivery of the bonds or shall become an officer after the date of
issue, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient
for all purposes the same as if the officer had remained in office until the
delivery or had held office on date of issue. All bonds issued under the
provisions of this title shall have and are declared to have, as between
successive holders, all the qualities and incidents of negotiable instruments
under the negotiable instruments law of the State of Maryland. The bonds may be
issued in coupon or in registered form, or both, as the Board may determine,
and provision may be made for the registration of any coupon bonds as to
principal alone; also as to both principal and interest, and for the
reconversion into coupon bonds of any bonds registered as to both principal and
interest. The issuance of the bonds shall not be subject to any limitations or
conditions contained in any other law and the County may sell the bonds in a
manner, either at public or private sale, and for a price, as it may determine
to be for the best interests of the County. The bonds shall be issued under the
signature and seal of the County. The bonds shall be signed by the chief
executive officer of the County, with the seal of the County affixed and
attested by the signature of either the Administrative Assistant or the Clerk
to the County. At any time before the issuance of any bonds the Board may, in
addition to any sums appropriated under any other provision of law, advance the
sums as may be necessary to cover the expense of issuance of the bonds, which
shall be treated and repaid as part of the costs of the project or projects
financed with the proceeds of the bonds.
   (b)   The proceeds of the bonds shall be used solely for the payment of the
cost of the project or projects on account of which the bonds are issued and
shall be disbursed in a manner and under the restrictions, if any, as the Board
may provide in the authorizing resolution. If the proceeds of the bonds, by
error of estimates or otherwise, shall be less than the cost, additional bonds
may in like manner be issued to provide the amount of the deficit, and, unless
otherwise provided in the authorizing resolution, shall be deemed to be of the
same issue and shall be entitled to payment from the same fund without
preference or priority of the bonds first issued for the same purpose. If the
proceeds of the bonds of any issue shall exceed the amount required for the
purpose for which the bonds shall have been issued, the Board may, by
appropriate resolution, apply the surplus to payment of the cost of an
additional project or projects or the surplus shall be used for the retirement
of bonds of the issue, as in the authorizing resolution provided. In every case
where the proceeds of any issue of bonds shall be expended for the cost of one
or more projects, the Board shall cause separate capital accounts to be created
for each project, among which the bond proceeds shall be divided and from which
the separate costs of each project shall be paid. As soon as each project is
completed, the special assessments or other charges imposed or made by the
Board with respect to the project shall be calculated in the manner as to
provide a proportion of the annual debt service on the issue of bonds equal to
the proportion of the proceeds of the issue expended on the project. The
resolution authorizing any bonds issued pursuant to this title to finance a
drainage system also shall identify the drainage area established pursuant to §
14-108 of this title in which any drainage system is to be built and state the
amount being borrowed for the drainage area.
   (c)   The County’s full faith and credit and unlimited taxing power shall be
unconditionally pledged to the payment of the principal of and interest on any
bonds issued pursuant to this section. In the event that the funds available to
the County from all sources are insufficient to pay any bonds issued under this
title, together with the interest due, the Board, on behalf of the County, in
each and every fiscal year in which bonds are outstanding shall levy and
collect ad valorem taxes upon all the legally assessable property within the
corporate limits of Carroll County in rate and amount sufficient to provide for
the payments when due, together with accrued interest to the date of payment.
In the event the proceeds from the taxes so levied in any fiscal year are
inadequate for the above purposes, the Board, on behalf of the County, shall
levy additional taxes in the succeeding fiscal year to make up any deficiency.
   (d)   In addition to any other authorizations contained in this title, the
Board is empowered and directed to make payments to any municipality operating
its own water, sewerage or drainage systems in an amount equal to the amount of
ad valorem taxes levied and collected within such municipality under other
provisions of this title, provided that the payments shall be used solely for
the construction or maintenance of water, sewerage or drainage systems within
the municipality. The Board is authorized to impose additional ad valorem taxes
to provide for the payments but the imposition of the taxes shall be
discretionary with the Board and shall be in addition to any other taxes or
charges levied or imposed under this title. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed as impairing the unconditional pledge of the County’s full faith and
credit and unlimited taxing power to the payment of the principal of and
interest on bonds issued under this title; all taxes levied and collected for
the purpose of paying the principal and interest shall be kept separate and
apart from any other revenues and receipts of the County and shall be used
solely and only for the purpose for which they were levied.
14-603. Revenue bonds.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439Q; 1976 Code, sec. 15-17; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
For the purpose of providing funds for the design, construction, establishment,
purchase, or condemnation of water, sewerage and drainage systems in Carroll
County pursuant to this title, the County is authorized and empowered, in
addition to the authority and power conferred by §
14-602 of this subtitle, to borrow money in the amounts as may be needed for
the purpose and to evidence the borrowing by the issuance and sale of its
negotiable revenue bonds, payable as to principal and interest solely from the
proceeds of special benefit assessments and other charges imposed and made by
the County on the project or projects so financed with the proceeds of bonds,
which revenues the County is authorized to pledge to the payment. The Board is
authorized and empowered to fix and determine the form and tenor of revenue
bonds, the denominations, the rate or rates of interest payable, the place or
places of payment, and the method of sale, all as provided in §
14-602 of this subtitle, except that the amount of the revenue bonds which may
be issued by the County shall be limited only by the cost of the project or
projects to be financed with the bonds and the revenue bonds shall not
constitute an obligation of the faith and credit of the County, but, on the
contrary, shall recite that the principal and interest of the bonds are payable
solely from the revenues prescribed from the bonds or in the resolution or
trust indenture authorizing the same. The Board is authorized and empowered, in
its discretion, to secure any revenue bonds issued under this title by an
appropriate trust indenture by and between the County and a corporate trustee,
which may be any trust company, or bank having trust powers, within or outside
the State. Every trust indenture, and revenue bonds secured thereby, shall
clearly recite that the bonds are obligations of the County, payable solely
from the revenues therein prescribed, and do not constitute general obligations
of the County or of the State of Maryland and that the faith and credit of the
County and the County’s taxing power are not pledged to the payment of the
bonds. Any trust indenture may contain covenants on the part of the County, not
contrary to law, deemed necessary or appropriate by the Board for the proper
security of the purchasers of any bonds, but the County shall enter into no
covenant which shall permit the trustee or bondholders in any manner to sell or
otherwise divest the County of its title to any project or projects financed
with the proceeds of the bonds, without the prior written consent of the
County. Subject to the foregoing limitation, any trust indenture may contain
covenants for the protection of bondholders, relating to all or any of the
following: the nature, extent and procedure for acquiring or constructing any
project or projects and the supervision of the project or projects; the
maintenance and operation of any project or projects, and the supervision of
the project or projects, the employment of consulting engineers, auditors,
attorneys and other experts in connection with any acquisition, construction,
maintenance or operation; the terms and provisions of the bonds and the
securing of the proceeds of the bonds, the imposition and collection of
assessments, charges and rentals for the use of any project or projects and the
use, application and security of any revenues so collected, including the
establishment, deposit and securing from any revenues for debt service on, or
prior redemption of, any revenue bonds, or for the maintenance, operation and
improvement of any project or projects; the insurance of any project or
projects; the issuance of additional revenue bonds for any project or projects
and the limitations; the powers, duties and indemnification of any trustee, or
its successor, party to any trust indenture; the rights and remedies of the
trustee and of bondholders in the event of any default by the County under any
trust indenture, which rights and remedies may include the taking over of any
operation by the trustee or by a receiver appointed by a court of competent
jurisdiction of the project or projects financed with the proceeds of any issue
or revenue bonds secured by the trust indenture, and the marshaling of the
revenues from any project or projects for the use and benefit of bondholders.
In addition to the covenants enumerated above but subject to the limitations
contained in this title, the County is authorized and empowered to make further
additional covenants in any trust indenture, of like or different character as,
in its judgment, may be necessary, convenient or desirable for the better
security of any issue of its revenue bonds secured by any trust indenture or as
will, in its judgment, tend to make any bonds more marketable.
14-604. Refunding bonds.
1978, ch. 739; 1999 Supp., sec. 15-17A; 2000, ch. 601.
   (a)   The Board may provide for the issuance of the County’s bonds under
this title at any time or times for the purpose of refunding any bonds of the
district, a body politic and corporate created by the County pursuant to the
provisions of Title 9 of the Environment Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland; the Commission; and the County, acting pursuant to this title, which
are then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premium and any
interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or any subsequent date of
redemption, purchase or maturity of the bonds. The authority of the Board to
provide for the issuance of the County’s bonds under this section shall be
deemed to be in addition to any powers provided in Section 24 of Article 31 of
the Annotated Code of Maryland. Refunding bonds may be issued for any corporate
purposes including, without limitation, the public purposes of realizing
savings in the effective costs of debt service, directly or through a debt
restructuring, or alleviating an impending or actual default. Refunding bonds
may be issued in an amount in excess of that of the bonds to be refunded.
   (b)   For the purposes of determining whether refunding bonds issued under
this section are within the debt limitation specified in §
14-602 of this subtitle, the amount of bonds or other obligations to be
refunded shall be subtracted from, and the amount of refunding bonds to be
issued shall be added to, the aggregate of the County’s outstanding bonds under
this title.
14-605. Temporary bonds.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439R; 1976 Code, sec. 15-18; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
Prior to the preparation of the definitive bonds authorized to be issued by §§
14-602 through
14-604 of this subtitle, the County may, under like restrictions, issue interim
receipts or temporary bonds, with or without coupons, exchangeable for
definitive bonds, when such definitive bonds have been executed and are
available for delivery. In addition, the County may, in anticipation of the
issuance of any bonds, issue bond anticipation notes pursuant to the authority
of, and in the manner prescribed by, Section 12 of Article 31 of the Annotated
Code of Maryland. With respect to the bonds, coupons, temporary bonds, receipts
or bond anticipation notes, which have matured, been exchanged or redeemed, the
Board shall make arrangements for the mutilation and cremation of the
instruments after an appropriate accounting. The Board may also provide for the
replacement of the instruments which shall become mutilated or be destroyed or
lost, upon receipt of the indemnification, and the payment of the expenses of
replacement as the Board, in its discretion, may deem proper or requisite.
Bonds may be issued under the provisions of this title without obtaining the
approval or consent of any division, commission, board, bureau or agency of the
State of Maryland and without any other proceeding or the happening of any
other condition or thing than those proceedings, conditions or things which are
specifically required by this title. In the event the Board shall determine to
sell any bonds of the County authorized by this title at public sale, it shall
comply with the provisions of Section 10 of Article 31 of the Annotated Code of
Maryland, but in all other respects the provisions of Sections 9 to 11,
inclusive, of Article 31 of the Annotated Code of Maryland shall not apply to
bonds issued under this title. If the Board shall provide for the execution of
any bonds in facsimile, it shall comply with the provisions of §§ 2-301 through
2-306 of the State Finance and Procurement Article of the Annotated Code of
Maryland. All bond proceeds, as well as all money held in sinking or reserve
funds in the name of the County shall be invested by the Board in the manner
prescribed by Section 22 of Article 95 of the Annotated Code of Maryland.
Subtitle 7. Assessments; charges.
14-701. Tax exemptions.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439S; 1976 Code, sec. 15-19; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
The County shall not be required to pay any taxes or assessments upon any
project acquired, constructed or operated by it, under the provisions of this
title, or on the income, and the bonds issued under the provisions of this
title, their transfer and the income (including any profit made on the sale by
any person other than the initial purchaser) shall at all times be free from
taxation by the State of Maryland or any of its political subdivisions, or by
any town or incorporated municipality or any other public agency within the
State.
14-702. Benefit assessments.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439T; 1976 Code, sec. 15-20; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
   (a)   For the purpose of paying the interest on and principal of the bonds
issued by the County as in this title provided for the water and sewerage
systems to be constructed, purchased, or established under this title, the
Board may fix an annual assessment on all properties, improved or unimproved,
binding upon a street, road, lane, alley, or right-of-way in which a water main
or sewer has been built. The annual assessment shall be made on the front foot
basis, and the first payment shall be collected during the year in which the
construction is completed on the water supply or sewerage systems; or in which
the systems are purchased or acquired. All sums collected by the Board for
benefits levied against the property for water or sewerage construction shall
be set aside as a separate fund to be known and designated as the Front Foot
Benefit Assessment Fund.
   (b)   The Board for the purpose of assessing benefits shall divide all
properties binding upon a street, road, lane, alley, or right-of-way, in which
a water pipe or sanitary sewer is to be laid, into four classes, namely:
agricultural, small acreage, industrial or business, and residential, and the
Board may subdivide each of these classes in the manner as it deems to be in
the public interest. Whenever any water or sewerage project in the service area
has been completed and declared ready for service, the Board shall fix and levy
an assessment for the remainder of the fiscal year on a pro rata basis upon all
property in the service area abutting upon the water main or sewer, in
accordance with the classification or subdivision, and it shall in writing
notify all owners of the properties into which class and subdivision their
respective properties fall and the charge determined on, naming also in the
notice a time and place, when and at which time the owner will be heard. The
notice may be mailed to the last known address of the owner, or served in
person upon any adult occupying the premises or in case of a vacant or
unimproved property posted upon the premises.
   (c)   The classification of and the benefit assessment made against any
property by the Board is final, subject only to revision at the hearing. The
Board may change the classification of properties from time to time as the
properties change in the uses to which they are put. The benefit assessment
shall be levied for water supply and sewerage construction, and shall be based
for each class of property on the number of front feet abutting on the street,
lane, road, alley, or right-of-way in which the water pipe or sewer is placed;
provided, however, that in the case of any irregular shaped lot abutting upon a
road, street, lane, alley, or right-of-way in which there is or is being
constructed a water or sewerage system at any point, the lot shall be assessed
for the frontage as the Board may determine to be reasonable and fair; and
provided further that no residential property may be assessed on more than one
side unless it abuts upon two parallel streets, that corner lots may be
averaged and assessed upon the frontage as the Board may deem reasonable and
fair, and that all lots in the residential and industrial or business
classification shall be assessed even though a water main or sewer may not
extend along the full length of any boundary; and provided further, that no
land classified as agricultural by the Board shall be assessed a front foot
benefit when it has constructed through it or in front of it a sewer or water
main until such time as the water or sewer connection is made, and when so made
and for every connection the land is liable to a front foot assessment for the
reasonable frontage not exceeding three hundred (300) feet, or as may be
determined by the Board, and shall be immediately assessed at the rate of
assessment determined by the Board for agricultural land. Any land owned by a
religious body on which there is erected a church or a parsonage and which is
used exclusively for customary religious purposes, in the discretion of the
Board, may be exempted from front foot benefit assessment for that frontage not
exceeding 150 feet.
   (d)   Front foot benefit assessments for water and sewerage construction
shall be as nearly uniform as is practicable for each class or subclass of
property for any one year, and no benefit charge, once levied, may be
increased; provided, however, that whenever the County acquires an existing
system other than a municipal system, the construction of which has been added
in whole or in part to the purchase price of land or lots abutting upon the
system and which contribution the Board has determined to be a factor in the
cost to the County of such system, the Board in its discretion may levy the
lesser assessment as may take into account this factor.
   (e)   The amount of the assessment per front foot for each class of property
for water and sewerage systems may be reduced from time to time by the Board in
its discretion, if cost and conditions are deemed by it to justify the
reduction but may be subsequently increased to the amount of original
assessment in the event revenues prove to be insufficient. The benefit
assessments shall be paid annually by all properties located as above specified
for a period of years co-extensive with the period of maturity of the bonds out
of the proceeds of which the construction was done.
   (f)   The Board may at any time permit a connection with a water main or
sewer by a property owner whose property does not abut on a water main or sewer
and who has not previously paid a benefit charge for the construction of the
water main or sewer, provided, the Board classifies the property and determines
a front foot assessment to be paid by the property owner as though the property
abutted on a water main or sewer; and if the connection is made, the property
owner and the property as to all charges, rates and benefits stand in every
respect in the same position as if the property abutted on a water main or
sewer.
   (g)   The annual benefit assessment or other charge as above specified is a
lien on the property against which it is assessed until paid, any statute of
limitations to the contrary notwithstanding, subject only to prior State and
county taxes. If any property is sold for State or county taxes, or both, by
the Director of Finance* of the County, and if after sale there is a surplus
after all costs and expenses incident to the sale shall have been paid, the
County, upon proper petition to the Circuit Court shall be allowed any balance
from the surplus, and shall be a preferred lienor to the extent of its lien;
and for the purpose of giving notice to the general public as to existing liens
and charges against any property within Carroll County abutting on any water or
sewer main, or connected to any water or sewer main the Board shall keep a
public record of all names of owners of property, locations of property, lot
numbers when of record, and the amount of the benefit assessments, water
service charges, or other charges, that may become liens from time to time. The
records shall be kept in the office of the Board as a public record, and when
so kept shall be legal notice of all existing liens within Carroll County. The
Board shall request the Director of Finance of the County to print a notice on
the State and county tax bills that benefit assessments and other charges for
water and sewer services must be paid in the office of the Board or elsewhere
as the Board may designate.

14-703. Special assessments.
1978, ch. 739; 1999 Supp., sec. 15-20A; 2000, ch. 601.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing for the payment of the principal of and
the interest on the bonds issued by the County under the terms and conditions
of this title for the construction of drainage systems, there may be levied by
the Board, on behalf of the County, a special assessment to be known as a
drainage area assessment against all of the properties within the drainage area
served by the system, whether immediately or remotely, which the Board may
determine to be specifically benefitted by the system, based on the area or on
the assessed value of all of the property belonging to any owner within the
drainage area and so benefitted, which special assessment shall be uniform
throughout the area affected. This special assessment shall be made on either
an area basis or on an assessed valuation basis whichever is deemed more
equitable and just by the Board, and the selection made by the Board shall be
final and conclusive. The special assessment, if levied, shall be levied
annually in an amount deemed equitable and just (taking into account the
benefit to the properties in the drainage area) by the Board and shall be used
to meet all or a part of the principal and interest requirements of the bonds
outstanding, the proceeds of which were used for the construction, and related
expenses, of the drainage system installed in the drainage area. Before the
special assessment as provided by this section of this subtitle is levied, the
Board shall mail to the owners of all properties within the drainage area or
part of the drainage area on which it proposes to levy a special assessment, at
the address of the owner as appears from the tax records of Carroll County,
notice that the special assessment is to be levied and giving the property
owners an opportunity to be heard at a time and place fixed in the notice. At
the hearing, the Board may adjust the special assessment, maintaining however,
the uniformity of the base rate or percentage of levy.
   (b)   In any event, the Board shall levy annually, on behalf of the County,
an ad valorem tax on all legally assessable property in a drainage area in a
sufficient amount, together with any drainage and assessments and any other
funds available for the purpose, to meet the principal and interest
requirements, when due, of any bonds outstanding, the proceeds of which were
used for the construction, and related expenses, of a drainage system installed
in a drainage area.
14-704. Connection charges.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439U; 1976 Code, sec. 15-21; 1978, ch. 739; 2000, ch. 601.
For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this title, the County may
make a charge for every sewer and water connection. The funds derived from the
charges may be used for payment of principal and interest on bonds,
accumulating funds for capital improvements, for acquisition and construction
of water and sewerage systems and the operation and maintenance of water and
sewer systems and for the purchase of equipment and supplies necessary to the
operation of the Board. Connection charges may be established from time to time
by the Board. The connection charges may be based upon reasonable
classifications as the Board may determine and the classifications may vary
within any water or sewerage system and among any systems depending on any
special circumstances which the Board finds exists. The charges provided in
this section shall not be limited to the costs to the Board for making the
connections. The Board is empowered to determine the manner in which the
charges shall be payable.
14-705. Charges authorized.
1967, ch. 754, sec. 439K; 1976 Code, sec. 15-22; 1978, ch. 739; 1984, ch. 381;
2000, ch. 601; 2001, ch. 720.
For the purpose of providing funds for maintaining, repairing and operating its
water and sewerage systems, and for its operation and other expenses, including
proper depreciation allowances, and for interest on and the retirements of
bonds as specified in this title, the Board may make the following charges:
   (1)   A water and sewer service charge. The rates for water and sewer
service shall consist of a minimum or ready-to-serve charge which shall be
based on the size of the meter on the water connection leading to the property,
and of a charge for water used, which shall be based on the amount of water
passing through the meter during the period between the last two readings. The
meter shall be required to be placed on each water connection by and at the
sole expense of the County and it shall remain the property of the County. The
rates shall be classified within Carroll County in a manner as the Board deems
advisable; provided, however, that a classification shall be based upon the
quantities of water used and may be, insofar as possible, uniform throughout
each system in Carroll County. If the Board at any time shall not have meters
available to install in all the properties in a given locality that are
connected to the system, then a flat rate shall be charged on properties in
which meters have not yet been installed, which rate shall be uniform in each
system and based upon the ready-to-serve charge and the amount of water used.
Bills for water and sewer charges shall be sent quarterly or semi-annually as
the Board may determine to each property served and shall be payable at the
office of the Board or other place as the Board may designate. The charges
shall be a lien upon the property served and collectible as elsewhere provided
in this section. If any bill remains unpaid after thirty (30) days from date of
sending, the Board, after written notice left on the premises or mailed to the
last known address of the owner, shall turn off the water from the property in
question; and the water shall not be turned on again until bill has been paid,

shall be collected annually in the same manner as are front foot benefit
assessments against all property having a connection within a water main or
sewer under the operation or ownership of the County and shall be a lien
against the property. The charges shall be based on the classifications as the
Board from time to time may establish and shall be uniform throughout each
system within each classification; provided, however, that no charge for the
upkeep of water and sewerage systems shall be made against any property in any
year for which property is currently subject to a front foot benefit assessment
as elsewhere in this title provided.

used to assist property owners who are not eligible for state or federal
assistance, but meet financial eligibility criteria set by the Board to
facilitate connection to public water and sewerage systems.
      (ii)   Disbursements from the fund shall be used to pay the costs
associated with water and sewerage system connections including, but not
limited to, the municipal connection fees, well closures, electrical upgrades,
and similar charges.
      (iii)   Property owners who have received disbursements from the fund
shall repay the fund.
      (iv)   The Board shall:
         1.   Impose a lien on the property benefitted from the connection to
public water and sewerage systems for the amount paid by the Board on the
property owner’s behalf; and
         2.   Establish procedures for repayment to the fund by providing for
annual payments to be added to the property owner’s property tax bills.

in the same manner as other properties are sold at tax sale. The liens shall be
subject only to liens for State and county taxes. The charges shall be due when

if a jurisdiction within the county imposes fees to offset the costs of
development from a person subject to this subchapter for exactly the same
development; and the fees imposed by that jurisdiction are designed or intended
to offset the same development impact; provided, however, that credits will be
granted only to the extent the person actually pays impact fees to the other
jurisdiction. All payments made by the county to the other jurisdiction shall
likewise be reduced by the amount credited to the extent payments from the
county to that jurisdiction were based on the fees collected.
   (D)   A person who petitions for credit must provide to the Budget Officer a
certification that the fee imposed by the jurisdiction is for the same purpose

§ 33.59 COMPUTATION OF FEES USING INDEPENDENT IMPACT ANALYSIS.
   (A)   A developer or person may choose to use an independent impact analysis
to compute the development impact fee due.
   (B)   The developer or person shall be responsible for the preparation of
the draft independent impact analysis and the Budget Officer shall accept,
reject, or modify the draft analysis.
   (C)   The Budget Officer shall approve the person who prepares the draft
independent impact analysis on the basis of professional training and
experience in preparation of development impact analysis. The independent
impact analysis shall conform to standard methodologies and format and be
approved by the Budget Officer. The Budget Officer may publish acceptable
methodologies and formats for the preparation of impact analysis. Prior to
submission of the draft independent impact analysis, the developer or person
shall meet with the Budget Officer to review the requirements for the
preparation of a draft independent impact analysis.
   (D)   In addition to any other methodologies approved by the Budget Officer,
the following formulas shall be used to determine the development impact fee
for schools, unless the developer or person provides substantial competent
evidence that an alternative formula or methodology should be used:
School fee =    (SCPU x CPS) - (SCPU x CPS x .25) +
      (SCPU x CPS2) - (SCPU x CPS2 x .25) +
      (SCPU x CPS3) - (SCPU x CPS3 x .25)
Where
   SCPU =    School children per unit
   CPS =    Cost per student for Grades K-5
   CPS2 =    Cost per student for Grades 6-8
   CPS3 =    Cost per student for Grades 9-12

2002)
§ 33.60 PAYMENT OF FEE; LIEN AGAINST PROPERTY.
   (A)   Except as provided in §
33.61, the entire impact fee shall be paid to the county before a building
permit may be issued. A building permit may not be issued until any applicable
development impact fee has been paid. Any jurisdiction in the county which
issued a building permit without collecting the correct impact fee shall be
liable for any deficiency.
   (B)   If a building permit expires, any impact fee paid for the issuance of
the permit shall be credited to the impact fee due for any subsequent building
permit issued for the same property. The applicant for the subsequent permit
shall not be required to pay the difference, if any, between the amount due for
the current impact fee, and the amount previously paid. The impact fee credit
is transferable between owners but applies only to the lot or parcel for which
the fee was originally paid.
(2004 Code, § 102-6) (Ord. 165, passed 11-18-1998)
§ 33.61 CREDITS.
   (A)   Any conveyance of land by a developer to the county or construction
project completed, received, and accepted by the county from a developer shall
be credited against the development impact fee due if the conveyance or
construction meets the same needs as the development impact fee. If the
developer wishes to receive credit against the amount of the development impact
fee due for such conveyance or construction, the developer may enter into a fee
agreement with the county. The fee agreement shall provide for establishment of
credits and fee payment in a specified manner and time.
   (B)   The value of land conveyed or facilities constructed by a developer
and accepted by the county for purposes of this section shall be determined by
an appraisal based on the fair market value of the land or facilities as
established by the county. Construction shall be in accordance with county and
state design standards.
   (C)   Credit may not be given for:
      (1)   Site-related transportation improvements to local roads and
collectors, including transportation improvements required for adequate access
for a subdivision;
      (2)   Conveyance of land or construction of facilities required as part
of the Planning Commission approval of the project; or
      (3)   Any conveyance or construction otherwise required for development
under any other provision of state or county law.
   (D)   Land awarded credit under this section shall be conveyed no later than
the time at which development impact fees are due. The portion of the
development impact fee credited for construction shall be deemed paid when the
construction is completed and accepted by the county for maintenance, or when
adequate security for the completion of the construction has been provided.
(2004 Code, § 102-7) (Ord. 165, passed 11-18-1998)
§ 33.62 USE OF FUNDS.
   (A)   All funds collected from development impact fees shall be used solely
for capital improvements (including payment of debt service) for expansion of
the capacity of public facilities and not for replacement, maintenance, or
operations. Expansion of the capacity of a road includes extensions, widening,
intersection improvements, upgrading signalization, improving pavement
conditions and all other road and intersection capacity enhancement. Expansion
of the capacity of a public school includes all construction and remodeling, to
the extent that the construction serves to increase the number of pupils that
may be enrolled in the public schools, but does not include temporary
structures.
   (B)   All fees collected pursuant to this subchapter shall be placed in a
capital outlay fund and used only to pay for costs of capital improvements as
defined herein. The capital outlay fund shall be divided into as many subfunds
as shall be necessary to separately assess fees for single-family residence;
townhouse, duplex, triplex, and other multi-family residence and mobile home.
   (C)   Fees collected may be used for capital improvements as defined herein.
However, each fee collected for a dwelling unit must be applied to capital
improvements in the proportion established by the County Commissioners.
   (D)   The amount of fees collected pursuant to this subchapter that can be
applied to any capital improvement shall be limited to that portion of the cost
which is reasonably attributable to the need generated by new development or
benefit conferred upon new development. In approving each capital improvement
budget use of the funds from the capital outlay fund, the County Commissioners
shall apportion the cost of capital improvements between needs or benefits
relating to existing development and needs or benefits relating to new
development.
   (E)   The funds collected for public facilities shall be used for the
purpose indicated whether the project is owned by the state, the county, or a
municipality, provided that the project benefits the county proportionally with
the impact that the development from which the funds were generated impacted
the county.
   (F)   If development impact fee districts are hereafter created by
resolution, funds collected from development impact fees shall be used for
capital improvements within the development impact fee district from which they
are collected, so as to reasonably benefit the feepayer. The school impact fee
districts shall be as shown on the school impact fee districts map all as
established by the Budget Officer and on file in the Department of Land Use,
Planning, and Development, or its successor agency, and with the County
Commissioners. Fees from one district may be used for capital improvements in
another district on a written finding by the Director of Planning, Land Use,
and Development, or its successor agency, that the capital improvements are a
direct benefit to the district from which the fees were collected.
   (G)   By written agreement, the county and the feepayer may agree to
reimburse the feepayer for any fee paid in excess of that required by this
subchapter. The fees advanced shall be used by the county to fund the costs of
capital improvements for public facilities needed by new development. Such fees
may be reimbursed from development impact fees collected subsequent to the
agreement and from development that will reasonably benefit from the capital
improvements.
(2004 Code, § 102-8) (Ord. 165, passed 11-18-1998; Ord. 03-12, passed 6-10-
2003)
§ 33.63 REFUND OF FEES.
   (A)   Fees not expended by the end of the calendar year immediately
following six years from the date of payment shall, upon application of the
feepayer, be returned to the feepayer with interest at the rate of 5% per year.
The First In, First Out (FIFO) method of accounting shall be used for tracking
these funds.
   (B)   The Budget Officer may extend the date at which the funds must be
refunded for up to three years. An extension shall be made only on a written
finding that within a three-year period, certain capital improvements are
planned that will directly benefit the development against which the fees were
charged.
(2004 Code, § 102-9) (Ord. 165, passed 11-18-1998)
§ 33.64 APPEALS.
   (A)   Any person, firm, or corporation aggrieved by the levying of any fee,
as provided herein, may appeal to the County Commissioners within 30 days of
the date the fee is levied. The County Commissioners will hear the appeal
within 60 days and decide the appeal within 30 days of the hearing. At the
hearing, the party aggrieved shall have the burden of establishing, by expert
evidence, that the fee as levied does not fairly reflect the impact of the
development on the county’s capital improvements. The expert and the expert’s
impact analysis must be qualified pursuant to §
33.59 and the expert’s independent impact analysis must be submitted at the
time an appeal is filed and be completed in accordance with §
33.59. Initiation of an appeal does not eliminate the developer’s obligation to
pay the fee; the developer shall pay the development impact fee prior to
proceeding with development or may elect to appeal prior to commencing
development.
   (B)   If the County Commissioners determine that either a reduced fee or no
fee is required, the county shall refund excess fee paid.
   (C)   An appeal shall be filed with the appropriate office as determined by
the County Commissioners. The County Commissioners shall also establish an
appeal fee, which must be paid upon filing an appeal. The office shall adopt
and publish regulations for the processing of such appeals. The appeal fee
shall be refunded if it is determined on appeal that the impact fee was
excessive.
   (D)   The County Commissioners may appoint such full- and part-time hearing
examiners as may be necessary and appropriate and may delegate to the said
hearing examiner or examiners the power to hold and conduct hearings as
required and set forth herein. Hearings shall be conducted in such a manner and
subject to such rules and regulations as may be provided by the County
Commissioners.
      (1)   The County Commissioners shall establish the hearing examiners’
terms of office, qualifications, and compensation.
      (2)   The hearing examiner shall render a written recommendation at such
time and in such manner and form as may be required by the County
Commissioners.
      (3)   Only written exceptions to the recommendations of the hearing
examiner are allowed. Such exceptions must be filed with the County
Commissioners within ten days of the hearing. The County Commissioners shall
decide the matter based on the recommendations of the hearing examiner, the
exceptions filed thereto and the record within 30 days of the deadline for
filing exceptions.
   (E)   The party aggrieved by the decision, including the Budget Officer, may
appeal to the Circuit Court for Carroll County in accordance with the Maryland
Rules of Civil Procedure.

§ 33.65 SPECIAL TRUST ACCOUNT.
   Immediately, upon the effective date of this subchapter, a special trust
account shall be established on the General Fund books which shall not be spent
for any purpose other than that for which it was collected; unless:
   (A)   This subchapter is voided or repealed, then the funds collected
hereunder shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the county; or
   (B)   An ordinance is enacted to replace or amend this subchapter; and as
part of that ordinance, the funds collected hereunder are directed to different
purposes.
(2004 Code, § 102-11) (Ord. 165, passed 11-18-1998)
§ 33.66 ACCOUNTING OF FUNDS IN SPECIAL TRUST ACCOUNT.
   A separate bank account is not required upon creation of a special trust
account. Interest shall be credited to the special trust account monthly, based
on the average balance in the account and the average percent of interest
realized by the county during that month. The moneys from development impact
fees and interest credited to the special trust account may be obligated only
by the normal county budget procedure. It shall be the duty of the Finance
Officer to account for such funds and the duty of the Budget Officer to
establish the necessary audits and other records to ensure that all collections
of development impact fees are in accordance with the issuance of building
permits as set forth in §§
33.58 and
33.59. Should, at any time, such fund be determined to have a balance in excess
of needs in any six-year period, the County Commissioners shall consider an
amendment to lower or eliminate the development impact fees making up such
fund. Should the need for any category of fee be eliminated due to state or
federal government action or by the County Commissioners, the balance in the
trust account along with any unexpended appropriations residing in any fund
shall revert to the unappropriated surplus of the county. 
(2004 Code, § 102-12) (Ord. 165, passed 11-18-1998)
§ 33.67 VIOLATIONS.
   It is unlawful for any person to enlarge, alter or change any use of the
person’s property or to erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move,
improve, make, put together or convert any building or structure in the county,
or attempt to do so, or cause the same to be done, without first paying the fee
imposed by this subchapter pursuant to either §
33.58 or §
33.59.

until the fee is paid. The person who fails so to pay shall be responsible for
the costs of such suit, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.

Director, Department of Management and Budget, or its successor agency. The
Director, Department of Management and Budget, or its successor agency, shall
be authorized to promulgate rules and standards for the application and review
of all waiver requests.

The Clean Energy Loan Program Administrator shall provide the county with
written notice of the execution of a Clean Energy Loan Financing Agreement. If
the Clean Energy Loan Program Administrator provides such notice to the county
prior to May 1 in any given year, the county shall add the surcharge to the tax
property bill on July 1st of that same year. If the Clean Energy Loan Program
Administrator provides such notice on or after May 1 in any given year, the
county shall add the surcharge to the tax property bill on July 1st of the year
immediately following. The surcharge shall constitute a first lien on the
property from the date it becomes payable until the unpaid surcharge and
interest and penalties on the surcharge are paid in full, regardless of a
change in ownership, whether voluntary or involuntary. A person or entity that
acquires property subject to a surcharge assumes the obligation to pay such
surcharge. The county may assign the surcharge lien to the Clean Energy Loan
Program Administrator.

clean energy loan principal, accrued interest, and any administrative costs
incurred by the county.

of the clean energy loan, including any partial year prorated amounts;
      (5)   Prepayment requirements and any prepayment premium that may apply
to a prepayable clean energy loan;
      (6)   Notice that the clean energy loan obligations and the county's
administrative costs will be repaid through a surcharge included on the owner's
real property tax bill due and payable on the same date as the real property
tax bill;
      (7)   Notice that an unpaid clean energy loan surcharge constitutes a
first lien on the property that has priority over prior or subsequent liens in
favor of private parties and that the surcharge will continue as a lien on the
property from the date it becomes payable until the unpaid surcharge and
interest and penalties on the surcharge are paid in full, regardless of a
change in ownership of the property, whether voluntary or involuntary; and
      (8)   Notice that if payments of surcharges are not timely paid, the
surcharge will be collectible as a tax lien through the tax sale process
authorized under Md. Code, Tax-Property Article, Title 14, Subtitle 8 and in
accordance with
Chapter 33 of the Carroll County Code of Public Local Laws and Ordinances and
that an overdue surcharge will be so collected, irrespective of whether real
property taxes (or any other taxes, charges, or assessments) are due and owing.
   (D)   Default. In the event of default on the clean energy loan surcharge,
the lien will be collected pursuant to the tax sale process irrespective of
whether property taxes (or any other taxes, charges, or assessments) are due
and owing. The county shall not incur any liability to the clean energy lender
or others in the event of default. Nothing in this subchapter shall prevent the
clean energy lender from pursuing its rights and remedies under the Clean
Energy Financing Agreement provided however that the terms of the Clean Energy
Financing Agreement are in compliance with this subchapter.
   (E)   Payment to clean energy lender. The county shall have no ownership of
the surcharges collected except for administrative costs provided under this
subtitle. The county shall pay all surcharge payments received in any calendar
month to the applicable clean energy lender or the Clean Energy Loan Program
Administrator within 30 days after the end of the month in which such amounts
are collected. The county shall have no obligation to make payments to any
clean energy lender with respect to any clean energy loan obligation other than
that portion of surcharge actually collected from a property owner for the
repayment of a clean energy loan.
(Ord. 2017-09, passed 10-19-2017)
§ 33.78 FINANCING.
   (A)   Private lenders, terms. Clean energy loans may be provided by any
private lender and a Clean Energy Financing Agreement may contain any terms
agreed to by the clean energy lender and the property owner, as permitted by
law, for the financing of clean energy loans. The county may not finance or
fund any loan under the program. The county shall serve only as a program
sponsor to facilitate loan repayment by including the surcharge on the annual
county real property tax bill for the property, and the county shall incur no
liability for the loan.
   (B)   County role. The county's role in the Clean Energy Loan Program is
limited to sponsoring the program and collecting and forwarding the surcharges
imposed under the program. The county may not provide clean energy loans or
other financing in connection with this program.

§ 34.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The County Commissioners, recognizing that our system of
representative government depends in part upon the people maintaining the
highest trust in their public officials and employees, find and declare that
the people have a right to be assured that the impartiality and independent
judgment of public officials and employees will be maintained.
   (B)   The people have a right to be assured that the financial interests of
holders of and candidates for public office present no conflict with the public
interest.
   (C)   It is evident that this confidence is eroded when the conduct of the
county’s business is subject to improper influence and even the appearance of
improper influence.
   (D)   For the purpose of guarding against improper influence, the County
Commissioners enact this chapter to establish (1) minimum ethical standards for
county elected officials, officials, and employees; (2) financial disclosure
requirements for county elected officials, candidates for public office,
officials, and employees and individuals appointed to boards and commissions;
and (3) disclosure requirements for lobbyists.
   (E)   It is the intention of the County Commissioners that the provisions of
this chapter, except its provisions for criminal sanctions, be broadly
construed and strictly enforced to accomplish this purpose.

   (A)   Filing of complaints. Any person, including the Ethics Commission on
its own motion, may file a complaint of questionable conduct or misconduct with
the Ethics Commission. Such complaints must:
      (1)   Be against an official, employee, or lobbyist under the
jurisdiction of the Ethics Commission;
      (2)   Allege a violation of any of the provisions of this chapter either
by:
         (a)   Actual activities or decisions that present a conflict of
interest; or
         (b)   Conduct or relationships that give the appearance of a conflict
of interest or improper influence; or
         (c)   Conduct that may present a conflict of interest or improper
influence; or
         (d)   Conduct or relationships that violate the financial disclosure
or lobbying provisions of this chapter including failure to adequately complete

      (3)   Be filed with the Ethics Commission in writing and under oath with
penalty of perjury. The written complaint of violation must contain the name of
the employee or official and set forth sufficient facts to substantiate the
alleged violation. The complaint must also contain the name, address, and

      (4)   A complaint must be filed within two years after the date of the
alleged violation.
   (B)   Confidentiality. After a complaint is filed the proceedings, meetings,
and activities of the Ethics Commission relating to the complaint are
confidential as outlined in §
34.15.
   (C)   Processing complaints.
      (1)   Recording complaints. Once the Ethics Commission receives a
complaint it will be recorded in an appropriate confidential log under a unique
file number. This log will be kept with confidential files and will not be
subject to public view. If a reasonable basis exists for a preliminary inquiry,
the Ethics Commission will send written notice of the complaint to the
complainant and respondent.
      (2)   Investigating complaints.
         (a)   Prior to questioning any respondent, he or she shall be informed
of his or her right to have legal representation present if he or she so
desires.
         (b)   Preliminary inquiry. The Ethics Commission, through the Ethics
Administrator, may conduct a preliminary inquiry to determine whether the
matter should be processed as a complaint. If there are insufficient facts upon
which to base a determination of a violation, the Ethics Commission, through
the Ethics Administrator, will judge that the matter does not qualify for
further action. The disposition will be entered in the confidential log. The
Ethics Commission will dismiss the complaint and notify the complainant and
respondent in writing. All information will be subject to the confidentiality
provisions of this chapter.
         (c)   Formal investigation.
            1.   Complaints which are determined to have enough merit for
further action will be investigated by the Ethics Administrator with assistance
from selected county staff.
            2.   The Ethics Commission may refer a complaint to the County
Attorney, or other legal counsel, if appropriate, for investigation and review.
            3.   After investigation, the Ethics Administrator will call an
Ethics Commission meeting to present the results of the investigations of the
complaints to the Ethics Commission for its consideration. This report may
contain, but need not contain, provisions for a resolution of minor
infractions, which have been agreed to by the respondent. The Ethics Commission
may accept this resolution and no hearing need be scheduled. Upon resolution,
the Ethics Commission will notify the complainant and respondent in writing.
            4.   If the Ethics Commission determines that there is sufficient
evidence that a violation of the ethics laws has or is occurring, and a
resolution is not appropriate, a hearing will commence, either in conjunction
with the investigation report meeting or at a later date. The respondent and
complainant will be notified in writing at least 30 days prior to the
Commission meeting at which the investigation report will be presented and a
decision to have a hearing may be made. The letter will contain the preliminary
findings of the Ethics Commission and will indicate that a hearing may be held
in conjunction with the report of the investigation or at a later date. The
subject of the complaint will be given an opportunity to address the Ethics
Commission regarding the complaint.
   (D)   Oaths and requests. The Ethics Commission will have the following
powers to the extent permitted by law:

testify, or produce books, papers, records, documents or other tangible
objects.
      (3)   County employees are expected to comply with all requests from the
Ethics Commission or be subject to action under Chapter 36 of this County Code.
   (E)   Hearings.
      (1)   The Ethics Commission will conduct hearings. A member may recuse
himself or herself if a personal interest may present a conflict or an
appearance of conflict. Hearings are not open to the public.
      (2)   The respondent may be represented by counsel of their choosing and
may present evidence and witnesses on their own behalf.
      (3)   The respondent is entitled to know the names of all witnesses and
is entitled to receive copies of all evidence against him or her at least 30
days prior to a formal hearing.
      (4)   The respondent has a right to be present during testimony of all
witnesses and shall have the right of cross examination.
      (5)   All hearings are administrative hearings and are therefore not
subject to the strict rules of evidence. Latitude is available to the Ethics
Commission in order to determine the true circumstances of the case and arrive
at an appropriate conclusion.
      (6)   The respondent(s) shall be the only party or parties to the
proceeding, and any evidence, witnesses, and investigation results will be
presented to the Ethics Commission by the Ethics Administrator or, if
necessary, by staff assisting the Ethics Administrator.
      (7)   The standard of review used by the Ethics Commission in determining
whether a violation has occurred will be a preponderance of the evidence.
      (8)   The Ethics Commission will make written findings of fact and
conclusions of law based on evidence presented at the hearing. The report of
the Ethics Commission will contain the alleged violations, the elements of the
violations, the findings of fact by the Ethics Commission, action taken by the
Ethics Commission, and the signature of Ethics Commission members present at
the hearing. The Ethics Commission will send its written findings to the
complainant and respondent.
      (9)   Upon finding of a violation, the Ethics Commission may take any
enforcement action provided for in §
34.17 of this chapter.
      (10)   A finding of a violation is public information. Written reports of
investigations will be maintained as public records and, should there be a
request for viewing under the Maryland Public Information Act, will be redacted
(edited) to protect personally identifiable information.
   (F)   Criminal activity.
      (1)   If the Ethics Commission, while considering a complaint, finds that
there are reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent may have committed
a criminal offense, the Ethics Commission will promptly refer the matter to an
appropriate prosecuting authority.
      (2)   The Ethics Commission will make available to the prosecuting
authority all pertinent evidence or information under its control.
   (G)   Dismissal of complaint. The Ethics Commission may at any time dismiss
a complaint if it believes that probable cause of a violation of this chapter
does not exist.

   The purpose of discipline is to effectively, consistently, and promptly
modify employee behaviors, misconduct, and/or poor performance that is
inconsistent with or counterproductive to effective, efficient, and safe county

according to the circumstances of each case. Disciplinary actions include but
are not limited to, verbal or written notices, suspension with or without pay,
demotion, dismissal, or any other action deemed appropriate at the discretion
of the supervisor and HR.

§ 36.166 PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE.
   (A)   In most cases, but not all, supervisors shall impose a progression of
disciplinary actions before recommending dismissal.
   (B)   The county reserves the right to judge each case individually, based
on such factors as the seriousness of infraction, work history, prior
discipline, employee's knowledge/understanding of rules and procedures,
mitigating circumstances, public and private conduct, and how others were
treated under the same circumstances.
   (C)   When a violation occurs warranting disciplinary action, a supervisor
may issue disciplinary action in any of the steps outlined below depending on
the seriousness of the offense. Prior to a suspension or dismissal, Human
Resources must be consulted.
      (1)   Verbal (documented) Warning - for first offense or infractions of a
minor nature.
      (2)   Written Warning - for infractions of a major nature or if the
employee fails to correct shortcomings after a previous verbal warning.
      (3)   Suspension - for infractions of a major nature or if the employee
fails to correct their shortcomings after a previous verbal and/or written
warning. Employees may be placed directly on suspension based on the
seriousness of the offense, the circumstances surrounding the disciplinary
problem and the need to investigate the situation before determining the proper
level of discipline to issue. Suspension may be issued with or without pay, in
consultation with HR.
      (4)   Dismissal - if the employee fails to correct shortcomings after a
previous verbal, written, and/or suspension or in lieu of the foregoing, an
employee may be dismissed immediately after the occurrence of an infraction
without a verbal and/or written warning and/or suspension if it is determined
in conjunction with HR that the seriousness of the infraction warrants
immediate dismissal.

         (b)   Asbestos or materials containing asbestos shall be packaged in
impermeable bags with a minimum thickness of six mils and then placed in
corrugated or fiberboard drums sealed so that they are leakproof. The
containers shall be prominently labeled (in at least 16-point type) as follows:
CAUTION, CONTAINS ASBESTOS
AVOID OPENING OR BREAKING CONTAINER
BREATHING ASBESTOS IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH.
         (c)   Any container which does not meet the criteria enumerated above
or which has not been adequately packaged, in the judgment of the county, shall
not be accepted.
         (d)   The county shall be notified at least 48 hours in advance of the
disposal of any asbestos or material containing asbestos.
         (e)   Large structural components containing asbestos that cannot be
packaged in drums, as described in this subchapter, only will be accepted for
disposal if the component in question is itself acceptable for disposal and the
asbestos is adequately wetted, encapsulated, and handled in accordance with the
provisions of 40 C.F.R. Part 61, 1981 edition and COMAR 10.18.15 and 10.18.23,
as those provisions may be amended from time to time.
         (f)   Any person hauling asbestos or materials containing asbestos to
county facilities shall obtain an asbestos disposal form from the county and
submit a properly completed form to county personnel prior to entering the
solid waste acceptance facility.
         (g)   Any person hauling asbestos or materials containing asbestos to
county facilities shall unload at the location designated by county’s
personnel. Asbestos or materials containing asbestos shall be unloaded in a
manner which protects the containers from damage.
         (h)   Any truck or other vehicle hauling asbestos or materials
containing asbestos to county facilities shall have available on it protective
equipment to be used in the event that accidental damage to containers of
asbestos or materials containing asbestos occurs.
   (E)   Recyclable materials. A hauler who collects municipal solid waste must
also collect or provide for the collection of recyclables separated from all
other forms of solid waste. It is the responsibility of a hauler who transports
recyclables, a generator who transports recyclables, or a purchaser of
recyclables to furnish the county with monthly reports on tonnages of
recyclable materials hauled, generated, or purchased, their source and their
destination. Information provided herein, concerning the source and destination
of recyclable materials, considered proprietary or confidential must be clearly
designated as proprietary or confidential at the time a report is made. Upon
clear designation that information contained in a report is proprietary and
should remain confidential, the county will deny access to the information
pursuant to Md. Code, State Government Article, § 10-617(d), notify the
provider of the information of any action filed to gain access to the
information, and the county will not disseminate the information beyond county
staff or other government employees who agree to maintain the confidentiality
of the information and who demonstrate a need to have the information to
perform their duties. Failure to provide reports required by the county shall
be sufficient grounds to suspend, revoke, or deny a license issued hereunder
and shall be a violation of this subchapter. Haulers delivering solid waste to
a county facility shall segregate solid waste separately into any category as
may be required by county. Upon the passage of 90 days from the county’s
adoption of a resolution declaring that recycling is mandatory, haulers shall
be responsible for having all recyclables, at the time of delivery, segregated
from all other waste.
      (1)   Yard waste. No person shall dispose of yard waste by commingling it
with other solid waste. If yard waste is to be disposed of at a county
facility, it may be disposed of at the Northern Landfill or at other sites as
may hereafter be designated by the county, but only in the location designated
by the county for its disposal at the Northern Landfill or other designated
site. Loads of yard waste containing any material other than yard waste will
not be accepted as yard waste and in addition to the solid waste management fee
may be subject to penalties upon acceptance at a county facility if the
contamination affected the county’s yard waste collection program adversely in
any way.
      (2)   Tires. Any individual disposing of four or fewer tires within a
week may take the tires to any county-designated facility. Any individual
disposing of five or more tires shall comply with Md. Code, Environment
Article, § 9-228, and COMAR 26.04.08.
      (3)   Recyclable white goods. Recyclable white goods, if delivered to a
county facility, shall be unloaded in the designated white goods unloading area
and may not be disposed of in a sanitary landfill, except pursuant to an
approval of the Director of the Department.
   (F)   Documentation. Upon the request of the county, a hauler, purchaser of
recyclables, or a commercial generator hauling its own solid waste shall
provide the county with accurate and verifiable documentation of the types,
quantities, and disposition of any solid waste which the hauler, generator, or
purchaser has transported, or had transported, to any location. Information
provided herein, concerning the source and destination of recyclable materials,
considered proprietary or confidential, must be clearly designated as
proprietary or confidential at the time a report is made. Upon clear
designation that information contained in a report is proprietary and should
remain confidential, the county will deny access to the information pursuant to
Md. Code, State Government Article, § 10-617(d), notify the provider of the
information of any action filed to gain access to the information and the
county will not disseminate the information beyond county staff or other
government employees who agree to maintain the confidentiality of the
information and who demonstrate a need to have the information to perform their
duties.

Ord. 02-08, passed 4-25-2002)
§ 50.05 PROHIBITED ACTIONS AT SOLID WASTE ACCEPTANCE FACILITIES.
   (A)   All municipal solid waste shall be transported directly from the point
of collection and delivered in accordance with this subchapter to a solid waste
acceptance facility (either a county facility or any other lawfully permitted
facility), without any intervening transfer, unloading, processing, sorting,
salvaging, scavenging, or reuse, except as may be allowed under the terms of
the license issued hereunder.
   (B)   Special handling wastes shall be transported from the point of
collection and delivered in accordance with this subchapter to a facility
authorized by law to accept them.
   (C)   Upon reasonable advance notice to the hauler, the county may designate
or change the site designation for disposal of any waste or recyclable
material.
   (D)   No person shall use any county facility without a valid license as may
be required by this subchapter and which has been obtained from the county or
use any county facility in violation of this subchapter. A license issued
pursuant to this subchapter may be revoked at any time for any cause determined
sufficient by the county after reasonable notice and an opportunity for the
licensee to be heard.
   (E)   No person shall possess or consume any alcoholic beverage or beverages
at any county facility.
   (F)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle in a reckless or unsafe manner
at a county facility.
   (G)   No person shall trespass on county facility property. Except on a
county MRF, only persons with valid permits shall be allowed on county facility
property, and they shall be allowed only during operating hours and when
accompanied by authorized county personnel. The operator of a county MRF shall
take precaution to secure its property against trespassers.
   (H)   Except in the course of law enforcement, no person shall discharge a
firearm or other weapon such that it projects any object over or onto property
of a county facility.
(2004 Code, § 185-5) (Ord. 94, passed 5-21-1992) Penalty, see §
50.99
§ 50.06 FEES.
   (A)   Authorized fees.
      (1)   The county is hereby authorized in its executive capacity to
establish fees and penalties for the receipt of any solid waste or unacceptable
waste at a county facility. Fees or penalties established hereunder may be
changed whenever the county deems it necessary or expedient to do so.
      (2)   The County Commissioners may authorize the Department to adjust
fees on March 1 of each year to be effective on the following July 1 to recover
the actual cost of the operation of all solid waste management services
provided by the county. If this authorization is given, the Department shall
establish as the solid waste management fee a charge that is the result of the
Department’s determination of the projected actual cost of solid waste services
divided by the total tonnage of municipal solid waste projected to enter the
county landfill in the next fiscal year. (Actual cost is comprised of the
proposed budgets of those agencies of county government whose duties are solely
related to providing solid waste services, that portion of the budgets of
agencies of county government that may be attributable to the provision of
solid waste management services, any surplus or deficit, depreciation,
annualized cost of future development and closing, annualized cost of future
facilities, and if not previously accounted for herein, the cost of hazardous
waste disposal, composting, and recycling.)
      (3)   In addition, solid waste management fees may be calculated and
established on any portion of the waste stream by providing different fees for
different categories of waste. If separate fees are established for different
categories of solid waste, the anticipated revenue from these fees shall be
used by the Department in establishing the solid waste management fee. In
addition, the Department, if authorized to adjust the solid waste management
fee pursuant to this section, may adjust any fee established hereunder and
establish new fees.
   (B)   Types of fees.
      (1)   Solid waste management fee. Solid waste, including any component of
the waste stream, may be assessed a management fee when delivered to the county
landfill or other county facility. These fees are in addition to any permit or
license fee.
      (2)   Special handling wastes. Special handling wastes will be assessed a
management fee when delivered to the county landfill. This fee is in addition
to any solid waste management fee, permit, or license fee.
      (3)   MRF residue.  Residue from the processing of a MRF shall be subject
to a solid waste management fee in an amount established in a contract between
the county and the operator of the MRF. If there is no contract or the contract
does not address a fee for MRF residue, the fee shall be as established
pursuant to division (A) above.
      (4)   Mixed loads. The fee for any load containing more than one category
of waste shall be equal to the fee that would be required for disposal of the
load requiring the highest fee. The county may reduce or waive this surcharge
if the hauler demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the county that
the mixing of waste was not due to the fault or negligence of the hauler and
that the hauler has made best efforts to prevent such mixing in the future.
      (5)   Additional fees. An additional fee of $100 per hour may be assessed
to the hauler of any load of waste which requires any assistance.
   (C)   Customer notice. A hauler shall include on each invoice to a
residential customer a specific statement that informs the customer of the
amount of the county’s solid waste management fee. For example, if the fee is
$40 per ton, the notice must read: “The fee charged by the county for each ton
of solid waste we dispose of is $40. It is estimated that each household
generates one and one-half tons of solid waste per year without recycling.”
(2004 Code, § 185-6) (Ord. 94, passed 5-21-1992; Ord. 114, passed 4-14-1994;
Ord. 02-08, passed 4-25-2002)
§ 50.07 BILLING AND PAYMENT OF FEES.
   (A)   A solid waste management fee shall be charged on each load of solid
waste delivered to a county landfill, and payment shall be due upon disposal of
the waste. Categories of solid waste may be charged different fees, or the
county may determine not to charge a fee for categories of solid waste. A
hauler may enter into a written agreement with county to establish an account
with the county. The county may require a hauler to provide security for the
future payment of the fee in a form and amount satisfactory to county upon the
establishment of a credit account, and the county may charge an administrative
fee if a credit account is requested.
   (B)   A municipality within the county, that engages to collect all solid
waste within its jurisdiction, may elect to pay solid waste management fees
upon a monthly basis pursuant to a schedule developed by the Department, or
that municipality may elect to have its hauler pay solid waste management fees
pursuant to division (A) above. In the event a municipality elects to pay its
solid waste management fee, the municipality shall make arrangements with its
hauler for providing the county with a manifest identifying the source of the
solid waste and the municipality’s responsibility for payment of the fee. The
hauler will be charged for all loads that are not properly identified as the
responsibility of the municipality.
   (C)   If a hauler has established an account with the county, or if a
municipality elects to pay its solid waste management fee to the county
directly, the hauler or the municipality, as the case may be, will be billed
monthly and payment shall be due within 30 days of the date of the bill. The
county may charge interest on unpaid balances and assess penalties for accounts
that are past due.
   (D)   Accounts not paid by the thirty-fifth day after the statement date
will be classified as delinquent, and in addition to interest and penalties
being assessed, credit will be suspended until full payment is made. No dumping
will be allowed.
   (E)   If an account becomes delinquent a second time within 12 months, the
person who has the account will lose the credit privilege for six months.
   (F)   A person who has a credit account must charge at least $50 per month
to maintain a credit account.
   (G)   All additional fees will be billed separately and will be due 30 days
from statement date and shall be subject to penalties for late payment and
interest as determined by the Comptroller.

§ 50.08 OPERATING AND SAFETY RULES FOR COUNTY FACILITIES.
   (A)   Any users of the county facilities shall unload in designated areas
and immediately thereafter leave the site.
   (B)   All persons other than those actually participating in the unloading
must remain in vehicles as a matter of safety. Children under age 13 and pets
must also be kept in vehicles.
   (C)   Salvaging and scavenging is prohibited at the county facilities except
with the prior written approval of the county.
   (D)   No fires or open burning are permitted in county facilities.
   (E)   No hunting is permitted at any solid waste acceptance facility owned
or operated by or on behalf of Carroll County.
   (F)   No person may dump solid waste, recyclables, special handling waste,
or other waste regulated hereunder in other than an area designated for the

wastes without a permit if required by this subchapter to have one.
   (G)   Smoking is prohibited at county facilities except in designated
smoking areas.
   (H)   Loitering and solicitation are prohibited at county facilities.
   (I)   Boxes or other containers will be allowed to be dropped from vehicles
only in areas expressly designated as untarping or unloading areas.
   (J)   Vehicles and containers may not be left at county facilities without
prior county approval.
   (K)   All sorting and separation of solid waste by a hauler must be
performed at designated areas and not in the tipping areas.
   (L)   Haulers must unload solid waste off the rear of the vehicle in
designated tipping areas. Unloading of vehicles off the sides is prohibited. No
vehicles will be allowed to discharge waste through the tailgate. All tailgates
must be removable, lay down, or swing to an open position.
   (M)   Passengers shall be in the cab of the vehicle upon arrival at the
scale. Riding on the bed or tailgate between the scale and tipping areas or
during unloading is prohibited.
   (N)   Operators of vehicles are required to leave a minimum of six feet
between vehicles during unloading at the landfill and MRF.
   (O)   Licensed vehicles, containers, and the contents of vehicles and
containers are subject to inspection at any time by the county.
   (P)   All persons unloading vehicles shall be appropriately dressed to
prevent injury and shall be wearing shoes.
   (Q)   Owners and operators of licensed vehicles and containers shall be
responsible to ensure that their vehicles are watertight, readily emptied,
cleaned with sufficient frequency to prevent insect breeding or odors or other
nuisances, and shall be maintained in good repair and a safe condition. All
waste must be secured to the vehicle or container and enclosed or covered with
secured tarpaulins to prevent leakage, spillage, dusting, or litter. Such
enclosures and tarpaulins must remain in place until arrival at the designated
unloading or uncovering areas at the county facility. After discharging a load
of waste, the driver or operator of the vehicle is responsible for inspecting
the vehicle and the container to ensure that all the waste from the vehicle and
container has been discharged properly. In the event that all the waste has not
been discharged, the driver or operator must remove all remaining waste or
secure the remaining waste by tarping or enclosing the vehicle or container. In
the event a vehicle or container leaks, spills, dusts, or litters on any county
facility, public road, or private property, the person hauling the waste will
be responsible for all cleanup and for paying any costs incurred or damages
sustained by the county in connection with performing or monitoring such
cleanup.

SEWER AND WATER MASTER PLAN
§ 51.01 POLICY AND ADOPTION BY REFERENCE.
   (A)   Generally. This subchapter outlines the rules and regulations for the
installation, operation, and maintenance of water and sewer facilities in this
county. All matters pertaining to the installation, operation, and maintenance
of water and sewer facilities in this county shall be performed and conducted
in accordance with the Carroll County Department of Public Works, Bureau of
Utilities, or Regulations and Standard Specifications and Design Details for
Water and Sewer Construction in Carroll County, as from time to time amended
(hereinafter referred to as "the Manual"), and the County Commissioners, or
their successor agencies, hereby adopts said Manual by reference and
incorporates the same as if fully set forth herein.
   (B)   Contract numbering policy. At the onset of any project proposed by the
county, the following method of identification will be used. The Bureau of
Utilities, or its successor agencies, shall establish the approximate
identification for each project.
      (1)   W indicates water.
      (2)   S indicates sewer.
      (3)   XX indicates project number.
      (4)   X indicates date and year in which contract is awarded.
   (C)   Charges and rates. The County Commissioners are authorized to
establish by resolution water and sewer area connection charges and water and
sewer usage rates. Charges and rates established hereunder may be changed
whenever the County Commissioners deem it necessary to do so. Before adopting a
resolution under this section, the County Commissioners shall hold a public
hearing and shall provide notice of the hearing.
(2004 Code, § 179-1) (Ord. 46, passed 4-17-1984; Ord. 46-J, passed 8-11-1997;
Ord. 02-20, passed 11-21-2002; Ord. 03-13, passed 6-10-2003; Ord. 2021-09,
passed 10-14-2021)
§ 51.02 GENERAL PLAN.
   (A)   The County Commissioners will adopt and, from time to time, revise a
general plan for development of a Comprehensive Water and Sewer Master Plan
("the Master Plan") in the county.
   (B)   The Master Plan will include operating systems, projected systems, and
planned systems. Operating systems are those elements of the Master Plan for
which a cost center has been established to track revenue and/or expenditures,
as determined by the Comptroller. Projected systems are those elements of the
Master Plan for which identification pursuant to §
51.01(B) has been made, but which have not been accepted as operating systems.
Planned systems are those elements of the Master Plan which reflect anticipated
service areas and systems but which are not yet projected systems.
   (C)   For a system to be a planned system, included within the Master Plan
there must be:
      (1)   Petition by private citizen;
      (2)   Decision by the county that the system is in the interest of the
public health and welfare;
      (3)   Directive by the Carroll County Health Department; or
      (4)   Directive by the Maryland Department of the Environment.
   (D)   Once planned systems are included in the Master Plan, the county may
require that a feasibility study be done. The county shall contract for the
feasibility study with a consultant.
   (E)   The county may require the private citizen who has petitioned that a
system be included in the Master Plan, pursuant to division (C) above, to bear
the cost of the feasibility study, and to secure the cost by a deposit with the
county. In the event that the project proves feasible and is included as a
projected system within the Master Plan, the cost of the feasibility study
becomes part of the total project cost and will be refunded to the private
citizen.
   (F)   The feasibility study shall determine the technical and economic
feasibility of the proposed project. The results of the study will be an
assertion that the project is or is not technically feasible. The study shall
also contain an estimate of the project cost, which shall include construction,
engineering, inspection and administrative cost, plus an estimate for
contingencies, and an estimate of the lump sum income available from area
connection charges; it shall contain an estimate of the annual income required
to support the system and shall establish suggested charges or assessments
necessary to raise such income. The results will also include an estimate of
the annual surplus or deficit. The county shall inform the person or party
responsible for the inclusion of the system in the Master Plan of the complete
results of the feasibility study in a timely manner.
   (G)   Subject to reserves maintained by the county pursuant to division (I)
below, allocations for water and sewer service by the county shall be granted
on a first-come, first-served basis whenever public water or sewer service is
available at the property in question through service provided by the county's
transmission and/or main lines. Allocations shall only be granted upon the
execution and acceptance of a standard Public Works Agreement (PWA) or other
agreement as required by county policy, the recordation of an approved
subdivision plat and payment of all applicable charges; provided, however, that
prior to an allocation being made, all necessary approvals as may be required
by law must have been secured.
   (H)   To determine availability, the county will allocate and record
capacity or flows for single equivalent dwelling units (EDUs) at the time
building permits are approved or at the time area connection charges and any
other applicable charges are paid.
   (I)   The county may set aside allocations for water and sewer service as it
deems necessary for industrial development, educational, and governmental
purposes.
   (J)   If a property is required to connect to the county water or sewer
system as a result of § 14-303 of the Code of Public Local Laws ("the Code")
and not for reasons of health:
      (1)   The County Commissioners may establish a time to connect and shall
record in the Land Records of Carroll County for each such property the notice
to connect to the system;
      (2)   Upon petition of a property owner, the County Commissioners may
determine that it is not feasible for the property to connect to the system. In
such cases where it is determined that it is not feasible for the property to
connect, then the property shall not be required to connect to the system.
Feasibility shall be determined:
         (a)   By engineering studies prepared and certified by a professional
engineer licensed to do business in this state, if those studies determine that
it is impossible to connect the property to the system on a technical basis; or
         (b)   By a combination of engineering and financial studies, which
reflect that it would be commercially impractical to connect the property to
the system based upon costs that would be substantially greater than could be
expected at then current costs to connect other properties in the area (that
have connected to the system) and based upon the costs to connect that property
to the system versus the benefits to be derived from the services to be
provided.
      (3)   The determination of feasibility shall be in the county's sole
discretion and may be based on the effect the exemption may have on the cost of
the project or on the county's ability to provide service to other properties
in the area. The burden shall be on the property owner to establish in the
feasibility of service with clear and convincing evidence; and
      (4)   An exemption granted hereunder may exempt the property from any
front-foot benefit assessment levied or to be levied on the property which
fronts the county water or sewer main.

SEWER AND WATER CONNECTIONS
§ 51.15 PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING WATER OR SEWER EXTENSIONS BY DEVELOPERS.
   (A)   The developer shall show on his or her subdivision plat a 20-foot
utility easement on the sides and back of each lot, unless otherwise noted,
which shall be granted to the county by deed of easement. The plans for
construction and specifications of water and sewer systems shall be furnished
to the county by developers of all new subdivisions wherein water or sewer
systems are required. Developers shall have the right to select a Maryland
Licensed professional engineer (with specific background in water and sewer
design) in good standing for the preparation, at their expense, of the plans
and specifications, subject to their plans and specifications being reviewed
for approval by the county. The developer shall pay for all fees incurred in
reviewing subdivision plans as they relate to public water and sewer plans. The
developer shall be responsible to secure all necessary rights-of-way and
easements in a form satisfactory to the county. Where the proposed extension is
not a planned or projected system included in the Carroll County Master Plan at
the time of execution of a PWA and a transmission line is extended for the
benefit of developer for furnishing of service to his or her subdivision, the
developer shall pay the total cost of construction, including for the mains,
vaults, laterals, and cleanouts, for all properties abutting the new
infrastructure plus overhead charges as established by the county. Where the
proposed extension is a planned or projected system included in the Carroll
County Master Plan at the time of execution of the PWA, and transmission line
is extended for the benefit of developer for furnishing of service to his or
her subdivision, the county may contribute to the actual construction costs.
   (B)   A PWA will be required by the county outlining the conditions under
which the water and sewer facility improvements will be made. Signing of the
PWA must precede the final approval of the subdivision drawings by the county.
All public water and sewer facilities financed by a developer shall be deeded
to the county free of any liens.
   (C)   The developer shall deposit with the county a bond or other suitable
guaranty in an amount sufficient to guarantee the construction of the proposed
subdivision water and sewer facility. The developer shall make a cash deposit
with the county of an amount which represents the amount of the estimated
inspection expenses and costs, overhead, and administrative charges upon
execution of the developer's PWA. The deposit for overhead and administration
charges shall be nonrefundable. The deposit for inspection expenses and costs
shall be adjusted after the project is completed and final construction
inspection and audit is made. Any payment required because of a deficit in the
initial deposit shall be made by the developer to the county prior to his or
her receiving water or sewer service.
   (D)   Construction of water and sewer mains, including house connections
within a development, shall be designed and installed in accordance with county
specifications, as outlined in the Manual.
   (E)   Where a pressure booster station, pumping station, or other facility
is required in order to provide an area with water or sewer service, the
developer shall pay for the facility and any associated infrastructure. If, in
its sole discretion, the county determines that the facility would benefit the
existing water or sewer system, the county may negotiate with the developer and
contribute to the construction of the facility upon such terms and conditions
as the county deems proper.
   (F)   The developer shall complete all grading of the approved subdivision
prior to the start of any utility construction. This grading is to be performed
at the developer's entire cost and expense and in accordance with
specifications set forth by the county.
   (G)   The developer shall be responsible for the protection of meter vaults
and piping and shall keep the vaults at the grade set by the county. The
developer shall be responsible for the protection of manholes, surface
structures, etc., until accepted by the county.
   (H)   If revisions to the approved plans or specifications are required by
the county, such revisions to plans shall be made by the developer or its
agents or contractors. If the revisions result in the suspension of operations,
the developer shall be financially responsible for any damages caused thereby.
   (I)   Approved plans where sufficient construction has not commenced within
two years of the county's approval, are subject to re-review and any necessary
revisions are required at the developer's sole expense.
   (J)   The county shall establish a front-footage charge on the recorded lots
within the development at the established rate within the area in which the
development lies. The front-footage charge may be a front-foot benefit
assessment calculated in accordance with §
51.17 and/or a front-foot maintenance fee in accordance with §
51.24(A)(2). The front-foot maintenance charge for those properties outside the
developed area but planned to be along the new infrastructure shall be paid by
the developer equal to a ten-year period of payments as part of the PWA
agreement. Those fees shall be re-established and be the responsibility of the
owner upon connection to the system.
   (K)   Before the county enters into any PWA for the extension of a water or
sewer main to a development, which would involve an extension of the main along
the frontage of properties not previously served by the system and which
properties are not all owned by the person seeking the extension and if those
properties not previously served are required to connect, a public hearing
shall be held before the County Commissioners. The hearing shall be conducted
as though required by § 14-106(a) of the Code and shall comply with provisions
thereof. The person seeking the extension shall pay all costs of the hearing,
including the cost of notice, and shall pay an administrative charge as set by
the county. Payment shall be made in advance, and no hearing shall be held
until all of the charges required herein have been paid in full. The hearing
shall be held within 60 days of the application for the extension, and the
extension shall be accomplished within three years of the decision to extend
the water or sewer main.
(2004 Code, § 179-3) (Ord. 02-20, passed 11-21-2002; Ord. 2021-09, passed 10-
14-2021)
§ 51.16 CONSTRUCTION BY COUNTY.
   The county may construct water or sewer facilities and transmission or
interceptor lines (according to the Carroll County Master Plan) to an existing
housing development, or to a developer's subdivision; or the county may
construct water or sewer facilities anywhere, if financed through either the
General or Enterprise Funds of the county.
(2004 Code, § 179-4) (Ord. 02-20, passed 11-21-2002; Ord. 2021-09, passed 10-
14-2021)
§ 51.17 FRONT-FOOT BENEFIT ASSESSMENT CLASSIFICATIONS AND RATE STRUCTURES.
   (A)   The county shall establish minimum annual front-foot benefit
assessments for a period of years coexistent with the period of maturity of any
loans made or bonds sold for the purpose of raising moneys for the construction
of water or sewer projects. The assessment will begin no later than the
transfer (including lease) of the property or the issuance of a building
permit, whichever is first to occur for each respective lot. Moneys received
from such assessments shall be credited to the Enterprise Fund of the overall
district in which the subdivision lies and will assist in liquidating the bond
issue for the entire district's water and sewer system. For projects declared
ready for service hereafter, front-foot benefit assessments shall be separated
into the following classifications.
      (1)   Agricultural. Agricultural property shall be defined to be a large
tract of land, not otherwise classified, which is used for agricultural
purposes and is in excess of 25 acres. When a connection is made to the water
or sewer system, the property is liable for a front-foot benefit assessment for
its frontage not exceeding 300 feet. The assessment shall be at a rate equal to
75% of the residential assessment for the same project or line. If and when
development or subdivision of the property is made, reclassification by the
county will take place. Upon reclassification, the properties shall be assessed
on the classification, at the rates, and on footage which are applicable for
that project as of the date of reclassification. Reclassification is to be made
when development is commenced or when a subdivision plat is filed among the
Land Records of Carroll County, whichever is first.
      (2)   Small acreage.
         (a)   Small acreage, unimproved. Small acreage, unimproved, shall be
defined lo be an unimproved tract of land of at least seven and one-half and
not more than 25 acres in size and not otherwise classified. It shall be
subject to a front-foot benefit assessment charge at 90% of the residential
rale for the full frontage of the property if it abuts upon a water or sewer
main, in whole or in part, not to exceed 300 feet.
         (b)   Small acreage, improved. Small acreage, improved, shall be
defined to be an improved tract of land of at least seven and one-half and not
more than 25 acres in size and not otherwise classified. Small acreage,
improved includes three subclassifications as follows:
            1.   Residential. Residential property shall be defined to be
property, either lots or parcels, used for dwelling purposes and not otherwise
classified. There are two subclasses of residential property:
               a.   Single-unit residential property shall be defined as
residential property having one dwelling unit constructed or occupied on the
property. It shall be subject to a front-foot benefit assessment charge for the
full frontage of the property if it abuts upon a water and sewer main, in whole
or in part, not to exceed 300 feet and shall be assessed at 90% of the
residential assessment for the same project or line.
               b.   Multi-unit residential property shall be defined as
residential property having more than one dwelling unit constructed or occupied
on the property. It shall be subject to a front-foot benefit assessment for the
full frontage of the property if it abuts upon a water or sewer main in whole
or in part.
            2.   Commercial. Commercial property shall be defined as that
property used for trade, manufacturing, business or any other enterprise
conducted for profit; or property used for privately or publicly owned schools
or governmental purposes, except those properties classified industrial. These
properties shall be subject to a front-foot benefit assessment for the full
frontage of the property if it abuts upon the water or sewer main in whole or
in part.
            3.   Industrial. Industrial property shall be defined as that
property which is zoned I-1 or I-2 Districts, but which is not used for any of
the permitted or conditional uses allowed within those zones; or which is used
for the principal permitted uses or conditional uses of the I-1 or I-
2 Districts, but those uses are on less than 50% of the land. These properties
shall be subject to a front-foot benefit assessment for the full frontage of
the property if it abuts upon the water or sewer main in whole or in part.
      (3)   Business. Business property shall be defined as that property which
is less than seven and one-half acres in size, except as provided in division
(A)(2)(b)3. above, and which is not residential property. There are two
classifications of business property as follows:
         (a)   Commercial. Commercial property shall be defined as that
property used for trade, manufacturing, business, or any other enterprise
conducted for profit; or property used for privately or publicly owned schools
or governmental purpose, except those properties classified industrial. These
properties shall be subject to a front-foot benefit assessment for the full
frontage of the property if it abuts upon the water or sewer main in whole or
in part.
         (b)   Industrial. Industrial shall be defined as that property which
is zoned I-1 or I-2 Districts (regardless of actual use); or which is used for
any principal permitted use or for any approved conditional use of the I-1 or
I-2 Districts. Industrial is also defined to be a property, which is over seven
and one-half acres in size, which is used for the permitted or conditional uses
of the I-1 or I-2 Districts and the permitted or conditional use occupies 50%
or more of the property. These properties shall be subject to a front-foot
benefit assessment for the full frontage of the property if it abuts upon the
water or sewer main in whole or in part.
      (4)   Residential. Residential property shall be defined as property less
than seven and one-half acres in size, either a lot or parcel, which is
unimproved and zoned for residential development, or which is improved and used
for dwelling purposes and not otherwise classified. There are two subclasses of
residential property:
         (a)   Single-unit. Single-unit residential property shall be defined
as residential property having one dwelling unit constructed or occupied on the
property. It shall be subject to a front-foot benefit assessment charge for the
full frontage of the property if it abuts upon a water and sewer main in whole
or in part, not to exceed 300 feet; and
         (b)   Multi-unit. Multi-unit residential property shall be defined as
residential property having more than one dwelling unit constructed or occupied
on the property. It shall be subject to a front-foot benefit assessment for the
full frontage of the property if it abuts on a water or sewer main in whole or
in part.
   (B)   When the county establishes the annual front-foot benefit assessment
pursuant to division (A) above, it shall assess front footage on the basis of
the following schedule:
      (1)   Regular-shaped lots. A regular-shaped lot shall be defined as a lot
which has no more or less than four sides and which is either square or
rectangular in shape. A regular-shaped lot where one or more sides (in whole or
in part) abuts upon a water or sewer pipe will be assessed according to the
side or length of the property abutting the pipe. Property which does not abut
upon a water or sewer pipeline, but is connected to the public facility, will
be assessed as though the property abutted the water or sewer line.
      (2)   Corner lots. When a water or sewer pipeline abuts on all or a part
of two nonparallel sides of a corner lot, the owner will be assessed on the
short side and shall be assessed for all frontage over 175 feet on the longer
side. If, at a later date, the corner lot is subdivided, then the original lot
and each lot created will be reassessed upon recordation of a deed or plat for
the property.
      (3)   Dead-end street or road. When a lot or property is located at the
end of a street or road in which a water or sewer pipeline is laid and when
such property can be served by the public facility, the front-foot benefit
assessment shall be calculated according to the side of the lot that faces the
street, lane, road, alley, or right-of-way in which the water pipe is placed,
regardless of the length of pipe along such property, as though the property
fully fronted the line.
      (4)   Irregular-shaped lot. An irregular-shaped lot shall be defined as a
lot which is not a regular-shaped lot. When a lot served by water or sewer
pipeline is determined to be irregular in shape, the dimensions of all sides
shall be added and the result divided by the number of sides. The result shall
be the assessable front-footage.
         (a)   Panhandle-shaped lot. Panhandle-shaped lots are irregular-shaped
lots.
         (b)   Cluster-type subdivision lot. Cluster-type subdivision lots are
irregular- shaped lots.
         (c)   Cul-de-sac lot. When a water or sewer pipe line serves a cul-de-
sac lot, the front-foot assessment shall be calculated by establishing a line
between the two sides of the lot between the points where the sidelines
intersect the curve of the cul-de-sac; then by establishing a center point on
that line; and then establishing a line from the center point to the center of
the rear lot line; then by establishing a line from a point 35 feet from the
established front line along the centerline to intersect the two side lines and
measuring the distance along such line. That distance shall be the front-
footage for that property. The lots shall be deemed to be irregular-shaped
lots.
      (5)   End of street. When a lot or property is located at the end of a
street, road, or right-of-way in which a water or sewer pipeline is laid and
when such property can be served by the public facility, the front-foot benefit
assessment shall be calculated in the same manner as for irregular-shaped lots.
      (6)   Other lots not herein defined. Any lots not coining within the
above descriptions shall be assessed in the amount and in a manner determined
by the county as reasonable and fair.
   (C)   Upon the designation of a water or sewer system as an "operating
system", the county shall promptly levy front-foot benefit assessment charges
on all properties which are by law required to be assessed, subject to the
following procedures:
      (1)   Each property will be classified according to division (A) above.
      (2)   After all property is classified, a front-foot benefit assessment
shall be established for each classification. The total front-foot benefit
assessment shall not exceed an amount necessary to retire any bonds issued for
the construction of facilities which serve the property.
      (3)   After the front-foot benefit assessment is established for each
classification, the county shall determine the front-footage of each property
using the provisions of division (B) above.
      (4)   After the front-footage is determined, it shall be multiplied by
the front-foot benefit assessment which was established for the classification
which applies to that property. The result shall be the annual front-foot
benefit assessment which shall be applied to that property.
      (5)   After the front-foot benefit assessment is established, notice
shall be given each property owner of the classification into which his or her
property falls and of the amount of the front-footage established for his or
her property, and shall be given notice of the amount of the property owner's
front-foot benefit assessment.
      (6)   Notice shall be given by first-class mail to the last known address
of the property owner as reflected by the records of the Tax Collector. Notice
shall be effective upon the fifth day after deposit of the notice in the United
States mail, postage prepaid. The notice shall advise the property owner of a
date, time and place at which he or she will be heard to contest the
classification and front-footage attributable to his or her property.
      (7)   If, after notice as provided in division (C)(6) above, the property
owner does not appear at the date, time, and place for his or her hearing, the
front-foot benefit assessment shall be final and shall not be changed except by
a change in use of the property which results in a reclassification as provided
herein, or changed as a result of subdivision of the property which would
change the method of calculation of the front-footage pursuant to division (C)
above.
   (D)   The hearing provided for by division (C)(6) above shall be conducted
by the County Commissioners. At the hearing, the utility and the property owner
shall be entitled to present all evidence that is relevant and material to the
dispute. Based upon the evidence presented and the comments of the property
owner and the county, the County Commissioners shall within 30 days set an
annual front-foot benefit assessment for the subject property. The decision of
the County Commissioners shall be final and binding on the county and the
property owner.
   (E)   When the county determines that a property upon which an annual front-
foot benefit assessment has been levied is no longer within the classification
made of that property, the county shall reclassify the property. A
reclassification shall be conducted in the same manner as for an original
classification.
   (F)   When service is extended to a property which has not been previously
classified, or to property which has been subdivided since the classification
for it was established, the property owner shall agree to the levy of front-
foot benefit assessments pursuant to a contract with the county. The contract
shall provide for the classification of each property to be served, its
applicable front-footage, the rate per front-foot, and the date upon which the
levy shall be effective, which shall be no later than the transfer (including
lease) of the property, or the application for a building permit, whichever is
the first to occur for each respective lot.

12-2019; Ord. 2021-09, passed 10-14-2021)
§ 51.18 AREA CONNECTION CHARGE.
   (A)   An area connection charge is a fee for each connection made or
required to be made to the water or sewer system levied on properties required
or desiring to be served by public water or sewer. The area connection charge
is based on the water usage classification as set forth in the Manual and §
51.24, Table 1. The county shall confirm the meter size and water usage
classification for each property connected to the system. The county shall
establish standards based upon the use of the property, or the anticipated use
of the systems or both or be provided a calculation from a professional
engineer by which standards the county will confirm the meter size and water
usage classification for each property. This charge is a portion of the
financing costs of water or sewer capital improvements or master facilities,
transmission mains, or interceptors, but which may be applied to such other
purposes as the county may determine and which are consistent with law.
   (B)   When the system is designed pursuant to §
51.15, and to ensure water and sewer allocations are available, the area
connection charge shall be paid at the time of the acceptance of a PWA related
to utilities. The amount of the area connection charge shall be established by
the county.
   (C)   When the system is expanded pursuant to §
51.16, an area connection charge and a front- foot assessment shall be levied
on all properties required to connect.
   (D)   When a property is subdivided and a PWA is not required, the area
connection charge shall be paid as part of the building permit application
approval.
   (E)   An additional area connection charge shall be assessed where it is
demonstrated that there is an increase in water usage at the site in accordance
with §§
51.19 and
51.24. At no time will charges be refunded due to a downward reclassification.
Any prior payment shall be credited when calculating the additional charge.
   (F)   Area connection charges shall be due when levied.
   (G)   The County Commissioners shall review annually, more often if
necessary, the various charges established as area connection charges.
(2004 Code, § 179-6) (Ord. passed - -; Ord. 46-L, passed 5-17-2001; Ord. 02-20,
passed 11-21-2002; Ord. 2021-09, passed 10-14-2021)
§ 51.19 RECLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY.
   (A)   The county may establish a plan to ensure commercial properties are
accurately classified based on the current water usage classification outlined
in §
51.24, Table 1.
   (B)   If a property is reclassified to a higher water usage classification,
the area connection charge shall be calculated accordingly based on the
difference previously paid. At no time shall a downward reclassification occur.
   (C)   After reclassifying a property to a higher water usage classification,
the county shall notify the owner of the reclassification. The owner shall then
be required to pay the difference in area connection charges within 90 days
unless otherwise determined. At the next billing, following the notice of the
reclassification, the user shall be billed at the rates applicable, regardless
of the actual meter size.
(2004 Code, § 179-6.1) (Ord. 02-20, passed 11-21-2002; Ord. 2021-09, passed 10-
14-2021)
§ 51.20 WATER AND SEWER USAGE FEES.
   (A)   Usage rates shall consist of a "ready-to-serve" charge for each size
meter and a charge based upon actual usage. Usage shall be determined by the
amount of fluids passing the meter during the period between the last two
readings. For users without a functioning meter, a ready-to-serve charge and
gallonage charge may be computed in accordance with §
51.24(A)(1). These charges shall be billed quarterly and shall be due 30 days
thereafter.
   (B)   Water haulers shall draw public water from only the county's
designated bulk water storage tank. The use shall be metered and the hauler
shall pay for each gallon of water at a rate which shall be set and may be
amended from time to time by resolution of the County Commissioners.
(2004 Code, § 179-7) (Ord. 02-20, passed 11-21-2002; Ord. 2012-01, passed 1-31-
2012; Ord. 2021-09, passed 10-14-2021)
§ 51.21 DELINQUENT BILLS.
   (A)   All water and sewer charges as outlined in this code or adopted
otherwise, are payable when due and constitute a lien upon the property from
and after the date incurred, until paid. A late fee charge in the amount of $10
will be assessed upon all payments made after the due date, and such late fee
may be added to the subsequent bill.
   (B)   Failure to pay water or sewer charges when due shall result in the
termination of service. Service may be terminated upon five days' advance
written notice. For purposes of this section, notice may be accomplished by
posting on the property in any manner deemed sufficient by the county or by
mail. When notice is given by mail, such notice shall be sufficient and
effective at 8:00 a.m. on the fifth calendar day of ordinary mailing in the
United States Postal Service.
   (C)   In addition to, and not in substitution for, any other method of
enforcement, the county may file suit at law or in equity against the property
owner, user, or both to recover any charges or interest due the county under
the provisions of these regulations. The county shall be entitled to recover
reasonable attorneys' fees for the collection of any delinquent charges and to
recover the costs of bringing such action.

§ 51.22 UTILITY TERMINATIONS OF SERVICE.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning:
      CUSTOMER. A property owner who is responsible for the timely and complete
payment of all utility charges and all installments and surcharges arising from
utility service supplied to a residence. For purposes of this subchapter, a
tenant of rental property whose owner is contractually responsible for payment
of utility charges arising from utility service supplied to the tenant's rental
unit is not a property owner.
      UTILITY. Water and/or sewer service.
   (B)   Utility bill.
      (1)   A utility bill shall be mailed on a quarterly basis to every
customer for utility service supplied during the time period shown on the
utility bill. Each utility bill shall contain the following information:
         (a)   The time period and number of days of utility service covered by
the utility bill;

contained in the bill.
   (C)   Customer dispute.
      (1)   At any time before the date of termination of utility service for
nonpayment of the amount(s) shown on a utility bill, a notice of rejection, or
a notice of termination, a customer may dispute the correctness of all or part
of the amount(s) shown in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter
provided such requests are not the subject of a previous dispute included under
this division (C).
      (2)   The procedure for residential customer disputes shall be as
follows:
         (a)   Before the date of termination, the residential customer shall

of the hearing, shall issue a written decision formally resolving the dispute.
Its decision shall be final and binding on the utility and the customer.
      (3)   Utilization of this dispute procedure shall not relieve a
residential customer of his or her obligation to timely and completely pay all
other undisputed utility charges and/or installments and surcharges, and the
undisputed portion(s) of the amount(s) which is (are) the subject of the
present dispute. Notwithstanding division (C)(4) below, failure to timely and
completely pay all such undisputed amounts shall subject the residential
customer to termination of utility service in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter.
      (4)   Until the date of the County Commissioners' designated board or the
utility official's decision, whichever is later, the utility shall not
terminate the utility service of the residential customer and shall not issue a
notice of termination to him or her solely for nonpayment of the disputed
amount(s). If it is determined that the customer must pay some or all of the

shown on the bill or the notice by the required due date, the county shall mail
or personally serve upon the customer a notice of termination at least three
days after the payment date.
      (3)   The notice of termination shall contain the following:
         (a)   The amount to be paid;
         (b)   The date of the notice of termination; or
         (c)   The date of termination, which shall be at least five business
days from the date of the notice of termination;
         (d)   Notice that, unless the county receives complete payment of the
amount shown prior to the date of termination, the utility service shall be
terminated under this division (D);
         (e)   Notice that in lieu of paying the entire amount shown a
residential customer, prior to the date of termination, may notify the utility
that he or she disputes the correctness of all or part of the amount shown, if
all or part of the amount shown was not the subject of a previous dispute under
division (C) above; and
         (f)   Notice by the Bureau of Utilities described in division (B)
above.
      (4)   If, prior to the date of termination, the utility has not received
complete payment of the amount due or the residential customer has not notified
the utility that they dispute the correctness of all or part of the amount
shown on the notice of termination, then the utility shall terminate the
utility service.
   (E)   Limitations on termination of utility service.

this subchapter.
      (2)   Reinstatements are not required to be made on holidays, weekends or

§ 51.24 RATES.
   (A)   Usage rates and area connection charges shall be based on the water
usage classification as outlined in Table 1 and which shall be established by
the County Commissioners by resolution or ordinance:
      (1)   Non-functioning meters. Customers who do not have a functioning
meter shall pay quarterly a ready-to-serve charge and a gallonage charge which
shall be computed as follows:
         (a)   Effective with the customers' first full billing cycle after
adoption of this subchapter, customers shall pay a ready-to-serve charge equal
to the charge applicable to users having a three-inch meter. On the first
billing period after each July 1, thereafter, the ready-to-serve charge shall
increase to the charge for the next higher meter size. After a charge for the
largest single meter has been applied to the user based upon this calculation,
the previous year's ready-to-serve charge shall be doubled in each succeeding
year.
         (b)   Customers shall pay a gallonage charge equal to their estimated
use based on the meter size at which their ready-to-serve charge is calculated.
The charge shall be determined in accordance with Table 1:

*An increased area connection charge shall apply to each additional l,000
gallons per day over Rate 12.
**Exception: Age restricted communities (55 and older) receive a 60% reduction
to Rate 1 of each rate schedule. To qualify, the property shall be deeded as
age restricted. Any future change shall result in a reclassification of the
property and a balance of the fee paid.
 
      (2)   Front-foot maintenance fee.
         (a)   Effective July 1, 2001, the county shall establish an annual fee
for upkeep of water and sewerage systems which shall be made upon such
reasonable basis as the County Commissioners may determine. The fee shall be
collected annually in the same manner as are front-foot benefit assessments
against all properties having a connection to a water main or a sewer under the
operation or ownership of the county and shall be a lien against the property.
         (b)   The fee shall be based on such classifications as the county may
establish and shall be uniform throughout each system within each
classification; provided, however, that no charge for upkeep of water and
sewerage systems shall be made against any property in any year for which
property is subject to a front-foot benefit assessment.
   (B)   Reduction in charges due to water loss.
      (1)   Within 30 days of an invoice for water and sewer service, a
customer may apply for a reduction in the customer's water and sewer charges
when the customer shows that the customer did not cause, either through intent
or through negligence, a leak in the customer's water service line and presents
evidence of the repair of a leak in the customer's water service line, where
the leak existed between the customer's house or business and the meter serving
the property, or when the customer presents evidence of a repair of a major
break within the structure and associated with an insurance claim. A plumbing
permit shall be required.
      (2)   The Comptroller, upon receipt of an application for a reduction in
charges due to the loss of water as provided in division (B)(1) above, shall
review the application and decide whether to grant the reduction in the
charges.
      (3)   Where the leak spans more than one billing cycle, despite the best
efforts of the customer to have it repaired, the Comptroller may adjust the
bills.
      (4)   In determining the amount of the reduction, the Comptroller shall
consider:
         (a)   The prior use of the customer during the whole period of service
to the customer but for a period of no less than the two preceding quarters; or
         (b)   The use of similar customers if the customer has not used the
system for at least two quarters.
      (5)   In determining whether to grant the reduction, the Comptroller
shall determine if the customer knew or should have known about the leak and
grant relief only in circumstances when the customer has acted reasonably. The
decision of the Comptroller may be appealed to the County Commissioners or a
Board of Appeals appointed by the County Commissioners, and its decision is
final and not subject to further appeal. Credits shall only be considered and
granted provided a plumbing permit is completed for the repair.
      (6)   Reductions in water usage shall not be granted for the filling of
swimming pools, hot tubs, or other water storage components, including outdoor
irrigation systems.
   (C)   Other charges.
      (1)   In cases where the owner requests the meter tested for accuracy,
the owner shall pay the costs of a meter replacement should the result show
that the existing meter was accurate. If the meter is shown to be inaccurate,
the county shall replace the meter at no cost to the owner and shall adjust the
billed invoice appropriately.
      (2)   Property transfer fee. A fee of $30 shall be charged for each final
water reading related to the transfer of a property and paid as part of the
recordation of the deed.
   (D)   Removal of meter. If a property owner requests removal of the meter
because the property is vacant, condemned, or abandoned, or for any other
reason, the charge for removal shall be $50 and the subsequent charge for
reinstatement of the meter shall be $50 plus the cost of the new meter. During
the time period that the meter is removed, the base charge will not be
assessed. If the meter is not reinstated within 24 months, the property owner
shall pay the current water area connection charge, less any connection charges
previously paid when the meter is reinstalled.

pursuant to § 51.99, any person who shall injure, deface, destroy, molest,
tamper with, or otherwise damage any portion of the water and sewer system
owned by the county shall be liable to the county for the damage, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in bringing suit.
   (B)   In addition to, and not in substitution of, any other right or remedy
which the county may have hereunder or otherwise, the county may bring suit to

not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included,
unless it is a Saturday, a Sunday, or a legal holiday, in which event the

holiday. When the period of time prescribed is less than seven days,
intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays shall be excluded in the
computation.

§ 51.41 PROCEDURE.
   Notwithstanding any other ordinance or resolution to the contrary, a
developer who has been denied subdivision approval solely because there are
inadequate sewer facilities to serve a proposed subdivision as a result of a
lack of capacity in the system, may acquire, and be entitled to use, units of
capacity by complying with the following requirements:
   (A)   The developer may enter a contract with the county for the conduct of
an infiltration and inflow field study of the sewer system, or that portion of
the system, which would serve the impacted subdivision.
   (B)   The contract shall provide that the developer shall pay all costs of
the study and that the developer must provide a suitable guaranty, as
determined by the County Attorney, to ensure that he or she will, in fact, pay
for all costs of the study.
   (C)   If the study finds areas of the system which can be corrected, the
developer who paid for the study will be given the opportunity to enter a
contract with the county to pay for a remedy of the defect in the system. If
the developer shall refuse or fail to enter such a contract within 90 days of
the offer, anyone thereafter having an impacted subdivision may enter the
contract to pay for a remedy of the defect in the system provided the study
conclusions remain valid.
   (D)   The contract set forth in division (C) above shall provide that the
developer will pay all costs incurred by the county in fixing the system, or

for more lots than are represented on the plat of the impacted subdivision,
regardless of the number of lots proposed for future development in any
preliminary plan or on any subdivision plat.
   (B)   The number of allotments shall be decided by the county based upon the
actual capacity of the system, the actual use of the system, any tolerance
desired by the county to protect the public and the environment, and the
necessity to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of this
county and this state.
   (C)   No allotments arising solely as a result of a developer's actions
hereunder shall be given to anyone else until all allotments in the impacted
subdivision have been reserved and the repairs completed. Surplus allotments
may be reentered in the system and distributed in accordance with county code.

   (A)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substance, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the
opinion of the AHJ that such wastes can harm either the septage, sewage, or
leachate treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the
receiving stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or
constitute a nuisance. In forming an opinion as to the acceptability of these
wastes, the AHJ will give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the facility, materials
of construction of the facility, nature of the treatment process, capacity of
the treatment plants, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage treatment
plants, mid other pertinent factors.
   (B)   The substances are:
      (1)   Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease, or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of 50 mg/l or containing substances which may
solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32° and 100°F (0° and 38°C);
      (2)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. Properly shredded
means that no solids shall have a maximum dimension of more than two inches;
      (3)   Any waters or wastes containing strong acid iron pickling wastes,
or concentrated plating solutions whether neutralized or not;
      (4)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-
producing substances which are present after treatment of the composite waste
in concentrations exceeding those limits as may be established by the AHJ;
      (5)   Materials which exert or cause:

§ 52.016 DISCHARGE OF HARMFUL SUBSTANCES; CONSIDERATIONS FOR ACCEPTABILITY.
   (A)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters, or wastes if it appears likely in the
opinion of the Administrator that such wastes can harm either the sewers,
sewage treatment process, or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream, or can otherwise endanger life, limb, public property, or constitute a
nuisance. In forming his or her opinion as to the acceptability of these
wastes, the Administrator will give consideration to such factors as the
quantities of subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers,
materials of construction of the sewers, nature of the sewage treatment
process, capacity of the sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of
wastes in the sewage treatment plant, and other pertinent factors.
   (B)   The substances prohibited are:
      (1)   Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease, or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of 50 mg/l or containing substances which may
solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32° and 100°F (0° and 38°C);
      (2)   Any garbage that has not been properly shredded. The installation
and operation of any garbage grinder equipment with a motor of three-fourths
horsepower (0.76 hp metric) or greater shall be subject to the review and
approval of the Administrator. Properly shredded means that no solids shall
have a maximum dimension of more than two inches;
      (3)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other taste- or odor-
producing substances which are present after treatment of the composite waste
in concentrations exceeding those limits as may be established by the
Administrator;
      (4)   Any waters or wastes having a pH excess of 8.5;
      (5)   Materials which exert or cause:
         (a)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as but
not limited to fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of dissolved
solids (such as but not limited to sodium chloride and sodium sulfate);
         (b)   Excessive discoloration (such as but not limited to dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions); and/or
         (c)   BOD or chemical oxygen demand in excess of 300 mg/l, or chlorine
requirements in such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the
sewage treatment works;
      (6)   Suspended solids in excess of 300 mg/l or dissolved solids in
excess of 700 mg/l;
      (7)   Any waters or wastes or discharges from rain leaders, outside
alleyways, foundation drains, sump pumps, or any other stormwater connections;
      (8)   Any waters or wastes containing concentrations of nutrients, such
as P and TKN including other nutrients, which in the opinion of the
Administrator are detrimental to the POTW or may alone or in combination affect
the safe or continued operations of the POTW; and
      (9)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged to the POTW’s system by a customer, which waters contain the
substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in this section and which
in the judgment of the Director may have a deleterious effect upon the POTW or
the receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute
a public nuisance, the Director may:
         (a)   Require said customer to register and furnish all information
requested by the approving authority concerning their operations pertinent to
their wastes and processes;
         (b)   Require that said customer obtain all applicable permits for the
discharge of wastes;
         (c)   Reject the wastes;
         (d)   Require pretreatment of the wastewaters to an acceptable
condition for discharge to the district’s system;
         (e)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
         (f)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating
the wastes amenable to treatment; and/or
         (g)   Require that no change be made in the manufacturing process
which might affect the volume or character of wastes without prior written
approval of the approving authority.

§ 52.017 EXCESSIVE DISCHARGE.
   Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard, no industrial user shall ever increase the use of
process water or, in any other way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial
or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or in
any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the county, state, or
federal government.

§ 52.018 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGES.
   Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this chapter. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained
at the owner’s or user’s own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing
facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection shall be
submitted to the county for review and shall be approved by the county before
construction of the facility. No user who commences contribution to the POTW
after the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been
approved by the county. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to
modify the user’s facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of
the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration
and volume, and corrective actions.
(2004 Code, § 181-7) (Ord. 57, passed 2-18-1986; Ord. 57-A, passed 10-5-1993)
§ 52.019 UPSET PROVISION AND NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   An upset can be used as an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards, provided that the
industrial user meets certain conditions.
   (B)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset must demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause or
causes;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workmanlike manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to the
county within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must follow within five days): a
description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance; the period of
noncompliance, including exact dates and times, or if not corrected, the
anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue; steps being taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (C)   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (D)   Industrial users will have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.
   (E)   The industrial user shall control production or all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards
upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility
is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

§ 52.020 BYPASS NOT VIOLATING APPLICABLE PRETREATMENT STANDARDS OR
REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Allowable. An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does
not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) below.
   (B)   Notice.
      (1)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Director, if possible at least ten days before
the date of the bypass; and
      (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Director within 24
hours from the time the industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the industrial
user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Director may
waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been
received within 24 hours.
   (C)   Prohibition of bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take
enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass unless:
      (1)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or
severe property damage;
      (2)   There were not feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use
of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of
equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
      (3)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under division
(B) above.
   (D)   Approval. The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet
the three conditions listed in division (C) above.

§ 52.021 NOTIFICATION.
   (A)   All users of the POTW shall immediately notify the POTW of all
discharges that could cause problems to the POTW, including any slug loading
that would violate any of the specific prohibition of 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(b). The
notification shall include the location of the discharge, the type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
   (B)   All industrial users shall promptly notify the POTW in advance of any
substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge,
including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the
industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p).
   (C)   The industrial user shall notify the POTW, EPA Regional Waste
Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing
of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if otherwise disposed of,
would be a hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. Part 261. Such notification must
include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. Part 261, the
EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or
other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste
stream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. Industrial
users who commence discharging after October 15, 1993, shall provide the
notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the listed or
characteristic hazardous waste. Any notification under this division (C) need
be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed discharges must be submitted under 40 C.F.R. Part
403.12(j). The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of 40 C.F.R.
Part 403.12(b), (d), and (e).
   (D)   (1)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (C)
above during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms
of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified
in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
      (2)   Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in
a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
   (E)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) identifying additional characteristics of
hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the
industrial user must notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste
Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of
such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.
   (F)   In the case of any notification made under division (C) above, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
   (G)   Within five days following such a discharge, the user shall submit a
written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures that will
be taken by the user to prevent similar future discharges.
   (H)   Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss,
damage, or other liability resulting from the discharge, nor shall such
notification relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability
which may be imposed under this chapter or other applicable state or federal
law.

   (A)   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
user shall notify the county within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation.
   (B)   The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the
results of the repeat analysis to the county within 30 days after becoming
aware of the violation, except the industrial user is not required to resample
if:
      (1)   The county performs sampling at the industrial user at a frequency
of at least once per month; or
      (2)   The county performs sampling at the user between the time when the
user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the
results of this sampling.

   All analyses, including sampling techniques, submitted in support of any
application, report, evidence as required by any permit or order shall be
performed in accordance with 40 C.F.R. Part 136 and amendments thereto. Where
40 C.F.R. Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the
pollutant in question, or where the Administrator (as defined in 40 C.F.R. Part
136) determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the POTW
or other persons, approved by the Administrator (as defined in 40 C.F.R. Part

   (A)   Information and data about a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit applications, permits, and monitoring programs and from
inspections shall be available to the public unless the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of Administrator that
the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.
   (B)   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection except upon written request by the state or EPA for
uses related to this chapter. Confidential portions of a report shall be
available for use by the state or EPA in judicial review or enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics shall not be recognized as confidential information.
Information accepted by the POTW as confidential shall not be disclosed to the
public unless the user is given a ten-day notification.

§ 52.031 TREATMENT SURCHARGE.
   (A)   Generally. In addition to the annual sewer service charge under §§
51.01,
51.02, Sewer and Water Master Plan, and §§
52.045 and
52.046, there may be charged a treatment surcharge for discharging any wastes
into the system which exceed the maximum values of polluting materials
established by the surcharge formula in division (B) below. Such treatment
surcharge shall be applicable to all users that discharge directly or
indirectly into the system and shall be payable to the county annually.
   (B)   Computation of treatment surcharges.
      (1)   Treatment surcharges will be based upon the volume and
concentration of flow discharged to the system multiplied by factors expressing
the cost for treating the constituents covered by the formula.
      (2)   The amount of surcharge will be determined by the following
formula:
   Total treatment surcharge = V x 8.34 x FA(BOD – 300) V x 834 x FB(TSS – 300)
Where:
   V =   Volume of waste in millions of gallons discharged to the system, such
to be expressed to the nearest thousand gallons.
   FA =   Cost per pound (in dollars) of removing BOD constituents from the
sewage, such to be expressed to the nearest tenth of a cent as determined by
the engineer, subject to approval of the County Commissioners.
   FB =   Cost per pound (in dollars) of removing suspended solids from the
sewage, such to be expressed to the nearest tenth of a cent as determined by
the engineer, subject to the approval of the County Commissioners.
      (3)   A maximum of 300 mg/l by weight of BOD and TSS is allowable without
payment of surcharge.
      (4)   Should it become necessary to place a surcharge on other
constituents, charges will be computed in the same manner.
      (5)   Until a cost can be established for the treatment of each
constituent at treatment plants operated by the county or Baltimore City, the
cost factor may be based upon the average cost of treating those constituents
at other plants having like or similar processes and effluent requirements.

PRIVATE STREETS
§ 92.045 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to prescribe and adopt rules and standards
for acceptance by the county of private roads into the county public roads
system and to allow for the inclusion of water and sewer service and/or storm
drainage.
(2004 Code, § 197-20) (Ord. 98-01, passed 11-18-1998; Ord. 02-04, passed 3-14-
2002)
§ 92.046 APPLICABILITY.
   This subchapter shall be effective immediately upon its final adoption by
the County Commissioners, and for the purpose of this subchapter, no private
roads or streets which have been laid out or established as such after June 1,
1962, shall be considered eligible for acceptance, construction or maintenance
in the county system of public roads under the provisions of this subchapter.
(2004 Code, § 197-21) (Ord. 98-01, passed 11-18-1998)
§ 92.047 PUBLIC NOTICE.
   In order to exercise the powers conferred by this subchapter, there must
first be:
   (A)   A petition by a majority of the property owners whose property abuts
or has direct access to the road to be improved (“the affected property
owners”) in which they request the necessary improvement or construction;
   (B)   Public hearing upon the petition after ten days notice in a newspaper
regularly published in the county;
   (C)   Approval of said petition by the County Commissioners; and
   (D)   The passage of an appropriate ordinance setting forth the improvements
or construction to be made, the property owners affected, and all material
terms of the annual benefit assessments to pay the portion of the cost to be

§ 92.048 PUBLIC HEARING.
   At the public hearing, the Director of Public Works, or a designated
representative shall:
   (A)   Review the details of the improvements necessary to accept the road
into the county roads system, which details shall have been documented and sent
to each affected property owner, along with the notice of the public hearing,
and discuss the method and procedure for determining annual benefit
assessments, together with the amount of the assessment for each property owner
whose property abuts or has direct access to the road;
   (B)   Conduct a vote of the affected property owners present, by ballot, to
determine whether they desire the county to make the road improvements and
accept the road as petitioned. Votes by proxy of property owners may be
considered if properly executed and notarized. Any property owner not present
or who does not register a vote by notarized proxy shall be deemed to have
voted in the negative;
   (C)   Announce that each individual lot that abuts or has direct access to
the road to be improved shall receive one vote. If such individual lot has
several owners and they are unable to reach a unanimous agreement as to how to
vote, that lot shall be considered to have voted “no”; and
   (D)   Establish the status of the right-of-way required and as set forth in
§
92.050.
(2004 Code, § 197-23) (Ord. 98-01, passed 11-18-1998; Ord. 02-04, passed 3-14-
2002)
§ 92.049 APPROVAL OF PETITION.
   The County Commissioners may approve the petition, provided that the
Director of the Department of Public Works, or its successor agency, has
certified:
   (A)   That an acceptable deed has been recorded in the Land Records of
Carroll County conveying the right-of-way, road, or street to the county for
public use and that a plat of the street has been recorded showing the location
and area of the land acquired; and
   (B)   That 66-2/3% of the group of property owners who will be assessed for
the improvements have voted at the public hearing in favor of a request that
the county proceed with the improvements.

§ 92.051 SEQUENCE OF IMPROVEMENT.
   The sequence of improvement of private roads given final approval by

§ 92.052 ANNUAL BENEFIT ASSESSMENTS.
   In determining the amount and method of the annual benefit assessments:
   (A)   No benefit assessment shall exceed the assessed value of the property,
excluding any improvements thereon, after giving effect to benefits accruing
thereto from the improvement for which the property is being assessed;
   (B)   Annual benefit assessments shall be levied with interest at the same
rate as borne by the last capital improvement bonds issued by the county. Such
levy against properties for improvement of private roads shall amortize the
cost over a period of not more than ten years;
   (C)   The method of cost calculation may be assessed differently than stated
hereafter in this subchapter, provided that said calculation is agreed upon
unanimously among affected homeowners;
   (D)   Property owners whose properties abut or access the improved road by
private driveway, private road, or use-in-common driveway shall be liable
collectively for 100% of the costs of construction and improvement, including
such overhead costs as engineering, advertising, and legal expenses;
   (E)   The total of all costs determined to be the benefit assessment shall
be divided among the affected property owners. When the county establishes the
annual front-foot benefit assessment, it shall be based on assessed value of
land only;
   (F)   After the road is constructed and taken into the county system, if
abutting land is subdivided within the assessment period, the property owner
shall agree to the levy of front-foot benefit assessments against the
properties being subdivided pursuant to a contract with the county prior to
recordation of a subdivision plat or deed creating an offconveyance. The
contract shall provide for the classification of each property served, its
applicable assessment of the land value only (not to include improvements);
   (G)   Upon the collection of the cost of road construction from the owner or
owners of land subdivided as provided in division (F) above, where the cost
exceeds the original assessment for the property being divided, the County
Commissioners, immediately after the expiration of the assessment period, shall
reduce the amount of remaining assessments proportionately among the owners of
the remaining lands abutting on the road; and
   (H)   The method of determining individual lot assessments may be changed if
the following conditions are met:
      (1)   There is unanimous agreement of all owners of affected properties,
in writing; and
      (2)   The agreement binds successors in title, is approved by the County
Commissioners, and is recorded in the Land Records of Carroll County.

§ 92.053 COLLECTION OF ANNUAL BENEFIT ASSESSMENT.
   The County Commissioners shall, on any private road constructed or improved

taxes for the county any annual benefit assessments due thereon on or before
January 1 of the following year for collection in the same manner as other
property taxes. Such annual benefit assessments shall be included on state and
county property tax bills. Until paid, annual benefit assessments shall be a
first lien upon the property against which they are assessed, subject only to
prior state and county taxes. A public record of existing liens and charges
against any property for annual benefit assessments shall be kept among the
Land Records of Carroll County.

Commissioners, the County Commissioners, following notice and an opportunity to
cure, may cause such work to be done. In such a case, the owner or permittee
shall reimburse the County Commissioners the cost thereof within 30 days after

the County Commissioners make the request, in which case no such payment shall
be required, except to the extent otherwise required by applicable law. An
owner shall be given not less than 48 hours advance notice to arrange for such
temporary wire changes.
   (E)   Compliance with applicable laws and standards.
      (1)   All excavations, construction, maintenance, and other work related
to a facility in a public street, including work by the County Commissioners in
its capacity as a utility, shall be performed in accordance with all applicable
law and regulations and with §§
92.001,
92.015 through
92.030,
92.045 through
92.054, and
92.065 through
92.067, including, where applicable, the Occupational Safety and Health Act of
1970, as amended; the National Electrical Safety Code, prepared by the National
Bureau of Standards; and the National Electrical Code of the National Board of
Fire Underwriters.
      (2)   All of an owner’s facilities shall be installed in accordance with
good engineering practices, and maintained in a safe, suitable, and substantial
condition in good order and repair.
      (3)   All safety practices required by law shall be used during
construction, maintenance, and repair of an owner’s facilities.
      (4)   An owner or permittee shall at all times employ ordinary care and
shall use commonly accepted methods and devices for preventing failures and
accidents that are likely to cause damage, injury, or nuisance to the public.
   (F)   Coordination of excavations.
      (1)   On the first day of October, each utility shall prepare and submit
to the Department a plan, in a format specified by the Department, that shows
all reasonably foreseeable excavations in the paved portion of the public
streets anticipated to be done in the next three years, or a statement that no
excavations are proposed. The utility shall report to the Department promptly
any changes in the plan as soon as those changes become reasonably foreseeable.
The Department shall make the specified format available to utilities no less
than 60 days before the date the plan is due.
      (2)   The Department may disclose information contained in a three-year
plan to another utility only on a need-to-know basis in order to facilitate
coordination and avoid unnecessary excavation. If a utility clearly and
appropriately identifies information contained in the plan as proprietary, a
trade secret, or otherwise protected from disclosure, then to the maximum
extent permissible under federal, state, and local laws applicable to public
records, the Department may not disclose that information to the public. If the
Department determines that information is not clearly or appropriately
identified, the Department shall notify the utility that the Department intends
to disclose the requested information unless ordered otherwise by a court.
      (3)   The Department shall review the three-year plans submitted by
utilities and identify conflicts and opportunities for coordination of
excavations in the paved public streets. Each applicant shall coordinate, to
the extent practicable, with each potentially affected owner and permittee to
minimize disruption in the public streets.
      (4)   If utilities propose to excavate in the same paved public streets
within a three-year period, the Department shall issue permits for the work in
a manner that maximizes coordination and minimizes the total period of
construction.
      (5)   If electric or telephone utilities are to be placed underground in
a new subdivision, the lead utility shall give written notice to known
utilities in the area within which the property is located. Such notice shall
be given at least 48 hours before commencement of trenching construction.
      (6)   The County Commissioners may require joint use of the property,
structures, and appurtenances of each utility located in the public streets,
alleys, and public places, insofar as such joint use may be reasonable and
practicable, adheres to good engineering practices, and does not conflict with
applicable federal and state law. This provision shall not affect any right of
any utility to charge for the use of its facilities pursuant to applicable law.
(2004 Code, § 92-5) (Ord. 08-11, passed 12-18-2008)
§ 92.085 WARRANTY, INDEMNIFICATION, AND SECURITY.
   (A)   Warranty and liability.
      (1)   For a period of two years after satisfactory completion of work in
a public street, the owner and permittee warrant and guarantee the quality of
the work performed and are responsible for maintaining the site free from any
defects resulting from the quality of work and, in the event of such defects,
for repairing or restoring the site to a condition that complies with all
applicable law and regulations and §§
92.001,
92.015 through
92.030,
92.045 through
92.054, and
92.065 through
92.067. Any repair or restoration during the warranty period shall cause the
warranty period to run for one additional year beyond the original two-year
period.
      (2)   The issuance of a permit or any inspection, repair, suggestion,
approval, or acquiescence of any person affiliated with the County
Commissioners does not relieve the owner or permittee from the warranty and
liability provisions of this section, the indemnification provisions of
division (B) below, or any other term or condition of this subchapter.
   (B)   Indemnification.
      (1)   An owner and permittee and their successors and assigns shall
indemnify, defend, protect, and hold harmless the County Commissioners,
including its officers, agents, and employees, from and against:
         (a)   All claims allegedly arising directly or indirectly from any
act, omission, or negligence of the owner, the permittee, their subcontractors,
or the officers, agents, or employees of any of them, relating to the permit or
the work authorized by the permit; and
         (b)   All damage to county property, including damage to county public
streets and public works, arising directly or indirectly from any act,
omission, or negligence of the owner or the permittee, their subcontractors, or
the officers, agents, employees of any of them, relating to the permit or the
work authorized by the permit, except that this division (B)(1)(b) does not
apply to gradual degradation or ordinary wear and tear of roads or public
streets.
      (2)   Each owner and permittee has an immediate and independent
obligation to defend the County Commissioners from any claims that actually or
potentially fall within the indemnity provision, even if the allegations are or
may be groundless, false, or fraudulent.
      (3)   The County Commissioners have a cause of action for indemnity
against each owner and permittee for any costs the County Commissioners may
incur as a result of defending or satisfying any claims that arise from or in
connection with the permit, except for claims resulting directly from the
negligence or willful misconduct of the County Commissioners.
      (4)   The indemnification obligations assumed under the permit survive
expiration of the permit and completion of the work authorized by the permit.
(2004 Code, § 92-6) (Ord. 08-11, passed 12-18-2008)
§ 92.086 COMPLAINTS.
   (A)   Utility complaint procedures. A utility shall establish and file with
the Department written procedures for receiving, acting on, and resolving
complaints. The utility shall investigate a complaint and notify the resident
in writing within ten days after receipt of the complaint of the results of the
investigation and of any proposed action or resolution. The utility shall also
notify the resident of the right to file a complaint with the Department.
   (B)   County complaint procedures.
      (1)   A resident may initiate a review of a complaint previously made to
a utility by filing with the Department the complaint and any associated
correspondence or other papers.
      (2)   If the Department determines after a review of the complaint and
other papers that there is no violation of this subchapter, the Department
shall so notify the resident and the utility. Otherwise, the Department may
require the resident and utility to submit further statements in support of
their respective positions.
      (3)   The utility or resident may request in his or her statements that
the Department conduct informal discussion of the complaint. If so requested,
the Department shall conduct an informal discussion, in person or by
teleconference. Promptly thereafter, the Department shall issue a written
decision.
      (4)   If the Department determines that the utility violated a provision
of this subchapter, the Department may employ one or more of the enforcement
measures allowed by this subchapter.
(2004 Code, § 92-7) (Ord. 08-11, passed 12-18-2008)
§ 92.087 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Enforcement procedures and remedies.
      (1)   If the County Commissioners determine that an owner or permittee
has failed to perform any obligation under this subchapter or has failed to
perform in a timely manner, the County Commissioners may:
         (a)   Make a written demand on the owner or permittee that it remedy
the violation;
         (b)   Issue a stop work order pursuant to division (B) below; and/or
         (c)   Issue an order to cure pursuant to division (C) below.
      (2)   If the violation is not remedied or in the process of being
remedied to the satisfaction of the County Commissioners within a reasonable
time period following a written demand or order to cure, the County
Commissioners may:
         (a)   Enforce the provisions of this subchapter through injunctive
proceedings, an action for specific performance, or any other appropriate
proceedings;
         (b)   Issue a civil citation and impose a penalty not to exceed
$1,000, pursuant to the provisions of §
3-811 of the Code of Public Local Laws;
         (c)   Assess against the owner or permittee any monetary damages
provided for such violation in any agreement between the owner or permittee and
the County Commissioners;
         (d)   Assess and withdraw the amounts specified above from the owner’s
or permittee’s performance bond or other applicable security instrument;
         (e)   Revoke any franchise or permit held by the owner or permittee as
provided in his, her, or its franchise agreement or permit; or
         (f)   Pursue any legal or equitable remedy available under any
applicable law or under any agreement between the owner or permittee and the
County Commissioners.
      (3)   Remedies available to the County Commissioners for franchise
violations under this subchapter and under a franchise agreement shall be
construed, except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, as cumulative and
not alternative.
      (4)   If civil penalties are assessed against an owner or permittee under
this subchapter, the owner or permittee is not subject to liquidated damages
payable to the County Commissioners for the same violation. If liquidated
damages payable to the County Commissioners are assessed against an owner or
permittee, the owner or permittee is not subject to civil penalties under this
subchapter for the same violation. If the County Commissioners seek actual
damages for any violation, any civil penalties or liquidated damages recovered
by the County Commissioners for the same violation, including civil penalties
or liquidated damages for partial time periods included in a longer time period
for which actual damages are sought, shall be offset against any actual damages
recovered by the County Commissioners.
      (5)   An owner or permittee shall pay civil penalties or liquidated
damages within 30 days after receipt of notice from the County Commissioners.
      (6)   The filing of an appeal to any regulatory body or court does not
stay or release the obligations of an owner or permittee under a franchise
agreement and applicable law.
      (7)   An assessment of liquidated damages or civil penalties does not
constitute a waiver by the County Commissioners of any other right or remedy
they may have under a franchise or applicable law, including the right to
recover from the owner or permittee any additional damages, losses, costs, and
expenses, including actual attorney’s fees, that were incurred by the
franchisors or the County Commissioners by reason of or arising out of the
violation. However, the County Commissioners’ election of liquidated damages
under a franchise agreement shall take the place of any right to obtain actual
damages over and above the payment of any amounts otherwise due. This provision
may not be construed to prevent the County Commissioners from electing to seek
actual damages for a continuing violation if they have imposed civil penalties
or liquidated damages for an earlier partial time period for the same
violation, subject to the offset specified in division (A)(4) above.
   (B)   Stop work order.
      (1)   The Director may issue a stop work order, impose conditions on a
permit, or suspend or revoke a permit if the Director determines that:
         (a)   A person has violated applicable law or regulations, §§
92.001,
92.015 through
92.030,
92.045 through
92.054, and
92.065 through
92.067, or any term, condition, or limitation of a permit; or
         (b)   Work in the public streets poses a hazardous situation or
constitutes a public nuisance, public emergency, or other threat to the public
health, safety, or welfare.
      (2)   The Director shall notify the permittee of action taken under
division (B)(1) above by a written, electronic, or facsimile communication, and
the permittee shall comply immediately after receipt of the notice.
      (3)   A stop work order shall state the conditions under which work may
be resumed and shall be posted at the site.
   (C)   Order to cure.
      (1)   The Director may order an owner or permittee who has violated
applicable law, regulations, §§
92.001,
92.015 through
92.030,
92.045 through
92.054, and
92.065 through
92.067, or any term, condition, or limitation of a permit, to cure the
violation within the time specified in the order.
      (2)   An order issued under this section shall warn the person that a
failure to comply within the time specified makes the person subject to the
imposition of a civil fine under division (A)(2)(b) above and to liability for
any costs incurred by the Department to effectuate compliance.
      (3)   If the owner or permittee fails, neglects, or refuses to comply
with an order issued under this section, the Director may complete the
excavation or other work in the public streets in any manner the Director deems
appropriate, and the owner or permittee shall compensate the Department for all
costs incurred, including costs for administration, construction, consultants,
equipment, inspection, notification, remediation, repair, and restoration. The
cost of the work may be deducted from any bond or other security instrument of
the owner or permittee. The Department’s completion of an excavation or other
work in the public streets does not relieve the owner or permittee from the
warranty and liability provisions of §
92.085(A), the indemnification provisions of §
92.085(B), or any other term or condition of this subchapter.
(2004 Code, § 92-8) (Ord. 08-11, passed 12-18-2008)
§ 92.088 COSTS.
   Except where otherwise expressly stated herein, all costs incurred by an
owner or permittee in connection with any provision of this subchapter shall be
borne by the owner or permittee.

CONTROLLED-ACCESS HIGHWAYS
§ 92.100 DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   Any words not defined herein shall have their generally accepted
meaning.
   (B)   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      COLLECTOR STREET. A street whose primary function is to carry traffic
between local and arterial streets and serve the collection function for a
system of access roads. It is not intended to serve the immediate access needs
of individual properties. It is a public highway, usually serving moderate
traffic volumes.
      CONTROLLED-ACCESS HIGHWAY. A highway designated as such herein; or a
highway hereafter designated by the County Commissioners in accordance with
this subchapter.
      EXISTING HIGHWAY. A highway actually open to traffic as of the date of
adoption of this subchapter.
      EXPRESSWAY. A major highway of two or more traffic lanes in each
direction that is designed to eliminate principal traffic hazards and has the
following characteristics:
         (a)   A median divider separating opposing traffic lanes to eliminate
head-on collisions and sideswiping;
         (b)   Grade separation structures to eliminate the conflict of cross
streams of traffic at each intersection;
         (c)   Points of entrance and exit limited to predetermined locations;
         (d)   Vertical curves long enough to provide long sight distances; and
         (e)   Shoulders wide enough to permit vehicles to stop or park out of
traffic lanes. An expressway is a controlled-access highway.
      FREEWAY. Same meaning as CONTROLLED- ACCESS HIGHWAY.
      MAJOR ARTERIAL HIGHWAYS. High-traffic type highways, other than
expressways, which are on a continuous route, with a high degree of continuity,
and which serve as the major carriers of through traffic for any given
corridor. Arterials are primarily designed for through traffic but
consideration is also made for access to adjacent properties. Partial control
of access can be used to give preference to through traffic, but at grade
intersections, channelizations or interchanges may be provided.
      PARKWAY. Same meaning as CONTROLLED- ACCESS HIGHWAY.
      PROPOSED HIGHWAY. A planned highway not open to traffic.
(2004 Code, § 99-1) (Ord. 99-10, passed 7-1-1999)

   (B)   If, in the opinion of the county or the County Planning Commission, an
existing or proposed highway ought to be designated a controlled-access highway
or an expressway:
      (1)   The matter shall be referred to the Director of Public Works for
review and evaluation by the Department of Public Works;
      (2)   The Director of Public Works shall cause a study and analysis to be
prepared which reviews present and anticipated traffic conditions in the area
affected by the proposed controlled-access highway, the anticipated cost to
build or to designate the highway as a controlled-access highway, and a
recommendation. The report shall be completed within 90 days and submitted to
the county and the Planning Commission;
      (3)   The Planning Commission shall review the report of the Director
and, after giving at least 20 days notice with a fair summary of the report of

comments of the public will be heard, and within 60 days of its receipt of the
report of the Department shall render its report and recommendation to the
county;
      (4)   The county will review the recommendations of both the Department
and the Planning Commission and may conduct further hearings on the subject,
but shall not be required to conduct further hearings;
      (5)   Upon completion of its review, the county may designate the highway
a controlled-access highway or an expressway; and
      (6)   The decision of the county shall be final and not subject to
further review, despite any irregularities of procedure.
(2004 Code, § 99-2) (Ord. 99-10, passed 7-1-1999)
§ 92.102 EFFECT OF DESIGNATION.
   (A)   If the county designates a highway to be a controlled-access highway
or an expressway, from the time of designation, there shall be no further
access allowed except as herein authorized.
   (B)   If previously authorized by the county, curb cuts or driveways,
existing at the time of designation, shall continue to have access to the
controlled-access highway until such time as the right of access is purchased
through sale or condemnation, provided that the existing access shall not be
enlarged or extended.
   (C)   The county may permit access to the controlled- access highway based
upon procedures to be established by the Director and the Director of Land Use,
Planning, and Development, or its successor agency, but only from and to major
arterial highways or collector streets.
   (D)   Owners of property which abuts a controlled-access highway shall not
accrue any rights to access to the controlled-access highway by virtue of
ownership of the abutting land unless the controlled-access highway is owned as
an easement and not in-fee.
(2004 Code, § 99-3) (Ord. 99-10, passed 7-1-1999)
§ 92.103 ELIMINATION OF ACCESS.
   (A)   If a proposed highway is declared to be a controlled-access highway,
then there shall be no right of access by any abutting owner unless the right
to access is specifically preserved in a deed for the property (which is to be
used as the controlled-access highway), and no person, including an owner,
shall have the right of access to or from the abutting land to or from the
highway.
   (B)   No county employee, agent, or official may grant access to or from a
controlled-access highway to an abutting owner; access shall be limited
strictly to those situations authorized pursuant to §
92.102(C).
   (C)   If an existing highway is declared to be a controlled-access highway,
then the owners of any abutting properties denied total access to or from the
highway shall be entitled to relief:
      (1)   The county may provide access to the abutting property through
other properties or over other public roads to allow ingress to and egress from
the abutting property for vehicles reasonably expected to use the property
under then current zoning:
         (a)   At its then current use; or
         (b)   If the property owner is able to establish at a hearing before
the County Commissioners that a higher and better use could be made of the
property under then current zoning, then the access provided shall be
sufficient to allow that use, subject, however, to a contribution from the
abutting owner for expenses the abutting owner would be or would have been
required to pay for public improvements to gain such access.
      (2)   The county may purchase, either by sale or condemnation the
abutting owner’s right of access.
      (3)   The county may effect a combination of either division (C)(1) or
(C)(2) hereof.

No person may be granted a franchise without having entered into a franchise
agreement with the County Commissioners pursuant to this chapter.
   (B)   Application for initial franchise.
      (1)   A written application shall be filed with CCRC for the grant of an
initial cable franchise. To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of the
application shall be submitted together with ten copies. All applications shall
include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of all
applicants with respect to the application. The written application for a cable
franchise submitted to CCRC shall contain, at a minimum, the following
information:
         (a)   The name, address, and form of business (corporation,
partnership, etc.) of the applicant;
         (b)   Ownership and control of the applicant, including the names and
addresses of all entities with 5% or more ownership interest in the applicant.
Where such owners are not individuals, the applicant shall provide the same
information with respect to their ownership and control, and so on until the
ultimate owners are reached;
         (c)   Information showing the applicant’s technical ability to
construct and operate the proposed system;
         (d)   Information showing the applicant’s financial qualifications to
construct and operate the proposed system;
         (e)   Information showing the applicant’s legal qualifications to
construct and operate the proposed system;
         (f)   A summary of any construction activity within the county
anticipated by the applicant in connection with the proposed cable system,
including a projected schedule for completion of such construction (which shall
not be binding, except to the extent it may be incorporated into a franchise
agreement); and
         (g)   The applicant may submit any other information it considers
relevant to its application.
      (2)   The applicant shall submit with its application such application
fee as may be specified from time to time by CCRC, based on the anticipated
costs incurred by the County Commissioners in negotiating and granting the
proposed franchise.
      (3)   CCRC may at any time request, and the applicant shall provide, such
additional information as the County Commissioners reasonably deem relevant to
the County Commissioners’ consideration of the application.
   (C)   Franchise agreement. Within a reasonable time after submission of an
application, the County Commissioners shall enter into negotiations with the
applicant as to the terms and conditions of a franchise agreement.
   (D)   Public hearing. The County Commissioners may hold a public hearing to
hear comments on a franchise application. The County Commissioners shall give
the public at least 15 days advance notice of any such hearing by publishing a
notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
   (E)   Reimbursement of application costs. After an initial franchise is
granted, the applicant shall remit to the County Commissioners the amount of
any actual costs incurred by the County Commissioners over and above the
application fee referred to in division (B)(2) above, within 30 days after
receipt of an invoice from the County Commissioners specifying such costs.
   (F)   Franchise conditions. Every cable franchise granted pursuant to this
chapter shall be subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   A cable franchise shall be subject to all applicable federal,
state, and local laws, rules and regulations, ordinances and resolutions,
including those governing the monitoring and tapping of cablecast signal
privacy, and the penalties for violation thereof.
      (2)   A cable franchise shall be subject to all lawful exercise of the
police power of the franchisors and CCRC.
      (3)   A cable franchise shall be subject to the right of the franchisors
and CCRC:
         (a)   To terminate the same for misuse, or failure to comply with any
material provisions of this chapter, or any federal, state, or local laws,
ordinances, rules, or regulations, or failure to comply with any material
provision of the franchise agreement; and
         (b)   To control and regulate the use of the public streets.
      (4)   If a franchise terminates, and the franchisee does not have
authority independent of that franchise to maintain and operate its system in
the county’s public streets, then, to the extent not inconsistent with 47
U.S.C. § 541(b)(3), the County Commissioners may order the franchisee to remove
its facilities from the franchise area within a reasonable period of time as
determined by the County Commissioners. In that case, any property owned by the
franchisee and not removed from the public streets within six months from the
date of the County Commissioners’ order shall be considered to have been
abandoned by the franchisee and will become the property of the franchisors to
do with as they may choose. If a franchisee fails to remove its facilities as
provided in this division (F)(4), CCRC may have the removal done at the
franchisee’s expense, and any cost incurred by CCRC or the franchisors in
removing the franchisee’s facilities from the county’s public streets or
property will be a claim against the franchisee.
      (5)   In order that the franchisors and CCRC may exercise their rights
herein upon termination of the franchise, a franchisee shall not make, execute,
or enter into any deed, deed of trust, mortgage, contract, conditional sales
contract, or any loan, lease pledge, sale, gift, or any other agreement
concerning any of the rights, facilities, or property, real or personal, of the
cable system without prior approval of CCRC and upon CCRC’
      (6)   The grant of a franchise by the franchisors shall be nonexclusive
and shall be for a term as provided in the franchise agreement, which shall not
exceed 15 years.
      (7)   A franchisee shall, where practicable, use existing towers, poles,
conduits, lines, cables, and other equipment and facilities. Copies of all
agreements for the use of such equipment and facilities with public utilities
operating within the county shall be maintained on file by the public utility
and made available for review by CCRC upon reasonable notice. Where such
facilities are not reasonably available from public utilities, a franchisee
shall have the right to erect and maintain its own poles, conduits, and related
facilities in the public streets as may be necessary for the proper
construction, installation, and maintenance of its cable system, subject to
applicable law.
      (8)   Nothing in a franchise agreement shall be deemed to waive the
requirements of the various codes, laws, and ordinances of the county regarding
permits, zoning, fees to be paid, or right-of-way management, or to take the
place of any general license or permit required for the privilege of
transacting or carrying on a business within the county as required by the
ordinances and laws of the County Commissioners, or for attaching devices to
poles or other structures, whether owned by the franchisors or a private
entity, or for excavating or performing other work in or along the public
streets.
      (9)   A franchisee shall not oppose intervention by the franchisors or
CCRC in any suit or proceeding pertaining to the cable system to which the
franchisee is a party.
      (10)   No reference herein, or in any franchise agreement, to “public
streets” shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by the franchisors
or CCRC that its interests or other right to control the use of such property
is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a franchisee shall be
deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the franchisors and
as the franchisors may have the undisputed right and power to give.
   (G)   Termination on account of certain assignments or appointments.
      (1)   To the extent not prohibited by the United States Bankruptcy Code,
any franchise shall be deemed revoked 120 calendar days after an assignment for
the benefit of creditors or the appointment of a receiver or trustee to take
over the business of a franchisee, whether in a receivership, reorganization,
bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of creditors, or other action or
proceeding; provided, however, that a franchise may be reinstated at the
franchisors’ sole discretion if, within that 120-day period:
         (a)   Such assignment, receivership, or trusteeship has been vacated;
or
         (b)   Such assignee, receiver, or trustee has fully complied with the
terms and conditions of this chapter and the applicable franchise agreement and
has executed an agreement, approved by a court of competent jurisdiction, under
which it assumes and agrees to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
chapter and the applicable franchise agreement, and such other conditions as
may be established or as are required by applicable law.
      (2)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of foreclosure or other
judicial sale of any of the facilities, equipment, or property of a franchisee,
the franchisors may revoke the franchise, following a public hearing before
CCRC, by serving notice on the franchisee and the successful bidder, in which
event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will be
revoked and will terminate 30 calendar days after serving such notice, unless:
         (a)   The franchisors have approved the transfer of the franchise to
the successful bidder; and
         (b)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the
franchisors to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise
agreement and this chapter, and such other conditions as may be established or
as are required pursuant to this chapter or a franchise agreement.

§ 111.03 SYSTEM PERFORMANCE AND SERVICE.
   (A)   System performance.
      (1)   A franchisee shall comply with all applicable technical standards
regarding operation of the cable system, including but not limited to the
technical standards set forth in 47 C.F.R. § 76.601.
      (2)   Whenever it is necessary to shut off or interrupt service for the
purpose of making repairs, adjustments, or installations, a franchisee shall do
so at times as will cause the least amount of inconvenience to its subscribers,
and unless such interruption is unforeseen and immediately necessary, it shall
give reasonable notice thereof to its subscribers.
   (B)   Interconnection.
      (1)   A franchisee shall design its cable system so that it may be
interconnected with other cable systems or similar communications systems in
the county and adjacent jurisdictions for purposes of sharing public,
educational, and governmental access programming or other governmental
transmissions such as emergency alerts.
      (2)   Upon the request of CCRC, the franchisee shall initiate good-faith
negotiations with any other franchisee or operator of a similar communications
system to determine the practical economic feasibility of the establishment and
operation of an interconnection link and how costs may be shared equally by
such franchisees or operators for both construction and operation of such a
link.
      (3)   The interconnection shall be made within 60 days of an order by
CCRC to proceed unless, for good cause shown by the franchisee, a reasonable
time extension is granted by CCRC.
   (C)   Parental control. A franchisee shall ensure that any pay-per-view
programming can only be activated by the positive action of a subscriber using,
for example, a private identification number or other individual selection
procedure. A franchisee shall ensure that means are available to enable
subscribers to block out audio and video on any undesired channels on the cable
system.
   (D)   Service to multiple dwelling units. No franchisee shall demand the
exclusive right to serve a person or location as a condition of extending cable
service. No franchisee shall be required to pay any fee to a building owner to
provide cable service to any member of the public in any privately owned
buildings in the county. Any disputes between a franchisee and a building owner
shall be heard and resolved by the CCRC. Each franchisee shall report to the
CCRC any building owner who requests a fee from the franchisee as a condition
for allowing the franchisee to install a cable system service in the owner’s
building.
   (E)   Continuity of cable service.
      (1)   If a franchisee transfers its cable system, the franchisee shall
cooperate with the County Commissioners and the transferee in maintaining
continuity of service to all subscribers, such that, to the extent reasonably
possible, subscribers receive continuous uninterrupted service.
      (2)   If a cable franchise terminates, the franchisee shall cooperate
with the County Commissioners and any other providers of cable service in
maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers, such that, to the extent
reasonably possible, subscribers receive continuous uninterrupted service. This
provision shall not be construed to require the franchisee to continue to
provide cable service after the termination date.

§ 111.04 RATE REGULATION.
   The franchisors reserve the right to regulate all rates and charges except
to the extent they are prohibited from doing so by law.

§ 111.05 FRANCHISE FEE.
   (A)   Payment of franchise fee.
      (1)   During the term of any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter,
the franchisee shall pay to franchisors for the use of the public streets, as
well as the maintenance, improvements, and supervision thereof, an annual
franchise fee as specified in the franchise agreement.
      (2)   Each payment shall be accompanied by supporting information,
verified by an officer of the franchisee, containing a detailed, accurate
statement of the franchisee’s gross revenues and the computation of the payment
amount, in the form and containing the information specified in the format in
Table 111.05 below.

   (B)   No accord or satisfaction. No acceptance of any payment shall be
construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claims CCRC or
the franchisors may have for further or additional sums due or payable as a
franchise fee under the franchise agreement or for the performance of any other
obligation of the franchisee hereunder, or as an acknowledgment that the amount
paid is the correct amount due.
   (C)   Late fees and interest.
      (1)   Any unpaid fees shall be subject to interest charges computed from
the due date, at an annual rate equal to the commercial prime interest rate of
the County Commissioners’ primary depository bank during the period such unpaid
amount is owed.
      (2)   If any franchise fee payment is not made on or before the required
date, the franchisee shall pay a late payment charge of 5% of the amount
originally due, as a cost incidental to the enforcing of the franchise, in
addition to the interest charge specified in division (C)(1) above. This charge
shall be applicable only with respect to late payment of an undisputed amount.
If it is later determined as a result of a dispute or audit that there was an
underpayment on a payment that was timely made, the 5% charge shall not be
applicable.
   (D)   Discounts on bundled services. For purposes of calculating franchise
fee payments, any discount reflected in an aggregated bill for services which
include cable services and noncable services will be allocated proportionately
to the bundled services.
(2004 Code, § 93-5) (Ord. 41, passed 4-28-1983; Ord. 08-10, passed 12-18-2008)
§ 111.06 REPORTS AND RECORDS.
   (A)   Open books and records.
      (1)   A franchisee shall manage all of its cable system operations in
accordance with a policy of open books and records.
      (2)   CCRC shall retain throughout the life of any franchise the right to
require such information pertaining to the operation of the franchise as it
reasonably deems useful or necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the
franchise agreement and applicable law.
   (B)   Inspection of books and records.
      (1)   Upon reasonable written notice, the County Commissioners shall have
the right to inspect a franchisee’s books and records pertaining to the
operation of the franchise at any time during normal business hours as
reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the terms of the franchise
agreement and applicable law. This includes not only the books and records of
the franchisee, but any books and records the County Commissioners reasonably
deem relevant held by any affiliate of the franchisee, a cable operator of the
cable system, any contractor or subcontractor, or any person holding any form
of management contract for the cable system.
      (2)   Such inspections shall be conducted in a manner that will not
unreasonably disrupt the franchisee’s normal operations.
      (3)   If any books or records that relate to the cable system are not
kept in the county, the franchisee shall pay all reasonable and necessary
expenses incurred in making the inspection.
   (C)   Annual report. Each franchisee shall file annually with CCRC a written
report containing the following information:
      (1)   A summary of maintenance practices, transmission improvements,
signal strength, and signal quality at the subscriber end of the system during
the past year. This report shall include a summary of the results of, and/or,
at the franchisee’s option, copies of the FCC proof of performance tests
conducted during the past year;
      (2)   A map showing the area within the borders of the franchisors in
which the franchisee offers service as of the end of the year;
      (3)   A summary of the franchisee’s plans for extending its cable service
to unserved areas during the coming year;
      (4)   A copy of the franchisee’s rules and regulations of the franchisee
applicable to cable subscribers; and
      (5)   An annual statement of gross revenues derived from the operation of
the cable system for cable service, certified by the franchisee’s chief
financial officer or an independent certified public accountant.
   (D)   Communications with regulatory agencies.
      (1)   The franchisee shall file with CCRC all reports and materials
submitted to or received from the following agencies by the franchisee or its
affiliates that relate specifically to the cable system or could affect the
franchisee’s operations within the boundaries of the franchisors: the FCC, the
Security and Exchange Commission, and any other federal or state regulatory
commission or agency having jurisdiction over any matter affecting operation of
the franchisee’s system.
      (2)   Materials filed with CCRC pursuant to division (D)(1) above shall
be filed as follows: materials submitted by the franchisee or an affiliate
shall be filed with CCRC at the time they are submitted to the receiving
agency. Materials received by the franchisee shall be filed with CCRC within 30
days of the date they are received by the franchisee, except that if applicable
law permits a response to such materials by the franchisors and sets a deadline
of 60 days or fewer days for the franchisors’ response, they shall be filed
with CCRC within five days of the date they are received by the franchisee.
   (E)   Confidentiality.
      (1)   CCRC and the franchisors shall maintain the confidentiality of any
trade secrets or other proprietary information received from a franchisee, and
such records shall be exempt from inspection under this section to the extent
required by applicable law regarding subscriber privacy.
      (2)   If a franchisee clearly and appropriately identifies information as
confidential or proprietary, then to the maximum extent permissible under
applicable federal, state, and local laws related to public records, CCRC and
the franchisors may not disclose that information to the public.
      (3)   If CCRC determines that requested information is not clearly or
appropriately identified, or that disclosure is otherwise required by law, CCRC
shall notify the franchisee that CCRC intends to disclose the requested
information unless ordered otherwise by a court.

§ 111.07 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.
   (A)   Insurance.
      (1)   A franchisee shall carry and maintain during the entire length of
the franchise term liability insurance coverage protecting the County
Commissioners, CCRC, the franchisors, their agents, servants, officials,
boards, commissions, and employees and the franchisee from and against any and
all claims, injury or damage to persons or property, both real and personal,
caused by the construction, erection, operation, or maintenance of the cable
system and the conduct of the franchisee’s business in the county, in the
amounts set forth in its franchise agreement.
      (2)   Worker’s compensation insurance shall also be provided as required
by the state law.
      (3)   The insurance policies obtained by a franchisee in compliance with
this and other sections shall be issued by a company or companies acceptable to
CCRC.
      (4)   The insurance policies shall name the County Commissioners and CCRC
as an additional insured and shall contain a provision that a written notice of
cancellation or reduction in coverage of said policy shall be delivered to CCRC
at least 30 days in advance of the effective date thereof.
      (5)   Certificates of insurance shall be filed and maintained with the
County Commissioners and CCRC during the term of the franchise.
   (B)   Indemnification.
      (1)   A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless CCRC and the franchisors, their agents, servants,
officials, boards, commissions, and employees, at all times against any and all
claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings, and judgments for damages or
equitable relief arising out of the construction, maintenance, or operation of
the cable system; and specifically agrees that it will pay all damages and
costs which CCRC and the franchisors or their agents, servants, officials,
boards, commissions, or employees may be legally required to pay arising from
the franchise granted herein. Such damages and penalties shall include but not
be limited to damages arising out of copyright infringements, or a failure by
the franchisee to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or
franchisees of programs to be delivered by the cable system, and other damages
arising out of the installation, operation, or maintenance of the cable system
authorized, allowed, or prohibited by the franchise.
      (2)   In the event suit shall be filed against CCRC or the franchisors or
their agents, servants, officials, boards, commissions, or employees either
independently or jointly with a franchisee to recover for any claim or damages,
the franchisee, upon notice to it by CCRC, shall defend CCRC, the franchisors,
or their agents, servants, officials, boards, commissions, or employees, as the
case may be, against the action and, in the event of a final judgment being
obtained against any of them, either independently or jointly with the
franchisee by reason of the acts of the franchisee, the franchisee will pay
said judgment and all costs and legal fees, and hold CCRC and the franchisors,
their agents, servants, officials, boards, commissions, and employees harmless
therefrom.
   (C)   Bond.
      (1)   A franchisee shall, concurrently with its acceptance of a
franchise, and during the entire term of the franchise and any extensions or
renewals thereof, file with CCRC, at franchisee’s sole expense, a corporate
surety bond with a responsible company acceptable to CCRC, and licensed to do
business in this state, in the amount specified in its franchise agreement,
renewable annually, and conditioned upon the faithful performance of
franchisee’s obligations under the franchise, and upon the further condition
that in the event the franchisee shall fail to comply with any one or more of
the provisions of the franchise agreement or this chapter, there shall be
recoverable, jointly and severally from the principal and surety of such bond,
any damages or loss suffered by CCRC, franchisors, or subscribers as a result
thereof, including the full amount of any compensation, indemnification, or
cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the franchisee as prescribed
hereby, plus a reasonable allowance for attorneys’ fees and costs, said
condition to be a continuing obligation on the part of the franchisee to CCRC
and the franchisors that may arise from the acceptance of the franchise or its
renewal or from the exercise of any privilege or right herein granted.
      (2)   The bond shall provide that at least 30 days prior written notice
of intention not to renew or to cancel or of any material change be given by
the surety company by filing the same with CCRC.
      (3)   CCRC may withdraw the amount due, with interest and any penalties,
from the bond if after 30 days written notice the franchisee fails to:
         (a)   Pay to CCRC or the franchisors any franchise fees, taxes, or
other amounts due;
         (b)   Pay any damages, costs, or expenses that CCRC or the franchisors
are compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the franchisee in
connection with the franchise; or
         (c)   Comply with any material provision of the franchise that CCRC
determines can be remedied by an expenditure of the bond.
      (4)   Within 30 days after any withdrawal from the bond, the franchisee
shall restore the full amount of the bond as required in division (C)(1) above.
   (D)   Nonwaiver. Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages
recovered by CCRC, the franchisors, or their agents, servants, officials,
boards, commissions, or employees shall be construed to limit the liability of
a franchisee for damages under the franchise.
(2004 Code, § 93-7) (Ord. 41, passed 4-28-1983; Ord. 08-10, passed 12-18-2008)
§ 111.08 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Enforcement procedures.
      (1)   If CCRC determines that a franchisee has failed to perform any
obligation under the franchise or has failed to perform in a timely manner,
CCRC may make a written demand on the franchisee that it remedy the violation.
If the violation is not remedied or in the process of being remedied to the
satisfaction of CCRC within a reasonable time period following the demand, CCRC
may:
         (a)   Assess against the franchisee monetary damages as provided in
the franchise agreement;
         (b)   Issue a civil citation and impose a penalty not to exceed
$1,000, pursuant to the provisions of §
3-811 of the Code of Public Local Laws;
         (c)   Assess and withdraw the amounts specified above from the
franchisee’s performance bond or other applicable security instrument;
         (d)   Revoke the franchise as provided in the franchise agreement; or
         (e)   Pursue any legal or equitable remedy available under the
franchise or any applicable law.
      (2)   Remedies available to CCRC for franchise violations under this
chapter and under a franchise agreement shall be construed, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter, as cumulative and not alternative.
      (3)   If civil penalties are assessed against a franchisee under this
section, the franchisee is not subject to liquidated damages payable to CCRC
for the same violation. If liquidated damages payable to CCRC are assessed
against a franchisee, the franchisee is not subject to civil penalties under
this section for the same violation. If CCRC seeks actual damages for any
violation, any civil penalties or liquidated damages recovered by CCRC for the
same violation, including civil penalties or liquidated damages for partial
time periods included in a longer time period for which actual damages are
sought, shall be offset against any actual damages recovered by CCRC.
      (4)   A franchisee shall pay civil penalties or liquidated damages within
30 days after receipt of notice from CCRC.
      (5)   The filing of an appeal to any regulatory body or court does not
stay or release the obligations of a franchisee under the franchise agreement
and applicable law.
   (B)   No waiver.
      (1)   An assessment of liquidated damages or civil penalties does not
constitute a waiver by CCRC or the franchisors of any other right or remedy
they may have under the franchise or applicable law, including the right to
recover from the franchisee any additional damages, losses, costs, and
expenses, including actual attorney fees that were incurred by the franchisors
or CCRC by reason of or arising out of the violation.
      (2)   However, CCRC’s election of liquidated damages under the franchise
agreement shall take the place of any right to obtain actual damages over and
above the payment of any amounts otherwise due.
      (3)   This provision may not be construed to prevent CCRC from electing
to seek actual damages for a continuing violation if it has imposed civil
penalties or liquidated damages for an earlier partial time period for the same
violation, subject to the offset specified in division (A)(3) above.

CABLE CONSUMER PROTECTION
§ 111.25 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Cable operator duties. A cable operator shall satisfy the customer
service standards set forth in this chapter and any additional or stricter
requirements established by regulations of the FCC or other applicable federal,
state, or local law or regulation.
   (B)   Scope of chapter. This chapter does not prevent or prohibit:
      (1)   CCRC and a cable operator from agreeing to customer service
requirements that exceed the standards set forth in this chapter;
      (2)   CCRC from enforcing, through the end of a franchise term, pre-
existing customer service requirements that exceed the standards set forth in
this chapter or are contained in current franchise agreements;
      (3)   CCRC or the franchisors from enacting or enforcing any lawful
customer service or consumer protection laws or regulations; or

or the franchisors concerning customer service that imposes customer service
requirements that exceed, or address matters not addressed by the standards set
forth in this chapter, a franchise agreement, or federal or state law.
   (C)   Meeting standards specified by percentages of time. Where standards
shall be met a certain percentage of the time, as specified herein, a cable
operator shall adopt policies designed to meet those standards in all cases,
and in no event shall intentionally violate the standards. However, the cable

unintentionally fails to meet the standards in particular cases, so long as the
cable operator meets the standards the specified percentage of the time.
   (D)   Initial grace period. Other than for violations of §§
111.34 and
111.35, a cable operator shall not be subject to penalties, liquidated damages,

set forth in this chapter that occur during the first six months after the
operator first begins to provide cable service within the boundaries of the
franchisors, unless such violations involve fraud or willful misconduct.
(2004 Code, § 93-12) (Ord. 41, passed 4-28-1983; Ord. 08-10, passed 12-18-2008)
§ 111.26 OFFICE AND TELEPHONE ACCESS AND COMPLAINTS.
   (A)   Local business office. A cable operator shall maintain within the
geographic limits of the county a local business office or designated agent
that shall be open during normal business hours for the purpose of receiving
and resolving all subscriber complaints regarding the quality of service,
equipment malfunctions, and other similar matters, and to allow subscribers to
request service, pay bills, and conduct other business.
   (B)   Telephone access.
      (1)   A cable operator shall maintain a local, toll-free or collect-call
telephone access line which will be available to its subscribers 24 hours a
day, seven days a week.
      (2)   Trained company representatives will be available to respond to
customer telephone inquiries during normal business hours. After normal
business hours, the access line may be answered by a service or an automated
response system, including an answering machine. Inquiries received after
normal business hours shall be responded to by a trained company representative
on the next business day.
      (3)   Under normal operating conditions, telephone answer time by a
customer representative, including wait time, shall not exceed 30 seconds when
the connection is made. If the call needs to be transferred, transfer time
shall not exceed 30 seconds. These standards shall be met no less than 90% of
the time under normal operating conditions, measured on a quarterly basis.
         (a)   Measurement of the standard stated in division (B)(1) above
shall include all calls received by the cable operator at all call centers
receiving calls from subscribers, whether they are answered by a live
representative, answered by an automated response system, or abandoned, and
shall include all periods during which live representatives are available to
answer calls, whether or not such periods occur during normal business hours.
         (b)   If a call is answered by an automated response system, the
standard stated in division (B)(1) above shall be satisfied for a given call if
the standard system includes an option to speak to a service representative,
that option is presented to the caller within the first 90 seconds from the
time the call is answered by the automated response system, and, if that option
is exercised, the caller is not required to wait more than 30 seconds to be
connected to a service representative.
      (4)   Under normal operating conditions, a subscriber will receive a busy
signal less than 3% of the time.
   (C)   Complaints.
      (1)   Complaints by any subscriber may be filed with the cable operator
in writing or delivered to the cable operator orally in person or by telephone.
      (2)   Any complaints regarding service interruption received from
subscribers by the cable operator or referred to the cable operator by CCRC
shall be investigated by the cable operator and service restored within 48
hours of their receipt. In the event service is not restored within 48 hours,
the subscriber shall be credited with a reduction in the subscriber’s monthly
payment for each full day or portion of a day that such service is not restored
by determining from the subscriber’s monthly charge the pro rated charge for
each day’s service, then multiplying said daily charge by the number of days
during which service was not wholly restored and subtracting the result from
the subscriber’s monthly charge. Any complaints not regarding service
interruption received from subscribers by the cable operator or referred to the
cable operator by CCRC shall be investigated and responded to by the cable
operator within two business days of their receipt. If a complaint is sent to
the cable operator by CCRC, the cable operator shall respond to CCRC and report
on the status of that complaint within 24 hours of the time CCRC delivers the
complaint to the cable operator.
      (3)   The procedure for reporting and resolving complaints shall be
stated in writing by the cable operator to each subscriber at the time of
initial installation of cable service to the cable system, at least annually
thereafter, and at any time upon request.

§ 111.27 CABLE INSTALLATION AND REPAIR STANDARDS.
   (A)   General service standards.
      (1)   A cable operator shall render efficient cable service, make prompt
repairs, and intentionally interrupt cable service on the cable system only for
good cause and for the shortest time possible and, except in emergency
situations or to the extent necessary to fix the affected subscriber’s service
problems, or as provided in division (A)(4) below, only after a minimum of 48
hours prior notice to subscribers and CCRC of the anticipated cable service
interruption.
      (2)   A cable operator shall maintain sufficient staff and facilities to
handle properly and adequately respond to cable system maintenance, requests
for service, and complaints.
      (3)   A cable operator shall maintain a duty roster of qualified
technicians to respond to complaints or malfunctions of the cable system at
other than normal office hours.
      (4)   A cable operator need not give notice to subscribers for planned
maintenance that does not require more than two hours interruption of cable
service and that occurs between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m.
      (5)   A cable operator shall begin working to restore service within two
hours after it becomes aware of a service interruption affecting 5% or more of
the subscribers within the boundaries of the franchisors.
      (6)   A cable operator shall maintain a written log, or the equivalent
stored in computer memory and capable of access and reproduction on hard copy,
of all cable service interruptions and requests for cable service.
   (B)   Appointments.
      (1)   The “appointment window” for installations and service calls shall
be a specific time or, at maximum, a four-hour time block during normal
business hours. A cable operator may also offer longer appointment windows so
long as it offers the subscriber the specified four-hour time blocks as well.
      (2)   The cable operator shall offer a subscriber who requests service an
appointment no more than seven calendar days from the date of the request. The
subscriber may request a later date.
      (3)   A cable operator may schedule service calls and other installation
activities outside of normal business hours for the express convenience of the
customer.
      (4)   A cable operator may not cancel an appointment with a subscriber
after the close of business on the business day preceding the appointment.
      (5)   A cable operator may not require that a subscriber answer a
telephone call or that the subscriber otherwise confirm availability before the
cable operator commences an appointment. If a cable operator unsuccessfully
attempts to contact the subscriber prior to arriving at the appointment, and
then fails to keep the appointment, the cable operator’s failure to reach the
subscriber shall not excuse it from keeping the appointment.
      (6)   If a cable operator’s representative is running late for an
appointment with a subscriber and is not able to keep the appointment as
scheduled, the subscriber shall be contacted. The appointment shall be
rescheduled, as necessary, at a time convenient to the subscriber.
   (C)   Installation standards measured on a quarterly basis. Under normal
operating conditions, each of the following standards shall be met by a cable
operator no less than 95% of the time, measured on a quarterly basis.
      (1)   A cable operator shall complete a standard installation within
seven business days after receipt of a request, excluding time required to
obtain necessary permits, in all areas where trunk and feeder cable has been
activated for cable service; provided, however, that if installation requires
that fiber be terminated on the subscriber’s premises and such termination has
not yet been installed, a cable operator shall have seven days to install such
termination, and the seven-day period for installation of cable service shall
commence only after such termination is installed or the seven-day period for
such termination has elapsed, whichever occurs first.
      (2)   Excluding conditions beyond the control of the cable operator, the
cable operator will begin working on a service interruption promptly and in no
event later then 24 hours after the interruption becomes known. Work on other
requests for service shall be commenced by the next business day after
notification of the problem, and the work shall be completed within three
business days from the date of the initial request. If for reasons beyond the
cable operator’s control the work cannot be completed in the required time even
with the exercise of all due diligence, the cable operator shall complete the
work in the shortest time possible. A cable operator’s failure to hire
sufficient staff or to train its staff properly does not justify a cable
operator’s failure to comply with the required time period.
   (D)   Extension of service.
      (1)   A cable operator shall complete a nonstandard installation within
six months, excluding time required to obtain necessary permits, but including
any extension of the distribution system that may be required to complete such
installation pursuant to the cable operator’s franchise agreement and
applicable law.
      (2)   If a potential subscriber or CCRC requests an estimate of the cost
of line extension to a location, a cable operator shall provide such a good
faith estimate within 30 days from the date of such request.
   (E)   Response to a service request.
      (1)   A cable operator has responded to a request for service under the
provisions of this section when a technician arrives at the service location
and begins work on the problem or, if a technician’s presence at the service
location is not necessary to diagnose and cure the problem, when the cable
operator has begun work on the problem elsewhere.
      (2)   If a subscriber is not home when the technician arrives, response
is considered to have taken place if the technician leaves written notification
of the technician’s arrival.
   (F)   Charges for installation and service.
      (1)   Except as federal law may otherwise provide, a cable operator may
not charge a subscriber any cost other than its standard installation rate for
a standard installation of a single outlet, unless the cable operator
demonstrates to CCRC’s satisfaction that extraordinary circumstances or a
custom installation requested by the subscriber justify a higher charge.
      (2)   Except as federal law may otherwise provide, a cable operator may
not charge a subscriber for a service call unless the service request can be
demonstrated:
         (a)   Both to have been repeated and not to have been based on a
problem originating with the cable system; or
         (b)   To involve subscriber negligence or misuse of equipment.
   (G)   Cable drops.
      (1)   Except as applicable law otherwise may require, if a drop exceeds
the standard drop length, a cable operator may charge a subscriber for a cable
operator’s actual costs of labor and materials associated with installing the
drop beyond the standard drop length, if the drop length in excess of the
standard drop length is necessary due to engineering requirements.
      (2)   The subscriber’s preference for the point of entry into the
residence shall be observed whenever feasible.
      (3)   Runs in building interiors shall be as unobtrusive as possible.
      (4)   A cable operator shall use due care in the process of installation
and shall repair any damage to the subscriber’s property caused by the
installation. The restoration shall be undertaken as soon as possible after the
damage was incurred and shall be completed within no more than 30 days after
the damage is incurred, subject to reasonable landscaping limitations.
   (H)   Underground and above-ground installations.
      (1)   In locations where a cable operator’s system is underground, drops
shall be placed underground as well.
      (2)   Except as federal law may otherwise require, in an area where a
cable operator would be entitled to install a drop above ground, the cable
operator, if requested by the homeowner, shall install the drop underground but
may charge the homeowner the difference between the actual cost of labor and
materials for the above-ground installation and the actual cost of labor and
materials for the underground installation.
(2004 Code, § 93-14) (Ord. 41, passed 4-28-1983; Ord. 08-10, passed 12-18-2008)
§ 111.28 NOTICES.
   (A)   Annual notice to subscribers. At the time service is installed to a
subscriber and at least once annually afterwards, and at any time on request,
the cable operator shall provide each subscriber with written information
concerning:
      (1)   Products and services offered;
      (2)   Prices, including a schedule of rates and charges, and options for
programming services and conditions of subscription to programming and other
services;
      (3)   Installation and service maintenance policies, delinquent
subscriber reconnect and disconnect procedures, and any other of its policies
applicable to subscribers;
      (4)   Written instructions on how to use the cable services and for
placing a service call;
      (5)   Channel positions of programming carried on the cable system;
      (6)   The procedures for making inquiries or complaints, including the
title, address, local telephone number, and email address of the employee or
agent to whom inquiries or complaints are to be addressed;
      (7)   CCRC official responsible for regulating the franchise, including
the name, telephone number, and email address of the official;
      (8)   The cable operator’s business hours, legal holidays, and procedures
for responding to inquiries after normal business hours;
      (9)   A copy of the service contract applicable to the subscriber, if
any; and
      (10)   A written notice regarding subscriber’s privacy rights pursuant to
47 U.S.C. § 551.
   (B)   Notification of changes.
      (1)   A cable operator shall provide to all subscribers and to CCRC at
least 30 days written notice before the implementation of any change in rates,
programming services, channel positions, business hours, legal holidays, or
procedures for responding to inquiries after normal business hours, unless such
change is beyond the control of the cable operator, in which case the cable
operator shall provide the maximum possible notice up to the 30 days specified
herein.
      (2)   In addition to the requirement of division (B)(1) above, a cable
operator shall give at least 30 days written notice to subscribers and to CCRC
before implementing any rate or service change. Such notice shall state the
precise amount of any rate change and briefly explain in readily understandable
fashion the cause of the rate change (e.g., inflation, change in external
costs, addition/deletion of channels). When the change involves the addition or
deletion of channels, each channel added or deleted shall be separately
identified. For purpose of the carriage of digital broadcast signals, the
operator need only identify for subscribers the television signal added and not
whether that signal may be multiplexed during certain dayparts.
      (3)   At least five working days before distributing a subscriber notice,
unless waived by CCRC, the cable operator shall provide to the officer the
specific points to be contained in a subscriber notice and the text of the
subscriber notice, if available. If the text is not available, it shall be
provided to CCRC as soon as it is available.
      (4)   A cable operator shall file with CCRC copies of all notices
provided to subscribers.
(2004 Code, § 93-15) (Ord. 41, passed 4-28-1983; Ord. 08-10, passed 12-18-2008)

   (A)   General standards.
      (1)   Bills shall be clear, concise, and understandable.
      (2)   Bills shall fully itemize cable services, equipment, and any other
items for which a cable operator charges a subscriber, including basic and
premium service charges and equipment charges.
      (3)   Bills shall clearly delineate all activity during the billing
period, including optional charges, rebates, and credits.
   (B)   Refunds. Refund checks to subscribers shall be issued promptly, but no
later than:
      (1)   The earlier of the subscriber’s next available billing cycle or 30
days following resolution of the refund request; or
      (2)   The return of all equipment supplied by the cable operator if cable
service is terminated.
   (C)   Credits.
      (1)   Credits for cable service shall be issued no later than the
subscriber’s next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is
warranted.
      (2)   The account of any subscriber shall be credited a pro rated share
of the monthly charge for cable service, upon the reasonably prompt request of
a subscriber, or without a subscriber’s request if the cable operator is aware
of an outage and can identify the affected subscribers; if the subscriber is
without cable service for a period that exceeds 12 hours during any 24-hour
period; or cable service is substantially impaired for any reason for a period
that exceeds 12 hours during any 24-hour period.
      (3)   The provisions of division (C)(2) above do not apply if it can be
documented that a subscriber seeks a refund for an outage or impairment that
the subscriber caused, or a planned outage occurred between the hours of 12:00
midnight and 6:00 a.m. and the subscriber had prior notice.
   (D)   Payment information; late fees.
      (1)   A cable operator’s billing statement shall show a specific payment
due date not earlier than the midpoint of the period for which the cable
service being billed is rendered (e.g., the fifteenth day of a 30-day billing
cycle).
      (2)   If a balance due is not received by seven days after the end of the
period for which the cable service being billed is rendered, the cable operator
may assess a late fee in accordance with state and local law and judicial
decisions.
      (3)   Any late fee shall appear on the following month’s billing
statement.
      (4)   A subscriber may not be charged a late fee or otherwise penalized
for any failure by a cable operator, including a failure to timely or correctly
bill the subscriber or a failure to properly credit the subscriber for a
payment timely made.
   (E)   Deposits.
      (1)   A cable operator may require a reasonable, nondiscriminatory
deposit on equipment provided to subscribers, in addition to any allowable
monthly rental fees.
      (2)   A subscriber deposit shall bear interest in accordance with
applicable law or at the going rate, which may not be less than the prime rate
of the bank being used by the County Commissioners for the conduct of ordinary
business. All deposits, with interest, shall be returned to the subscriber
within 30 days after return of the equipment.
   (F)   Billing inquiries. If a subscriber requests a written response to a
written billing inquiry, the cable operator shall respond in writing within 30

      (1)   A cable operator shall promptly disconnect or downgrade any
subscriber and may not require a notice period before the disconnect or
downgrade of service by a subscriber.
      (2)   If the subscriber returns or permits the cable operator to retrieve
any equipment necessary to receive a service within five business days of the
disconnection, the cable operator may not impose a charge for any cable service
delivered after the date of the disconnect request.
   (C)   Return of equipment.
      (1)   A subscriber may be asked, but not required, to disconnect a cable
operator’s equipment and return it to the business office.
      (2)   If a cable operator fails to remove its property from a
subscriber’s premises within 60 days of the termination of cable service, the
property shall be deemed abandoned unless the subscriber is responsible for the
cable operator’s failure to remove the property.
   (D)   Return of security deposit or other funds.
      (1)   Any security deposit or other funds due the subscriber shall be
refunded on disconnected accounts after any customer premises equipment
provided by the cable operator has been recovered by the cable operator.
      (2)   The refund shall be made within the earlier of 30 days or by the
end of the next available billing cycle measured from the date disconnection
was requested. If any customer premises equipment provided by the cable
operator has not been returned by the later of these two dates, the refund
shall be made on the date on which such equipment is returned.
   (E)   Disconnection of cable service by operator.
      (1)   If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber fee or other fee
or charge, a cable operator may disconnect the subscriber’s cable service.
However, the disconnection may not occur until after 35 days from the beginning
of the period for which the cable service being billed is rendered, plus at
least ten days advance written notice to the subscriber of the intent to
disconnect, given after the 35 days have elapsed. However, if the subscriber

the practices that led to disconnection and paid all proper fees and charges,
including any reconnect fees and amounts owed the cable operator for damage to
its cable system or equipment.
      (3)   A cable operator may disconnect a subscriber who causes signal
leakage in excess of federal limits. Disconnection may be effected either:
         (a)   After five days written notice to the subscriber, if the
subscriber fails to take steps to correct the problem; or
         (b)   Without notice if signal leakage is detected originating from
the subscriber’s premises in excess of federal limits, provided that the cable
operator shall immediately notify the subscriber of the problem and, once the
problem is corrected, reconnect the subscriber.
   (F)   Reconnection of cable service.
      (1)   A cable operator shall reconnect cable service to a subscriber who
wishes to have the subscriber’s cable service restored if the subscriber first
satisfies any previously owed obligations.
      (2)   The cable operator shall complete such reconnection within 48
hours.

§ 111.31 CHANGES IN CABLE SERVICE.
   (A)   Notice of change of service. When a cable operator substantially
alters the cable service it provides to a class of subscribers, the cable
operator shall provide each subscriber notice as required in §
111.28(B), explain the substance and full effect of the alteration, and provide
the subscriber with the right to choose to receive any combination of cable
services offered by the cable operator.
   (B)   Charges for authorized cable services only. A cable operator may not
charge for any cable service or product that the subscriber has not
affirmatively indicated the subscriber wishes to receive. Payment of the
regular monthly bill does not in and of itself constitute such an affirmative
indication.
   (C)   Requirement to purchase cable service other than basic service.
Subject to federal law, a cable operator that is not subject to effective
competition may not require a subscriber to purchase a cable service other than
basic service as a condition of purchasing premium or pay-per-view programming.

§ 111.32 PARENTAL CONTROL.
   Upon the request of a subscriber, a cable operator shall make available to
each subscriber, either for rent or for purchase or both, the option of
blocking the video and audio portion of any channel or channels of programming
entering the subscriber’s home. The control option shall be made available to
all subscribers requesting it at the time that cable service is provided or
within a reasonable time thereafter.

§ 111.33 RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.
   (A)   Discrimination prohibited. A cable operator may not deny service or
access or otherwise discriminate against subscribers on the basis of income,
race, color, religion, national origin, age, sexual orientation, or sex.
   (B)   Compliance with equal employment opportunity. A cable operator shall
comply with the equal employment opportunity requirements of federal, state,
and local laws and regulations.
   (C)   Privacy.
      (1)   A cable operator shall at all times protect the privacy rights of
all subscribers under all applicable law, including but not limited to § 631 of
the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 551.
      (2)   A subscriber’s “prior written or electronic consent” for purposes
of 47 U.S.C. § 551 shall be obtained by a cable operator pursuant to a separate
document with a prominent statement that the subscriber is providing such
consent in full knowledge of the provisions of 47 U.S.C. § 551. Such written
permission shall be for a limited period of time not to exceed one year, which
shall be renewable in writing at the option of the subscriber. No penalty shall
be invoked for a subscriber’s failure to provide or renew such an
authorization. The authorization shall be revocable at any time by the
subscriber, without penalty of any kind, by delivering to the cable operator in
writing, by mail or otherwise, the subscriber’s decision to revoke the
authorization. Any revocation shall be effective upon receipt by the cable
operator.

§ 111.34 ANTI-COMPETITIVE ACTIONS.
   A cable operator may not engage in unlawful acts that have the purpose or
effect of limiting competition for the provision of cable service or services
similar to cable service within the boundaries of the franchisors.
(2004 Code, § 93-21) (Ord. 41, passed 4-28-1983; Ord. 08-10, passed 12-18-2008)
§ 111.35 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Administration. CCRC shall have the authority to enforce the
requirements of this subchapter.
   (B)   Verification of compliance. If CCRC has reason to believe that a cable
operator may not be in compliance with the standards established in this
subchapter, CCRC, on reasonable notice, may require the cable operator to
demonstrate compliance with the standards required in this subchapter. The
cable operator shall provide sufficient detail to permit CCRC to verify the
extent of compliance.
   (C)   Enforcement procedures.
      (1)   If CCRC determines that a cable operator has failed to perform any
obligation under this subchapter or has failed to perform in a timely manner,
CCRC may make a written demand on the cable operator that it remedy the
violation. If the violation is not remedied or in the process of being remedied
to the satisfaction of CCRC within a reasonable time period following the
demand, CCRC may:
         (a)   Issue a civil citation for a civil infraction and impose a
penalty not to exceed $1,000, pursuant to the provisions of §
3-811 of the Code of Public Local Laws;
         (b)   Assess against the cable operator any monetary damages provided
for such violation in its franchise agreement;
         (c)   Assess and withdraw the amounts specified above from the cable
operator’s performance bond or other applicable security instrument;
         (d)   Revoke the cable operator’s cable franchise as provided in its
franchise agreement; or
         (e)   Pursue any legal or equitable remedy available under any
applicable law or under the cable operator’s franchise agreement.
      (2)   The following penalty amounts shall apply, in place of the amount
specified in division (C)(1)(a) above, in assessing civil penalties for
customer service standards that are measured on a quarterly basis:
         (a)   For the first calendar quarter in which a cable operator does
not meet the prescribed standard (a “noncompliant quarter”), the cable operator
will be subject to a civil penalty in the amount of $1,500;
         (b)   For a second consecutive noncompliant quarter, a cable operator
shall be subject to a civil penalty in the amount of $2,000; and
         (c)   For each consecutive noncompliant quarter beyond the second, a
cable operator shall be subject to a civil penalty in the amount of $4,000.
      (3)   Remedies available to CCRC for franchise violations under this
chapter and under the franchise agreement shall be construed, except as
otherwise provided in this chapter, as cumulative and not alternative.
      (4)   If civil penalties are assessed against a cable operator under this
chapter, the cable operator is not subject to liquidated damages payable to
CCRC for the same violation. If liquidated damages payable to CCRC are assessed
against a cable operator, the cable operator is not subject to civil penalties
under this section for the same violation. If CCRC seeks actual damages for any
violation, any civil penalties or liquidated damages recovered by CCRC for the
same violation, including civil penalties or liquidated damages for partial
time periods included in a longer time period for which actual damages are
sought, shall be offset against any actual damages recovered by CCRC.
      (5)   A cable operator shall pay civil penalties or liquidated damages
within 30 days after receipt of notice from CCRC.
      (6)   The filing of an appeal to any regulatory body or court does not
stay or release the obligations of a cable operator under the franchise
agreement and applicable law.
      (7)   An assessment of liquidated damages or civil penalties does not
constitute a waiver by CCRC or the franchisors of any other right or remedy
they may have under the franchise or applicable law, including the right to
recover from the cable operator any additional damages, losses, costs, and
expenses, including actual attorneys’ fees, that were incurred by the
franchisors or CCRC by reason of or arising out of the violation. However,
CCRC’s election of liquidated damages under the franchise agreement shall take
place of any right to obtain actual damages over and above the payment of any
amounts otherwise due. This provision may not be construed to prevent CCRC from
electing to seek actual damages for a continuing violation if it has imposed
civil penalties or liquidated damages for an earlier partial time period for
the same violation, subject to the offset specified in division (C)(4) above.
(2004 Code, § 93-22) (Ord. 41, passed 4-28-1983; Ord. 08-10, passed 12-18-2008)

   Except where otherwise expressly stated herein, all costs incurred by an
owner or permittee in connection with any provision of this chapter shall be
borne by the owner or permittee.

§ 150.06 RETENTION PRIORITIES.
   (A)   The following categories of trees, shrubs, or other associated
vegetation, and forest resources located in specifically identified sensitive
locations shall be considered a priority for retention and protection. These
trees, shrubs, or other associated vegetation and forest resources shall be
left in an undisturbed condition and protected from disturbance during and
until on site construction activities are complete, unless the applicant has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the county that reasonable efforts made to
protect them have been unsuccessful or has provided evidence to the county that
identifies certain individual trees in specific locations as unreasonable
liabilities to health and safety and that efforts to continue their existence
would either be economically prohibitive or otherwise unwarranted:
      (1)   Trees, shrubs, and plants located in sensitive areas including
wetlands and their buffers, 100-year floodplains, streams and their buffers,
steep slopes, and critical habitats; and
      (2)   Forests which connect large undeveloped or heavily vegetated tracts
of land lying within or adjacent to the site.
   (B)   The following categories of trees, shrubs, or other associated
vegetation, and forest resources located in specifically identified sensitive
locations shall be considered a priority for retention and protection and shall
be left in an undisturbed condition and protected from disturbance during and
until on site construction activities are complete, unless the applicant has
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the county that the applicant qualifies for
a variance in accordance with § 150.14.
      (1)   Rare/endangered. Trees, shrubs, or plants identified on the list of
rare, threatened, and endangered species of the United States Fish and Wildlife
Service or the Maryland Department of Natural Resources.
      (2)   Historic significance. Trees that:
         (a)   Are part of a historic site as recognized by the National
Register of Historic Places, the Maryland Historical Trust, the Carroll County
Historic Preservation Commission, or municipal historic body;
         (b)   Are associated with a historic structure as recognized by the
National Register of Historic Places, the Maryland Historical Trust, the
Carroll County Historic Preservation Commission, or municipal historic body; or
         (c)   Have been designated by the state or the county as a national,
state, county, or municipal champion tree.
      (3)   Specimen trees.
         (a)   A variance approval will be required to disturb the critical
root zone of the tree or remove the tree entirely.
         (b)   If a good or excellent condition specimen tree is to be removed,
its loss shall be mitigated for using the following formula: DBH of specimen
tree removed equals number of trees replaced based on a one-inch for one-inch
replacement. An acreage equivalent can be derived by dividing the DBH of the
specimen tree by 200 (e.g., a 30-inch DBH tree shall be replaced with 30 one-
inch caliper trees or 0.15 acre of equivalent planting or banking).

the Technical Manual;
      (3)   Purchase of credit from a county approved forest bank. Use of a
forest bank may be approved if on site afforestation or reforestation and off
site afforestation or reforestation are deemed impossible, impractical, or when
complying with those higher priorities would create an undue hardship.
   (B)   Location priority. Reforestation or afforestation shall, if
technically feasible, be conducted in the following order of priority:
      (1)   Establish or enhance forest buffers adjacent to streams, to widths
of at least 50 feet;
      (2)   Establish or increase existing forested corridors to connect
existing forests within or adjacent to the site, and where practical, forested
corridors should be a minimum of 300 feet in width to facilitate wildlife
movement;
      (3)   Establish or enhance forest buffers adjacent to critical habitats
where appropriate;
      (4)   Establish or enhance areas in the 100-year floodplains;
      (5)   Stabilize slopes of 25% or greater and slopes of 15% or greater
with a Soil K value greater than 0.35 including the slopes of ravines or other
natural depressions;
      (6)   Establish buffers between areas of differing land uses where
appropriate; and
      (7)   Establish forest areas adjacent to existing forests so as to
increase the overall area of contiguous forest cover, where appropriate.
   (C)   Time frames.
      (1)   Any planting areas proposed outside the approved limits of
disturbance may be planted upon approval of the FCP.
      (2)   A person required to conduct afforestation or reforestation on-site
shall accomplish it within one year of grading final approval.
      (3)   A person required to conduct afforestation or reforestation off
site shall accomplish it within one year of the issuance of the grading or
building permit.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001 PURPOSE; AUTHORITY; DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain, and enhance the
public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements
and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated with increased
stormwater runoff. The goal is to manage stormwater by using environmental site
design (ESD) to the maximum extent practicable (MEP) to maintain after
development as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff characteristics,
and to reduce stream channel erosion, pollution, siltation and sedimentation,
and local flooding, and use appropriate structural best management practices
(BMPs) only when necessary. This will help restore, enhance, and maintain the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of streams, minimize damage to
public and private property, and reduce impacts of land development.
   (B)   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the Md. Code, Environment Article,
Title 4, Subtitle 2, and shall apply to all development occurring within the
unincorporated areas of the county. The application of this chapter shall be
the minimum stormwater management (SWM) requirements and shall not be deemed a
limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state statute. This county
shall be responsible for the coordination and enforcement of this chapter.
   (C)   The degree of stormwater management (SWM) necessary to satisfy the
requirements of this chapter is considered reasonable to regulate the effects
of stormwater runoff on the receiving land and water:
      (1)   Quantity - overbank flood control (Qp10);
      (2)   Bank erosion - stream capacity (Cpv);
      (3)   Quality - waterborne pollutants (WQv); and
      (4)   Local groundwater table - groundwater recharge (Rev).
   (D)   The amount of protection required is based upon state law, scientific
study, and local engineering experience.
   (E)   Rainfall events beyond the capacity of management measures provided to
satisfy this chapter have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. The
severity of these events and their effects may be increased by man-made or
natural causes.
   (F)   Implementation of the provisions of this chapter does not create
liability on the part of the county or any officer or employee thereof for any
damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.

accordance with the provisions of this section if there are subsequent
additions, extensions, or modifications to a development receiving a waiver. A
waiver shall be limited to the matters contained in the request and by the
waiver granted. Waivers of the review and approval process may not be granted
except in accordance with this section. Waivers may be granted if the following
criteria are met.
      (1)   SWM quantitative control waivers shall be granted only to those
projects within areas where watershed management plans have been developed
consistent with division (A)(7) or in accordance with division (A)(5) below.
      (2)   If watershed management plans consistent with division (A)(7) below
have not been developed, then SWM quantitative control waivers may be granted
to projects provided that it has been demonstrated that ESD has been
implemented to the MEP and the county determines that circumstances exist that
prevent the reasonable implementation of quantity control practices.
      (3)   SWM qualitative control waivers apply only to:
         (a)   In-fill development projects where ESD has been implemented to
the MEP and it has been demonstrated that other BMPs are not feasible;
         (b)   Redevelopment projects if the requirements of §
151.019 are satisfied; or
         (c)   Sites where the county determines that circumstances exist that
prevent the reasonable implementation of ESD to the MEP.
      (4)   Waivers shall only be granted when it has been demonstrated that
ESD has been implemented to the MEP and shall:
         (a)   Be on a case-by-case basis;
         (b)   Consider the cumulative effects of the county waiver policy; and
         (c)   Reasonably ensure that the development will not adversely impact
stream quality.
      (5)   SWM quantitative and qualitative control waivers may be granted for
phased development projects if a system designed to meet the state’s 2000
regulatory requirements and the county’s 2004 version of this chapter for
multiple phases has been constructed by May 4, 2010. If the state’s 2009
regulatory requirements cannot be met for future phases constructed after May
4, 2010, all reasonable efforts to incorporate ESD in future phases must be
demonstrated.
      (6)   If the county has established an overall watershed management plan
for a specific watershed, then the county may develop quantitative waiver and
redevelopment provisions that differ from division (B) below and §
151.019.

         (h)   Be approved by the Administration.
      (8)   The county may grant a waiver of quantitative SWM requirements for
individual developments in areas where watershed management plans have been
developed, provided that a written request is submitted by the applicant
containing descriptions, drawings, and other information that is necessary to
evaluate the proposed development. A separate written waiver request shall be
required in accordance with the provisions of this section if there are
subsequent additions, extensions, or modifications to a development receiving a
waiver.

2004; Ord. 2010-05, padded 4-29-2010; Ord. 2010-08, passed 5-25-2010)
§ 151.019 REDEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   SWM plans for redevelopment shall provide ESD to the MEP consistent
with the Design Manual and the Supplement. Overbank flood protection volume
requirements do not apply unless required by the county in uncommon situations
such as historic flooding, or extreme erosion where more stormwater control
than the minimum required may be necessary.
   (B)   If the runoff from a proposed redevelopment site drains into a
publically or privately owned regional SWM facility that provides full quality
and quantity management, the developer may contribute their portion of the
actual cost for the design/construction/repair/maintenance of the regional
facility based on the per acre cost of the impervious acreage draining to the
facility in lieu of onsite SWM measures. Adequate pretreatment, runoff capture,
and stable conveyance to the regional facility must be provided.
   (C)   All redevelopment project designs shall reduce those existing site
impervious areas within the limit of disturbance (LOD) built in accordance with
an approved site plan by at least 50% below conditions existing on the date of
the most recent county geographic information system orthophotography or as
depicted on the original approved site plan. Where site conditions prevent the
reduction of impervious area, then SWM practices shall implement ESD to the MEP
for at least 50% of the site’s impervious area. When a combination of
impervious area reduction and ESD is used, the combined reduced and treated
area shall equal no less than 50% of the site’s impervious area within the LOD.
Where existing site impervious areas were constructed after July 1, 1984,
without an approved SWM plan, SWM shall be provided in accordance with §
151.035 for all impervious surfaces on the parcel.
   (D)   Alternative SWM measures may be used to meet the requirements in
division (C) above if the owner or developer satisfactorily demonstrates to the
county that impervious area reduction has been maximized and ESD has been
implemented to the MEP. Alternative stormwater management measures include but
are not limited to:
      (1)   An on site structural BMP;
      (2)   An off site structural BMP to provide water quality treatment for
an impervious area equal to or greater than 70% of the existing impervious
area;
      (3)   A combination of impervious area reduction, ESD implementation, and
an on site structural BMP for an area equal to or greater than 50% of the
existing site impervious area within the LOD; or
      (4)   A combination of impervious area reduction, ESD implementation and
an off site structural BMP for an area equal to or greater than 70% of the
existing site impervious area within the LOD.
   (E)   The county policies for providing stormwater runoff treatment for
redevelopment projects if it is proven to the county’s satisfaction that the
requirements of divisions (A), (B), (C) and (D) above cannot be met are as
follows:
      (1)   Retrofitting of existing on site or off site BMPs that provide
inadequate stormwater treatment for the impervious areas draining to them,
identified by the county within the eight digit drainage basin of the project,
to bring them up to current standards in accordance with the Design Manual and
the Supplement. The retrofitted facilities must treat drainage from impervious
areas that require additional treatment greater than that required for all site
imperviousness within the LOD; or
      (2)   Fees paid into the Stormwater Management Fund established in §
151.067 for the exclusive purpose of providing management of stormwater. The
fees shall be the estimated cost of constructing adequate onsite ESD and/or
structural SWM practices as estimated by the design engineer or surveyor with
concurrence by the County.

§ 151.020 VARIANCES.
   (A)   The county may grant a variance from any technical requirements of §§
151.035 and
151.036 (SWM criteria), provided the variance is consistent with sound SWM.
   (B)   The county may not grant a variance if downstream flooding problems or
danger to health and safety or damage to property or the environment exist or
may be created by runoff from the project.
   (C)   A variance may be granted upon:
      (1)   A written request submitted by the developer which contains
descriptions, drawings, and any other information that the county deems
necessary to demonstrate that ESD has been investigated thoroughly;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant a variance would result in
exceptional hardship or environmental degradation;
      (3)   A determination that adherence to the technical requirement is not
necessary to fulfill the purpose of this chapter;
      (4)   A determination that granting a variance will not result in
increased flooding, dangers to health and safety, or damage to property or the
environment; or
      (5)   Provision of compensatory SWM in accordance with §
151.019(D) for all impervious areas within the LOD not completely treated in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   For any development located within an incorporated municipality, a
notice of a request for a variance to the technical requirements of this
chapter shall be forwarded by the applicant to the Mayor of that municipality.
Proof of submittal to the municipality shall be provided to the county.
   (E)   If granting a variance to a technical requirement of this chapter, the
county shall issue written findings of fact that the applicant has met the
requirements of this section and that granting the variance is consistent with
the intent of this chapter.
   (F)   The process includes:
      (1)   Submittal with all supporting documentation;
      (2)   Review by the county SWM staff with written recommendation; and

2004; Ord. 2010-05, passed 4-29-2010)
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT CRITERIA
§ 151.035 MINIMUM CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   The minimum control requirements established in this section and the
Design Manual are as follows:
      (1)   The county shall require that the planning techniques,
nonstructural practices, and design methods specified in the Design Manual be
used to implement ESD to the MEP. The use of ESD planning techniques and
treatment practices shall be exhausted before any structural BMP is
implemented. SWM plans for development projects subject to this chapter shall
be designed using ESD sizing criteria, recharge volume, water quality volume,
and channel protection storage volume criteria according to the Design Manual
and the Supplement. The MEP standard is met when channel stability is
maintained, predevelopment groundwater recharge is replicated, nonpoint source
pollution is minimized, and structural SWM practices are used only if
determined to be absolutely necessary.
      (2)   Control requires adequate stormwater facilities and drainage
systems to capture, convey, and manage the design storm peak. Control of two-
and ten-year frequency storm events is required according to the Design Manual
and the Supplement if the county determines that either:
         (a)   Historic documentation of immediate downstream flooding or
channel instability problems;
         (b)   Neither a FEMA floodplain nor adequate continuous recorded
floodplain easements exist; or
         (c)   Floodplain development or conveyance systems are uncontrolled.
      (3)   The county may require more than the minimum control requirements
specified in this chapter if downstream flooding problems or danger to health
and safety or damage to property or the environment exist or may be created by
runoff from the development. When the county determines that there are existing
buildings within the floodplain or undersized hydraulic structures immediately
downstream of a project, management of the runoff from the 25-, 50-, and 100-
year design storm events or greater will be required as appropriate.
   (B)   Alternate minimum control requirements may be adopted subject to
Administration approval. Prior to approval, the Administration shall require a
demonstration that alternative requirements will implement ESD to the MEP and
control flood damages, accelerated stream erosion, water quality, and
sedimentation. The Administration may also require comprehensive watershed
studies.
   (C)   SWM and development plans, where applicable, shall be consistent with
adopted and approved watershed management plans or flood management plans as
approved by the Maryland Department of the Environment in accordance with the
Flood Hazard Management Act of 1976.
(2004 Code, § 191-10) (Ord. 01-12, passed 9-27-2001; Ord. 04-07, passed 4-1-

be used, either alone or in combination in a SWM plan. A developer shall
demonstrate that ESD and nonstructural practices have been implemented to the
MEP before the use of a structural BMP is considered in developing the SWM
plan. ESD planning techniques and nonstructural SWM measures must be
implemented to MEP to minimize the reliance on structural BMPs.
   (B)   ESD planning techniques and practices.
      (1)   The following planning techniques shall be applied, in order of
priority, according to the Design Manual and the Supplement, to satisfy the
applicable minimum control requirements established in §

      (4)   The use of ESD planning techniques and treatment practices as well
as microscale (nonstructural) practices specified in this section shall not
conflict with existing state law or local ordinances, regulations, or policies;
and
      (5)   ESD treatment and microscale (non-structural) SWM practices used to
satisfy the minimum control requirements shall be recorded in the Land Records
of Carroll County and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners. Prior
approval from the county shall be obtained before ESD treatment and microscale
(nonstructural) stormwater practices are altered.
   (C)   Structural stormwater management measures. 
      (1)   After all feasible ESD planning techniques and ESD and microscale
(nonstructural) SWM practices have been applied, as determined by the county,
the following structural practices shall be employed in order of priority to
satisfy the remaining applicable minimum control requirements established in §
151.035. All structural SWM practices shall be designed according to the Design

possible. Risers shall be designed to allow for inspection from top to bottom.
      (8)   All publicly maintained surface SWM facilities shall be designed
with slopes no steeper than 4:1.
      (9)   All publicly maintained facilities shall have an in fee access from
the bottom of the facility to a public right-of-way, unless an alternative
access is approved by the county. This access shall be a minimum 20 feet in
width containing a 12-foot wide paved access road constructed to minimum use-
in-common drive standards. The access road shall have a maximum slope of 17%
with a maximum cross slope of 3% and a maximum side slope of 4:1.
      (10)   Any retaining walls associated with a publicly maintained facility
shall have railings constructed per the Supplement and shall be located at
least 15 feet inside the parcel. Anchors associated with the retaining walls
shall be entirely inside the parcel.
      (11)   In areas of public maintenance, no loose riprap may be left

developments shall be located on a separate parcel and be maintained by the lot
owners. The ownership and maintenance agreement shall be recorded in the Land
Records of Carroll County. For all other developments containing structural
measures, the measures shall be protected by easement recorded in the Land
Records of Carroll County. Stormwater capture and conveyance systems feeding
the structural facilities shall be protected by easement. Prior approval shall
be obtained from the county before structural stormwater measures or stormwater
capture and conveyance systems are altered.
   (E)   Alternative planning. Alternative ESD planning techniques and
treatment practices and structural and nonstructural SWM measures may be used
for new development runoff control if they meet the performance criteria
established in the Design Manual and the Supplement and are adopted by the
county with the Administration’s approval. Practices used for redevelopment
projects shall be approved by the county.

§ 151.052 CONTENTS AND SUBMISSION OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLANS.
   (A)   Contents.
      (1)   The developer shall submit phased SWM plans that meet the design
requirements of this chapter. The plans shall be accompanied by reports that
include sufficient information to evaluate the environmental characteristics of
affected areas, the potential impacts of the proposed development on water
resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of measures proposed for
managing stormwater runoff. The developer or builder shall certify on the
drawings that all clearing, grading, drainage, construction, and development
shall be conducted in strict compliance with the plans. The developer shall
obtain from adjacent property owners any easements or necessary property
interests concerning flow of water. Approval of a SWM plan does not create or
affect any right to direct runoff or create dam breach inundation areas that
extend onto adjacent properties. Whenever easements are required for water flow
directed onto a downstream property, they shall be obtained by the developer
and recorded in the Land Records of Carroll County. Easements for water flow
onto properties below publicly owned facilities shall be conveyed to the
county. Easements for water flow below privately owned facilities shall be
conveyed to the SWM facility owner. New residential, industrial, institutional,
or commercial buildings may not be built within any dam breach inundation area
on or off site unless the dam was designed and approved as a high hazard dam.
Any proposed roadway that crosses a dam breach inundation area shall meet the
requirements of MD 378 for hazard Class “A” dams unless the dam was approved as
a high hazard dam. The applicant shall acquire protective easements on areas
delineated outside of the property limits unless the dam was approved as a high
hazard dam. The easements shall protect the inundation area from future
development. Easements protecting dam breach inundation areas below publicly
owned facilities shall be conveyed to the county. Easements protecting dam
breach inundation areas below privately owned facilities shall be conveyed to
the SWM facility owner. Dam breach inundation easements shall be recorded in
the Land Records of Carroll County.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.001 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum standards for the
control of soil loss through erosion with the intent being to minimize sediment
transport through runoff that may degrade the integrity and health of the
county’s stream system. Minimum standards for management practices will be
applied through the issuance of grading permits for land disturbance that may
involve clearing, grubbing, grading, filling, and the movement of soil to alter
the topography and for forest harvest activities. Such standards will become
conditions of those permits and will be enforced. In addition, actions that may
not require grading permits will also be the subject of enforcement if such
actions result in erosion and/or sediment transport that may impact adjacent
properties or have the potential to result in impact to streams.

construction practices to minimize future damage, and to protect water supply,
sanitary sewage disposal, and natural drainage. The Maryland General Assembly,
in Md. Code, Land Use Article, Title 4, has established as policy of the state
that the orderly development and use of land and structures requires
comprehensive regulation through the implementation of planning and zoning
control, and that planning and zoning controls shall be implemented by local
government in order to, among other purposes, secure the public safety, promote
health and general welfare, and promote the conservation of natural resources.
   (B)   These regulations are not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing
regulations and ordinances, including subdivision regulations, zoning
ordinances, building codes, or any existing easements, covenants, or deed
restrictions. In the event of a conflict between these regulations and any
other ordinance, the more restrictive shall govern.
   (C)   Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform
vital natural functions such as temporary storage of flood waters, moderation
of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, prevention of erosion,
provision of habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations, and improved
aesthetics. These functions are best served if all floodplains are kept in
their natural state. The natural characteristics of floodplains and their
associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced.
   (D)   This chapter provides a unified, comprehensive approach to floodplain
management, which addresses the following: natural floodplain functions, the
federal and state programs concerned with floodplain management, and correction
of existing deficiencies in the program.
   (E)   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by
the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect
the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof, other than the
part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

2014; Ord. 2015-07, passed 9-3-2015)
§ 153.002 APPLICABILITY.
   Any person proposing to conduct development within the floodplain regulated
by this chapter shall obtain approval for that development from the county, and
shall comply with all provisions of this chapter prior to conducting the
development.
(2004 Code, § 114-2) (Ord. 04-04, passed 4-5-2004)
§ 153.003 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   (A)   The degree of flood protection provided by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering experience and
scientific methods of study.
   (B)   Floods of greater magnitude may occur and flood heights may be
increased by human-made or natural causes.
   (C)   This chapter does not imply that flooding will not occur outside of
the delineated floodplain, nor that permitted development and land uses within
the floodplain will be free of flooding and associated flood damage.
   (D)   Implementation of the provisions of this chapter does not create
liability on the part of the county, any officer, or employee thereof for any
damage that may result from reliance on this chapter.

injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed development and its contents (if
applicable) to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services to the community provided by the
proposed development.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to, or are subject to less, flooding or erosion damage.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.01 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect and maintain the ground and
surface water resources of the county by establishing minimum requirements for
the protection of groundwater and surface water resources that contribute to
existing or future community water supplies, standards for review of
development activities, management standards, and design criteria for land use
activities that occur subsequent to that review, and enforcement procedures for
violations of standards adopted herein that contribute to or become a source of
pollution. Management of both surface and groundwater resources will minimize
potential damage to community water supplies by helping to assure the
maintenance of minimum flows and storage capacity and by minimizing the
potential for contamination of those sources.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter are promulgated pursuant to the
authority of Md. Code, Environment Article, §§ 4-201 et seq., and §
3-110 of the Code of Public Local Laws. The application of this chapter and the
provisions expressed are the minimum standards to maintain county water
resources and are in addition to requirements of the zoning district, and shall
not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by state
statute.

§ 155.033 SUBDIVISION IN THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICT.
   (A)   Lot yield.
      (1)   In addition to the ability to create off conveyances as provided
for in this chapter, lots may be created for residential purposes from any
tract of land pursuant to the following standard: where the tract to be
subdivided is six to 20 acres, one new lot plus the remaining portion may be
created; and for tracts over 20 acres, an additional new lot may be created for
each 20-acre increment or part thereof. The area of a tract shall be calculated
to the nearest 0.0001 acres. For purposes of this section, the standard is
illustrated by this chart:
 
Size of Tract to be Subdivided New Lots Remaining Portion Total
Under 6 acres                  0        1                 1
6 – 20 acres                 1        1                 2
20.0001 – 40 acres           2        1                 3
40.0001 – 60 acres           3        1                 4
60.0001 – 80 acres           4        1                 5
 
      (2)   In addition to the lots which may be created pursuant to the A
District, Transferred Development Rights (TDRs), subject to the provisions of §
155.090, may be added when the result does not exceed a density standard of one
unit for each ten-acre increment. Any parcel from which a lot or lots have been
created by subdivision and recorded in the Land Records of Carroll County since
February 14, 1978, shall not be eligible for TDRs.
      (3)   A new subdivision lot created from a tract pursuant to division (A)
(1) above may not be further divided for residential purposes, and when a tract
is divided pursuant to division (A)(1), the owner shall designate on the
subdivision plat the new lot or lots being created and the remaining portion,
if any, and whether the remaining portion may be entitled to further division
pursuant to division (A)(1) above.
      (4)   Divisions (A)(1) and (2) above shall have no application to
preliminary subdivision plans for residential purposes approved by the Planning
and Zoning Commission prior to April 29, 1978; provided, however, that a
preliminary subdivision plan approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission may
not be revised to increase the density.
      (5)   Where land is described in a deed recorded in the Land Records of
Carroll County as of April 23, 1963, which separately describes adjoining
tracts of land such as a multi-parcel deed and where any of such separate
adjoining tracts are existing and separated after July 1, 1989, by being
individually conveyed or being individually presented for subdivision, then
each tract so separated may be subdivided for residential purposes pursuant to
the following standard: where the tract to be subdivided is six to 20 acres,
one new lot plus the remaining portion may be created; and for tracts of 20
acres or more, one new lot may be created for each full 20-acre increment plus
the remaining portion.
      (6)   Reconfiguration for the purpose of increasing the overall density
beyond the individual lots yielded from the tracts or lawfully reconfigured
tracts which existed as of July 1, 1989 is prohibited.
   (B)   Utilization of adjoining tracts.
      (1)   When lots are created for residential purposes in the A District,
the lots are to be located and sized so the agricultural land devoted to
residential use is minimized, and the amount of land retained for agricultural
use is maximized. The total density of adjoining tracts and legally created off
conveyances may be used to comply with these standards, and the lots resulting
from development of adjoining tracts may be located on one or more of the
tracts. In computing density for purposes of this section, tracts which are
subject to an Agricultural Preservation District agreement or easement may not
be counted. Total number of residential lots shall be based upon yield from
actual acres of various tracts.
      (2)   Where land on either side of a public road, or on either side of a
strip dividing an original tract and owned in fee simple by a public utility,
would otherwise be adjoining except for the existence of in fee public
ownership of the road or public utility strip, such confronting tracts may be
considered adjoining under this division (B). The tracts shall be considered
adjoining only for the purpose of transferring density but not for the purpose
of increasing density beyond what is otherwise allowed.
      (3)   Whenever density from a transferring tract is relocated onto one or
more adjoining tracts, the transferring tract shall retain at least one
residential building right or the transferring tract shall be combined with
another tract or tracts unless modified by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (C)   Development of agricultural remaining portions.
      (1)   Further development of the remaining portion for purposes other
than agricultural or residential, as allowed by §
158.071.01 under the "Agricultural" land use category, shall be limited as
shown in the chart below, with no further subdivision of the remaining portion
allowed. For purposes of this subsection, a use shall be considered a single
building, as defined in §
158.002, or area of use for outdoor uses.
 
Size of Remaining Portion Number of Principal Permitted or Conditional Uses
                          Allowed
0-40 acres                1
More than 40 acres        2
 
(Ord. 2022-19, passed 10-20-2022)
§ 155.034 SUBDIVISION IN THE CONSERVATION DISTRICT.
   (A)   Utilization of adjoining tracts.
      (1)   When lots are created for residential purposes in the C District
under a cluster subdivision, the lots are to be located and sized so the
agricultural or conservation land devoted to residential use is minimized, and
the amount of land retained for agricultural or conservation use and open space
is maximized. The total density of adjoining tracts and legally created off
conveyances may be used to comply with these standards, and the lots resulting
from development of adjoining tracts may be located on one or more of the
tracts. In computing density for purposes of this section, tracts which are
subject to an Agricultural Preservation District Agreement or easement may not
be counted.
      (2)   Where land on either side of a public road, or on either side of a
strip dividing an original tract and owned in fee simple by a public utility,
would otherwise be adjoining except for the existence of in fee public
ownership of the road or public utility strip, such confronting tracts may be
considered adjoining under this division (A). The tracts shall be considered
adjoining only for the purpose of transferring density but not for the purpose
of increasing density beyond what is otherwise allowed.
      (3)   Whenever density from a transferring tract is relocated onto one or
more adjoining tracts, the transferring tract shall retain at least one
residential building right or the transferring tract shall be combined with
another tract or tracts unless otherwise subject to any conditions imposed by
the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(Ord. 2022-19, passed 10-20-2022)
§ 155.035 RURAL DESIGN STANDARDS FOR AGRICULTURAL AND CONSERVATION DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Unless otherwise determined by the Planning and Zoning Commission, new
residential building lots proposed to be created in the A and C Districts shall
be:
      (1)   Located in low priority woodlands or on pastureland rather than
productive cropland;
      (2)   Located to avoid prevailing winds from blowing odors toward
homesites from existing or future barnyards, silos, and other similar farm
buildings or related uses;
      (3)   Designed at a minimum lot size of one acre and with development
optimized to achieve the maximum possible amount of land remaining for
agricultural purposes;
      (4)   Designed at a minimum lot size as required by
Chapter 158 in the C District, unless clustered in accordance with this
chapter. This minimum lot size shall apply to the remainder and all proposed
lots; and
      (5)   Designed, whenever possible, to avoid the construction of new
streets or additional entrances onto a public street.
   (B)   In the Agricultural District, agriculture is the preferred use and a
notice to this effect shall be stated on a final plat creating residential
building lots in the district:
      “Agriculture is the preferred use in the Agricultural District. All
agricultural operations shall be permitted at any time, including the operation
of farm machinery and no agricultural use shall be subject to restriction
because it interferes with other uses permitted in the district.”
(Ord. 2022-19, passed 10-20-2022)

publicly maintained road and the legal record if any of such access shall be
incorporated in the deed which creates the off conveyance.
      (2)   No off conveyance lot or remainder may be created after July 1,
1989, without a right-of-way of record or legal access to and from a publicly
maintained road.
      (3)   No off conveyance lot may be created from within an off conveyance
lot after July 1, 1989, unless the record title holder of the remainder from
which an additional off conveyance could be created and the record title holder
of the first off conveyance consent thereto by joining in and signing the
application.
      (4)   The Director of the Department of Public Works, or its successor
agency, may waive the requirement of division (B)(1)(f) of this section.
      (5)   Deeds which create off conveyance lots or remainders shall identify
by title in the deed that it is a "deed of off conveyance" or "deed of
remainder," respectively.
      (6)   No building permit may be issued for any off conveyance lot or
remainder created after July 1, 1989, unless it was created pursuant to this
chapter.
   (C)   An off conveyance lot shall be created by recordation of a deed within
180 days after the approval given pursuant to division (A)(2) above, unless
otherwise extended in writing by the Department.
   (D)   For purposes of these regulations, where a tract, parcel, or remainder
is crossed by a publicly maintained road, and the road is not owned in fee
simple by a government agency, it shall be deemed that the road has divided the
land into separate parcels. One parcel, as determined by the owner, may be
conveyed without obtaining subdivision approval. The other parcel designated as
a hangover parcel may also be separately conveyed, subject to the following
requirements:
      (1)   If the hangover parcel is eligible for subdivision for the creation
of two or more buildable lots as defined in §
155.005 under the current zoning regulations, it shall be treated as a tract or
parcel described in a single deed existing prior to April 23, 1963, and shall
not be eligible for any off conveyance lots unless the record title holder of
the remaining land from which the off conveyance lots could be created
expressly transfers the right to one or both off conveyance lots by an
instrument recorded among the Land Records of Carroll County.
      (2)   If the hangover parcel is not eligible for subdivision for the
creation of two or more buildable lots as defined in §
155.005 under the current zoning regulations, the hangover parcel shall be
subject to regulation as an off conveyance lot as set forth in divisions (A)
and (B) above, but not division (B)(1)(e).
      (3)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in divisions (D)(1) and
(2) above and to the extent eligible off conveyance lots, as determined from
the original tract, cannot be created from the remaining land, these off
conveyance lots may be created from the hangover parcel.
      (4)   The creation or conveyance of a hangover parcel shall not count
against the number of off conveyance lots to which the tract from which it was
derived is otherwise entitled. Neither the creation or conveyance of a hangover
parcel, nor any later subdivision of the hangover parcel, shall in any way
diminish the number of any off conveyance lots to which the tract from which it
was derived was otherwise entitled.
      (5)   At the time of the first conveyance of the hangover parcel, the
deed shall recite that the parcel being conveyed is a hangover parcel.
   (E)   It is the intent of this chapter to recognize the lawful creation of
certain lots and remainders after April 23, 1963, based upon the regulations
and laws in effect at the time the lots were created. It is also the intent of
this chapter to prohibit the development of lots which were illegally created
after April 23, 1963. Therefore, the subdivision regulations in existence at
the time the lot was created shall control.

possible, and shall not branch more than once.
   (L)   Turnarounds. Turnaround areas shall be used for vehicles turning
around only and shall not be used for parking or driveway entrances.
   (M)   Administrative modifications. The width and centerline radius
requirements for UIC driveways may be reduced by up to 20% at the discretion of
the Director through an administrative modification process.
   (N)   Modifications. Where the Planning and Zoning Commission finds that
because of unusual circumstances of shape and topography or other physical
features or conditions of the proposed subdivision, or because of the nature of
adjacent developments, extraordinary hardship may result from strict compliance
with the UIC design requirements of §
155.039 and current County Standards, there may be granted a modification when
requested by the developer/owner. However, no such modification shall be
granted which will have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of the
Master Plan, the zoning regulations, this chapter or any other pertinent rules,
regulations or laws of the county. Prior to considering such requests, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall refer the matter for technical agency
review, which may include the Department of Public Safety or the Department of
Fire & EMS. In granting modifications, the Planning and Zoning Commission will
consider the comments from the technical review agencies and may require such
conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objectives of the
standards of the requirements so waived or Chapter 155, Development and
Subdivision of Land modified. The applicant shall submit a written request for
a modification to the county. The request shall include the specific conditions
necessitating a modification and include supporting documentation. Any
modification for a particular subdivision or development shall be noted on the

§ 155.040 TRANSFER OF LOT YIELD ACROSS ZONING LINES.
   (A)   Authority. The Planning and Zoning Commission may, in the exercise of
its discretion, approve the transfer of residential building lot yield across
zoning lines of the A and C Districts, provided the tracts or parcels are
contiguous and in common ownership.
   (B)   Restrictions.
      (1)   If residential lot yield is transferred across zoning lines of the
A and C Districts, no further subdivision of the resulting land or lots may be
approved for any purpose.
      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission may, in the exercise of its
discretion, require that residential lot yield derived from the C District be
clustered subject to the conditions set forth in this section and §
155.036(B).
   (C)   Conditions. The subdivision lots shall be clustered subject to the
following conditions which supersede the requirements of §
158.071.03.
      (1)   Objectives. The transfer shall achieve one or more of the following
objectives:
         (a)   Avoid development on high quality agricultural soils;
         (b)   Increase the acreage, soil quality, or contiguity of the
unimproved portions of the parcel remaining after subdivision;
         (c)   Reduce development impacts to sensitive environmental features
or ground or surface water quality; or
         (d)   Ensure that the undeveloped portion of the parcel remaining
after subdivision and development comprises a more desirable piece of farmland
for purposes of production or ownership.
      (2)   Minimum/maximum. Individual lots shall be a minimum of one acre and
a maximum of two acres in size with a minimum lot width of 150 feet. The front
yard shall be at least 40 feet, the side yards shall be at least 20 feet, and
the rear yard shall be at least 50 feet. Lots shall be designed to maximize the
resulting land, which is defined as the land derived from the reduction from
the three-acre minimum lot area requirement of the C District.
      (3)   Total number. The total number of lots and dwelling units shall not
exceed the number that would be permitted if the area would be developed in
conformance with its topographic characteristics, percolation requirements, and
normal minimum lot size requirements. If one or more lots proposed for transfer
are located on soils or slopes questionable in their ability to pass a
percolation test, the Planning and Zoning Commission may require percolation
tests as needed to determine the number of lots that would be viable without
the transfer option.
      (4)   Clustering. All individual lots shall be clustered and arranged to
minimize potential environmental or agricultural resource degradation. Lot
clustering and arrangement shall be dependent on the physical characteristics
of the site.
      (5)   No further subdivision. Residential lots may not be further
subdivided. The record plat shall contain a general note indicating the
restriction against further subdivision.
      (6)   Disposition of resulting land.
         (a)   The developer and/or property owner shall offer the resulting
land to the county for right of first refusal. If accepted by the county, the
property owner shall convey the resulting land to the county by deed approved
by the County Attorney at the time of recordation of the subdivision plat.
         (b)   If the county does not accept the resulting land, the developer
may elect to allow the resulting land to be owned in common among the residents
of the subdivision or to recombine the resulting land with one buildable lot in
the subdivision to be owned privately.
         (c)   If the resulting land is to be owned in common among the
residents of the subdivision, the developer shall establish a homeowners'
association. Access to the resulting land shall be carefully designed and
located to enable perpetual maintenance and accessibility.
         (d)   If the resulting land is to be recombined with a lot and owned
privately, the resulting land may be used as allowed in the zoning district in
which it is located. The resulting land shall be subject to any easement
required by the County Code, subject to any modification deemed necessary by
the County Commissioners to preserve the resulting land for agricultural
purposes.
         (e)   The disposition of the resulting land shall be clearly set forth
on the subdivision plat at the time of recordation.
      (7)   Easement. A permanent preservation or conservation easement, in a
legal form satisfactory to the County Attorney, shall be executed for the
remaining portion and resulting land and shall be noted as a condition of
approval on the record plat. The easement shall restrict future subdivision and
development on the remaining portion to one buildable lot right that may not be
subdivided from the remaining portion.
   (D)   Procedure.
      (1)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the application
of the transfer option at the concept phase of a residential subdivision plan.
      (2)   In determining whether or not to approve the transfer option, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall consider the following criteria:
         (a)   Avoidance of soil types that are best suited for agriculture;
         (b)   Reductions in impervious surfaces and stormwater runoff;
         (c)   Proximity of lots to potable water supplies;
         (d)   Reduced impacts to sensitive environmental features such as
steep slopes, wetlands, floodplains, and forested areas;
         (e)   Reduction of ingress and egress points on public roadways; and
         (f)   Benefits of placing a permanent preservation or conservation
easement on the remaining portion and resulting land.

safety of transportation that are affected by the proposed improvements and the
Planning and Zoning Commission may require the owner to enter into a PWA,
secured by a suitable guaranty, which implements any requirements of the
Planning and Zoning Commission. The developer/owner may be required to
contribute to a fund to be used to upgrade the transportation facility which is
determined to be inadequate on a basis that prorates the effect of the
development on the transportation facility; and
         (h)   Require certification of the adequacy of public facilities by
the agencies having jurisdiction over public facilities in the county,
including but not limited to the following: public water and sewer facilities,
police protection, roads and traffic control devices, storm drain facilities,
emergency service facilities, and solid waste disposal facilities. The Planning
and Zoning Commission may consider and may use the failure of any agency to
certify the adequacy of any public facility or service to serve a proposed site
as a basis for disapproval of a site development plan. Site plans for
residential development shall be reviewed for conformity with §§
156.01 through
156.07.
      (3)   Validity. A site plan shall become void 18 months after the date of
written approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission unless a building permit
or Zoning Certificate has been issued for the project. In the event the
building permit or Zoning Certificate is revoked or is terminated prior to the
issuance of a final use and occupancy certificate, the site plan becomes void
on the date of revocation or termination. At the written request of the
developer/owner, the Director may grant an extension.

SPECIFIC AREAS
§ 155.090 MINERAL RESOURCE RECOVERY AREA.
   (A)   Community involvement in the site plan review process.
      (1)   An applicant for site plan approval under this subchapter shall
submit a concept plan prior to submission of a detailed mineral resource
recovery site plan and the accompanying documentation. The applicant shall then
hold a site visit and tour of the subject property for the County
Commissioners, the Planning and Zoning Commission, adjoining property owners,
appropriate state agencies, and interested citizens for the purpose of
explaining the concept plan.
      (2)   Following the site visit, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
conduct the community involvement meeting. The applicant for the mineral
resource recovery operation shall present the concept plan for comment and
discussion concerning siting and location of processing operations, setback
requirements, screening, berming, landscaping, and transportation routes.
      (3)   After the community involvement meeting, the applicant may submit
the site plans and accompanying documentation to the county.
      (4)   Adjoining property owners, the County Commissioners, and the
Planning and Zoning Commission will be notified by the applicant, by first
class mail, of the date, time, and place of the site visit and tour and the
community involvement meeting. There will also be a public notice specifying
the date, time, and place of the site visit and tour and the community
involvement meeting, which will be advertised twice by the applicant in one
newspaper of general circulation in the area in which the mining is proposed to
occur. The public notice shall appear no more than 14 and no less than seven
days in advance of the site visit and tour and the community involvement
meeting. The site shall be posted with a notice of the time and place of the
site visit and tour and community involvement meeting at least two weeks before
the tour and the meeting.
   (B)   Application requirements to establish mineral resource operation. An
applicant for site plan approval for a mineral resource recovery operation
shall submit a site development plan to the Planning and Zoning Commission. The
site development plan shall contain the following:
      (1)   All information as required by the site plan checklist;
      (2)   A copy of the documents submitted to obtain state permits for the
extractive operation and all correspondence received from the state;
      (3)   A comprehensive, site-specific, geologic/hydrogeologic analysis
that shall include at a minimum:
         (a)   Site geologic mapping: geologic contacts, bedrock outcrops,
faults, three subsurface cross-sections perpendicular to regional strike or
mineral deposit;
         (b)   The location of current and any known historical sinkholes on
site or on adjacent properties;
         (c)   Fracture trace analysis;
         (d)   Hydrogeologic mapping: ground and surface watershed boundaries;
water balance analysis; aquifer test data, results, and evaluation; depth to
water table using borehole data and a water table map; three subsurface cross-
sections perpendicular to strike or mineral deposit; and
         (e)   The location of all wells within the zone of influence of the
proposed pit as designated by the state. The data should include depth, yield,
water quality, length of casing, and status whether used, unused, or abandoned.

availability of any abandoned water-filled pits for future public water
supplies;
      (9)   The description of all proposed or anticipated truck haul routes
within the county and a traffic impact study performed by a licensed traffic
engineer that addresses the effects of any proposed mineral resource recovery
activity on present and projected levels of service, adequacy of the present
and planned road system, road safety conditions, pavement impact and breakdown,
bridge capacity, and other factors related to traffic flow and safety. The
criteria to be included in the traffic impact study will be dependent upon a
pre-study conference which considers factors such as proximity of the
development to residential and other land uses, the size of the resource
recovery operation through initial recovery stages and peak operation, and any
other factors deemed necessary by the Planning Commission;
      (10)   A map detailing the location of any other mineral resource
operation that may exist within one-half mile of the site; and
      (11)   Any additional analyses and plans requested by the Planning and
Zoning Commission for the purpose of monitoring compliance with the regulations
and performance standards of the zone.
   (C)   Special requirements for development in the MRO.
      (1)   Except as provided in §
158.096(B)(5), within an MRO, residential building lots created after March 1,
1992 shall only be located on portions of a parcel not overlaid by the Viable
Resource Area (VRA). Development in the Mineral Resource Notification Area
(MRN) should be located to minimize conflicts between the development and the
planned or existing mineral resource recovery operation.
      (2)   On properties where residential building lots cannot be located
outside of the VRA based upon the boundaries of the properties as they existed
on January 1, 1991, a transfer of development right (TDR) will be permitted to
another area within the A, R-40,000, R-20,000, and R-10,000 Districts cluster
subdivision, pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   All subdivision plans, site plans, record plats, and building
permits dealing with land in the MRN shall contain notations identifying the
property as lying within a MRO and as within one-half mile of an area where
mineral resource recovery operations are currently occurring or may occur in
the future.
   (D)   Transfer of development rights (TDR). The owner of a parcel on which a
VRA designation has been placed has the right to create residential lots only
at the density permitted in the underlying zoning district, subject to the
provisions of this chapter. The property owner may transfer the development
rights to property in the A District pursuant to the provisions of this chapter
or to property zoned R-40,000, R-20,000, and R-10,000 Districts which is being
subdivided under the cluster subdivision provisions in this chapter, and
pursuant to the following:
      (1)   Creation of a TDR will be permitted by the Planning and Zoning
Commission only when it determines that residential lots cannot be clustered
from the portion of the property designated VRA to a portion of the property or
to adjoining property under the same ownership not designated VRA.
      (2)   Before an owner of property which has been given approval to create
TDRs may transfer these rights, the owner shall:
         (a)   File an application for a TDR with the Bureau. A metes and
bounds description of the property and a survey plat, prepared by a registered
engineer or surveyor and certified to be correct, shall accompany each
application;
         (b)   Obtain written approval from the Planning and Zoning Commission
of the base number of development rights on the property; and
         (c)   Once the Planning and Zoning Commission has determined the base
number of development rights, that number shall be multiplied by two, which
shall be the total number of development rights available for transfer.
      (3)   At the time of the approval of the total number of TDRs, a serial
number shall be assigned to each development right approved.
      (4)   Before a TDR may occur, the owner of the property from which the
development rights have been approved shall record a TDR easement in the Land
Records of Carroll County, as well as file a copy with the Bureau. The easement
shall state the total number of development rights approved on the property.
The recordation of the TDR easement creates a permanent easement against
residential subdivision or development of land for residential use on the
property.
      (5)   At the time of transfer of a development right or rights, a deed of
TDR shall be recorded in the Land Records of Carroll County, and a copy placed
on file with the Bureau.
      (6)   When subdivision approval is given by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and a plat recorded for a property using TDR, a TDR extinguishment
shall be recorded in the Land Records of Carroll County and a copy filed with
the Bureau.
      (7)   All preliminary subdivision plans on which TDRs are to be
incorporated shall have a notation as to the number of lots on the plan that
are being created through TDR. The plan shall also contain the serial number of
each TDR lot being used. A copy of the deed of TDR shall accompany each
subdivision plan using TDR.
      (8)   Subdivision of land in the A District which utilizes TDR shall be
performed in accordance with this chapter and any applicable development guides
and standards.
      (9)   Subdivision of parcels in the R-40,000, R-20,000, and R-10,000
cluster subdivision utilizing TDR shall be performed in accordance with this
chapter.
(Ord. 2022-19, passed 10-20-2022)
§ 155.091 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT (PUD).
   (A)   Applicability. A planned unit development (PUD) may be approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, as permitted in §§
158.074(C) and
158.075(C), subject to all the following provisions of this section.
   (B)   Purpose and objectives.
      (1)   Within the limit of these requirements, it is the purpose of the
PUD to provide suitable sites for relatively higher density types of
residential structures in areas zoned R-10,000 and R-7,500, and to permit the
optimum amount of freedom and variety in the design and management of such
varying types of residential structures, including one- and two-family units,
townhouses, and garden apartments within the areas designated.
      (2)   The following objectives are sought in providing for the PUD:
         (a)   To provide a more attractive and varied living environment than
would be possible through the strict application of Residential District
requirements;
         (b)   To encourage developers to use a more creative approach in the
development of land;
         (c)   To encourage a more intimate, efficient, and aesthetic use of
open space; and
         (d)   To encourage variety in the physical development patterns of
residential areas.
   (C)   Area.
      (1)   The proposed PUD shall normally include a tract of land not less
than 20 acres in a R-10,000 District and ten acres in a R-7,500 District.
      (2)   A PUD may be considered on a parcel of land of less than ten acres
if it has a common boundary with a R-7,500 District, but in no case shall a
tract of land of less than five acres be considered.
      (3)   Where the acreage in a PUD project is 100 acres or more, the
Planning and Zoning Commission may approve, as part of the overall plan, a
planned commercial center in which C-1 District uses may be located in
accordance with this chapter; provided, however, that such planned commercial
center is located in a manner as to be an integral part of the development
itself and not a means of servicing adjacent areas, or such a basis by which a
commercial district may be extended to adjacent properties.
   (D)   Designation of planned unit development.
      (1)   Land zoned properly and meeting the minimum requirements may be
designated by the Planning and Zoning Commission as suitable for a PUD and may
be developed by the owner, if the owner so desires, according to the
requirements and standards herein.
      (2)   No land shall be designated as a PUD unless it satisfactorily meets
such additional criteria as to suitability for such a development as may have
been adopted by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Such criteria shall include
but not be limited to present or potential adequacy of schools, and highway
access.
   (E)   Type and use of structures.
      (1)   Dwelling units may include single-family, two-family, or multi-
family structures, based on density requirements, standards described, the
nature of the adjacent development, and compensating features of the
development plan. The Planning and Zoning Commission may also approve places of
public assembly, recreational buildings, and accessory buildings if primarily
for use by persons residing within the PUD and if located and planned in a
manner not detrimental to adjacent properties.
      (2)   The sum of the number of dwelling units in multi-family structures
shall not constitute more than 60% of all dwelling units of all types.
   (F)   Density.
      (1)   The gross residential density of a PUD shall not exceed the
equivalent of six dwelling units per gross acre. Such density shall be
calculated as follows, as applicable to multi-family structures:
         (a)   Each efficiency apartment dwelling unit is equivalent to 0.50
units;
         (b)   Each one-bedroom multi-family or apartment unit is equivalent to
0.75 units;
         (c)   Each two-bedroom multi-family or apartment dwelling unit is
equivalent to 1.00 unit; and
         (d)   Each three-bedroom multi-family or apartment dwelling unit is
equivalent to 1.50 units.
      (2)   Calculation of gross acreage shall include all land within the PUD
tract, regardless of use, and if it abuts an external motorway to which access
is permitted may include one-half of the right-of-way thereof, but not
exceeding 30 feet.
   (G)   Open space. Common open space shall comprise not less than 25% of the
gross area. Such space shall include land area to be developed as recreational
areas or which is designated for the common use of all occupants of the PUD,
but shall not include streets, off street parking areas, or utility easements.
The Planning and Zoning Commission must be furnished satisfactory evidence as a
condition for approval that such open space area will be continued and that
perpetual maintenance is provided for.
   (H)   Sanitary facilities. Prior to accepting for approval a development
plan for a PUD, the Planning and Zoning Commission must be furnished
satisfactory evidence that acceptable community water and sewerage systems will
be provided and approved by the Carroll County Health Department and any other
agency having jurisdiction over such matters.
   (I)   Development plan.
      (1)   Applications for approval of PUD shall be accompanied by a
development plan prepared by a licensed architect, registered civil engineer,
professional landscape architect, or other qualified land planner. The
development plan shall be to scale and contain sufficient information to
establish the identity of proposed uses, grades, and approximate dimensions and
locations of proposed structures, streets, parking areas, walkways, easements,
and property lines.
      (2)   After approval of the development plan by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, any material change therein shall require a resubmission of such
plan for approval. In any case, where an approval has been given by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and construction has not started within one year
thereafter, such approval of the PUD shall automatically be terminated.
   (J)   Standards for location of dwelling types.
      (1)   Within 100 feet of any other property in a Residential District,
other than a R-7,500 District, dwellings shall be of single-family types.
      (2)   As a condition for approval of a PUD in which multi-family
dwellings are proposed, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall require, over
and above other standards herein, that these uses be so arranged and
distributed, and appropriately related to public open space, single-family
dwellings, or semi-detached dwellings that higher densities are not
unreasonably and disproportionately concentrated in these locations, or so
located as to concentrate traffic on minor residential streets.
   (K)   Bulk requirements.
      (1)   Bulk requirements shall be as follows:

§ 155.092 PLANNED COMMERCIAL CENTERS (PCC).
   (A)   Approval of certain types of centers by Planning and Zoning
Commission. In any commercial district, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
approve a neighborhood-type shopping center or a community-type shopping center
subject to the provisions hereinafter set forth under this subchapter.
   (B)   Development plan.
      (1)   The development plan shall show such items as the size of the
project, the location and approximate shapes of buildings, road ingress and
egress patterns, parking areas, storm drainage and water and sewerage
facilities, and such other information as is necessary for the Planning and
Zoning Commission to give the necessary consideration.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Planning and Zoning Commission to
ascertain whether the location, size, and other characteristics of the site,
and the proposed plan, comply with the following conditions:
         (a)   The proposed PCC will not cause points of traffic congestion on
existing or planned future roads in the areas of such proposed location; and
         (b)   The plans provide for a PCC consisting of one or more groups of
establishments in buildings of integrated and harmonious design, together with
adequate and properly arranged traffic and parking facilities and landscaping,

§ 156.01 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that proposed or planned
residential growth proceeds at a rate that will not unduly strain public
facilities, including schools, roads, water and sewer facilities, and police,
fire, and emergency medical services.
   (B)   This chapter establishes minimum adequacy standards or thresholds for
these facilities and services and mandates that the cumulative impacts of
proposed or planned residential growth, within the incorporated municipalities

REQUIREMENTS
§ 157.20 GENERAL STANDARDS FOR DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   The landscape plan shall incorporate species diversity. Any proposed
use of a monoculture will require county approval.
   (B)   Requirements for species diversity. A site that requires more than 15
PU shall provide plantings to create diversity at the following minimum
percentages: 20% species and 25% genus. These percentages apply to major and
minor deciduous trees and evergreen trees.
   (C)   Plant quantity requirements. Minimum required plant quantities shall
be based on PUs. Caliper size shall be in accordance with ANLA standards. One
PU equals:
      (1)   One major deciduous tree at least one and one-half inches in
caliper at installation;
      (2)   Two minor deciduous trees one inch in caliper at installation;
      (3)   Two evergreen trees at least five feet in height at installation;
      (4)   Five shrubs, 18 inches in height at installation depending on
screen type;
      (5)   Five hundred square feet of groundcover at recommended ANLA
standards;
      (6)   Ten herbaceous or perennial plants at one-gallon size may only be
used to meet Class D screening, as set forth in this chapter; and
      (7)   Twenty herbaceous or perennial plants at one-quart size may only be
used to meet Class D screening, as set forth in this chapter.
   (D)   Screening.
      (1)   General requirements. 
         (a)   Screening is required to diminish the impact of undesirable
views and mitigate the visual conflict and other effects (noise, fumes, and
light spillover) of adjacent dissimilar land uses. Screening shall consist of
trees and shrubs, fences, berms in conjunction with planting materials, solid
brick or architectural block walls. The degree of intensity of adjacent land
uses and width of landscape strip available as a buffer will dictate the
height, density, opacity, and landscape elements required.
         (b)   Screening is required for nonresidential uses adjacent to
residential zones or uses, dumpsters, storage and loading areas, service lanes,
parking lots, and other conditions as required.
         (c)   A minimum ten-foot wide landscape strip is required to
accommodate screen planting unless otherwise stated in this chapter or the
Manual.
         (d)   Screening may be waived in whole or in part by the county
provided the developer can demonstrate that adequate and perpetual screening
exists on an adjacent property.
      (2)   Screen types.
         (a)   Class A.
            1.   The function of Class A is to provide a visual screen that
will give the required level of height, density, and opacity depending on site
conditions. The screen may range from a solid linear screen of evergreen trees
where maximum opacity is needed to a loosely staggered screen where a filtered
view is appropriate, based on site conditions. A combination of major deciduous
trees, minor deciduous trees, evergreen trees, and shrubs may be used.
            2.   Minimum size at installation shall be 18 inches for shrubs and
five feet for evergreen trees.
            3.   A six-foot high opaque fence or wall may be required in
conjunction with a planting screen.
            4.   PUs shall be generated at one PU per 20 linear feet of the
area to be screened.
         (b)   Class B.
            1.   The function of Class B is to screen parking lots and service
lanes while maintaining views into the site.
            2.   Minimum height of shrubs at installation shall be 18 inches.
Shrubs must provide a minimum three-foot high year-round visual screen at
maturity.
            3.   A three-foot high solid fence or wall may be required in
conjunction with planting screen.
            4.   PUs shall be generated at one PU per 20 linear feet of the
area to be screened.
         (c)   Class C.
            1.   The function of Class C area is to provide a spatial and
vegetative buffer between single-family residences and other uses.
            2.   Where screening is required, a minimum 15-foot buffer shall be
established. A minimum of 30% of the required PUs shall be evergreen trees and
a minimum of 50% shall be major deciduous trees.
            3.   PUs shall be generated at one PU per 15 linear feet of area to
be screened.
            4.   The use of a planting scheme reflective of the natural state
landscape is required for proposed plantings.
            5.   Existing tree canopy coverage may be approved as credit toward
this requirement based on the size and condition of the existing tree canopy.
         (d)   Class D.
            1.   The function of Class D is to provide low level planting to
give visual relief from paved areas while maintaining the view of outside
display areas. Street trees combined with a Class D screen provide continuity
of streetscape. Mature planting shall be a minimum of 24 inches in height,
measured from the top of curb of the adjacent road. A combination of mature
(two years after planting) plant height and berm height may be used to achieve
the minimum height. Herbaceous plants may be used at recommended ANLA
standards.
            2.   Class D screen may also be satisfied by increasing the
landscape setback to 15 feet and providing a 24-inch minimum height grassed
berm along the length of the display area.
            3.   PUs shall be generated at one PU per 25 linear feet of display
area adjacent to the public right-of-way.
   (E)   Fence specifications.
      (1)   For board-on-board fences, the minimum wood panel thickness shall
be one-half inch. The minimum frame size shall be two inches by four inches and
minimum post size shall be four inches by four inches.
      (2)   Fences or walls shall be constructed of durable, low maintenance
materials coordinated with the materials used on building facades.
      (3)   Fencing or walls shall be placed on the inside edge of the
landscape strip with planting on the residential or street side of the fence
or, in wider buffers, placed to allow planting on both sides of the fence.
Fencing shall be located at the grade elevation that achieves the required
screening.
      (4)   Security fencing along a public right-of-way may not be placed in a
county right-of-way and shall be set back ten feet to allow planting on the
street side of the fence.
      (5)   Proposed grades, fence location, and construction detail are
required on the landscape plan.
   (F)   Credit for preservation and conservation of existing trees.
      (1)   Credit may be given for the preservation of major trees existing
within the buildable area of a development site when they are in a location and
of a nature that they contribute to the purpose and objectives of this chapter.
A credit of two PUs shall be given for each major tree three inches or greater
in caliper if the tree is healthy and in good condition and form as determined
by the county. The identification of trees proposed for conservation shall be
shown on the preliminary plan of subdivision or site plan and identified in a
table included on the plan that outlines the location of the trees, their
species, size and condition. A determination of final credit to be given will
follow field verification of the listed data. The final landscape plan shall
include landscape tree protection measures.
      (2)   In addition to credit for landscape units, credit may also be given
toward compliance with §§
150.20 through
150.41, Forest Conservation.
      (3)   Trees proposed for conservation shall be native species or
noninvasive, nonnative species appropriate for inclusion in their new setting.
Credit may not be given for unacceptable species as listed in the Manual. Trees
shall also be in good health and free from pests that would compromise their
survivability. Trees shall also be in a location that will enhance the ultimate
landscape of the development. The following conservation standards shall be
adhered to.
         (a)   The critical root zone of trees designated for preservation
shall be protected from disturbance and compaction.
         (b)   Other conservation measures may also be warranted, i.e., root
pruning, crown reduction, etc., if conditions dictate and the value of the
conservation is greater than the value of the measures to be undertaken.
         (c)   Isolated trees shall be protected with individual measures.
Groups of trees may be encircled as they stand to a point approximating the
critical root zone of the outermost tree.
         (d)   The relocation of individual trees may be appropriate under
circumstances if the tree can be moved and replanted with a high probability of
survival.
         (e)   If trees are to be relocated an individual maintenance plan
designed to assist the tree in survival is required.
         (f)   Trees to be preserved shall be marked in the field and tree
protection measures shall be installed prior to the issuance of grading permit
for the site.
         (g)   A construction sequence, which includes installation and removal
of protective measures and any necessary maintenance, shall be submitted prior
to final approval.
         (h)   Appropriate corrective action shall be taken when trees are
inadvertently damaged. If it is determined that any part of a tree is in an
unsafe or dangerous condition, then that part of the tree shall be removed. If
the entire tree is affected, it shall be removed in its entirety. If the
hazardous condition is questionable, then the property owner shall employ a
certified arborist to inspect the tree and certify that the condition of the
tree is not a hazard and is not expected to be a hazard in the foreseeable
future. Damaged trees that require removal may not be credited toward any
required PUs.
         (i)   In accordance with §
157.21, the replacement value of the conserved trees shall be bonded in an
amount equal to the number of planting unit credits for a period of one year
from the initial inspection as determined by the county. Trees that exhibit
postconstruction stress at that time may require replacement with the
equivalent PUs.
   (G)   Unacceptable species. Species which may not be used in the landscape
design are listed in the Manual.
   (H)   Landscape plan preparation. All landscape plans shall be prepared by
a:
      (1)   Licensed landscape architect; or
      (2)   Qualified landscape designer:
         (a)   Having a degree or certificate from a recognized program in
horticulture, landscape design or a related field, and having two years
experience preparing plans and landscape construction drawings; or
         (b)   Having five years experience in preparing planting plans and
landscape construction drawings.
   (I)   Plan review and approval. Landscape plan requirements shall be
satisfied prior to Planning Commission approval. Placement of plant materials
shall conform to the requirements contained in the Manual.
   (J)   Installation.
      (1)   Standards to conform to the most recent version of the ANSI A300
Standards, Part 6 – Transplanting and Landscape Specifications Guidelines of
the Landscape Contractors Association, Maryland, District of Columbia and
Virginia.
      (2)   Planting on individual lots shall be installed upon final grading
inspection. No final grading approval shall be given on the building permit
until landscaping is complete.
   (K)   Maintenance responsibility. The owner of any property on which
landscaping has been installed pursuant to this chapter shall maintain the
landscaping in good condition in perpetuity. A landscape maintenance agreement
shall be required. Failure to replace dead or dying PUs or the removal of any
installed PUs is a violation of this chapter.
   (L)   Variances.
      (1)   The county may grant a variance to any of the technical
requirements included in this chapter in accordance with this section, if there
are exceptional circumstances that could result in one or more of the following
conditions:

circumstances peculiar to the site or setting exist that would cause undue
hardship or would contradict the specific standard that is the subject of the
variance request;
         (b)   A demonstration, in sufficient detail, that the granting of the
variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that would be
denied other similar submittals;
         (c)   A demonstration that the variance request is not based on
conditions or circumstances resulting from actions by the applicant; and
         (d)   A demonstration that the request, if granted, will not impair
environmental quality or result in any form of degradation.
      (3)   For any development located within an incorporated municipality, a
notice of a request for a variance to this chapter will be forwarded by the
applicant to the Mayor of that municipality. Proof of submittal to the
municipality shall be provided to the county.
      (4)   In granting a variance to this chapter, the county shall issue
written findings of fact that the applicant has met the requirements of the
above divisions (L)(1), (L)(2), and (L)(3) and that granting the variance is
consistent with the intent of this chapter.

§ 158.017 RULES FOR INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
official Zoning Maps, the following rules shall apply:
   (A)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of
streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines.
   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following property lines or
platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lines.
   (C)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be
construed as following city limits.
   (D)   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to
be midway between the main tracks.
   (E)   Boundaries which are drawn parallel to road lines and which do not
coincide with property lines or lot lines, and where not designated by
dimensions, shall be deemed to be 200 feet back from the nearest road
centerline.
   (F)   Boundaries which are in unsubdivided property or where a district
boundary divides a lot shall be determined by the use of the map scale as shown
thereon.
   (G)   Where a district boundary line as shown on the Zoning Map or Maps
divides a lot which was in single ownership and of record at the time of
enactment of this chapter the use authorized thereon and the other district
requirements applying to the least restricted portion of such lot under this
chapter shall be considered as extending to the entire lot, provided that the
more restricted portion of such lot is entirely within 50 feet of said dividing
district boundary line. The use so extended shall be deemed to be conforming.

§ 158.033 NONCONFORMING USES.
   Any building, structure, premises, or use lawfully existing at the time of
the adoption of this chapter, or lawfully existing at the time this chapter is
amended, may continue to be used even though such building, structure or
premises does not conform to use or dimensional regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located; subject, however, to the following provisions:
   (A)   Extension, expansion, or alteration of nonconforming use. The Zoning
Administrator may, subject to §§
155.050 and
158.130, authorize the extension or expansion of a nonconforming use or the
alteration of a nonconforming structure, with or without conditions, provided
that:
      (1)   Any changes or additions to the activities taking place in
connection with the nonconforming use will not change the use in any
substantial way.
      (2)   Extension or expansion limits:
         (a)   A structure or use that was rendered nonconforming for failure
to comply with bulk requirements may not exceed 50% of the gross floor area of
structures or 50% of the gross acreage of the use above that which legally
existed at the time the use first became nonconforming or above that which was
approved by the Zoning Administrator or Board of Zoning Appeals as of October
30, 2015.
         (b)   All other nonconforming use extension or expansions shall be
limited to 10% of the gross floor area of structures or 10% of the gross
acreage of the use above that which legally existed at the time the use first
became nonconforming or above that which was approved by the Zoning
Administrator or Board of Zoning Appeals as of October 30, 2015.
         (c)   This section shall not apply to residential structures or uses
in the Conservation District which were constructed when the property was in
the Agricultural District, in which cases the bulk requirements in place for
the Agricultural District at the time of construction shall apply.
      (3)   Any such extension or expansion may not increase residential
density beyond that which is permitted by the zoning provisions of the zoning
district in which the subject extension or expansion is located, or beyond that
which existed at the time the subject nonconforming use became nonconforming,
with the exception of attached accessory dwelling units that are permitted in
the zoning district.
      (4)   The outdoor land area occupied by a nonconforming use may be
enlarged only to provide additional parking area or to comply with an order of
the Carroll County Health Department to improve, replace, or expand a well or
septic area.
      (5)   An expansion would not exacerbate an existing bulk requirement
nonconformity or create a new violation of the bulk requirements for the zoning
district in which the property is located.
      (6)   The extension, expansion, or structural alteration would not cause
an adverse effect on neighboring properties.
      (7)   Any request for an extension, expansion, or alteration that exceeds
these criteria shall be forwarded and heard by the BZA.
      (8)   The Zoning Administrator may waive the hearing provisions of this
section for structural alterations that would expand or extend a structure that
is presently a nonconformity solely on the basis of failure to satisfy one or
more dimensional requirements if the proposed expansion or extension does not
exacerbate nor create new bulk requirement violations, and so long as the
proposed alteration does not exceed 50% of the footprint of the existing
structure.
   (B)   Extension, expansion, or alteration of nonconforming use. The BZA may,
subject to §§
155.050 and
158.133, authorize the extension or expansion of a nonconforming use or the
alteration of a nonconforming structure, with or without conditions, provided
that:
      (1)   Any changes or additions to the activities taking place in
connection with the nonconforming use will not change the use in any
substantial way.
      (2)   Extension or expansion limits:
         (a)   A structure or use that was rendered nonconforming for failure
to comply with bulk requirements may not exceed 100% of the gross floor area of
structures or 100% of the gross acreage of the use above that which legally
existed at the time the use first became nonconforming, or above that which was
approved by the Zoning Administrator or Board of Zoning Appeals as of October
30, 2015.
         (b)   All other nonconforming use extension or expansions shall be
limited to 50% of the gross floor area of structures or 50% of the gross
acreage of the use above that which legally existed at the time the use first
became nonconforming, or above that which was approved by the Zoning
Administrator or Board of Zoning Appeals as of October 30, 2015.
      (3)   Any such extension or expansion may not increase residential
density beyond that which is permitted by the zoning provisions of the zoning
district in which the subject extension or expansion is located, or beyond that
which existed at the time the subject nonconforming use became nonconforming,
with the exception of attached accessory dwelling units that are permitted in
the zoning district.
      (4)   The outdoor land area occupied by a nonconforming use may be
enlarged only to provide additional parking area or to comply with an order of
the Carroll County Health Department to improve, replace, or expand a well or
septic area.
      (5)   An expansion would not exacerbate an existing bulk requirement
nonconformity or create a new violation of the bulk requirements for the zoning
district in which the property is located.
      (6)   The extension, expansion, or structural alteration would not cause
an adverse effect on neighboring properties.
   (C)   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
building, structure, or premises may, with approval of the BZA, subject to §
158.133(G), be changed to another nonconforming use which in the opinion of the
BZA is of the same or a more appropriate use or classification unless the use
is specifically prohibited in the district. The use need not meet the bulk
requirements, except for minimum lot area, of the underlying zoning district;
however, it shall meet all other requirements of the County Code, including any
requirement of the Carroll County Health Department. In the case of a
nonconforming junkyard operation, the BZA may, based on specific findings of
fact, decide upon an application filed by the land owner as to whether a
relocation of a nonconforming junkyard operation, either in whole or in part,
to another location on the immediate property or to a location on an adjoining
property, constitutes a suitable substitution of use which has substantially
less adverse impact to the general public and adjoining property. In granting
any such relocation as herein provided, the BZA shall attach such conditions or
requirements as it may deem necessary to protect the public interest, the
adjoining property owners, and the intent and purpose of this chapter.
   (D)   A nonconforming use may not be changed to another nonconforming use if
the new nonconforming use would require structural alterations or require
greater outdoor area to conduct the use or provide parking.
   (E)   No building, structure, or premises where a nonconforming use has
ceased for 24 months or more, unless otherwise extended as herein provided,
shall thereafter be used except in conformance with this chapter. Prior to the
expiration of such 12-month period after the nonconforming use ceases, the
owner of the property may make application to the Zoning Administrator for an
extension of time for such use. The Zoning Administrator may extend such period
for a reasonable time, up to 24 months, upon a finding that the property is
either under active restoration, being offered for sale, involved with
obtaining governmental approvals or other good cause as demonstrated by the
owner. If the Zoning Administrator grants an extension, such extension shall be
for at least 30 days, which shall run from the date of the written decision of
the Zoning Administrator. If the Zoning Administrator denies such extension for
any reason other than the failure to make a timely request, the owner shall be
deemed to have an extension for 30 days from the date of such written denial.
   (F)   The owner or operator of any existing nonconforming use involving used
car lots, service garages, or junkyards shall, not later than April 17, 1966,
certify in writing, on a prescribed form, to the office of the Zoning
Administrator, that such nonconforming use did exist on the adoption date of
this chapter. In order that the exact nature and extent of such nonconforming
use may be determined, a survey plat prepared by a professional engineer or
registered surveyor shall accompany any prescribed form. The survey shall
include the following:
      (1)   North arrow;
      (2)   Scale: one inch equal to 100 feet;
      (3)   Election district;
      (4)   Outline of parcel or parcels upon which the nonconforming use is
located;
      (5)   Bearings, distances, and acreage of that portion of the parcel or
parcels expressly used for the nonconforming use on the effective date of this
chapter;
      (6)   Use, dimensions, and location of all existing buildings; and
      (7)   Certification and seal of professional engineer or registered
surveyor.
   (G)   Nothing in these regulations shall prevent the restoration of a
nonconforming building or structure destroyed by fire, windstorm, flood,
explosion, act of public enemy or accident, or prevent the continuance of the
use thereof as it existed at the time of such destruction, provided that a
zoning certificate is obtained and restoration begun within one year of such
destruction, unless otherwise extended by the Zoning Administrator as provided
for in division (E) above.
   (H)   The factual existence of a nonconforming use may be certified by the
Zoning Administrator, upon review of an application filed by the property
owner.
      (1)   The application shall contain the following:
         (a)   A statement and plans or other illustrations fully describing
the magnitude and extent of the nonconforming use;
         (b)   A statement identifying the date the use became nonconforming to
the use or dimensional requirements of this chapter;
         (c)   Documentation substantiating the existence of the use on the
date it became nonconforming and clearly demonstrating the continued and
uninterrupted use or operation thereof from the specified date to the time of
filing the application. The burden shall be on the property owner to establish
the existence of the nonconforming use; and
         (d)   A listing of all adjoining property owners.
      (2)   Whenever the Zoning Administrator issues a notice of violation
alleging the illegal use of the property, the property owner may raise as a
defense the fact that the alleged illegal use is a nonconforming use provided
the property owner submits an application to certify the nonconforming status
of the use pursuant to this division (H).
      (3)   Applications for certification of a nonconforming use shall be
heard in accordance with §
158.130(G) and (H).
      (4)   The decision of the Zoning Administrator is appealable in
accordance with §
158.133.
   (I)   A decision of the Zoning Administrator or BZA approving an extension,
expansion, or alteration of a nonconforming use shall become void unless a
building permit conforming to the plans for which the approval was granted is
obtained within six months, and substantial construction in accordance
therewith is completed within one year from the date of the written decision.
An approval for which a building permit is not required shall become void
unless the extension, expansion, or alteration is implemented within one year
from the date of the written decision. If the decision is appealed, the time
period shall be measured from the date of the last decision. An extension to
these dates may be granted by the BZA for good cause.

§ 158.034 USES PROHIBITED UNDER OTHER COUNTY OR STATE LAWS.
   Any existing or proposed use which is determined to be in conflict with any
existing ordinance or laws of the county or law or regulation of this state or
other governmental agency shall be prohibited, even though such use may be

§ 158.038 MAJOR ROAD PLANS.
   In an area where a major road plan has been duly adopted in accordance with
Md. Code, Land Use Article, showing a proposed new highway or street or a
proposed relocation or widening of an existing highway or street, no building
or part of a building shall be permitted to be erected within the lines of such
proposed highway or street except as provided hereinafter:
   (A)   The Zoning Administrator shall issue a zoning certificate for such
construction as applied for, provided that the State Highway Administration,
the Carroll County Bureau of Roads Operations, or its successor agency, or
appropriate authority, upon and within 30 days of written notice thereof does
not reaffirm and substantiate its plans to provide such construction in
accordance with the major road plan.
   (B)   The owner of the property so affected shall, following the expiration
time of such written notice, have the right to appeal to the BZA the refusal of
a zoning certificate, and the BZA may give approval to build if it should find,
after public hearing, and upon the evidence and arguments presented to it upon
such appeal, that:
      (1)   The entire property of the appellant of which the area affected by
the major road plan forms a part cannot yield a reasonable return to the owner
unless such appeal is granted; and
      (2)   Balancing the interest of the general public in preserving the
integrity of the plan and the interest of the owner of the property in the use
and benefits of the property, the granting of such permit is required by
consideration of reasonable justice and equity.

§ 158.039 UTILITY EQUIPMENT AND TOWERS.
   (A)   Allowed uses. The following uses, exclusive of communications towers,
are allowed in any district and are exempt from lot area, lot width, and yard
requirements: overhead electric and telephone lines; underground utility lines
and distributing equipment; conduits; vaults; pipeline laterals; mains; traffic
signals; telephone booths and pedestals; sewerage pumping stations; sewerage
treatment plants; water filtration plants; reservoirs; the structures in which
these uses are housed; and other similar installations and equipment or
accessories of public utility nature. However, the plans for overhead electric

purposes where such facilities are constructed above ground; and telephone
exchanges.
   (C)   Communications towers.
      (1)   Communications towers are prohibited in all Residence Districts,
the H District, and the MHP District.
      (2)   Communications towers are permitted as a conditional use in the A
District and in the C District subject to the conditions and exceptions noted
hereafter, imposed elsewhere in this division (C), imposed elsewhere in this
chapter, imposed elsewhere by law, and subject to the following:
         (a)   A minimum setback of a distance equaling the height of the
tower. The setback shall be measured from the base of the tower to the boundary
line of the property owned, leased, or controlled by easement by the applicant;
         (b)   Subject to a minimum distance requirement of a distance equaling
the height of the tower plus 200 feet from all Residence Districts, the H
District, and the MHP District or the nearest part of any existing dwelling,
school, religious establishment, or institution for human care, in any other
district;
         (c)   Subject to a minimum setback from all overhead transmission
lines of a distance equaling two times the height of the tower and all masts;
and
         (d)   Subject to site plan approval by the Planning Commission
pursuant to §
155.050.
      (3)   Communications towers and tower complexes are permitted as a
principal permitted use in the C-2 and C-3 Districts, and as a conditional use
in the C-1 and Employment Campus Districts, subject to the conditions and
exceptions noted hereafter, imposed elsewhere in this subsection, imposed
elsewhere in this chapter, imposed elsewhere by law, and subject to the
following:
         (a)   A minimum setback of a distance equaling the height of the
tower. The setback shall be measured from the base of the tower to the boundary
line of the property owned, leased, or controlled by easement by the applicant;
         (b)   Subject to a minimum distance requirement of a distance equaling
the height of the tower plus 200 feet from all Residence Districts, the H
District, and the MHP District or the nearest part of any existing dwelling,
school, religious establishment, or institution for human care, in any other
district;
         (c)   Subject to a minimum setback from all overhead transmission
lines of a distance equaling two times the height of the tower and all masts;
and
         (d)   Subject to site plan approval by the Planning Commission
pursuant to §
155.050.
      (4)   Communications towers and tower complexes are permitted as a
principal permitted use in the Industrial Districts subject to the conditions
and exceptions noted hereafter, imposed elsewhere in this division (C), imposed
elsewhere in this chapter, imposed elsewhere by law, and subject to the
following:
         (a)   A minimum setback of a distance equaling twice the height of the
towers. The setback shall be measured from the base of the tower to the
boundary line of the property owned, leased, or controlled by easement by the
applicant;
         (b)   Subject to a minimum distance requirement of a distance equaling
twice the height of the tower plus 200 feet from all Residence Districts, the H
District, and the MHP District or the nearest part of any existing dwelling,
school, religious establishment, or institution for human care, in any other
district;
         (c)   Subject to a minimum setback from all overhead transmission
lines of a distance equaling two times the height of the tower and all masts;
and
         (d)   Subject to site plan approval by the Planning Commission
pursuant to §
155.050.
      (5)   Communications towers erected on existing structures other than
communications towers shall be allowed in any district, provided that the
height of the tower does not exceed one-third of the height of the existing
structure and the total height of the existing structure and tower does not
exceed 200 feet.
      (6)   The issuance of permit is as follows:
         (a)   No permit to construct a communications tower may be issued
unless the applicant demonstrates to the Zoning Administrator or, where
applicable, to the BZA, need for the tower and that the applicant has exhausted
all alternatives to constructing a tower. To that end, before an application
may be accepted, applicants are required to submit a written location analysis
detailing need for the tower. The location analysis shall be reviewed by a
qualified firm, corporation, or person chosen by the county as a
telecommunications consultant. The consultant shall be selected competitively,
and fees shall be reasonable and commensurate with time spent on the review.
The entire fee of the county’s consultant for the review shall be paid by the
applicant. To ensure timely completion of the review, the applicant shall
submit all information requested by the county or its consultant. Evidence
submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower, structure, or alternative
technology can accommodate the applicant’s proposed antenna may consist of any
of the following:
            1.   No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet the applicant’s engineering requirements;
            2.   Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet the applicant’s engineering requirements;
            3.   Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient
structural strength to support the applicant’s proposed antenna and related
equipment;
            4.   The applicant’s proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures or the
antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the
applicant’s proposed antenna;
            5.   The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing
tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower
development are presumed to be unreasonable;
            6.   The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable; and
            7.   The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology that
does not require the use of towers or structures, such as a cable microcell
network using multiple low-powered transmitters/receivers attached to a wire-
line system, is unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed new
tower or antenna development shall not be presumed to render the technology
unsuitable.
         (b)   Upon receipt of all information requested by the county and the
completion of the review of the location analysis, an application shall be
accepted for processing by the county. In the event of a disagreement as to
need for the tower after a complete exchange of all information between the
applicant and the county, the BZA shall rule on this issue at the hearing on
the application.
      (7)   An application for a zoning certificate for a communications tower
must be accompanied by an affidavit from the applicant stating that space on
the proposed tower will be made available to future users, when possible.
      (8)   Except as required by the Federal Aviation Administration or other
federal or state agencies, no tower may use artificial lighting or strobe
lighting at night.
      (9)   An applicant for a zoning certificate for a communications tower
must execute an agreement with the county, in a form legally sufficient to the
county, requiring the removal of the tower within six months after the tower
ceases to function as a communications tower.
      (10)   In reviewing any application or site plan under this section,
among other things, an agency shall consider the extent to which the proposed
use seeks to:
         (a)   Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful
design, siting, and vegetative screening;
         (b)   Avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure
and falling ice through engineering and careful siting of tower structures;
         (c)   Lessen traffic impacts on surrounding residential areas;
         (d)   Maximize the use of new communications transmission towers in
order to reduce the number of towers needed; and
         (e)   Demonstrate that comparable sites are not available in
nonresidential or rural areas, where the use is proposed in a residential or
conservation zone when otherwise protected from residential development.
      (11)   The Zoning Administrator, BZA, and the Planning Commission may
refer any application to appropriate agencies for comments.
   (D)   Additional provisions. The provisions of this section shall be subject
to §§
158.049 and
158.071(C)(9).
   (E)   Conveyor systems.
      (1)   Conveyor systems shall be a principal permitted use in I-2 and I-
1 Industrial Zoning Districts and A District and shall be a conditional use in
all other zoning districts, except for Residential Districts. In considering an
application for a conditional use, and in considering site plan approval, the
BZA and Planning Commission shall consider whether the proposed conveyor system
is more beneficial to the community at large than alternative systems for the
transportation of materials, for example, railroad, or truck transportation. In
comparing the proposed conveyor system to alternative transportation systems,
the BZA and Planning Commission may consider the following factors:
         (a)   Noise, dust control, odors, air emissions, and compliance with

area while maintaining the character of the surrounding countryside. No water
and sewer service is planned to these areas.
   (B)   Applicability. The following regulations and the applicable
regulations contained in other sections shall apply in the A District.
   (C)   Agriculture as preferred use. Agriculture is the preferred use in the
A District. All agricultural operations shall be permitted at any time,
including the operation of farm machinery, and no agricultural use shall be
subject to restriction because it interferes with other uses permitted in the
district. Compliance with Chapter 160, Right to Farm, is required.
   (D)   Principal uses. The regulation of principal uses is set forth in §
158.071.01.
Ord. 2022-20, passed 11-3-2022)
§ 158.071 C CONSERVATION DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of the C District is to prescribe a
zoning category for those areas where, because of natural geographic factors
and existing land uses, it is considered feasible and desirable to conserve
open spaces, water supply sources, woodland areas, wildlife, and other natural
resources. This district may include extensive steeply sloped areas, stream
valleys, water supply sources, and wooded areas adjacent thereto. Industrial
development should not be located in these areas, and residential development
should generally be limited to one single-family detached dwelling per three
acres. No water or sewer service is planned to these areas.
   (B)   Applicability. The following regulations and the applicable
regulations contained in other sections shall apply in the C District.
   (C)   Principal uses. The regulation of principal uses is set forth in §
158.071.01.
(Ord. 2022-20, passed 11-3-2022)
§ 158.071.01 AGRICULTURAL AND CONSERVATION DISTRICTS: REGULATION OF PRINCIPAL
USES.
   (A)   Table of Principal Land Uses. In the table below, the following
applies:
      (1)   The letter "P" indicates that the use is permitted in the district
indicated.
      (2)   The letter "C" indicates that the use is allowed following
conditional use authorization by the BZA in accordance with §
158.133.
      (3)   The letter "X" indicates that the use is prohibited.
      (4)   The letters "NA" indicate the use is not applicable to the
district.
      (5)   Any use not listed is prohibited unless the BZA determines that the
use is similar in impact, nature, function, and duration to an allowed use
listed in the table of uses, and which would not be otherwise detrimental to
the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community, unless
otherwise specifically prohibited.
      (6)   The particular and specific control the general.
      (7)   In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the
text and any caption, the text controls.
      (8)   In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the
text and any language in the definition of the use or the purpose and intent of
the zoning district, the text controls.
      (9)   Words used in the singular include the plural (and vice versa).
      (10)   Words or phrases not specifically defined in this chapter shall be
construed according to the common and generally recognized usage of the
language. Technical words and phrases, and others that have acquired a specific
meaning in the law, shall be construed according to that meaning.
      (11)   An administrative adjustment or variance may not be granted to
permit a use in a district where the use is prohibited or to eliminate the
requirement that a conditional use approval be granted for a use.
      (12)   The additional regulations listed in the table below may not
include all additional regulations that apply to the use, such as the
requirement for site plan review under
Chapter 155.
      (13)   Nonagricultural uses in the Agricultural District may be subject
to the restrictions on development on remaining portions as set forth in
Chapter 155.

§ 158.079 I-1 LIGHT INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of the I-1 District is to provide
locations for certain types of nonagricultural, nonresidential, and generally
nonretail commercial activities characterized by light manufacturing,
assembling, fabricating, warehousing, wholesale distribution, and limited
office and commercial uses which are supportive or directly related to
industrial uses, which may not be as intense as those provided for in the I-
2 District and which, with proper landscaping, separation, setback, and
buffering, will not significantly detract from adjoining residential or
commercial properties. It is intended that such districts be located in areas
with access to major thoroughfares or other major modes of transportation,
depending upon the specific demands of the industry being served. Industrial
Parks are encouraged in this district to provide for clustering of similar
industrial uses with common access and infrastructure, as well as the provision
of open spaces, stormwater management, and adequate buffering.

      (1)   The gross acreage of such uses does not exceed 15% or 15 acres,
whichever is lesser, of the Business/Industrial Park.
         (a)   The area of the commercial uses not otherwise permitted in the
I-1 District shall be computed as the building area containing the commercial

158.079(D)(1)(c), the size of any individual commercial use permitted in the
commercial districts but not otherwise permitted in the I-1 District may not
exceed a maximum of 25,000 square feet. The area of a canopy over gasoline

area shall be provided for the lots within a Business/Industrial Park, with the
exception of self-service storage facilities, which shall require two parking
spaces for employees and the greater of one parking space for each 20,000
square feet of building area or five spaces. The minimum number of spaces as
required herein and any modifications to the parking space design standards, as
previously approved by Planning Commission during the site development plan
approval of the Business/Industrial Park, shall supersede any parking
requirements and design standards of
Chapter 155;
      (6)   Notwithstanding anything in this subchapter to the contrary, the

locations for certain types of nonagricultural, nonresidential, and
noncommercial activities characterized by heavy manufacturing, refining,
processing, or compounding of materials or products predominantly from raw
materials. This district may also accommodate some of the light manufacturing
uses permitted in the I-1 (Light Industrial) District. The uses associated with
this district are intensive and frequently include operations that emit strong
odors; loud noises; and some level or volume of dust, vibrations, smoke, soot,
vapors, light, and pollution. It is intended that properties in this district
be located with access to major thoroughfares or other major modes of
transportation, depending on the specific demands of the industry being served.
It is not the purpose of this district to promote or encourage the use of land
within this district for retail services, Planned Commercial Centers, or
similar uses typically expected to be located within the established commercial
districts.
   (B)   Applicability. The following regulations and applicable regulations
contained in other sections shall apply in the I-2 District.

§ 158.081 EC EMPLOYMENT CAMPUS DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of the EC District is to provide for
and foster comprehensively planned employment centers in campus-like settings
to attract employers of highly skilled workers and primarily higher paying
jobs, including but not limited to research and development, institutional,
office, flex space, and other light and limited industrial uses, while also
providing a more flexible approach to design and development. In this district,
the integration of trails, sidewalks, communal plazas, and share amenities is
encouraged. An EC development may be comprised of multiple contiguous lots, the
extent of which shall be depicted on individual site plans. The following
objectives are sought in providing for the EC District:
      (1)   To facilitate a well-planned development with higher standards of
development than are typically found in other employment districts;

contributing to a positive and healthy working environment;
      (6)   To ensure that the limited number of permitted and accessory
residential, retail, service, eating and drinking uses within the district have
the principal purpose of serving the employment campus;
      (7)   To encourage green spaces, walking trails and other recreational
uses;
      (8)   To serve as an economic development tool in the effort to increase
the county’s commercial and industrial tax base;
      (9)   To encourage development of buildings that can be easily adapted as
the range of tenants and regional market for employment evolves; and
      (10)   To provide a flexible employment district.
   (B)   Outdoor storage. No outdoor storage of equipment, material or products
will be permitted.
   (C)   Signage. A signage plan shall be submitted at the time of site plan

158.114 shall also apply in the Employment Campus District.
   (D)   Architecture. Building architectural renderings or plans shall be
submitted at the time of site plan review to assure that the appearance, size,
type of building material, and other aspects of the buildings are harmonious
and consistent with the purposes and intent of the district.
   (E)   Principal uses. The regulation of principal uses is set forth in §

      (1)   The purpose of the HDO is to provide a mechanism for the
preservation of sites, structures, and districts of historical, archaeological,
or architectural significance, together with their appurtenances and
environmental settings. The HDO is meant to enhance, not substitute for, the
underlying zoning classification which regulates land use. This section imposes
additional requirements during the construction, alteration, reconstruction,
moving, and demolition of sites and structures located within the HDO. These
requirements are in addition to those of the existing conventional underlying
zoning district which controls land use.
      (2)   This subchapter is intended to:
         (a)   Safeguard the heritage of the county by preserving sites,
structures, or districts which reflect elements of the county's cultural,
social, economic, political, architectural, or archaeological history;
         (b)   Stabilize and improve property values of such sites, structures,
or districts;
         (c)   Foster civic beauty;
         (d)   Strengthen the economy of the county;
         (e)   Preserve and enhance quality of life;
         (f)   Promote the preservation and appreciation of the sites,
structures, and districts for the education and welfare of the residents of the
county;
         (g)   Develop an awareness among property owners of the value of
preserving, protecting, and restoring areas of historical, archaeological, or
architectural significance; and
         (h)   Enable the county to identify and officially designate sites,
structures, and districts of historical, archaeological, or architectural
importance to the county in order to make such sites, structures, and districts
eligible for specific benefits that may be available from various local, state,
or federal programs.
   (B)   Definitions applicable to HDO and H District.
      (1)   As used in this subchapter and as used in §
158.097, the following words have the meanings ascribed to them in Md. Code,
Land Use Article, § 8.101, as amended from time to time: demolition, district,

Secretary of the United States Department of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation. Guidelines may include design characteristics intended to meet
the needs of particular types of sites, structures, and districts, and may
identify categories of changes that do not require review by the HPC because
they are minimal in nature and do not affect historic, archaeological, or
architectural significance. These design guidelines shall be used in the HPC’s
review of applications for HDO work permits;
         (h)   May, at the request of an applicant, receive information
concerning the location and configuration of interior features in connection
with an application for a HDO work permit, which information may be used by the

work permit. The HPC may receive this information for use in understanding the
particular application before the HPC but shall not render any decision
concerning interior features and shall not require any applicant to submit any
information concerning interior features;
         (i)   May institute an action for injunctive relief to require routine
maintenance of a site or structure within the HDO, to require compliance with

surrounding property upon which the easement is applied is protected in
perpetuity from changes which would affect its historic, archaeological, or
architectural significance.
      (2)   In addition, the HPC shall have all the powers and authority

   (B)   Mineral resource overlay (MRO).
      (1)   Within the county, there is hereby established an area designated
an MRO. This MRO includes areas identified as containing a MR, a VRA, and those
areas surrounding the resource, identified
as MRN. This overlay shall exist only in the A District, I-2 or I-1 on the
Zoning Maps as adopted or amended. There shall be no new Agricultural Land
Preservation Districts created pursuant to the Maryland Agricultural Land
Preservation Program on any portion of a parcel assigned an MR or a VRA
designation.
      (2)   The owner of property which is not identified as being within an MR
may petition the county to place an MR designation on that person's property
subject to the following:
         (a)   The applicant for an MR designation shall submit for the
property a delineation of the extent of the mineral resource as mapped by the
Maryland Geologic Survey on the Mineral Resource Quadrangle Maps, scale 1:
24,000. The applicant may request a modification of the MR boundaries based
upon an analysis performed by a qualified geologist which identifies, locates,
and estimates the amount and quality of the resource proposed for recovery.
This analysis may include a literature search, well logs, existing geologic
maps, flood control studies, historic aerial photographs, or other relevant
data.
         (b)   Lands with an agricultural land preservation easement are not
eligible for the MR designation.
         (c)   To establish the MR boundary, the minimum horizontal distances
between the following features and the mapped limit of the resource shall be:
            1.   One thousand feet from the nearest boundary of a village of
historic importance as defined in §
158.152, which has been designated at the time of approval of the petition for
the MR boundary.
            2.   Seven hundred feet from the nearest boundary of an area zoned
for residential use (R-40,000, R-20,000, R-10,000, R-7,500) at the time of
establishment of the MR boundary.
            3.   Seven hundred feet from the nearest property lines of schools,
hospitals, religious establishments, sewage pumping stations, sewage treatment
plants, reservoirs, and water filtration plants which are in existence at the
time of establishment of the MR boundary.
         (d)   In addition to the criteria in §
158.096(B)(2), the Planning Commission may use such additional criteria as it
deems applicable in recommending the MR boundary.
         (e)   The Planning Commission shall review the information submitted
by the applicant and make a recommendation to the County Commissioners. The
County Commissioners, after holding a public hearing, shall approve, approve
with modifications, or deny the petition for an MRO designation.
      (3)   In a mineral resource recovery area (MR), all uses which are or may
be permitted in the underlying zone are prohibited except the following which

removal of excavated material, shall be no closer than 200 feet to all
adjoining property lines or any existing or proposed public road right-of-way
and 400 feet from any existing principal building on an adjoining property. The
Planning and Zoning Commission may increase the distance requirements if it
determines that adjacent land uses, geological, hydrogeological, topographical,
natural vegetative, or any other environmental feature causes a greater adverse
effect at the proposed site than desired.
      (2)   The minimum setback distances shall not apply to the common
boundary where the adjoining lot is used or planned for mineral resource
recovery operations. Setbacks on the remaining property lines shall meet the
setback requirements in division (C)(1) of this section.

Chapter 157 and the Carroll County Landscaping Manual.
      (6)   The line of sight shall be interrupted to the extent possible
between mineral resource recovery operations and adjacent properties zoned for
residential use, or improved by a residential dwelling, so as to reduce the
visual intrusion of the operation on adjacent and nearby properties.
      (7)   All permanent access roads shall be paved for a distance of at
least 200 feet from the adjoining public road. The paved cartway width shall be
a minimum of 22 feet, and the pavement type must be approved by the Carroll
County Department of Public Works, or its success agency. Roads marked on a
site plan and approved by the Planning Commission as temporary may be of a
stone construction type (i.e., crusher run).
      (8)   All excavated material stockpile operations and storage shall be
conducted in accordance with an approved site plan as set forth in
Chapter 155.
      (9)   When the height of the excavated material stockpiles exceed the
height of adjacent landscaping berms for a period of time greater than 12
months, then such stockpiles must be constructed using concurrent reclamation
methods.
      (10)   Hours of operation are as follows:
         (a)   Extractive operations, and the storage and removal of excavated
material, shall be restricted to the hours of 6:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Monday
through Friday, and 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. Saturday.
         (b)   Processing operations, and nonextractive related activities
(i.e., administrative, maintenance, repair), may be carried out on the premises
beyond the allowed hours of operation, provided that the sound level does not
exceed the maximum acceptable limit allowed by the state or
Chapter 93, Noise.
         (c)   On Sundays and during atypical business hours, extractive
operations will be allowed if expressly permitted by the Zoning Administrator
because of an operating emergency or because of local or state need.
      (11)   The mineral resource recovery operations shall comply with all
applicable federal and state air pollution control laws and regulations. In the
event of conflict between these laws and regulations, the most restrictive
legally applicable law or regulation shall apply. The operator shall control
and contain dust to prevent visible emissions from crossing the boundary of the
property.
      (12)   The mineral resource recovery operations shall comply with all
federal, state, and local laws regulating water resources management and
protection. In the event of conflict between these laws and regulations, the
most restrictive legally applicable law or regulation shall apply.
      (13)   The operator shall provide, prior to beginning a mineral resource
recovery operation, a contingency plan for well replacement whenever a public
water supply surface intake, public water supply well, or private water supply
well is within the zone of influence as designated by the state.
      (14)   Indenture provisions are as follows:
         (a)   Prior to the issuance of any Zoning Certificate under this
chapter for mineral resource recovery operation, the owner and operator shall
enter into an indenture with and provide a satisfactory bond or guaranty to the
County Commissioners to ensure compliance with this chapter and the provision
of related public improvements, adequate landscaping, fencing, screening,
health and safety safeguards, reclamation and restoration plans including
regrading, site access, draining, or other treatment as required by this
chapter at the completion of the extraction or processing operation. The
indenture shall be prepared by the County Attorney, and the bond or guaranty
shall be satisfactory to the County Commissioners.
         (b)   The indenture shall include language discussing the availability
of the water pumped in dewatering a site for a public water supply and the use
of any resulting reservoir when the site is abandoned for a public water
supply.
         (c)   The indenture shall require the applicant to provide the County
Commissioners a copy of all necessary state permits or letters of certification
from each state agency that it has completed its review of the proposed mining
operations and is prepared to issue its permit before the zoning certificate
may be issued.
         (d)   Prior to the completion of an indenture, the County
Commissioners may impose any other condition, limitation, or requirement which
they deem necessary, to protect the public health, safety, or welfare of the
people of the county.
      (15)   The reclamation plan shall consider providing for use of any
water-filled pits as a public water supply. Other proposed land uses for the
reclaimed site shall be detailed. Reclamation plans shall be developed with
consideration to the condition of adjoining mineral resource recovery
operations.
      (16)   When the property on which the mineral resource recovery is
planned to take place contains a historic structure, or a known archaeological
site, any documentation sent to the state concerning the structure shall also
be forwarded to the Carroll County Department of Land and Resource Management,
or its successor agency, to ensure that the structure and site are surveyed.
      (17)   All plans for mineral resource recovery operations shall be
submitted to the Planning Commission pursuant to the provisions of §
155.050.
      (18)   Prior to site plan approval, the Planning Commission shall
determine the adequacy of transportation facilities on the local land route as
detailed in the traffic impact study. If inadequacy is determined by the
Planning Commission, the Planning Commission will consult with the County
Commissioners and the Director of Public Works, or its success agency, to make
a determination as to the extent the public works agreement may be adjusted to
include road improvements that would alleviate the inadequacy.

      (6)   Regarding utility equipment and towers, notwithstanding any other
provision in this chapter, any application filed under §
158.039, shall require the following:
         (a)   Notice of a hearing shall be advertised in one issue of a
newspaper having general circulation in the county at least 60 calendar days
prior to the hearing.
         (b)   Property which is the subject of the application or appeal shall
be posted conspicuously by a notice or notices not less in size than 22 inches
by 28 inches at least 60 calendar days before the date of the hearing.
         (c)   Notice of the hearing shall be sent by first-class mail to the
appellant or person making application to the BZA and to those persons
identified by the appellant or applicant as persons owning property contiguous
to the property which is the subject of the proceeding no less than 60 calendar
days prior to the first scheduled hearing. In cases where a contiguous property
is also owned by the applicant, this notice shall also be sent to property
owners whose property abuts the applicant's contiguous property. Notice shall
be sufficient if given to the person shown as the owner on the tax rolls and
sent to the address where tax bills are sent.
      (7)   Notice is not defective under division (E)(2) above if it would
cause a reasonable person to inquire into the proceedings. Notice is not
defective under division (E)(4) above unless:
         (a)   The applicant or appellant caused the wrong address or name to
be included on the application or appeal and the person who claims defective
notice proves a lack of actual notice; and
         (b)   That constructive notice was given in such a way that it was
unlikely to have caused that person’s inquiry into the proceedings.
   (F)   Hearings.
      (1)   Hearings shall be conducted according to the BZA’s rules of
procedure, and any party may appear and be heard in person or by agent or

      (2)   Requests for postponement of a scheduled hearing shall be filed in
writing with the BZA not less than ten days prior to the date of hearing and
shall be accompanied by a sum of money sufficient to pay the cost of
advertising the postponement and the rescheduled hearing. The granting of such
requests shall be at the discretion of the Chair of the BZA.
      (3)   Requests for postponement filed later than ten days prior to the
date of a scheduled hearing shall, in addition to the other requirements set
forth in division (F)(2) above, be supported by an affidavit of the party
making the request or of some other credible person. The affidavit shall be
based on personal knowledge and set forth all facts upon which the request for
postponement is based. The granting of such request shall be at the discretion
of the BZA in cases of extreme hardship or upon good cause shown.
      (4)   The BZA may, upon its own initiative, postpone a scheduled hearing
at any time.
      (5)   The BZA may continue a hearing to another time and/or date once
such hearing has been started; however, the BZA shall announce the date and
hour of continuance for such hearing while in session.
      (6)   The BZA, upon application in writing by any interested party filed
with the BZA no less than ten days prior to the date of scheduled hearing, the
BZA shall visit the specific property involved prior to the hearing. The BZA,
in its discretion, may otherwise visit the property prior to or after the
hearing. The BZA shall include in the record of its proceedings the fact of
site visits and advise the parties of the date and time of the visit if made
prior to a decision but after the hearing has opened.
   (G)   Limitations, guides, and standards. Where in these regulations certain
powers are conferred upon the BZA or the approval of the BZA is required before
a conditional use may be issued, the BZA shall study the specific property
involved, as well as the neighborhood, and consider all testimony and data
submitted. The application for a conditional use shall not be approved where
the BZA finds the proposed use would adversely affect the public health,
safety, security, morals, or general welfare, would result in dangerous traffic
conditions, or would jeopardize the lives or property of people living in the
neighborhood. In deciding such matters, the BZA shall give consideration, among
other things, to the following:
      (1)   The number of people residing or working in the immediate area
concerned;
      (2)   The orderly growth of a community;
      (3)   Traffic conditions and facilities;
      (4)   The effect of the proposed use upon the peaceful enjoyment of
people in their homes;
      (5)   The conservation of property values;
      (6)   The effect of odors, dust, gas, smoke, fumes, vibrations, glare,
and noise upon the use of surrounding property values;
      (7)   The most appropriate use of land and structures;
      (8)   Public convenience and necessity;
      (9)   Type and kind of structures in the vicinity where public gatherings
may be held, such as schools, religious establishments, and the like;
      (10)   Compatibility; and
      (11)   The purpose of this chapter as set forth herein.
   (H)   Decision.
      (1)   Time frame. If the application is disapproved by the BZA,
thereafter the BZA shall take no further action on another application for
substantially the same proposal, on the same premises, until after two years
from the date of such disapproval.
      (2)   Appeals. If an appeal to the BZA is filed and the public hearing
date is set and duly advertised and properly posted and thereafter the
applicant withdraws the appeal, the applicant shall be precluded from filing
another appeal on the same issues.
      (3)   Approvals.
         (a)    If the application is approved by the BZA which does not
require a site plan, the approval shall become void unless a building permit
conforming to the plans for which the approval was granted is obtained within
six months.
         (b)   An approval for which a building permit is not required shall
become void unless the use or variance is implemented within one year of the
date of the written decision.
         (c)   An approval for which a site plan is required shall become void
unless the concept site plan has been submitted for distribution to the
reviewing agencies and accepted by the Bureau of Development Review, or its
successor agency, within six months from the date of the written decision. An
approval for which a site plan is required may become void if the property
owner or developer fails to take action to secure an approval of the site plan
from the Planning Commission in a timely manner, as determined by the Bureau of
Development Review.
         (d)   An applicant may apply to the BZA for one extension of up to 12
months upon a showing of good cause.
      (4)   Reconsideration. An applicant may request reconsideration of a
condition of approval within 30 days of the date of the written decision. At
the BZA’s discretion, the BZA may hold a hearing on the request or may reissue
the decision with modifications or corrections. A reconsideration may not
challenge the granting or denial of the application. A request for
reconsideration stays the time for appealing the decision granting or denying
the application until such time as the BZA decides on the reconsideration
request.
   (I)   Fees. A filing fee shall accompany each application for an appeal to
the BZA, as may be determined by the County Commissioners.

Land Preservation Program may be sufficient to allow the funding of an option
to purchase a development rights easement, the Program Manager will provide the
County Commissioners with the individual applicant or a list of the active
applicants with ranking.
      (2)   The County Commissioners may grant preliminary approval to one or
more applicants. The County Commissioners may also determine that a property
does not have a score which is high enough to justify an option to purchase a
development rights easement through this program.
   (C)   Easement valuation. After preliminary approval, the County
Commissioners shall authorize an appraisal of fair market value of the land
only, conducted according to the guidelines of the Maryland Agricultural Land
Preservation Program and shall consider any appraisal obtained and submitted by

   (D)   Option to purchase easement.
      (1)   Upon final approval by the County Commissioners, the county shall
agree in writing to extend to the applicant an option to purchase a development
rights easement, in an amount equal to 52.5% of the agreed upon fair market
value of the land only, which option shall extend for a period of five years.
      (2)   The option shall be recorded in the Land Records of Carroll County.
   (E)   Easement sale. The recorded option to purchase will require that the
applicant and any heirs or assigns actively pursue for a period of five years
the sale of an easement to the MALPF or other non-county agency approved by the
Program Manager at an asking price no lower than the amount of the option to
purchase the easement extended by the county. Any offer from the Foundation or
other agency that equals or exceeds the amount of the option must be accepted
by the applicant.
      (1)   If MALPF or other agency purchases a development rights easement
from the applicant during this five-year period, the full amount of the county
option shall be repaid at the settlement of the easement. Settlement of an
easement and payment of the proceeds to the county shall release the applicant
from any additional obligation of the option to purchase by the county.
      (2)   If a development rights easement has not been purchased by MALPF or
other agency within five years, the applicant may rescind the option to
purchase by repaying to the county within 30 days the full selling price of the
option, plus interest for the entire period of the option, at the legal rate in
effect at the time of rescission. If the applicant does not cancel the option,
the county will exercise the option contained in the agreement and purchase the
development rights easement for such consideration as has already been
established. The terms of the easement agreement will be the standard easement
terms of MALPF, the county, or other agency standard deed of easement.

§ 160.01 FINDINGS AND POLICY.
   It is the declared policy of the county to preserve, protect, and encourage
the development and improvement of its agricultural land for the production of
food and other agricultural products. It is the purpose of this chapter to
reduce the loss to the county of its agricultural resources by limiting the
circumstances under which agricultural operations may be deemed to constitute a
nuisance, trespass, or other interference with the reasonable use and enjoyment
of land, including but not limited to smoke, odors, flies, dust, noise,
chemicals, or vibration, provided that nothing in this chapter shall in any way
restrict or impede the authority of the state and of the county to protect the
public health, safety, and welfare.
   (A)   It is in the public interest to promote a clear understanding between
agricultural operations and nonagricultural residential neighbors concerning
the normal inconveniences of agricultural operations which follow generally
accepted agricultural practices and do not endanger public health or safety.
   (B)   This chapter is not intended to and shall not be construed as in any
way modifying or abridging local, state, or federal laws relating to health,
safety, zoning, licensing requirements, environmental standards (including
those standards which relate to air and water quality), etc.
   (C)   An additional purpose of this chapter is to promote a good-neighbor
policy by advising purchasers and users of property adjacent to or near
agricultural operations of the inherent potential problems associated with such
purchase or use. These potential problems include but are not limited to
noises, odors, dust, flies, chemicals, smoke, vibration, and hours of operation
that may accompany agricultural operations. It is intended that, through
mandatory disclosures, purchasers and users will better understand the impact
of living near agricultural operations and be prepared to accept attendant
conditions as the natural result of living in or near rural areas. However,
this chapter shall be effective regardless of whether disclosure was made in
accordance with §
160.05.

   Section 3800.2. Delineation of the floodplain. For the purposes of these
regulations, the minimum basis for establishing special flood hazard areas and
base flood elevations is the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Carroll County,
Maryland And Incorporated Areas dated October 2, 2015, or the most recent
revision thereof, and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and
all subsequent amendments and revisions to the FIRMs. The FIS, FIRM, and Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) shall be used to guide the County or any other
Authority Having Jurisdiction in determining the relative location of the
proposed building or development with respect to FEMA mapped streams,
floodplains, or floodways. If building or development is proposed in a
contested FEMA or unmapped floodplain, the floodplain shall be delineated in
accordance with Chapter 153. The FIS and FIRMs are retained on file and
available to the public at the Department of Land and Resource Management, or
its successor agency.
   3800.3 Permits.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to begin any development or
construction which is wholly within, partially within, or in contact with any
flood hazard area, including but not limited to: filling; grading; construction
of new structures and additions; the substantial improvement of buildings or
structures, including repair of substantial damage; placement or replacement of
manufactured homes, including substantial improvement or repair of substantial
damage of manufactured homes; erecting or installing a temporary structure, or
alteration of a watercourse, until a permit is obtained from the Carroll
County. No such permit shall be issued until the requirements of these
regulations have been met.
   (B)   In addition to the permits required in paragraph (A), applicants for
permits in nontidal waters of the State are advised to contact MDE. Unless
waived by MDE, pursuant to Code of Maryland Regulations 26.17.04, Construction
on Nontidal Waters and Floodplains, MDE regulates the 100- year frequency
floodplain of free-flowing waters," also referred to as nontidal waters of the
State. To determine the 100-year frequency floodplain, hydrologic calculations
are based on the ultimate development of the watershed, assuming existing
zoning. The resulting flood hazard areas delineated using the results of such
calculations may be different than the special flood hazard areas. A permit
from Carroll County is still required in addition to any State requirements.
   3800.4 Construction of buildings or other structures in floodplains.
Construction of buildings or other walled and roofed structures in the
floodplain is prohibited. This includes accessory and temporary structures.
Water-conveying structures are not included in this prohibition. A variance
cannot be requested for relief of this prohibition. CLOMR-Fs and LOMR-Fs cannot
be used to circumvent this prohibition and will not be recognized by the
County. Critical facilities, including but not limited to, wastewater treatment
plants and pumping stations, are exempt from this prohibition. Recreational
vehicles may not occupy a site for more than 180 days out of the year and shall
be fully licensed and ready for highway use to be allowed seasonally in the
FEMA floodplain. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on
its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-disconnect
type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
   Section 3800.5. Filling. Filling within the floodplain will not be
permitted, unless compelling reasons are submitted to the County and approved
through the variance process in accordance with Chapter 153. Only the minimum
amount of fill necessary to support the buildings will be allowed. Detailed
plans will be necessary to evaluate the effect of any filling. Landfills,
rubble fills, dumps, and sanitary fills are not permitted in the floodplain.
The use of fill may not increase flooding or cause drainage problems on
neighboring properties. A variance shall not be granted for any building or
fill which will result in any increase in water surface elevations during the
base flood unless the applicant acquires floodplain easements on areas outside
the property limits that are affected by any water surface rise resulting from
the development. Any land disturbance shall be graded and planted with adequate
vegetative cover to prevent erosion immediately after disturbance.
   Section 3800.6. Existing buildings, manufactured homes, or other structures
in the FEMA floodplain. Existing base buildings, manufactured homes, or other
structures in the floodplain are nonconforming with respect to this chapter
only and shall be substantially improved only if they can be brought into
conformance with Chapter 38 without increasing the footprint. Improvements,
Modifications, and additions to existing structures are counted cumulatively
for 10 years. Reconstruction and repairs shall also be counted cumulatively for
10 years. Minor additions (less than substantial improvement) shall be elevated
at least three feet above the elevation of the base flood on pilings or
columns. In the event of substantial damage or repetitive loss, the applicant
shall submit an alternative analysis to demonstrate that the building cannot be
moved out of the floodplain. If a building is replaced in the floodplain, it
shall be limited to the footprint of the previous building. Use flood damage-
resistant materials below the elevation of the lowest floor.
   Section 3800.7. Construction requirements in the floodplain. All buildings
shall be oriented so as to offer the least resistance to the flow of flood
waters. Materials which are buoyant, flammable, explosive, hazardous to health,
or which at times of flooding may be injurious to human, animal, or plant life,
shall not be stored less than three feet above the elevation of the base flood.
All buildings shall be firmly anchored in accordance with acceptable
engineering practices to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement
during flooding. All air ducts, large pipes, and storage tanks located below
three feet above the elevation of the base flood shall be firmly anchored to
resist flotation.
   3800.8. Inspections.
   The Floodplain Administrator or designee shall make periodic inspections of
development permitted in special flood hazard areas, at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance. Such
inspections may include:
   (A)   Stake-out inspection, to determine location on the site relative to
the flood hazard area.
   (B)   Foundation inspection, upon placement of the lowest floor and prior to
further vertical construction, to collect information or certification of the
elevation of the lowest floor.
   (C)   Inspection of enclosures below the lowest floor, including crawl/
underfloor spaces, to determine compliance with applicable provisions.
   (D)   Utility inspection, upon installation of specified equipment and
appliances, to determine appropriate location with respect to the base flood
elevation.
   (E)   Final inspection prior to issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
   3800.9. Flood protection setback requirement. Any new or replacement
buildings shall be located no less than 100 feet from the top of bank of all
FEMA mapped streams measured perpendicular to the stream bank and outside of
the area calculated to be within the variable width stream buffer per the
Carroll County Water Resource Manual. Natural vegetation shall be maintained in
the setback zone, and where natural vegetation does not exist along the banks,
high priority shall be given to planting trees in the setback area to prevent
erosion and enhance aquatic resources.
   3800.10. Certifications.
   Certifications and/or technical analyses prepared or conducted by a licensed
professional engineer or licensed architect, as appropriate, including:
   (A)   The determination of the base flood elevations or hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering analyses prepared by a licensed professional engineer
that are required by the Floodplain Administrator or are required by these
regulations for: certain subdivisions and development; development in flood
hazard areas with base flood elevations but no designated floodways; and
deliberate alteration or relocation of watercourses.
   (B)   The Floodproofing Certificate for nonresidential structures that are
floodproofed as required.
   (C)   Certification that engineered flood openings are designed to meet the
minimum requirement to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces.
   (D)   For nonresidential structures that are proposed with floodproofing, an
operations and maintenance plan as specified in Section.
   (E)   Such other material and information as may be requested by the
Floodplain Administrator and necessary to determine conformance with these
regulations.

Department. Any county or state employee shall be non-voting members.
   EMERGENCY WORK. When work of an emergency nature must be performed to
rectify a possible health or hazardous condition, the plumber may undertake
such work prior to the issuance of a permit, but it will be the responsibility
of the plumber to obtain a permit for the work within a reasonable time
thereafter.

170.18(1)(95-9) of this chapter).
   INDIVIDUAL SERVICES. These regulations apply to the introduction,
maintenance, and/or extension of the public water supply or sewage service or
any appurtenance thereof, in or upon any building, lot, premises, or
establishment, provided, however, that it shall not be unlawful where a public
water supply is not reasonably available, for any person or persons to install
or cause to be installed or operate a water supply for sanitary or other
purposes; but no such installations shall be connected to any public water
supply unless it shall first be disconnected from its original source of supply
and the connection from its original source of supply and the connection shall

work for inspection and testing.
      Testing. Tests shall be conducted in the presence of the Building
Official or his or her duly appointed representative.
   INSPECTION OF EXISTING SYSTEMS WHEN UNSANITARY CONDITIONS OR AN ILLEGAL

reasonable time and upon notification to the owner. If any defects are found
therein, the Building Official shall have the authority to order the repair or
reconstruction of such plumbing system in accordance with the provisions of
this Code.
   PERMIT FEES. The County Commissioners shall adopt a schedule of fees for the
issuance of permits for plumbing work.

or drains in public or private streets, alleys, or private ways, but such
permit will not be issued except in emergency cases. When issued, the recipient
assumes all risks, damage, injury, or loss resulting therefrom. All work
outside of private property or reservations (streets, alleys, avenues, or other
thoroughfares) when permitted, shall be installed under the supervision and to
the satisfaction of the local jurisdiction.
   PIPING THROUGH ADJACENT PROPERTY. Plumbing, piping, or sewer and water
piping, shall not be connected up or laid through property other than the
property to be served. Plumbing or water supply connections which cannot be
made across some border of the property served directly into some adjacent
lane, road, alley, street, or thoroughfare, or other land under public
jurisdiction, may with the permission of the Code Official be carried through a
right-of-way or easement across adjoining property provided that (1) all
privileges of such right-of-way or easement are obtained by the property owner,

and regulations in furtherance of the purposes and not inconsistent with the
specific provisions of this Code, for the connections of water supply to, of
the discharges of water or waste from water operated or water using equipment,
fixtures or devices, as may be deemed necessary to properly protect the public
water supply system.

writing of the change. If work under the permit has been started, the first
plumber will be notified by the Bureau of Permits and Inspections of the
proposed change. No transfer of the permit will be made in less than 3 days
provided that a transfer may be made in a shorter time pursuant to a written
agreement between the first and second plumber. If work under the permit has
not been started, the first plumber will be notified by the Bureau of Permits
and Inspections of the change and the transfer shall be made immediately. The
second plumber must file an application for the permit required and pay a fee
as set by the County Commissioners. The new plumber will assume responsibility
for the job including the work performed by the original plumber.
   REVOCATION OF PERMITS. The Building Official may, at any time, revoke, for
good cause, any permit previously issued. The owner of a property may, at any
time, in writing, request the revocation of a permit previously issued to a
plumber for work to be performed on the owner's property which may be revoked
at the discretion of the Building Official. (See paragraph entitled "Removal of
Original Plumber" for process.).

is being constructed but not available, such as an extension under a PWA.
   TRANSFER OF PERMITS. When the plumber wishes to be removed as the plumber of
record, the plumber must notify the Building Official in writing, requesting
that the plumber be released from responsibility for the part of the work that
has not been completed. The plumber will be responsible for the work that has
been completed. The Plumbing Inspector's record will indicate the extent of
such completed work and such responsibility.
   WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS. When the water supply system is intended to serve more
than one building owned by or intended for sale to different individuals or
groups of individuals, then the plans for such water supply system or systems
shall be submitted to the County Commissioners for approval and the entire work
must conform in its entirety with these regulations. Application for a permit
shall be made in writing to the County Commissioners prior to the commencement
of any work on such system or systems.
   WHEN PERMIT IS REQUIRED. It shall be unlawful to construct, enlarge, alter
or demolish a structure; or change the occupancy of a building or structure
requiring greater strength, exit or sanitary provisions; or to change to
another use; or to install or alter any equipment for which provision is made
or the installation of which is regulated by this Code, without first obtaining
the required permit, except that repairs which do not involve any violation of
this Code, shall be exempted from this provision.
