the exercise of its powers as aforesaid, permanently interferes with the use of
any public road or roads and bridges, as the same are now located, it will, in
that event, at its own expense, provide such new road or roads and bridges as
may be necessary at new locations to take the place of any of those whose use
is permanently interfered with.

and directed to make a special tax levy upon the assessable property of the
county annually from year to year so long as the same may be necessary to meet
all the interest and principal payments which may become due upon the loan or
bonds according to the original tenor of either.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 50.01 APPLICABILITY.
   This subchapter shall apply to Garrett County in its entirety.
(1986 Code, § 260-1) (Ord. —, passed 3-23-1982; Am. Ord. —, passed 2-8-1994)
§ 50.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DISPOSAL OF SEWAGE SLUDGE. This is regulated by other applicable state and
local laws and regulations.
   HAZARDOUS WASTE. As defined in COMAR 26.13.01-03B, as amended from time to
time by the Maryland Department of the Environment. Hazardous wastes shall not
be placed into any solid waste container operated by or for Garrett County nor
shall any hazardous waste be placed in any solid waste disposal facility
operated in Garrett County.
   SOLID WASTE. Includes garbage, rubbish, bottles, cans, paper, refuse and
other wastes produced by normal residential and commercial activities.
   UNACCEPTABLE WASTE. Waste which if delivered in sufficient quantities may
present a substantial endangerment to public health or safety, would cause
applicable law to be violated or is likely to materially adversely affect the
operation of the Garrett County Landfill or other disposal and collection
sites. UNACCEPTABLE WASTES shall include explosives, pathological and
biological waste, radioactive materials, foundry sand, septage, red bag or
other types of infectious medical waste, human remains, motor vehicles and
major motor vehicle parts such as transmissions, engines and rear ends,
agricultural and farm machinery and equipment, marine vessels and parts
thereof, other large equipment or machinery and any liquid waste. UNACCEPTABLE
WASTE shall not be delivered to Garrett County operated landfills or solid
waste collection sites.
(1986 Code, § 260-2) (Ord. —, passed 3-23-1982; Am. Ord. —, passed 2-8-1994)
§ 50.03 PLACEMENT OF SOLID WASTES; COLLECTION; DISPOSAL.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to:
      (1)   Place solid waste, hazardous waste and unacceptable waste onto the
surface of the ground along highways, streams and solid waste collection box
sites. Hazardous wastes and unacceptable wastes shall not be delivered and
placed at Garrett County solid waste collection or disposal facilities. Placing
of solid waste in containers or bags at driveway entrances or sidewalks for
commercial collection is not prohibited;
      (2)   Place dead animals or unacceptable waste in solid waste collection
boxes;
      (3)   Place ashes in collection boxes;
      (4)   Remove any waste or other items placed into collection boxes or
collection sites operated by Garrett County without the permission of the
Garrett County Office of Solid Waste and Recycling;
      (5)   Place solid waste that has not been generated by activities within
Garrett County into collection boxes or disposal sites operated or supported by
Garrett County. Persons not residing in Garrett County or owning property in
Garrett County shall not trespass upon county disposal sites or collection box
sites. Since Garrett County funds support the collection and disposal of the
wastes, it is intended that persons residing in other jurisdictions not use
Garrett County facilities unless permission is obtained. Proper monetary
compensation to the county as determined by the Garrett County Commissioners
would be a prerequisite for such permission;
      (6)   Place large items such as furniture, large appliances, trees, tree
limbs and building demolition materials at collection box sites unless
specifically allowed by the Garrett County Office of Solid Waste and Recycling.
These items shall be hauled directly to a landfill site;
      (7)   Deposit solid waste generated by commercial enterprises at Garrett
County solid waste collection sites other than a landfill unless specifically
permitted by the Garrett County Office of Solid Waste and Recycling. In no case
may individuals or businesses hauling solid waste for a fee bring solid waste
to Garrett County operated collection sites. Commercial haulers shall haul
directly to approved landfill sites;
      (8)   Place solid waste in a location at a landfill site that is other
than the designated discharge location;
      (9)   Haul solid waste on an open motor vehicle on a public highway
without a cover sufficient to maintain the waste from blowing off the vehicle;
      (10)   Operate a solid waste disposal site without a permit from the
Garrett County Office of Solid Waste and Recycling or the Maryland Department
of the Environment;
      (11)   Place or deposit solid waste, hazardous waste or unacceptable
waste in a strip mine, along a public road or stream bank or at any other
location that is not permitted to receive solid waste by the Garrett County
Office of Solid Waste and Recycling or the Maryland Department of the
Environment;
      (12)   Allow solid waste to become a nuisance to an adjacent property
owner by allowing solid waste to be blown onto an adjacent property or allowing
solid waste to accumulate to such an extent as to create a rodent attraction
and harborage;
      (13)   Dispose of an automobile, motorcycle, truck, heavy equipment or
any other type of tire at Garrett County solid waste collection sites unless
specifically allowed by the Garrett County Office of Solid Waste and Recycling.
Tires may be taken to the Garrett County Landfill where they will be stored
prior to transportation to an approved processing facility.
   (B)   Solid waste of an unusually large amount or unusual characteristic
must have prior approval from the Garrett County Office of Solid Waste and
Recycling before being deposited at a landfill site. Operating personnel at a
disposal site may reject any waste from being deposited when there is reason to
believe that the waste was not generated within Garrett County or the waste
could not be compatible with the disposal operation.
   (C)   The Board of Garrett County Commissioners may establish fees for
disposal of any type of solid waste at the Garrett County Landfill or at other
collection sites. These fees will be collected by the Garrett County Office of
Solid Waste and Recycling or its designee upon delivery of waste to Garrett
County solid waste collection or disposal facilities.

Sheriff and all other law enforcement officers along with the State’s Attorney
for Garrett County shall be responsible for enforcing this chapter.

RECYCLING
§ 50.15 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   State law requires each county up to 150,000 in population to recycle
15% of its solid waste stream by 1994. Recycling occurs when a material is
removed from the waste stream and used to make new products.
   (B)   The cost of landfilling has increased drastically over the past 10
years due to increased regulations and is expected to continue to escalate as
new aspects of trash disposal are addressed.
   (C)   In order to meet the recycling goal mandated by the state, the county
must provide documentation of all recycling taking place within its boundaries.
(1986 Code, § 260-6) (Ord. —, passed 9-14-1993)
§ 50.16 RECYCLABLE MATERIALS; DEFINITIONS.
   (A)   These are materials which would otherwise be county solid waste and
which may be collected, separated or processed and returned to the economic

is very high, yet we can only recycle materials for which methods of
collection, processing technology and markets for reuse exist.

(1986 Code, § 260-7) (Ord. —, passed 9-14-1993)
§ 50.17 ACCEPTANCE AND COLLECTION OF MATERIALS.
   It is the intent of Garrett County to obtain or assist in obtaining markets
for as many recyclables as possible. Some of the above-listed materials will be

   (I)   Suspension or revocation of license.
      (1)   Whenever the Inspector shall determine that there are reasonable
grounds to believe that there has been a violation, he or she shall give notice
of such alleged violation to the person or persons responsible therefor as
hereinafter provided, and the official shall also notify the Board of such
alleged violation in writing. The notice shall:
         (a)   Be put in writing;
         (b)   Include a statement of the reasons why it is being issued;
         (c)   Allow for a period of 60 days for the performance of any act it

notice shall be deemed to be properly served upon the owner or agent if a copy
thereof is served upon him or her personally or if a copy thereof is sent by
certified mail with return receipt requested to his or her last known address.
If notice cannot satisfactorily be served as specified above, then a copy of
the notice may be posted in a conspicuous place in or about the refuse
collection and disposal site affected by the notice, or he or she may be served
with such notice by any other method authorized or required under the laws of
the state.
      (2)   The notice may contain an outline of remedial action which, if
taken, will effect compliance with the provisions of this subchapter and with
rules and regulations adopted pursuant thereto. Any person affected by any
notice which has been issued in connection with the enforcement of any of the

thereto may request and shall be granted a hearing on the matter before the
Board, provided that the person shall file in the office of the Board a written
petition requesting the hearing and setting forth a brief statement of the
grounds therefor within 14 days after the day the notice was served. Upon
receipt of the petition, the Board shall set a time and place for the hearing
and shall give the petitioner written notice thereof. At the hearing, the
petitioner shall be given an opportunity to be heard and to show why the notice
should be modified or withdrawn. The hearing shall be commenced not later than
14 days after the day on which the petition was filed, provided that, upon
application of the petitioner, the Board may postpone the date of the hearing
for a reasonable time beyond the 14 day period if in its judgment the
petitioner has submitted a good and sufficient reason for the postponement.
After the hearing, the Board shall sustain, modify or withdraw the notice,
depending upon its findings as to whether the provisions of this subchapter
have been complied with. The proceedings at the hearing, including the findings
and decision of the Board, shall be summarized, reduced to writing and entered
as a matter of public record in the office of the Board. The records shall also
include a copy of every notice issued in connection with the matter.
      (3)   At the conclusion of the 60-day correction period, the Inspector
shall conduct an on-site inspection of the refuse collection and disposal site
affected by the notice to determine compliance. If the Inspector finds that the
violation has been corrected, he or she shall notify the owner, in writing, of
his or her compliance. If the Inspector finds:
         (a)   That corrective measures have not been taken, he or she shall
initiate appropriate action against the person or persons affected by the
notice. The action may include, in addition to the remedies provided in §
50.44, an order for the revocation of any refuse collection and disposal site
license by the Board; or
         (b)   That the person or persons responsible for the violation have
made a good-faith effort to correct the violation, the Inspector may provide
notice to perform such further corrective measures as deemed necessary by the
Inspector. The notice shall be issued pursuant to division (I)(1) above and may
be appealed pursuant to division (I)(2). If all corrective measures have not
been fulfilled by the conclusion of the second notification period, the
Inspector shall initiate appropriate action as specified in division (I)(3)(a)
above.
      (4)   Whenever the Inspector shall find that an emergency exists which
requires immediate action to protect the public health or safety, he or she
may, without notice or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of such
an emergency and requiring that corrective action be taken within 30 days or as
he or she deems necessary to meet the emergency. Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this subchapter, the order shall be effective immediately. Any
person to whom each order is directed shall comply therewith immediately, but
upon filing a petition with the Board shall be afforded a hearing within 7 days
of the receipt by the Board of the petition. After the hearing, depending upon
its findings as to whether the provisions of this subchapter have been complied
with, the Board shall continue the order in effect, modify it or revoke it.
      (5)   Any person aggrieved by this decision of the Board may seek relief
therefrom in any court of competent jurisdiction, as provided by the laws of

§ 50.36 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   (A)   The requirements of this subchapter shall be supplementary to and

disposal sites specified in the Health and Environment Articles of the
Annotated Code of Maryland and by Maryland Regulations.
   (B)   Any refuse collection and disposal site lawfully existing prior to the
adoption of this subchapter but which does not conform to the standards set
forth in §§
50.37 and
50.38 may continue to operate, provided that the refuse collection and disposal
site complies with standards and conditions set forth in the refuse collection
and disposal site’s initial license as approved by the Board. After the first
day of August 1988, no refuse collection and disposal site shall be licensed
nor any refuse collection and disposal site expanded except in full compliance
with this subchapter.

(1986 Code, § 260-18) (Ord. —, passed 7-19-1988; Am. Ord. —, passed 10-12-1993)
§ 50.37 SETBACKS.
   (A)   No portion of a refuse collection and disposal site property that is
occupied for refuse collection and disposal site purposes may be located closer
than the following distances:
      (1)   From the right-of-way line of a public road or highway: 500 feet;
      (2)   From side boundary lines not bordering a right-of-way of a public
road or highway: 500 feet;
      (3)   From any land owned or leased by a government agency for
recreation, open space, conservation or related purposes: 1,000 feet;
      (4)   From a residence, retail business, school, hospital, church or
other institutional facilities: 1,000 feet, unless from the evidence submitted
the Board concludes that the proposed method of screening the refuse collection
and disposal site would effectively prevent the site from being detrimental to
or detracting from the value of every such use.
   (B)   Upon a finding of unnecessary hardship pursuant to §
50.35(B)(7), the Board may, in the case of a nonconforming refuse collection
and disposal site:
      (1)   Authorize a permanent setback variance from any permanent
structure;
      (2)   Establish permanent setback lines less stringent than those
specified in division (A) of this section, provided that the setbacks shall

setbacks specified in division (A) of this section.
(1986 Code, § 260-19) (Ord. —, passed 7-19-1988; Am. Ord. —, passed 10-12-1993)
§ 50.38 SCREENING.
   (A)   Each licensed refuse collection and disposal site shall, within 9
months of the issuance of the license, be enclosed to screen the refuse
collection and disposal site from view by the traveling public and from
adjoining properties. The screening shall consist of vegetative or structural
materials, or both, as specified by the Board. The Board may waive the
requirement for installing additional screening where the Board concludes that
the refuse collection and disposal site will not be visible from a public road
or from every adjoining property, provided that the applicant agrees to
maintain such screening as then exists.
   (B)   The screening shall be installed by the licensee in accordance with
plans approved by the Board as part of the license and shall be maintained in
good order and repair by the licensee. The screening shall be constructed
according to setback requirements in §
50.37.
   (C)   Vegetative screening shall be preferred, to consist of trees, shrubs
or other plant materials of such aggregate size, location and density as to
comply with division (A) of this section. The screening shall, at the time of
planting, be not less than 5 feet in height and shall be designed to grow to
and shall be maintained at a height of not less than 7 feet. The screening
shall ordinarily have a depth of not less than 10 feet measured perpendicularly
from tree centers. The vegetative screening shall consist of 2 staggered rows
of trees, with rows being 10 feet apart measured perpendicularly from tree
centers. Trees within the respective rows shall be spaced not further than 12
feet apart (measured from centers). The proposed species of vegetation shall be
indicated on the site plan submitted in accordance with §
50.35(B)(2). The Board shall, upon request, supply a list naming desirable
vegetative species to fulfill this vegetative screening requirement.
   (D)   In lieu of vegetative screening, the Board may authorize and require
screening constructed of mounded earth, wood, stone or brick or other
appropriate material if the Board finds that the constructed screening would be
more harmonious than vegetative screening with the present or intended future
character of the neighborhood. If authorized by the Board, the screening shall
be sightly and shall not be of a different quality, type or dimension and shall
be maintained and/or painted so as not to detract from the surroundings. The
screening shall be kept in good repair at all times and shall have no openings
through which persons or animals may enter, except for doors or gates necessary
for ingress or egress to the refuse collection and disposal site, which said
doors or gates shall be kept closed except when actually needed for ingress or
egress.
   (E)   Upon finding of unnecessary hardship pursuant to §
50.35(B)(7), the Board may, in the case of a nonconforming refuse collection
and disposal site, authorize a permanent variance from the requirement in §
50.38(A) that the refuse collection and disposal site be completely screened.
The variances shall be sparingly granted and only in the case where the Board
finds, from an examination of the topographical character of the properties
involved, that it would not reasonably be possible to achieve complete
screening. The variances shall be granted only for as much of the perimeter of
the refuse collection and disposal site as meets this criterion and shall not
relieve the licensee of the responsibility to install and maintain as much
screening as the Board shall judge reasonable under the circumstances.
(1986 Code, § 260-20) (Ord. —, passed 7-19-1988; Am. Ord. —, passed 10-12-1993)
§ 50.39 ACCESS.
   (A)   No driveway or other point of vehicular access to a refuse collection
and disposal site shall intersect any public road within 100 feet of the point
of intersection of 2 public roads, measured along the center lines thereof.
   (B)    Except in unusual circumstances, the Board shall not authorize more
than 1 driveway or other point of vehicular access for every 300 feet of
frontage of a refuse collection and disposal site along a public road. No such
driveway shall be more than 30 feet in width.
   (C)   Upon a finding of unnecessary hardship pursuant to §
50.35(B)(7), the Board may, in the case of a nonconforming refuse collection
and disposal site, authorize an access variance, either permanently or for a
period not to exceed 9 months.
(1986 Code, § 260-21) (Ord. —, passed 7-19-1988; Am. Ord. —, passed 10-12-1993)

of the screening enclosing the refuse collection and disposal site.
   (B)   Burning of waste materials within a refuse collection and disposal
site shall be permitted only in strict compliance with applicable county, state
and federal air quality regulations.
   (C)   The Board may, in the license of any refuse collection and disposal
site, prescribe reasonable limits on the hours of operation at the refuse
collection and disposal site, taking into account the type and proximity of
development existing on nearby properties.
(1986 Code, § 260-22) (Ord. —, passed 7-19-1988; Am. Ord. —, passed 10-12-1993)
§ 50.41 SIGNS.
   (A)   Every refuse collection and disposal site shall be entitled to have
not more than 1 identification sign on the premises. The sign shall not be
larger than 200 square feet in size. No part of the sign shall extend more than
20 feet above the ground.
   (B)   No sign shall constitute a public safety or traffic hazard, such as by
obstructing traffic signals, traffic signs, road warning signs, street name
signs or the full view of the traffic in all directions at driveways,
entranceways or any other intersections on a public road.
   (C)   Lighting devices shall be shielded so that they do not create a glare
or a nuisance by shining directly into a public street or highway or into an
adjoining property. No flashing or rotating flashing illumination of a sign
shall be permitted.

§ 51.02 DISTRIBUTION AND PRODUCTION TAX.
   (A)   Levy; rate established; exclusions. There is levied a production tax
on the business or occupation of producing natural gas or other gases taken
from the earth in Garrett County, computed as follows:
      (1)   A tax shall be paid on the gas produced within Garrett County,
accounting from January 1, 1951, equivalent to 5.5% of the wholesale market
value when produced at the wellhead;
      (2)   Money received pursuant to the tax shall be distributed as follows:
         (a)   Ten-elevenths to the county; and
         (b)   One-eleventh to municipalities in the county distributed on a
per capita basis, based on population records as updated by the State Planning
Commission.
   (B)   The market value of gas produced in Garrett County shall be the value
thereof at the mouth of the well.
   (C)   The producer of gas shall pay the total tax on all gas produced,
making the payments of tax to the County Commissioners of Garrett County by
legal tender or cashier's check payable to the County Commissioners. It shall
be the duty of each such producer to keep accurate records of all such gas
produced.
   (D)   The tax herein levied shall be due and payable at the office of the
County Commissioners of Garrett County by the 15th day of each month of each
calendar year, based on the amount of gas produced in the preceding month. On
or before such date each producer shall make and deliver to the County
Commissioners a verified report, on forms prescribed by the county, showing the
gross amount of gas produced, upon which the tax herein levied accrues,
together with details as to the amount of gas, from what leases the gas was
produced, the correct names and addresses of the producer of the gas and such
other information as the County Commissioners may require. In no event shall a
producer be relieved of responsibility for the tax until same shall have been
paid.
   (E)   Unless the payment of tax on all gas produced during any month or
fractional part thereof shall be made on or before the date due as hereinabove
specified, such payment shall become delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the
amount of the tax shall be added, and the tax and penalty shall bear interest
at the rate of 6% per annum from the date due until the date paid.

passed 5-19-2009)
§ 51.03 OVERPAYMENT OF TAX; SUBSEQUENT PURCHASERS LIABLE FOR TAX.
   When it shall appear that a taxpayer to whom the provisions of this chapter
shall apply has erroneously paid more taxes than were due during any taxpaying
period on account of a mistake either of fact or of law, it shall be the duty
of the Director of Finance, upon order of the County Commissioners, to credit
the total amount of taxes due by the taxpayer for the current period with the
total amount of taxes so erroneously paid or to make refund in a proper case.

§ 51.04 VERIFICATION OF REPORTS AND RECORDS; EMPLOYMENT OF AUDITORS; POWERS.
   The County Commissioners may, through the County Auditors or other auditors
and/or other technical assistants employed for the purpose of verifying reports
and investigating the affairs of producers, determine whether the tax is being
properly reported and paid. They shall have the power to enter upon the
premises necessary in determining the correct tax liability and to examine or
cause to be examined any books or records of any person subject to a tax under
this chapter and to secure any other information directly or indirectly
concerned in the enforcement of this chapter and to promulgate and enforce,
according to law, rules and regulations pertinent to the enforcement of this
chapter, which shall have full force and effect of law.

§ 51.05 DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE; PAYMENT OF TAX UNDER PROTEST; APPEALS.
   If the County Commissioners are satisfied that the values used in computing
the tax do not represent the wholesale market value of the gas at the mouth of
the well, they shall forthwith so notify the taxpayers concerned, and it shall
be the duty of the County Commissioners to set a date for a hearing thereon,
giving each taxpayer concerned not less than 10 days written notice thereof,
and to call before them by proper process such persons as in their judgment may
know the wholesale market value of the gas at the mouth of the well, who shall
testify under oath as to the wholesale market value thereof. Each taxpayer
shall have the right to be heard and present evidence. The County
Commissioners, after hearing the evidence, shall fix the wholesale market value
of the gas at the mouth of the well by written findings in accordance with the
evidence so introduced, and their findings in such case or cases shall be
final, unless the taxpayer concerned shall pay the tax herein levied upon the
wholesale market value so fixed by the County Commissioners under protest
within 60 days after the taxpayer has been notified in writing of the findings,
or in the event the taxpayer does not pay the tax based on the values so
determined by the County Commissioners within 60 days after having been
notified of the findings. The findings of the County Commissioners shall be
final, unless the taxpayer shall, within 60 days, appeal to the Circuit Court
of Garrett County. Upon the appeal, the trial shall be de novo, but the
findings of the County Commissioners shall be taken as prima facie evidence of
the wholesale market value of the gas at the mouth of the well, and the burden
of proof shall rest upon the taxpayer to establish a lower wholesale market
value.

§ 51.06 DELINQUENT PAYMENTS; NONFILING OF REQUIRED REPORTS.
   In the event of any person engaged in the business of producing any gas in
Garrett County shall become delinquent in the payment of the proper taxes
herein imposed or fails to file required reports with the County Commissioners,
the County Commissioners shall have the right to enjoin any such person who is
at fault from producing gas until the delinquent tax is paid or the reports are
filed.

§ 51.07 INSTITUTION OF LEGAL ACTION; FILING OF REQUIRED REPORTS.
   (A)   On notice from the County Commissioners, it shall be unlawful for any
person to produce or remove any natural gas from any lease in Garrett County
whenever the producer has failed to file reports as required under the
provisions of this chapter.

   (A)   Any person, firm, association or corporation, whose failure, omission,
default or violation it may be, shall be subject to a penalty of not less than
$100 nor more than $1,000 for failure or omission to keep the records required
herein or for the violation of any of the other provisions hereof, and each

UTILITY CODE
§ 54.01 PURPOSE.
   Utilities are frequently located in, on, under, or along county roads and
rights-of-way. It is the desire of the county that such utilities be located
outside of the county roads and rights-of-way where possible. Where such
facilities cannot be located on private property, the county understands that
there may be a public interest for utility installations to be accommodated
within the rights-of-way of county roadways. However, since the manner in which
these accommodations are carried out can have a significant effect upon the
function of the roadways, it is necessary for utility occupancy and use of the
rights-of-way to be regulated to ensure that the free and safe flow of traffic
is maintained, adequate provisions are made for maintenance and future
expansion of county roadways, that all activities are in compliance with
applicable federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including this
chapter, and that adequate steps are taken to evaluate any loss of productivity
of agricultural land due to denial of a particular application for utility
accommodation.
(Ord. —, passed 6-30-2009)

right-of-way. Protection shall be provided to the coated surface of the pipe by
having a mill applied coating as appropriate to the pipe size.
      (8)   An alternate method of installing concrete pipe shall be to jack a
casing pipe (sleeve) across the roadway. The concrete pipe (carrier) would then
be grouted into place within the casing. This method includes the assumption
that the concrete pipe being used does not require a cathodic protection system
to protect its metal elements.
   (C)   Testing. All installed piping within the county right-of-way will be
tested as required by USDOT Pipe Line Safety Standards.

      (1)   Underground crossings are allowed only through sleeves, conduits,
or heavier walled conduit with cathodic protection. The sleeve or conduit need
only extend from the ditch centerline to the ditch centerline on the other
side. Bends will be permitted on conduits which will contain electrical or
communications cables. Bends in liquid and gas lines should be avoided where
possible. In areas where excessive bury depths would be encountered; the County
Roads Department may allow a series of sleeves at different elevations. All
crossings shall be made as close to a right angle to the centerline of the
roadway as possible. Crossings will not be allowed through drainage pipes or
culverts. Crossing locations will be selected for minimum interference with
existing, planned, or potential construction and with regard to other utilities
crossing in the same area. Underground crossings shall not be placed within at
least 10 feet of structures. Vents or sleeves will be located beyond the ditch
line.
      (2)   Aerial crossings for utilities being accommodated under permit will
be allowed. Crossings shall be made as normal to the roadway as possible. Poles
shall be located no more than 1 foot inside the right-of-way where possible.
   (B)   Arterials and collectors - longitudinal.
      (1)   Longitudinal underground lines are allowed to be installed in
arterials or sections of arterials where access control lines do not exist. The
underground utilities must be installed outside of the shoulders, preferable
between the ditch centerline and a line 3 feet inside the right-of-way line to
allow a safe location strip for overhead facilities. Any appurtenances
necessary for the utility shall not be located at or above grade within travel
way, shoulder way or ditch line. Where there are no feasible alternatives,
appurtenances will not be located in the wheel path. Longitudinal underground
facilities shall not be placed within 10 feet of bridge foundations. The
longitudinal location will be selected for minimum interference with existing,
planned, or potential construction. The alignment selection shall be made with
cognizance of existing and future longitudinal locations by other utilities
parallel to the one being located. Where controlled access lines are present, a
utility may obtain permission to locate within these lines by written request
to the County Roads Department for an exemption based on the alternative
locations being cost prohibitive and/or technically unfeasible. Descriptions
and the cost of the requested location and the alternates must be shown.
      (2)   Longitudinal aerial lines for utilities being accommodated under
permit shall be located close to the right-of-way line, 1 foot inside, if
possible.
      (3)   Longitudinal electrical lines, both overhead and underground, shall
be limited to 98 kilovolts rms to ground.
   (C)   Conversion or roadway improvements. When a roadway is converted,
widened or realigned, existing underground utilities which, if not relocated,
would exist in the shoulders and may not have to be relocated provided:
      (1)   The present depth of cover, without adjustment, will be within
county specifications.
      (2)   The existing system is in good condition and can safely withstand
the stress of highway construction and maintenance traffic.
   (D)   Inadequate right-of-way. In areas where adequate right-of-way does not
exist outside the traveled roadway or sidewalk, the County Roads Department may
exclude the restrictions of this section to accommodate utilities if it is
determined that the levels of service and safety intended for this section of
roadway are not unreasonable compromised.
   (E)   Markers. The location of crossing facilities must be indicated by line
markers located at or outside the roadway right-of-way line except for
facilities crossing non-limited access roadways in cities, business, or
residential districts or where the placement of markers is not practical and
would not serve the purpose for which markers are intended. Markers should
indicate the name, address, and telephone number of the owner of the facility
and, in the case of pipelines, the substance conveyed.

§ 54.45 CONSOLIDATION AND JOINT USE.
   A utility is expected to consolidate its faculties when performing
relocation work in order to preserve as much of the corridor as possible for
the transportation function and for the accommodation of other utilities. For
the same reasons, utilities have a strong obligation to enter into joint use
agreements with other utilities wherever possible. The County Roads Department
may require proof that crosstalk or technical problems will not allow
consolidation or joint use techniques to be employed.
(Ord. —, passed 6-30-2009)
§ 54.46 ENCASEMENT AND CAPPING.
   (A)   Encasement and capping of utilities is permitted where conditions
warrant.
   (B)   ENCASEMENT, in this chapter, is defined as the surrounding of a
carrier pipe with concrete to protect the carrier from the load imposed by the
roadway and its traffic. Capping is defined as the placing of a concrete slab
over a facility. These techniques are useful when the carrier pipe must be used
with minimal cover or when unusually heavy loading is expected as in an area
where large earth moving equipment will be operating. Encasement is not
substituted for sleeving.

§ 54.50 JACKING.
   (A)   Jacking is the pushing of a sleeve or casing pipe under a roadway.
   (B)   When the pipe crossing under the roadway is to be jacked, the hole is
not to exceed the outside diameter of the pipe. The pipe shall be pushed
simultaneously with the auger so as to prevent cave-ins. The use of water by
itself will not be permitted. Construction methods using water in combination
with other materials to provide a stable bore may be approved by the County
Roads Department if the type of construction is found to be suitable for the
proposed installation.
   (C)   The pipe shall have sufficient length to extend beyond the shoulders.
No excavation for pushing pipes shall be made in the shoulder area.
   (D)   A heavy timber shaft at either end of the jacking pit will be provided

   (D)   It is the responsibility of the specific utilities, or agencies
responsible for construction work, to direct the contractor to begin the
grouting operation as soon as a sufficient length of tunnel liner plate has
been installed that will insure a proper seal. Grouting in general shall
proceed progressively with each adjacent set of holes provided in the liner
plates. All voids shall be completely filled within the working day with grout.
It will be necessary that a bulkhead be made sufficient to insure the proper
seal in order that all voids will be completely filled with the grout being
placed under pressure. The grouting equipment shall have a minimum capacity of
1/2 cubic yard in order to assure that adequate grouting materials will be
placed within a reasonable period of time to avoid the setting up of grouting
from the previous grout batch. Upon completion of grouting, all holes shall be
plugged with the fitting provided.

BRIDGE AND OTHER STRUCTURES
§ 54.60 GENERAL.
   Attaching utility lines to a roadway structure can materially affect the
structure, the safe operation of traffic and the efficiency of maintenance. Gas
lines over 100 psi and pipelines carrying explosives, corrosive or flammable
fluids will not be permitted to be installed on roadway structures. Where it is
feasible and reasonable to locate utility lines elsewhere, attachments to
roadway structures will not be permitted. Bridge attachment by a utility will
not be considered unless the structure in question is of a design that is
adequate to support the additional load and to accommodate the utility faculty
without compromise of roadway features, including reasonable ease of bridge
maintenance.
(Ord. —, passed 6-30-2009)
§ 54.61 INSTALLATION ARRANGEMENTS.
   (A)   The utility should submit, through the County Roads Department, a
request to have its facility attached to the bridge, a statement describing
alternative methods, and their relative costs, of getting the facility over or
around the obstacle, and a description of the facility including the weight per
foot of its contents. Details relative to the contents such as pressure,
voltage, current, flammability, freeze point, and temperature should be
included.
   (B)   Appropriate devices to protect the bridge and the facility such as
valves, circuit breakers, and pressure sensors should be provided and
explained. The proposed method of attachment should be described with the aid
of sketches detailing the proposed horizontal and vertical alignment. High
quality drawings will be required at this point in time.
   (C)   The cost of the utility facility installation, including the
additional bridge engineering and modifications, will be borne by the utility
company. The County Roads Department reserves the right to approve/disprove the
engineering firm performing the modification design.
(Ord. —, passed 6-30-2009)
§ 54.62 METHODS OF ATTACHMENT.
   (A)   The utility, if possible, is to be supported by diaphragms between the
first interior stringers so as not to be visible from below when approaching
the structure.
   (B)   Bridge vertical clearance must be reduced. Entire installation
including supporting brackets, etc., must be above the bottom of the highest
adjacent stringer. On-site drilling of bridge concrete or welding to existing
steel will not be allowed. Provisions for expansion and contraction of the
facility must be compatible with the expansion and contraction design of the
bridge. Sleeving will usually not be required, but carrier pipes may have to
have either heavier wall thickness than usual or for steel pipe have a higher
yield strength by using a design factor 20% lower than that required by the US
DOT Pipeline Safety Standards to provide more safety factor. Support rollers,
saddles, and hangers may require padding or coating to minimize vibration noise
and wear. Coating systems for utilities must be compatible with the life
expectancy of coating systems of bridge members, where applicable. Metallic
conduits are to have adequate positive grounds.
   (C)   Gas mains up to 100 psi operating pressure.
      (1)   General. If there is no cut off valve on the pressure side of the
main within 200 feet of the bridge, the County Roads Department may require the
installation of a valve closer to the bridge.
      (2)   On structures.
         (a)   In sidewalks. On new structures and rehabilitated structures
(new decks), gas mains may be placed within the sidewalk area, provided
suitable methods acceptable to the County Roads Department can be devised to
vent the sidewalk. If encasement is used, casing pipes are to be extended
through sleeves in the back walls. Carrier pipes at a distance of at least 10
feet outside the extremities of the structure. Casing pipes shall be vented to
the atmosphere through a screened vent. This vent is to be located outside the
shoulder line behind the guardrail.
         (b)   Between beams.
            1.   Where the encased carrier pipe is too large to be placed in
the sidewalk, it is to be placed between beams. In this case, the casing pipe
may be omitted, but the area between beams shall be vented by suitable openings
whose design does not allow deck concrete and steel to be attacked by deicing
salts. Casing pipes are to be vented to the atmosphere through screened vents.
Vents are to be located so that no gas will be trapped in pockets between beams
and diaphragms.
            2.   Gas mains are to be supported by existing diaphragms where
possible. Additional supports between diaphragms are to be placed as required.
On existing structures these additional supports are to be attached to the
beams by bolting. Welding to existing steel beams will not be permitted. Where
a gas main must be hung below the diaphragm, it is to be supported by hangers
specially designed for this use.
            3.   Attachments to concrete structures, if permitted, must conform
to the general structure, aesthetic and other specific requirements for steel
structures but the details thereof shall be determined on a case by case basis.
            4.   Expansion joints in the gas main shall be compatible with the
expansion and contraction design of the bridge.
            5.   Sleeves through the back walls are to be caulked to prevent
seepage of water through the back walls.
            6.   The gas main is to be protected as much as possible from
electrolysis caused by stray electric current.
         (c)   Underground in vicinity of structures.
            1.   Gas mains installed underground are to be encased in steel
pipes where they lie within the right-of-way. The casing pipe is to be extended
to the right-of-way lines and is to be sealed to the carrier pipe at each end.
It is to be vented to the atmosphere through screened vents located at the
right-of-way lines. The casing pipe may be installed by jacking, or tunneling,
or where permitted, by open cut.
            2.   Casing pipes are to be designed to accommodate all externally
applied loads. Where the gas main is installed by tunneling beneath the roadway
and tunnel liner plates are installed, a solid steel casing pipe must also be
used to contain and safely vent any gas escaping from the carrier pipe.
   (D)   Water and sewer piping.
      (1)   General. A cutoff valve is to be placed just off the bridge in the
pipeline on the pressure side of the structure. Concrete buttresses are to be
placed as appropriate at each end of the structure.
      (2)   On structures.
         (a)   Water mains and sewer lines on structures are usually placed
between beams, preferably between the fascia beam and the first interior beam.
This will permit placing the pipe in the shoulder on the approaches to the
bridge. Piping is to be supported, if possible, by the existing diaphragms.
Additional supports may be placed as required. They must be attached to the
existing beams by bolts. Welding to existing beams will not be allowed. The
piping may be placed on top of the diaphragms with U bolts or other suitable
means to hold the pipe in place. Hangers, if used, shall be of a type
especially designed for this use. Expansion joints for the piping shall be
compatible with the expansion and contraction design of the bridge. The piping
shall be fitted with dresser couplings, or approved equal, to enable
adjustments for expansion, contraction, and deflection. A crows-foot
restraining device placed at each joint of sufficient length to facilitate
removal of any section of pipe without damage or removal of an adjacent section
is recommended.
         (b)   Attachments to a concrete structure, if permitted, must conform
to the basic structural, aesthetic and other specific requirements for steel
structures but the details must be tailored to the particular concrete
structure.
         (c)   The piping is to pass through sleeves in the back walls. These
are to be caulked to prevent seepage of water through the back walls. Piping up
to 12 inches in diameter is to be covered with insulation to prevent freezing.
No portion of the piping or its support is to project below the bottom flange
of the highest adjacent beam.
      (3)   Underground vicinity of structures.
         (a)   Underground piping shall be placed in casing pipes where pipe
size and soil materials are such that flow from a broken main would jeopardize
bridge supports.
         (b)   Casing pipes are to extend for the full width of the right-of-
way sufficiently beyond footings so that water from a broken main will be
safely discharged away from the footing. The casing pipe shall be sealed to the
carrier pipe at the high end and open into a manhole at the low end. The casing
may be either steel or reinforced concrete, and shall be designed for all
externally applied loads and for the internal pressure from a ruptured carrier
pipe. A valve is to be installed on the pressure side of the right-of-way. The
piping is to be located at least 10 feet from the nearest bridge footing, and
the casing pipe is to be installed in 10-foot maximum lengths. As each length
is installed, it is to be backfilled and thoroughly tamped before additional
excavation is performed. The open ends of the casing pipe are to be closed at
the end of each working day.
   (E)   Power and communication lines.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   Power and communication lines to be attached to structures must
be installed in conformance to National Electric Code and National Safety Code
requirements. Electrical lines with voltage in excess of 98 kilovolts rms to
ground will not be installed on structures.
         (b)   For the safety of persons using the bridge; signing to warn all
users of the voltage shall be provided as set forth herein under this section.
      (2)   On structures.
         (a)   In sidewalks (or parapets). On new structures and rehabilitated
structures, the power or communication lines placed in conduits may be
installed within the sidewalk or parapet area. On an existing structure,
removal and replacement of existing sidewalk and/or parapet to accommodate the
lines in these areas may be acceptable, should this be the feasible alternative
without cost to the county and with minimal inconvenience to traffic.
Installations in the sidewalk or parapet areas shall conform, to the extent
applicable, with Division of Bridge Development Structural Standards Nos. BR-
SS-6.09, 79-70 sheets 1 and 2 of 2 and BR-SS-0.01, 75-13 sheets 1 and 2 of 2,
latest revision.
         (b)   Between beams.
            1.   Power and communication lines to be installed on structures
are to be placed in conduits. Conduits are to be supported by existing
diaphragms where possible. When additional supporting members are required,
they are to be attached to the beams by bolts. No welding to existing steel
will be permitted. Conduits are to be placed between fascia and first interior
beam, if possible. Telephone and other low voltage (50 volts or less) lines may
be placed in plastic, fiberglass, or PVC conduits. High voltage lines must be
placed in steel conduits. Conduits are to have expansion/deflection joints that
are compatible with the design of the bridge. No part of the installation shall
project below the bottom flange of the highest adjacent beam.
            2.   Metal sleeves through the abutment back walls are to be
provided for passage of the conduits. These are to be caulked to prevent
leakage of water through the back wall.
            3.   Attachments to a concrete structure, if permitted, must
conform to the general intent of the basic structural, aesthetic, and other
specific requirements for steel structures but the details will be tailored to
suit the particular concrete structure.
   (F)   General requirements for all utilities.
      (1)   No utility installation is to be placed on the outside of a
structure where it will be visible.
      (2)   When a utility passes through a back wall, spaces around the metal
sleeved penetration are to be filled with non-shrink grout, and then caulked to
prevent leakage of water.
      (3)   To comply with the requirement that no part of an installation may
project below the bottom of the highest adjacent stringer, it may be necessary
to raise or replace existing diaphragms with smaller diaphragms, and to place
additional ones as necessary to support the installation and to equal the
strength of the diaphragms removed. Removal and replacement shall be carried
out progressively. All connections shall be bolted. Welded connections are not
permitted.
      (4)   Casing pipes should have provisions to drain condensate.

§ 54.64 BLASTING.
   Blasting is generally not permitted within 100 feet of a bridge. When
blasting is to be performed, the following criteria must be adhered to:
   (A)   Before any blasting is permitted, the contractor, accompanied by a
representative of the County Roads Department must inspect the existing
structure, photographing, marking and noting any cracks, fractures, and/or
other signs of existing damage. After the completion of the blasting, the
structure is to be re-inspected by the contractor together with a
representative of the County Roads Department. Any enlargement of existing
cracks, new cracks or other damage to the structure must be considered to have
been caused by the contractor's blasting. This additional damage must be
repaired or replaced at the contractor's expense. These repairs must be made to
the satisfaction of the County Roads Department.
   (B)   A seismograph is to be placed on the pier or abutment footing nearest
to the point of blasting. The seismograph is to be operated by a person
qualified to read and interpret the information obtained.
   (C)   Test shots using small charges and time delays are to be set off,
noting the particle velocity as recorded by the seismograph. A maximum of 2
inches per second will be permitted.
   (D)   The sizes and time delays of the main shots will be determined by the
test shots, bearing in mind that the particle velocity shall not exceed 2
inches per second.
   (E)   Even though the County Roads Department specifies the maximum readings
on the seismograph, this does not relieve the contractor of responsibility for
any damage sustained by the structure.

54.99
§ 54.65 ABANDONMENT.
   (A)   When a utility facility is no longer required on a bridge, the utility
will notify the County Roads Department. The County Roads Department will
decide if that facility must be removed, the removal cost being the
responsibility of the utility company.
   (B)   If the County Roads Department determines the utility should be
removed, then removal shall be accomplished within 6 months. The County Roads
Department will determine prior to work beginning if a bond will be required by
the facility owner to insure that removal costs are accounted for if
abandonment is required.

§ 70.04 ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY; WEIGHING AND MEASUREMENT REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Authority of police officers.
      (1)   Any police officer having reason to believe the size or weight of a
commercial motor vehicle and load being operated on a highway is unlawful may
require the driver to stop and submit to a measurement or weighing, or both, of
the vehicle by means of either portable or stationary scales or measuring
devices in accordance with methods of weighing established by rules and
regulations compiled by experts in the field of weights and measures.
      (2)   As used in this section, POLICE OFFICER means any uniformed police
officer.
(Anno. Code (1951), § 278; 1951, Ch. 311, § 254; 1953, Ch. 166; 1955, Chs. 204

   (B)   Weighing and measurement procedures.
      (1)   Measurement or weighing of commercial vehicles. The driver of every
commercial motor vehicle directed to do so by any sign or by any police officer
shall stop his vehicle and submit it to measurement or weighing, or both, by
means of either portable or stationary scales or measuring devices. Operation
of the vehicle upon any highway of this state shall signify the consent of the
driver and of the owner of the vehicle to submit to the measurement and
weighing. The signs may be displayed only by officers and civilian employees of
the Department of Maryland State Police or Sheriff’s Office assigned to enforce
this subchapter.
      (2)   Removal of excess weight; first offense leniency for carriers of
indivisible or perishable loads; tolerances for milk carriers. Whenever, upon
the measuring or weighing of a vehicle and load, the vehicle is found to be in
violation of the law, a police officer may require the driver to remove the
excess weight if the overweight does not exceed 5,000 pounds. If the overweight
exceeds 5,000 pounds, the vehicle must be unloaded until the vehicle complies
with the applicable law before the vehicle can be moved, and all material or
cargo so unloaded shall be cared for by the owner or operator of the vehicle at
the risk of the owner or operator; provided, however, that on the first offense
by a person operating a vehicle which has an indivisible load, the vehicle may
be allowed to proceed after obtaining a permit from the County Roads
Supervisor, but on second or subsequent offenses, the vehicle carrying the
indivisible load must return to the place of entry or origin in the state after
obtaining a permit from the County Roads Supervisor to do so and provided,
further, that a vehicle violating the law and carrying as its full load
perishable products shall for the first offense only by the person operating
the vehicle, be allowed to proceed to the destination, but for a second or
subsequent offense within any 1 calendar year, the products must be unloaded
before the vehicle can be moved. Vehicles bearing valid registration plates
issued by this state and transporting liquid milk in bulk from the producer may
receive a 5% tolerance on the applicable registration or statutory gross weight
limit, but in no event shall the registration or statutory gross weight limit,
including the 5% tolerance, exceed a total of 73,280 pounds.
      (3)   Failure to stop and submit to measurement or weighing. Any driver
who fails to stop and submit to measurement or weighing, as required by this
section, or who fails to obey an order to drive upon scales as directed by a
police officer shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.
(1986 Code, § 248-6) (Ord. —, passed 8-30-1971)

   (A)   Whoever shall violate a provision of this title for which no specific
penalty is provided shall be punished as set forth in §
10.99.
   (B)   Upon conviction of any person for a violation of any provisions of §§
70.01 et seq., the following fines shall be imposed:
      (1)   A loading error or tolerance of 1,000 pounds is allowable, and only
weight in excess of the 1,000 pounds of tolerance shall be a violation. For a
weight violation over the registered weight or any statutory weight limit,
every pound of excess weight up to 5,000 pounds shall be imposed. The minimum
fine shall be $20.
      (2)   For a weight violation in excess of 5,000 pounds over the
registered weight or any statutory weight limit, a fine of $0.06 for each
additional pound of excess weight over 5,000 pounds shall be imposed.
   (C)   Upon conviction for any violation, no fine shall be suspended or
reduced, but, in computing the fine, a credit of any excess weight caused by an
accumulation of cinders, snow or ice shall be given. If the vehicle being
operated at the time the offense is committed is registered outside of Maryland
or if the person responsible for the violation or the person operating the
vehicle is a nonresident of the state, further proceedings shall be had as to
the person, or the vehicle shall be impounded until the fine is paid or
acceptable collateral posted. The impounding of the vehicle does not include
the cargo, and the cargo shall not be held. If, after 90 days from the date the
vehicle was impounded, the fine has not been paid or acceptable collateral
posted, the court shall satisfy the fine, accrued interest and costs.

notice. The action may include, in addition to the remedies provided in
§ 111.99, an order for the revocation of any junkyard license by the Board; or
      (2)   If the Inspector finds that the person or persons responsible for
the violation have made a good faith effort to correct the violation, the
Inspector may provide notice to perform such further corrective measures as
deemed necessary by the Inspector. The notice shall be issued pursuant to
division (A) of this section and may be appealed pursuant to division (B) of
this section. If all corrective measures have not been fulfilled by the
conclusion of the second notification period, the Inspector shall initiate
appropriate action as specified in division (C)(1) above.

requires immediate action to protect the public health or safety, he or she
may, without notice or hearing, issue an order reciting the existence of such
an emergency and requiring that corrective action be taken within 30 days or as
he or she deems necessary to meet the emergency. Notwithstanding the other
provisions of this chapter, the order shall be effective immediately. Any
person to whom the order is directed shall comply therewith immediately, but
upon filing a petition with the Board, shall be afforded a hearing within 7
days of the receipt by the Board of the petition. After the hearing, depending
upon its findings as to whether the provisions of this chapter have been
complied with, the Board shall continue such order in effect, modify it or
revoke it.
   (E)   Any person aggrieved by this decision of the Board may seek relief
therefrom in any court of competent jurisdiction, as provided by the laws of
this state.

STANDARDS
§ 111.40 GENERAL.
   (A)   The requirements of this chapter shall be supplementary to and shall
not contravene any requirements pertaining to junkyards specified in any zoning
ordinance adopted by the Board pursuant to the authority of Md. Code, Art. 66B,
but the provisions of this chapter shall prevail to the extent that they are
more restrictive.
   (B)   Every junkyard required to comply with Md. Code, Transportation
Article, Subtitle 8, and more specifically, with the regulations promulgated
thereunder, shall also be required to comply with the requirements of
§§ 111.40 et seq.
   (C)   Any junkyard lawfully existing and licensed by the Board before March
7, 1988, but which does not conform to the standards set forth in §§
111.41 and
111.42, may continue to operate, provided that the junkyard complies with
standards and conditions set forth in the junkyard’s initial license as
approved by the Board. After March 7, 1988 no junkyard shall be licensed nor
any junkyard expanded except in full compliance with this chapter.

§ 111.41 SETBACKS.
   (A)   No portion of a junkyard property that is occupied for junkyard
purposes may be located closer than the following distances:
      (1)   From the right-of-way line of a public road or highway: 100 feet;
      (2)   From side boundary lines not bordering a right-of-way of a public
road or highway: 50 feet;
      (3)   From any land owned or leased by a government agency for
recreation, open space, conservation or related purposes: 500 feet;
      (4)   From a residence, retail business, school, hospital, church or
other institutional facilities: 500 feet, unless from the evidence submitted,
the Board concludes the proposed method of screening the junkyard would
effectively prevent the junkyard from being detrimental to or detracting from
the value of every such use.
   (B)   Upon a finding of unnecessary hardship pursuant to division (G) of
this section, the Board may, in the case of a nonconforming junkyard:
      (1)   Authorize a permanent setback variance from any permanent
structure;
      (2)   Establish permanent setback lines less stringent than those
specified in division (A) of this section, provided that the setbacks shall
conform as nearly as is reasonably possible under the circumstances to the
setbacks specified in division (A) of this section; and
      (3)   Authorize a temporary setback variance for a period not exceed 9
months, within which time all “junk” materials and nonpermanent objects and
structures shall be moved to comply with the permanent setback lines
established through the preceding division (2).

§ 111.42 SCREENING.
   (A)   Each licensed junkyard shall, within 9 months of the issuance of the
license, be enclosed to screen the junkyard from view by the traveling public
and from adjoining properties. The screening shall consist of vegetative or
structural materials, or both, as specified by the Board. The Board may waive
the requirement for installing additional screening where the Board concludes
that the junkyard will not be visible from a public road or from every
adjoining property, provided that the applicant agrees to maintain such
screening as then exists.
   (B)   The screening shall be installed by the licensee in accordance with
plans approved by the Board as part of the license and shall be maintained in
good order and repair by the licensee. The screening shall be constructed
according to setback requirements in
§ 111.41.
   (C)   Vegetative screening shall be preferred, to consist of trees, shrubs,
or other plant materials of such aggregate size, location and density as to
comply with division (A) of this section. The screening shall, at the time of
planting, be not less than 5 feet in height and shall be designed to grow to
and shall be maintained at a height of not less than 7 feet. The screening
shall ordinarily have a depth of not less than 10 feet measured perpendicularly
from tree centers. The vegetative screening shall consist of 2 staggered rows
of trees with the rows being 10 feet apart measured perpendicularly from tree
centers. Trees within the respective rows shall be spaced not further than 12
feet apart (measured from centers). The proposed species of vegetation shall be
indicated on the site plan submitted in accordance with §
111.21(B). The Board shall, upon request, supply a list naming desirable
vegetative species to fulfill this vegetative screening requirement.
   (D)   In lieu of vegetative screening, the Board may authorize and require
screening constructed of mounded earth, wood, stone, or brick, or other
appropriate material, if the Board finds that such constructed screening would
be more harmonious than vegetative screening with the present or intended
future character of the neighborhood. If authorized by the Board, the screening
shall be sightly and shall not be of a different quality, type, or dimension,
and shall be maintained and/or painted so as not to detract from the
surroundings. The screening shall be kept in good repair at all times and shall
have no openings through which persons or animals may enter, except for doors
or gates necessary for ingress or egress to the junkyard, which said doors or
gates shall be kept closed except when actually needed for ingress or egress.
   (E)   Upon a finding of unnecessary hardship pursuant to §
111.21(G), the Board may, in the case of a nonconforming junkyard, authorize a
permanent variance from the requirement in division (A) of this section that
the junkyard be completely screened. The variances shall be sparingly granted,
and only in the case where the Board finds, from an examination of the
topographical character of the properties involved, that it would not
reasonably be possible to achieve complete screening; such variances shall be
granted only for as much of the perimeter of the junkyard as meets this
criterion and shall not relieve the licensee of the responsibility to install
and maintain as much screening as the Board shall judge reasonable under the
circumstances.

§ 111.43 ACCESS.
   (A)   No driveway or other point of vehicular access to a junkyard shall
intersect any public road within 100 feet of the point of intersection of 2
public roads, measured along the centerlines thereof.
   (B)   Except in unusual circumstances, the Board shall not authorize more
than 1 driveway or other point of vehicular access for every 300 feet of
frontage of a junkyard along a public road. No such driveway shall be more than
30 feet in width.
   (C)   Upon a finding of unnecessary hardship pursuant to §
111.21(G), the Board may, in the case of a nonconforming junkyard, authorize an
access variance, either permanently or for a period not to exceed 9 months.

in strict compliance with applicable county and state air quality regulations.

§ 111.45 SIGNS.
   (A)   Every junkyard shall be entitled to have not more than 1
identification sign on the premises. The sign shall not be larger than 200
square feet in size. No part of the sign shall extend more than 20 feet above
the ground.
   (B)   No sign shall constitute a public safety or traffic hazard, such as by
obstructing traffic signals, traffic signs, road warning signs, street name
signs, or the full view of the traffic in all directions at driveways,
entranceways, or any other intersections on a public road.
   (C)    Lighting devices shall be shielded so that they do not create a glare
or a nuisance by shining directly into a public street or highway or into an
adjoining property. No flashing or rotating flashing illumination of a sign
shall be permitted.

   (A)   A violation of any section of this chapter, including the maintenance
or operation of any such junkyard or dump without a license, is a misdemeanor,
subject upon conviction to a fine of not less than $50. Each day on which a
violation continues is a separate offense.
   (B)   If a junkyard, automotive dismantler and recycler facility, or scrap

appropriate authorities of Garrett County, in addition to other remedies, may
institute an injunction in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent any
illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about such premises. The rights and
remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and are in addition to all

CONSUMPTION ON PUBLIC PROPERTY
§ 112.01 FINDINGS.
   (A)   The Board of County Commissioners of Garrett County, Maryland, a body

   (B)   The provisions of Md. Code, Art. 2B, § 19-202 prohibit a person from
consuming any alcoholic beverage on public property unless authorized by the
governmental entity that has jurisdiction over that property. The Act further
provides, in § 19-203, that any local governmental entity that owns or
otherwise has jurisdiction over the property may adopt standards providing for
the authorization of the consumption of alcoholic beverages otherwise
prohibited by the Act, if consistent with the intended use of the property by
the general public.
   (C)   The county finds, and has found, that the consumption of alcoholic
beverages on Program Open Space property is consistent with the intended use of
that property by the general public when, and only when, the operators of the
Program Open Space property have secured the appropriate authority and have
been issued a license for the consumption of alcoholic beverages and the sale
of such beverages by the Board of License Commissioners of Garrett County,
Maryland, pursuant to the Act.

§ 113.01 ELIGIBILITY.
   All commercial and industrial businesses (the “qualified business”) located
in Garrett County are eligible for the County real property tax credit,
provided that qualified business makes a capital improvement to it’s real
property in the minimum amount of $100,000 on or after July 1, 2007 (the
“minimum capital investment”). The minimum capital investment shall be
determined by the State Department of Assessment and Taxation in accordance
with it’s rules and regulations for the assessment of real property in the
State of Maryland and in accordance with this chapter.
(Res. 2008-9, passed 6-24-2008)
§ 113.02 VALUATION.
   The County real property tax credit is based on the initial assessment of
the new construction or renovation of an existing property (the “improved
property”) to be determined at the time the improved property is subject to
assessment by the State and results in the improved property’s addition to the
county’s tax roles. The valuation of the improved property is to be determined
by the improved property’s value at the time of it’s assessment and is not to
be effected by any increase in general property values or assessments as
determined by the State Department of Assessment and Taxation.
(Res. 2008-9, passed 6-2420-08)
§ 113.03 TAX CREDIT.
   The amount of the credit shall be equal to 50% of the increase in the county
real estate tax levied on the improved property, due on any expansion,
renovation or capital improvement in the property over the first year, and for
the subsequent four-year period, the credit decreases by 10% annually (40%,
30%, 20%, 10%). After five years of county real estate tax credits, the
improved property shall return to the tax rolls at its then full-assessed
value.
(Res. 2008-9, passed 6-24-2008)
§ 113.04 EFFECTIVE DATE OF CREDIT.
   The tax credit shall apply to full tax years only. A qualified business will
be required to pay any partial year county taxes that may be issued. The tax
credit for a qualified business will then receive the county property tax
credit for the five year period as provided by §
113.03.
(Res. 2008-9, passed 6-24-2008)
§ 113.05 ENTERPRISE ZONE PROPERTY TAX CREDIT.
   A qualified business located in one of the county’s enterprise zones and
eligible for enterprise zone property tax credits will remain eligible for the
tax credit, but only to the extent that the tax credit does not duplicate the
enterprise zone property tax credit. In no event can the combined enterprise
zone property tax credit and the tax credit exceed 100% of the real property
taxes levied and assessed on the improved property.
(Res. 2008-9, passed 6-24-2008)
§ 113.06 EXISTING FACILITIES.
   (A)   In the event a business purchases an existing facility instead of
constructing a new facility in the county, the new business will be eligible
for the county property tax credit only if improvements are made to the
property and those improvements meet the minimum requirements of the county’s
property tax credit program.
   (B)   The amount of the county property tax credit allowed will pass through
to the commercial or industrial business that conducts the activity that
qualifies for the credit. The term of the tax credit may not exceed the term of
the lease and may not exceed five years.
(Res. 2008-9, passed 6-24-2008)
§ 113.07 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   The Garrett County Department of Economic Development (the
“Department”) is the designated county agency responsible for the
administration of the property tax credit.
   (B)   To qualify for the county property tax credit, a business must be
certified by the Department as a qualified business. The process for
certification by the Department shall be as follows:
      (1)   The business must notify the Department’s designated contact of its
intent to seek certification for the county property tax credit immediately
upon completion of any expansion, renovation, or capital improvement in the
property.
      (2)   The business must complete and submit the application (to be
provided by the Department) to the Department. If the business qualifies, the
Department’s designated contact will issue a certificate of eligibility.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 151.001 PURPOSE, AUTHORITY AND JURISDICTION.
   (A)   The purposes of this chapter are to protect human life and health,
minimize property damage, encourage appropriate construction practices to
minimize future damage, protect individuals from unwittingly buying land
subject to flood hazards, and to protect water supply, sanitary sewage
disposal, and natural drainage. The prevention of unwise development in areas
subject to flooding will reduce financial burdens to the community and the
State, and will prevent future displacement and suffering of its residents.
This protection is achieved through this review of all activities proposed
within identified floodplains and by the issuance of permits for those
activities that comply with the objectives of this chapter.
   (B)    Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform
vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of
peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge,
prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations,
recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best
served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the
natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water
bodies should be preserved and enhanced.
   (C)   This chapter provides a unified, comprehensive approach to floodplain
management which addresses these natural floodplain functions and the federal
and state programs concerned with floodplain management.
   (D)   This chapter is adopted under authority of the National Flood
Insurance Act of 1968 and the Flood Hazard Management Act of 1976, Environment
Article, Title 5 of the Annotated Code of Maryland and in compliance with the
National Flood Insurance Program as set forth in the Code of Federal
Regulations – 44 C.F.R. Section 59.22.
   (E)   This chapter shall apply to the unincorporated part of the county and
any incorporated municipality which may enter into an agreement with the county
to enforce floodplain management regulations within municipal boundaries.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013)
§ 151.002 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter supersedes and is intended to replace the County Floodplain
Management Ordinance adopted on October 2, 2013. However, any other ordinance
shall remain in full force to the extent that its provisions are more
restrictive.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013; Am. Ord. —, passed 1-
22-2019)
§ 151.003 APPLICABILITY.
   Any person or entity proposing to do any development within floodplain zones
as defined and regulated by this chapter must first obtain a permit for that
development from the Garrett County Permits and Inspections Office and must
comply with all provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013)
§ 151.004 PARTIAL INVALIDITY AND SEVERABILITY.
   If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the remainder of the
chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in force.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013)
§ 151.005 DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection provided by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on engineering experience and
scientific methods of study. Floods of greater magnitude may occur or flood
heights may be increased by man-made and natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that flooding will not occur outside of the delineated floodplain zone,
nor that permitted development and land uses within the floodplain will be free
of flooding and associated flood damage. This chapter does not create liability
on the part of the community, any officer, or employee thereof for any damage
which may result from reliance on this chapter.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013)

studies and on flood insurance rate maps as zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30 and A99.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. The date the building permit was issued, provided the
actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition
placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The
first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For substantial improvement, the START OF CONSTRUCTION is the first
alteration of any structural part of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including but not limited to,
manufactured homes, gas and liquid storage tanks, garages, barns, and sheds.
   SUBDIVISION. The division or redivision of lots, tracts, parcels or other
divisions of land, including a change in existing lot lines for the purpose,

or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS.
      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost
of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure (less land
value) either before the improvement or repair is started or if the structure
has incurred substantial damage and been restored, before the damage occurred.
      (2)   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT occurs when the first alteration of any
wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences. The
minimum repairs needed to correct previously identified violations of local
health, safety, or sanitary codes, and alterations to historic structures which
do not preclude their continued designation as historic structures are not
considered SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   TEMPORARY STRUCTURE. Any structure completely removed within 180 days from
issuance of the permit.
   VARIANCE. The grant of relief from a term or terms of this chapter.
   VIOLATION. Any construction or development in a special flood hazard area
that is being performed without an issued permit. The failure of a building,
structure, or other development for which a permit is issued to be fully
compliant with these regulations and the conditions of the issued permit. A
building, structure, or other development without the required design
certification, the elevation certificate, or other evidence of compliance is
required is presumed to be a VIOLATION until such time as the required
documentation is provided.
   WATERCOURSE. The channel, including channel banks and bed of nontidal waters
of the state.

FLOODPLAIN ZONES
§ 151.020 IDENTIFICATION OF FLOODPLAIN ZONES.
   The regulatory floodplain shall be those areas of the County delineated as
Special Flood Hazard Areas and base flood elevations within the Flood Insurance
Study (FIS) for Garrett County, Maryland and incorporated areas dated February
1, 2019 as may be revised and the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRMs) and all subsequent amendments and revisions to the FIRMs. The FIS and
FIRMs are retained on file and available to the public at the Permits and
Inspections Office.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013; Am. Ord. —, passed 1-

§ 151.021 FLOODPLAIN ZONES.
   (A)   A community may have these nontidal floodplain zones:
      (1)   Floodplain: that part of the floodplain outside of the floodway.
      (2)   Floodway: that area of the floodplain reserved to discharge the
waters of the 100-year flood.
   (B)   Nontidal floodplains may have detailed engineering study data,
profiles, and water surface elevations,or may have approximate delineations
only.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013)
§ 151.022 FLOODPLAIN BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Floodplain zone determination. The local permitting official will
determine the floodplain zone in which the development activity is proposed
using the FIRMs and FIS if applicable. Without prior approval from FEMA, the
community shall use no other data to enforce floodplain management regulations.
Where map boundaries and elevations disagree, elevations prevail, with approval
from FEMA through the issuance of a letter of map change or amendment.
   (B)   Approximate floodplain determination. For development proposed in the
approximate floodplain (no water surface elevations or floodway data provided),
the applicant must use the best available information to determine the
elevation of the 100-year flood and the extent of the floodway, and must
delineate these on the site plan submitted for approval. For new subdivisions,
the applicant must have the 100-year flood elevations certified by a registered
professional engineer based on hydrologic and hydraulic analyses which include
a floodway analysis.

§ 151.023 DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS IN FLOODPLAIN ZONES.
   (A)   Generally. In order to prevent excessive flood damage and to allow for
the protection of the natural and beneficial floodplain functions, the
following provisions shall apply to all development, new construction, and
substantial improvements to existing structures in all floodplain zones. If a
structure is in more than 1 zone, the more stringent provisions shall apply to
the entire structure. The specific requirements contained in §§
151.085 through
151.092 also apply to development in this subchapter. Any approved development
shall comply with all other zoning, environmental, water quality and sanitary
regulations, as well as applicable state and federal requirements.
   (B)   Watercourses. In all floodplain zones, any development which proposes
to alter a watercourse must obtain a variance. All conditions for encroachment
in the floodway must be met and adverse impacts to aquatic resources must be
minimized. Adjacent communities and property owners, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, FEMA, and the MDE must be notified by the applicant before any
modification may occur to watercourses. Any activity falling within the 100-
year nontidal floodplain may require a waterway construction permit from the
MDE.
   (C)   Wetlands. Encroachment by development into wetlands is not allowed
without state and federal permits. It is state and federal policy that
disturbance of wetlands shall be avoided. The applicant must demonstrate that
no alternatives exist and the encroachment is the minimum necessary. Mitigation
may be required by the appropriate regulatory authorities.
   (D)   Sediment and stormwater management. Any land disturbance permitted in
the floodplain must have a stormwater management and sediment and erosion
control plan as required by state and local regulations. The plan must include
design of land contours that will not increase surface water runoff onto
neighboring properties. Ground cover must be established immediately after
disturbance.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013)
PERMIT PROCEDURES
§ 151.030 GENERAL.
   A floodplain management permit is required for all development in any
designated floodplain area. It shall be granted only after all necessary permit
applications are approved by applicable federal and state agencies. A permit
issued by the local permitting official under this chapter is not valid until
all necessary permits for development are obtained. Receipt of federal or state
permits does not exempt development from the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013)

§ 151.033 ISSUANCE OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Considerations.
      (1)   Prior to issuance of a permit, the local permitting official shall
determine the location of the project relative to floodways and floodplains,
and shall note on the permit the proper elevation to which the lowest floor of
proposed structures must be elevated. In approximate floodplains where an
elevation is not available, the applicant shall be required to obtain the
elevation. The applicant must agree to secure all other required permits, an
elevation certificate, floodproofing certificate, engineering analysis, or
other required verifications deemed appropriate by the local permitting
official.
      (2)   Permits shall be granted by the local permitting official only
after determining that the proposed development will be in complete conformance
with the requirements of this chapter and all other applicable local codes and
ordinances. All other necessary permits or approvals must be granted. Permits
are valid only after all other necessary permits are granted.
   (B)   Dam safety. Caution should be exercised when approving development
downstream of existing or proposed dams. The condition of the dam, as well as
the design criteria, hazard class, and the danger reach, should be investigated
to avoid increasing potential hazards. Dams must meet design criteria based on
the potential impacts downstream of the dam. Downstream development within the
dam break flood wave shall be denied unless the dam meets the design standards
for a high hazard dam.
   (C)   After issuance and during construction.
      (1)   After issuance of a permit, no changes of any kind shall be made to
the application, permit, or any of the plans, specifications, or other
documents submitted with the application without the written approval of the
local permitting official. A copy of the permit or other verification must be
displayed at the construction site during construction activity.
      (2)   Work on the permitted activity shall begin within 180 days of the
issuance of the permit, or the permit shall expire, unless a written extension
is granted by the local permitting official.
      (3)   During construction, the local permitting official or an authorized
representative shall inspect the site to determine that the work is in
compliance with the permit. Any work found to be noncompliant must be corrected
before any additional work is undertaken.
   (D)   Record of permits. A record of all floodplain permits shall be
maintained in the Permits and Inspections Office and be available upon request
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency or its authorized agent (MDE)
during periodic assessments of this community’s participation in the National
Flood Insurance Program. All documents needed to support any permit action,
such as elevation certificates, map amendments or revisions, variance actions,
shall be available for review during these assessments.

DEVELOPMENT—FLOODPLAIN
§ 151.055 GENERAL.
   Development may not occur in the floodplain where alternative locations
exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved. Before a permit is
issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures cannot be located
out of the floodplain and that encroachments onto the floodplain are minimized.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013)
§ 151.056 ELEVATION REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Residential structures. All new or substantially improved residential
structures, including manufactured homes, shall have the lowest floor elevated
to or above the flood protection elevation. Basements are not permitted. The
elevation of the lowest floor shall be certified by a registered surveyor or
professional engineer on the elevation certificate, after the lowest floor is
in place. Enclosures below the flood protection elevation must be constructed
with water equalizing vents to meet the specifications of §
151.086. Improvements which are less than substantial shall be constructed to
minimize damage during flooding or shall be elevated to the greatest extent
possible.
   (B)   Nonresidential structures. All new or substantially improved
nonresidential structures shall either be elevated as set forth above for
residential structures or shall be floodproofed. Floodproofing designs must
ensure that areas below the flood protection elevation are watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects
of buoyancy. If the floodproofing option is chosen, a floodproofing certificate
must be completed by a registered professional engineer or architect who shall
review the design and specifications and certify that the nonresidential
structure will meet this standard. State regulations do not allow basements in
nonresidential buildings in the nontidal floodplain.

§ 151.057 FILL.
   (A)   The placement of more than 600 cubic yards of fill per parcel/lot in
the floodplain is prohibited except by variance. Elevating buildings by other
methods must be considered unless 600 cubic yards or less of fill are required.
An applicant shall demonstrate that fill is the only alternative to raising the
building to at least the flood protection elevation, and that the amount of
fill used will not affect the flood storage capacity or increase flooding onto
neighboring properties. A Conditional Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill
issued by FEMA shall be required before a permit shall be issued by the county.
Following completion of the project, a Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill
shall be obtained from FEMA.
   (B)   In the event buildings on adjacent properties are known or determined
to be subject to flooding under current conditions, the local permitting
official may require submission of hydrologic and hydraulic analyses to
adequately demonstrate the effects of the proposed fill. The requirements
described in §
151.092 must be met whenever fill is used.

proposals and applications for the subdivision of land and/or new development
in any floodplain area shall include a plan drawing showing the location of all
existing and proposed public and private utilities, facilities, drainage
structures, and road access. If the 100-year flood elevation(s) have been
determined by the Flood Insurance Study or other reliable source approved by
the MDE, such flood elevation(s) shall be delineated on the proposed plan. If
the proposal involves more than 5 lots or greater than 5 acres and the 100-year
flood elevation has not been determined for the land area, the developer shall
determine the100-year flood elevation and delineate such flood elevation on the
proposed plan.
   (B)   All plans shall be certified by a registered professional engineer and
shall be reviewed by the county to assure that:
      (1)   All such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood
damage;
      (2)   All necessary permits have been received from the MDE and
appropriate federal agencies;
      (3)   All public and private utilities and facilities (including sewer,
water, telephone, electric, gas, and the like) are located, constructed and
floodproofed to minimize or eliminate flood damage;
      (4)   Adequate drainage is provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards;
      (5)   At least 1 access which, during the 100-year flood, shall provide
safe vehicular access to and egress from the subdivision and/or new

DEVELOPMENT—FLOODWAY
§ 151.070 GENERAL.
   Floodways shall be preserved to carry the discharge of the 100-year flood.
Floodways present increased risks to human life and property because of their
relatively faster and deeper flowing waters. Fill shall not be permitted. New
residential structures shall not be permitted. Other new development shall not
be permitted in the floodway except where the lowest floor of the new structure
is at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE) and the effect of the
development on flood heights is fully offset by accompanying stream
modification in accord with §
151.072 and the development is approved by the MDE through the issuance of a
waterway construction permit and when necessary, the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers. Any development in the floodway which may result in any increase in
water surface elevations or change to the floodway must be submitted to FEMA
for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision, and Letter of Map Revision shall be
obtained from FEMA following completion of the project. Hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses based on existing floodway models and performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices and certified by a registered
professional engineer must be submitted. Failure to receive this letter shall
be grounds for denial of the permit. An alternative analysis must be prepared
for any development in the floodway before a permit may be issued. The
provisions of §
151.055 through §
151.058, as well as §
151.070 through §
151.074, apply to floodways.

   (B)   Encroachment in the floodway is the minimum necessary;
   (C)   The development will withstand the 100-year flood without significant
damage; and
   (D)    The development will not increase downstream or upstream flooding or
erosion.
(Ord. —, passed 10-22-1991; Am. Ord. —, passed 8-20-2013)
§ 151.072 EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Existing structures in the floodway shall not be substantially
improved (more than 50% of market value) or replaced unless the lowest floor of
the structure is elevated at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE) and
the effect of the proposed development or improvement on flood heights is fully
offset by accompanying stream modifications. All proposals to offset the
effects of building in the floodway by construction of stream modifications,
shall be documented by an engineering study prepared by a registered
professional engineer which fully evaluates the effects of such construction
and shall be submitted to MDE. The report shall use the flood insurance study
and the flood insurance rate maps as prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency and adopted herein as the basis of the analysis. The County
shall not issue any permit for construction in the floodway until it has
received written notice from MDE that a waterway construction permit for the
proposal has been approved.
   (B)   The placement of any manufactured homes or buildings in the floodway
shall be prohibited except where the manufactured home is replacing an existing
manufactured home of equal dimensions, has a lowest floor which is 1 foot above
the elevation of the 100-year flood, and has no effect on flood heights. Such
replacement must be approved by MDE through the issuance of a waterway
construction permit.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.001 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect, maintain, and enhance the
public health, safety, and general welfare by establishing minimum requirements
and procedures to control the adverse impacts associated with increased
stormwater runoff. The goal is to manage stormwater by using environmental site
design (ESD) to the maximum extent practicable (MEP) to maintain after
development as nearly as possible, the predevelopment runoff characteristics,
and to reduce stream channel erosion, pollution, siltation and sedimentation,
and local flooding, and use appropriate structural best management practices
(BMPs) only when necessary. This will restore, enhance, and maintain the
chemical, physical, and biological integrity of streams, minimize damage to
public and private property, and reduce the impacts of land development.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter, pursuant to the Md. Code Environment
Article, Title 4, Subtitle 2, 2009 replacement volume, are adopted under the
authority of the Code of Public Local Laws for Garrett County, Maryland, the
same being Article 1 of the Public Local Laws of the State of Maryland (the
County Code) and shall apply to all development occurring within the
incorporated and unincorporated areas of Garrett County. The application of
this chapter and provisions expressed herein shall be the minimum stormwater
management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any
other powers granted by state statute. The Stormwater Management Office under
the direction of Planning and Land Development, Permits and Inspections shall
be responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter.

that the planning techniques, nonstructural practices, and design methods
specified in the Design Manual be used to implement ESD to the MEP. The use of
ESD planning techniques and treatment practices must be exhausted before any
structural BMP is implemented. Stormwater management plans for development
projects subject to this chapter shall be designed using ESD sizing criteria,
recharge volume, water quality volume, and channel protection storage volume
criteria according to the Design Manual. The MEP standard is met when channel
stability is maintained, predevelopment groundwater recharge is replicated,
nonpoint source pollution is minimized, and structural stormwater management
practices are used only if determined to be absolutely necessary.
      (2)   Control of the 2-year and 10-year frequency storm event is required
according to the Design Manual and all subsequent revisions if Garrett County
determines that additional stormwater management is necessary because
historical flooding problems exist and downstream floodplain development and
conveyance system design cannot be controlled.
      (3)   The Stormwater Management Office may require more than the minimum
control requirements specified in this chapter if hydrologic or topographic
conditions warrant or if flooding, stream channel erosion, or water quality
problems exist downstream from a proposed project.
   (B)   Alternate minimum control requirements may be adopted subject to
Administration approval. The Administration shall require a demonstration that
alternative requirements will implement ESD to the MEP and control flood
damages, accelerated stream erosion, water quality, and sedimentation.
Comprehensive watershed studies may also be required.
   (C)   Stormwater management and development plans where applicable, shall be
consistent with adopted and approved watershed management plans or flood
management plans as approved by the Maryland Department of the Environment in
accordance with the Flood Hazard Management Act of 1976.

155.025 must be recorded in the land records of Garrett County and remain
unaltered by subsequent property owners (see §
155.086). Prior approval from the Garrett County Stormwater Management Office
shall be obtained before any stormwater management practice or structural
stormwater management measure is altered.
   (D)   Alternative ESD planning techniques and treatment practices and
structural stormwater measures may be used for new development runoff control
if they meet the performance criteria established in the Design Manual and all
subsequent revisions and are approved by the Administration. Practices used for
redevelopment projects shall be approved by Stormwater Management Office.
   (E)   For the purposes of modifying the minimum control requirements or
design criteria, the owner/developer shall submit to Stormwater Management
Office an analysis of the impacts of stormwater flows downstream in the
watershed. The analysis shall include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations
necessary to determine the impact of hydrograph timing modifications due to the
proposed development upon a dam, highway, structure, or natural point of
restricted stream flow. The point of investigation is to be established with
the concurrence of Stormwater Management Office, downstream of the first
downstream tributary whose drainage area equals or exceeds the contributing
area to the project or stormwater management facility.

Subdivision Ordinance, as amended, are included by reference. In addition, for
the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BUILDING. A combination of materials having walls and a roof to form a
structure for the shelter of persons, animals or property. Decks and porches
that do not include solid walls or roofs shall not be considered part of a
building for the purposes of this chapter.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any activity, other than normal crop farming and forestry
activities, but including grading of roads for forestry, which materially
affects the existing condition or use of any land or structure. This shall
include, but not be limited to the erection of structures, the placement of
mobile homes, the improvements of roads and other paving, and the filling or
grading of land.
   GRADING. Cutting or otherwise distributing the soil mantle by mechanical
means so as to permanently change the contours of the land.
   HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCE. Any substance, including oil or its by-products, that:
      (1)   Conveys toxic, lethal, or other injurious effects or which causes
sublethal harmful alterations to plant, animal, or aquatic life;
      (2)   May be injurious to human beings;
      (3)   Persists in the environment; and
      (4)   Any matter identified as a “hazardous waste” by the Environmental
Protection Agency or a “controlled hazardous substance” by the Maryland
Department of the Environment. For the purposes of this section, excluding
propane and natural gas.
   IMPERVIOUS SURFACE COVERAGE. Land area covered with a surface that is
impervious to water.
   PRINCIPAL BUILDING. A building occupied, or intended to be occupied by, the
primary use of the lot, as opposed to the accessory or subordinate use.
   SITE PLAN. A plan showing the proposed development of a lot or parcel. A
site plan shows existing and proposed natural features, grading and contours,
structures, road rights-of-way, paved and stone areas, driveways, parking
spaces, walkways, vegetative cover, landscaping, and stormwater management.
   SLOPE. The incline of land, measured by dividing the vertical increase in
elevation by the horizontal distance. For example, a 30 feet increase in
elevation over a 100 feet length would be a 30% slope.
   SOURCE WATER PROTECTION AREA (SWPA). An area overlying an aquifer which
contributes water to a community or municipal water supply well or spring. The
source water protection areas are shown on the Sensitive Areas Map 1. Their
boundaries are based on the Maryland Department of the Environment Source Water

(Ord. —, passed 6-24-1997, eff. 7-1-1997; Am. Res. 2010-6, passed 5-25-2010)
§ 156.04 STEEP SLOPES OVER 30%.
   (A)   If slopes of over 30% are present in areas that potentially may be
affected by grading or construction of buildings, driveways, roads or vehicle
parking areas, then the applicant shall submit a site plan that designates the
maximum total portions of the lot that will be graded due to construction of a
principal building(s), driveways, roads and vehicle parking areas. Note: In
many cases, an applicant may be able to avoid the requirements of this section
by restricting construction to the less steep portions of a lot.
   (B)   Based upon the site plan, a new principal building and/or vehicle
parking areas shall only be permitted to be constructed on areas with a natural
slope over 30% if all of the following requirements are met:
      (1)   The lot shall include a minimum lot area of 4 acres, except as
provided by division (C) of this section;
      (2)   A maximum total of 2% of the lot area that exceeds 30% slope shall
be covered by all buildings, paving and stone surfaces;
      (3)   The applicant shall establish to the satisfaction of the staff of
the Garrett County Department of Planning and Land Development that there is no
reasonable alternative to construction of buildings and/or parking areas upon
the over 30% slopes that would still provide for a reasonable use of the lot;
      (4)   A grading plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional in a
manner that holds grading of slopes over 25% to a reasonable minimum.
      (5)   No additional fill material shall be placed on steep slope areas.
   (C)   Grandfathering. This §
156.04 shall not apply to any lot of record less than 4 acres in gross area
that existed prior to July 1, 1997, has not been further subdivided since that
date, and meets all other requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   If the footprint of a new principal building(s) in addition to the
area covered by driveways, roads and vehicle parking areas would affect a total
of less than 200 square feet with a natural slope over 30%, then the
requirements of this section shall not apply to the lot.
   (E)   Developers are encouraged, but not required, to direct development
away from areas with natural slopes of 25 to 30%. The Cluster Housing options
in County Subdivision Ordinance, Article 3 and the Deep Creek Lake Watershed
Zoning Ordinance, Article 5 provide attractive incentives (including reduced
lot sizes) that can help accomplish this objective.
   (F)   The slope provisions of this chapter shall apply to slopes that
existed as of July 1, 1997. An applicant shall not regrade land prior to
submitting an application in order to circumvent this chapter.
   (G)   Man-made slopes.
      (1)   Structures shall not be constructed or placed on slopes exceeding
30% grade that result from development activity.
      (2)   Steep slopes that resulted front development activity may be re-
graded or altered in connection with redevelopment of a site in accordance with
an approved site plan.

§ 156.05 STREAM BUFFERS.
   (A)   Growth areas. The Generalized Sensitive Areas Map 1 shows the
locations of “streams” and “growth areas,” which are based upon the Garrett
County Comprehensive Plan. Within the areas shown as growth areas, the minimum
stream buffer shall include areas within 25 feet of each side of the top of the
primary bank of a stream, as determined by the Department of Planning and Land
Development. Within areas that are not shown as growth areas, the minimum
stream buffer shall include areas within 50 feet of each side of the top of the
primary bank of a stream.
   (B)   New buildings. A new building shall not be placed within a required
stream buffer.
   (C)   Building expansion. A building that existed prior to July 1, 1997 may
be expanded into a required stream buffer, provided that the intrusion shall be
limited to a cumulative maximum total of 1,000 square feet of land area.
   (D)   Paving and stone. No new or expanded paving or stone surface shall be
placed within the required stream buffer, except for any of the following:
      (1)   Sidewalks or trails that will not serve motor vehicles;
      (2)   Necessary road and driveway crossings that are approximately
perpendicular to the stream;
      (3)   Temporary waterway crossings related to construction, provided the
crossings are approved by applicable state agencies;
      (4)   The Planning Commission may approve an exception to the 50 feet
wide stream buffer (in areas not designated as a growth area) if:
         (a)   The area involved is a relatively small area of land;
         (b)   The applicant or his or her representative demonstrate to the
Planning Commission that the project would be more environmentally sound than
would otherwise occur, or is necessary to allow a road design to meet
established minimum standards; and,
         (c)   An effective vegetative buffer, including grasses, shrubs and
tree canopy, exists within the reduced buffer area or will be provided in
accordance with a detailed planting plan shown on the approved site plan.
   (E)   Grading. If grading is proposed within a required stream buffer, then
a grading plan shall be prepared by a qualified professional in a manner that
holds grading of slopes within such areas to a reasonable minimum.
   (F)   Recommendations.
      (1)   Property-owners are strongly encouraged, but not required, to
maintain the Stream Buffers in natural vegetation and to plant new trees in
areas without significant existing vegetation. At best, the buffer should
include both natural ground vegetation and deciduous trees that will provide a
canopy over the waterway.
      (2)   Subdividers are strongly encouraged to establish deed restrictions
to limit tree cutting within this buffer.
      (3)   The county shall provide educational material to applicants for
approval of subdivision plans, grading permits and building permits, including:
         (a)   Information on creation and protection of vegetative buffers;
and
         (b)   Sources of information, support and assistance for installation
and maintenance of stream buffers.

application to the County Department of Planning and Land Development, together
with any required fees. The application shall state the specific sections

grant a modification or waiver to specific provisions of this chapter if the
applicant establishes to the satisfaction of the Planning Commission that the
modification or waiver:

      (2)   Is necessary to:
         (a)   Avoid an undue hardship that was not self-created and that
results from the peculiar and uncommon conditions of the property;
         (b)   Avoid a clearly unreasonable requirement that would not serve
any valid public purpose; and/or
         (c)   Allow a site layout and/or improvements that would clearly be
more in the public interest than what would occur if the modification would not
be granted.

appeal pursuant to the Maryland Rules of Procedure.

divides a lot or property which has been consolidated into single ownership,
subsequent to the effective date of this chapter, the uses permitted thereof
and the other district requirements applying to the least restrictive portion
of such lot may extend over the entire lot or for a distance of 50 feet from
the district boundary line into the more restrictive portion of the lot,
whichever distance is less, provided the owner of such property secures a
special exception permit from the Board of Appeals pursuant to §

§ 157.023 PURPOSES OF ZONING DISTRICTS.
   To assist in interpreting the provisions of this chapter, the following
summarizes the purposes for the various zoning districts:
   (A)   Agricultural Resource - To protect rural character and conserve
natural resources, primarily agricultural land, and also including forests and
sensitive environmental areas by limiting residential development to a low
density and providing a cluster subdivision option. To retain the value of land
by allowing subdivision with a minimum lot size of 3 acres, or 1 acre under
specified conditions. To allow selected commercial and recreational uses that
do not conflict with the preservation of agricultural resources
   (B)   Rural Resource - To protect rural character and conserve natural
resources, primarily forest and timber resources, and also including
agricultural land and sensitive environmental areas by limiting residential
development to a low density and providing a cluster subdivision option. To
retain the value of land by allowing subdivision with a minimum lot size of 3
acres, or 1 acre under specified conditions. To allow selected commercial and
recreational uses that do not conflict with the preservation of forest and
timber resources.
   (C)   Lake Residential 1 District - By limiting residential development to a
relatively low average density, this district is intended to help reduce
pressures for overdevelopment and overcrowding which would threaten the public
health, safety and welfare by undermining property values, jeopardizing
investments, threatening the tax base, causing pollution, creating health and
safety hazards and endangering the balance of ecological systems within the
lake’s drainage basin. The Lake Residential District 1 is intended for areas
that fall within existing or future public sewer service boundaries, allowing
for residential development at 1 dwelling unit per acre. Besides low-density
residential use and continued farming and forestry, this district also is
intended to help reduce possible pressure for overuse of the lake surface by
accommodating certain types of land-based family-oriented recreation
facilities. Most non-residential uses are treated as special exceptions to
ensure adequate safeguards for preventing nuisances to adjoining properties.
   (D)   The Lake Residential 2 District is intended to limit residential
development to 1 dwelling per 2 acres within areas not planned for public water
or public sewer service, thereby reducing pressure for overdevelopment that
would undermine property values, cause pollution and endanger the balance of
ecological systems within the lake's drainage basin. This district is intended
to allow continued farming and forestry and to accommodate recreational uses in
the same manner as in the Lake Residential 1 District.
   (E)   Town Residential District - To provide for higher-density, more
compact village or small-town settlements where central water and sewage
service exist. To provide for single family homes, side-by-side twins,
townhouses and apartments at an average density of approximately 4 to 5 units
per acre. To provide for a few selected types of small commercial uses, while
making sure these areas remain basically residential in nature.
   (F)   Town Center District - To recognize the core areas of existing towns.
To provide for higher-density, more compact village or small-town settlements
where central water and sewage service exist. To provide for single family
homes, side-by-side twins, townhouses and apartments at an average density of
approximately 5 to 6 units per acre. To also provide for retail stores,
restaurants, offices and similar light commercial uses, while avoiding heavy
commercial and industrial uses.
   (G)   General Commercial District - To mainly provide for larger and/or
heavier commercial uses that are not compatible with residential areas and town
center locations. To also provide for certain types of compatible light
industrial development.
   (H)   Commercial Resort 1 and 2 - To provide for commercial recreation uses
and supporting commercial activities. To promote resort-type light commercial
uses and family recreation, while avoiding heavy highway commercial
development. The Commercial Resort 1 district provides opportunities for
visitor-oriented commercial development, but not major residential development.
The Commercial Resort 2 district emphasizes land-based family-oriented
development, while allowing for residential development at an average density
of 1 unit per acre.

ARTICLE 4. OVERLAY DISTRICTS
§ 157.036 DEEP CREEK LAKE SCENIC PROTECTION OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Purpose. The ridges and crests surrounding Deep Creek Lake create a
series of scenic views from the lake and shoreline. The Scenic Protection
District is an overlay district intended to preserve views of these features
and thereby protect the natural beauty of the area.
   (B)   Designations and applicability.
      (1)   The Scenic Protection District is an overlay district. Its
requirements supplement the requirements of the underlying zoning district and
apply to all land delineated as a scenic protection area on the zoning map.
      (2)   This overlay district applies to areas in which all or part of a
structure constructed thereon could be silhouetted along the skyline when
viewed from Deep Creek Lake or its shoreline. The intent is to minimize the
placement and visual impact of structures that would be silhouetted against the
sky.
      (3)   Development that is not visible from any point along the shoreline
or surface of Deep Creek Lake shall be exempt from the requirements of this
overlay district. The burden shall be upon the applicant for development to
demonstrate that the proposed development will not be visible from these
points. An applicant may submit a viewshed analysis to demonstrate the lack of
visibility of the project. Based upon the analysis, the Zoning Administrator
shall determine whether the proposed development is exempt.
      (4)   The provisions of this District apply to the issuance of zoning
permits for construction or replacement of a principal structure. These
provisions shall not be applicable to accessory structures or additions to
existing structures.
   (C)   Tree retention and planting.
      (1)   Purpose. Trees must be retained or planted around new principal
structures as required below to retain the lake's forested crests and ensure
that new principal structures on the crests or ridges blend into the natural
landscape. To allow views of the lake from homes, trees are not required
between a structure and the lake.
      (2)   Vegetation plan required. A vegetation plan shall be included with
all applications for a zoning permit or subdivision plat approval. The
vegetation plan shall show:
         (a)   Location, size and species of existing trees to be retained;
         (b)   Location, size and species of existing trees to be removed;
         (c)   Proposed trees to be planted, including their species, size at
time of planting, and expected size at maturity; and
         (d)   Proposed grading.
      (3)   Tree retention.
         (a)   To the greatest extent possible, existing forests and trees
shall be retained on the crests and ridges surrounding Deep Creek Lake.
         (b)   Priority shall be given to retaining and protecting trees that
are 6 inches or more in diameter.
      (4)   Minimum tree standards. The following requirements apply to
construction or replacement of a principal structure.
         (a)   For purposes of this section, a large canopy tree is a deciduous
tree with the following characteristics:
 
                  Expected height at maturity Expected crown diameter or limb
                                              spread at maturity
Large canopy tree More than 40 feet           More than 35 feet
 
         (b)   If mature forests will be retained around a proposed dwelling in
a manner that will meet the intent of this division (C), a specific number of
trees is not required.
         (c)   Trees shall be retained or planted to the sides and rear of
proposed structures, as viewed from the lake. At least 1 deciduous, large
canopy tree shall be planted per 15 linear feet of building facade, based upon
the sum of all building facades that do not face the lake.
         (d)   This section establishes a minimum number of required trees, but
shall not be construed to require trees in a specific arrangement or location.
The placement of trees shall be designed to meet the intent of this subsection.
The specific location of trees will vary based upon the features of the
particular lot.
      (5)   Maintenance of landscaping. Where tree planting or retention is
required by this section, a tree protection easement shall be required for
approval of a building permit for a principal structure. The easement shall:
         (a)   Require protection of trees and vegetation and require planting
of new trees to replace trees that are cut or die;
         (b)   Be granted to and enforceable by the county;
         (c)   Run with and bind the land, the grantor, and the grantor's
successors; and
         (d)   Be recorded in the Land Records before issuance of a building
permit.
      (6)   Tree size. Trees planted to meet the requirements of this section
shall be at least 8 feet tall at time of planting.
      (7)   The following guidelines shall be used in meeting the intent of
this section:
         (a)   Reasonable efforts should be taken during construction to
maximize the protection of trees. Care is needed not only to minimize the
cutting of trees, but also to avoid accidental damage that will cause trees to
eventually die. Measures should be used to make sure that equipment does not
damage tree trunks, that roots are not compacted by vehicles and that the grade
level around trees is not changed by more than 6 inches. Temporary wooden
barricades or wire fencing shall be placed below the “dripline” of trees (the
area located directly under the outer circumference of the tree branches) to
protect the root system from being compacted by vehicles or material storage.
         (b)   Plant native trees suitable for the Deep Creek Lake Area. The
publication, Maryland Native Plants: Plant Lists for Maryland Regions -
Mountain Region, by the National Park Service, should be used in tree
selection. This publication is available from the Zoning Administrator.

§ 157.067 PLANNED RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT (PRD).
   (A)   Purpose. The purposes of these PRD provisions are:
      (1)   To encourage innovations in residential development and renewal so
that demand for housing may be met by greater variety and maximum choice in the
type, design and layout of dwellings and by the conservation and more efficient
use of open space ancillary to said dwellings;
      (2)   To provide, through such innovations, greater opportunities for
better housing and recreation for present and potential residents of the
county;
      (3)   To encourage a more efficient use of land and services and to
reflect changes in the technology of land development so that the economies
secured may enure to the benefit of those who need homes;
      (4)   To permit greater flexibility in the design of developments to
conserve natural resources such as streams, lakes, floodplains, wetlands,
wooded areas, steeply sloped areas, areas of unusual beauty and significant
natural habitats;
      (5)   To make sure that the provisions of this chapter which are
concerned with the uniform treatment of dwelling type, bulk, density and open
space within each zoning district may be applied flexibly, in a manner which
would not distort the objectives of this chapter, when dealing with the
improvement of land by other than lot-by-lot development; and
      (6)   To establish a procedure which can relate the type, design and
layout of residential development to the particular site and the demand for
housing at the time of development, in a manner consistent with the
preservation of the property values within existing residential areas, and to
assure that the increased flexibility of regulations over land development
established hereby is carried out following sound, expeditious and fair
standards and procedures.
   (B)   Eligibility. A proposed development shall be eligible to use the
provisions of this section only if all of the following requirements are met:

Districts.
      (2)   The proposed PRD shall consist of 1 or more contiguous parcels of
land under ownership, purchase agreement, option to purchase, leasehold
agreement or other similar legal agreement by a single legal entity to own and/
or develop the land. One or more phases of a PRD may be transferred to and be
developed by a separate legal entity provided that the originating legal entity
first secures preliminary approval of the specific phase or phases to be
developed. A subsequent legal entity may file an application for final approval
provided that the final plan shall conform substantially to the preliminary
approved plan.
      (3)   Minimum acreage. The proposed PRD shall contain a minimum number of
contiguous acres in accordance with the following schedule:
         (a)   In the LR2 - Lake Residential 2 District: 30 acres.

possible.
      (2)   Where extensive natural tree cover and vegetation does not exist
and cannot be preserved on the PRD site, landscaping shall be provided to
enhance the appearance of the PRD, aid in erosion control, provide protection
from wind and sun, screen roads and parking areas, and enhance the privacy of
dwelling units.
      (3)   Street trees shall be provided along all arterial and collector
roads, unless the Planning Commission determines that existing trees to be
preserved will serve the same purpose. A minimum of 2 trees with a minimum
trunk width of 3-inches measured 1 foot above the ground shall be provided for
each 50 feet of road perimeter. Such trees shall be planted at a distance from
the road that is sufficient to avoid future conflicts with the road.
   (L)   PRD ownership, maintenance and preservation of common open spare.
      (1)   The developer shall make provisions which make sure that the common
open space land continues as such and be properly maintained. The developer
shall provide for and establish an organization for the ownership, maintenance
and preservation of open space which shall conform to the following standards
and procedures:
         (a)   The organization shall be established by the developer before
sale or rental of dwelling units in the PRO.
         (b)   The form, financial capability, rules of membership and methods
of cost assessment of the organization shall be devised to insure the
successful fulfillment of the maintenance, preservation and improvement
responsibilities of the organization.
         (c)   The organization responsible for maintenance, preservation and
improvement of common open space areas shall be the sole owner of the common
open space lands.
         (d)   The organization shall have or hire adequate staff to administer
common facilities and maintain the common open space.
         (e)   In the event that the organization established to own and
maintain a common open space or any successor organization, shall at any time
after establishment of the PRD fail to maintain the common open space in
reasonable order and condition in accordance with the development plan, the
County may serve written notice upon the organization, or upon the residents
and owners of the PRD setting forth the manner in which the organization has
failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable condition and the notice
shall include a demand that the deficiencies of maintenance be corrected within
30 days thereof, and shall state the date and place or a hearing thereon which
shall be held within 14 days of the notice. At such hearing the county may
modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give an
extension of time within which they shall be corrected.
            1.   If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modifications thereof shall not be corrected within 30 days or any extension
thereof, the county, to preserve the taxable values of the properties within
the PRD and to prevent the common open space from becoming a public nuisance,
may enter upon the common open space and maintain the same for a period of 1
year. The entry and maintenance shall not constitute a taking of the common
open space, nor vest in the public any rights to use the same.
            2.   Before the expiration of the year, the county, upon its
initiative or upon the request of the organization theretofore responsible for
the maintenance of the common open space shall call a public hearing upon
notice of such organization, or to the residents and owners of the PRD, to be
held by the county, at which hearing such organization or the residents and
owners of the PRD shall show cause why such maintenance by the county shall
not, at the option of the county, continue for a succeeding year.
            3.   Common open space in a reasonable condition, the county may,
in its discretion, continue to maintain the common open space during the next
succeeding year and subject to a similar hearing and determination in each year
thereafter. The decision of the county in any such case shall constitute a
final administrative decision subject to judicial review.
         (f)   The cost of such maintenance by the county shall be assessed
ratably against the properties within the PRD that have a right of enjoyment of
the common open space and shall become a lien on the properties. The county at
the time of entering upon the common open space for the purpose of maintenance,
shall file a notice of lien in the office of the Treasurer of the county, upon
the properties affected by the lien within the PRD.

Notes:
**—For the purposes of this §
157.073, lot width shall be calculated based upon the average of the following: a) the length of the rear lot line, and b) the width of the lot at the front of the proposed
principal building. This front line used for calculating required lot width shall be shown on the record plat and shall be the required front building setback line for the
lot. In addition, for lots that are adjacent to publicly accessible recreation land that abuts Deep Creek Lake, each lot that is adjacent to a common property line (as
provided in §
157.170) shall have an absolute minimum lot width of 100 feet as measured along such “common property line.”
***—Shall be calculated based upon the “Total Area of the Tract” (see definition above).
****—Except where the steep slope regulations of the Sensitive Areas Ordinance apply.
*****—Non-cluster provisions are only summarized in the above table for general information purposes. For non-cluster development, see the actual provisions in §
157.041.
 
   (D)   Other requirements. A Cluster Development shall comply with all of the
same requirements that apply to any other subdivision of single family detached
dwellings, except for provisions that are specifically permitted to be adjusted
by this Section. All other requirements of this chapter and the County
Subdivision Ordinance shall still apply to a Cluster Development.
   (E)   Open Space. Division (C) above states the minimum percentage of the
tract area within a Cluster Development that shall be permanently preserved as
public, semi-public or private open space. Such preserved open space shall meet
all of the requirements of §
159.030 of the Subdivision Ordinance.
   (F)   Steep slopes. A lot required to have a larger minimum lot area under §
157.071 because of steep slopes shall not be permitted to be reduced in lot
area under this section. However, through the use of the smaller minimum lot
areas in this section, the lot layout may be able to be revised to move
proposed building sites away from steeply sloped portions of a tract so that
the requirements of §
157.071 no longer apply.
   (G)   Access. A Cluster Development shall have an interior road system that
minimizes or avoids the need for individual driveways entering directly onto
arterial or major collector roads.
   (H)   Yield plan.
      (1)   Purpose. To make sure that the Cluster Development does not result
in an excessive increase in density from the maximum that would otherwise be
permitted.
      (2)   A Yield Plan shall be submitted as part of an application for a
Cluster Development. The Yield Plan shall be a sketch plan drawn to scale that
shows the number and location of lots that could reasonably be expected to be
permitted under the conventional zoning regulations of the applicable district.
Such Yield Plan shall consider the impacts of regulations regarding steep
slopes, floodplains, wetlands and similar matters. The Yield Plan shall
consider the same areas of land as the proposed Cluster Development.
      (3)   A Cluster Development shall not be permitted to include a greater
total number of dwelling units than is determined to have been possible based
upon the Yield Plan, unless a density bonus is specifically permitted in
division (C) above. The Yield Plan shall be subject to acceptance by the
Planning Commission.

   (A)   The following requirements apply to all accessory solar energy
generating systems:
      (1)   Ground-mounted solar collection devices accessory to a permitted
use shall be subject to the same setbacks as the primary use found in §
157.041.
      (2)   The total height of ground-mounted solar energy collectors,
including any mounts and framework, shall not exceed ten feet above the ground
when orientated at maximum tilt.
      (3)   A roof-mounted solar energy system shall not project vertically
above the peak of the sloped roof to which it is attached, or project
vertically more than five feet above a flat roof.
      (4)   A parapet shall be provided to screen roof-mounted solar energy
systems located on flat roofs of permitted nonresidential uses.
      (5)   No accessory solar energy system shall produce glare that would
constitute a nuisance to occupants of neighboring parcels or persons traveling
neighboring roads.
      (6)   Screening from adjoining properties and adjacent roads may be
required around the perimeter of non-residential ground mounted solar energy
systems. The Board of Appeals may require a detailed landscaping plan that
includes any existing vegetation and the type, location and spacing of any
plantings.
   (B)   The following requirements apply to all community solar energy
generating systems:
      (1)   Community ground-mounted solar collection systems shall be setback
a minimum of 100 feet from any property line.
      (2)   The total height of ground-mounted solar energy collectors,
including any mounts or framework, shall not exceed 20 feet above the ground
when oriented at maximum tilt.
      (3)   No solar energy system shall produce glare that would constitute a
nuisance to occupants of neighboring parcels or persons traveling neighboring
roads. A viewshed analysis is required and shall be considered by the Board of
Zoning Appeals for approval of a special exception.
      (4)   The solar energy system shall be screened from adjoining properties
and adjacent public roads. A detailed landscaping plan that includes any
existing vegetation and the type, location and spacing of any plantings shall

   (C)   The following decommissioning standards apply to all community solar
energy generating systems:
      (1)   DECOMMISSIONING means the removal and legal disposal of a community
solar energy generating system and any other components related to the system.
      (2)   RESTORATION OF PAD SITE means, at the location of the community
solar energy generating system, stabilizing, grading, and seeding disturbed
areas to grow ground cover; and replacing the excavated foundation areas with
topsoil that is free of noxious weeds, rocks, root mat, or foreign objects
larger than two inches in size; and has proper soil nutrients to provide and
sustain the growth of ground cover.
      (3)   Before a use permit is issued for a community solar energy
generating system, the Garrett County Department of Planning and Community
Development shall:
         (a)   At the applicant's expense, retain an independent and certified
professional engineer to prepare a net cost estimate for decommissioning and
restoration of the site;
         (b)   Require the applicant to post a form of financial surety
acceptable to the county (e.g. bond, letter of credit, cash, etc.) equal to
100% of the cost estimate determined above and adjusted by an estimated
construction pricing index to ensure that cost increases during the following
five-year interval will not decrease the value of the financial surety.
      (4)   Financial surety posted in accordance with this subsection shall be
held by the Garrett County Finance Department to be used as surety in the event
of noncompliance with a requirement under this section by an owner of a
community solar energy generating system.
      (5)   On completion of the construction of a community solar energy
generating system, and every ten years thereafter, the Garrett County
Department of Planning and Community Development, at the applicant's expense,
shall retain an independent certified professional engineer to prepare a net
cost estimate for decommissioning and restoration of the site. The Garrett
County Department of Planning and Community Development may alter the amount of
the financial surety determined under this subsection to provide adequate
security for the costs of decommissioning and restoration of the site.
      (6)   If a community solar energy generating system is sold, the
financial surety posted in accordance with this division (C) shall be released
if the new owner posts financial surety with the Garrett County Finance
Department that is equal to the amount of the financial surety posted by the
seller; or is a greater amount if the Garrett County Department of Planning and
Community Development determines that additional security is necessary to
provide for the cost of decommissioning and restoration of the site.
      (7)   If a community solar energy generating system has not generated
electricity for a continuous period of 365 days or an owner has abandoned a
community solar energy generating system, the Garrett County Department of
Planning and Community Development may require the owner to decommission and
restore the site. If the owner fails to comply with these requirements, the
financial surety shall be used by Garrett County to cover the costs of
decommissioning and restoration of the site.

§ 157.091 REGULATIONS FOR OFF-ROAD PARKING.
   (A)   Existing parking. Structures and uses in existence at the effective
date of this chapter shall not be subject to the requirements of this
subchapter so long as the kind or extent of use is not changed, provided that
any parking facility now serving such structures or uses shall not in the
future be reduced to an amount less than that required by this chapter.
   (B)   Changes in use. Whenever a building or use is changed or enlarged in
floor area, number of employees, number of dwellings, seating capacity or
otherwise to create a need, based upon the requirements of §
157.090, for an increase of 10% or more in the number of existing parking
spaces, the number of additional spaces to be provided shall be based upon the
incremental change or enlargement.
   (C)   Conflict with other uses. No parking area shall be used for any other
use that interferes with its availability for the parking need it is required
to serve.
   (D)   Continuing character of obligation. All required parking facilities
shall be provided and maintained so long as the use which the facilities were
designed to serve still exists. Off-road parking facilities shall not be
reduced in total extent except when such reduction is in conformity with the
requirements of this subchapter in conjunction with a change in the nature of
the use.
   (E)   Joint use.
      (1)   Two or more uses may provide for required parking in a common
parking lot; the total number of spaces in such lot shall not be less than the
sum of the spaces required for each use individually, unless such lot is
provided as specified in division (E)(2) below.
      (2)   Up to 50% of the parking spaces required for a) theaters,
auditoriums, bowling alleys or private clubs, and up to 100% of the parking
spaces required for churches or meeting halls, may be provided collectively and
used jointly by b) banks, offices, retail stores, repair shops, service
establishments and similar uses not normally open, used or operated during the
same hours as those listed in a) provided, however, that a written agreement
assuring the continued availability of such parking areas shall be properly
drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to legal sufficiency
by the County Attorney, and filed with the application for the zoning permit.
   (F)   Mixed uses. Where a permitted use contains or includes more than 1 of
the types of uses identified in §
157.090, the number of parking spaces required shall be the sum of the computed
requirements for the separate types of uses.
   (G)   Location of parking spaces. Required off-road parking spaces shall be
on the same lot or premises with the principal use served, or where this
requirement cannot be met, within 400 feet walking distance of the principal
use.
   (H)   Fractional spaces. Where the computation of required parking spaces
results in a fractional number, only the fraction of ½ or more shall be counted
as 1.

would result in the shortest reasonable accessible distance to a handicapped
accessible building entrance. Curb cuts shall be provided as needed to provide
access from the handicapped spaces.
      (3)   Minimum size. Each required handicapped parking space shall be 8 by
18 feet. In addition, each space shall be adjacent to a 5 feet wide access
aisle. Such access aisle may be shared by 2 handicapped spaces by being placed

§ 157.093 OFF-ROAD LOADING AREA.
   (A)   All permitted uses requiring truck loading and unloading space for

length by 12 feet in width by 14 feet in height.
   (C)   Number. The applicant shall provide evidence acceptable to the Zoning
Administrator that the number of off-road loading spaces will be sufficient.
   (D)   Each required off-road truck-loading berth shall have unobstructed
access to a public road. Such access may be combined with access to an off-road
parking lot; provided, however, that all berths shall be designed so that
maneuvering of trucks to reach the loading dock shall not require the use of
any required off-road parking spaces or intrude into any road right-of-way. No
off-road loading berth shall be located in any required front yard.
   (E)   All permitted or required loading berths shall be on the same lot as
the use to which they are accessory, except that berths may be provided in
spaces designed to serve jointly 2 or more adjacent establishments provided
that the number of berths in such joint facilities shall not be less than the
total required separately for all such establishments.

§ 157.165 POWERS AND DUTIES; VARIANCES.
   (A)   Upon appeal from a decision by the Zoning Administrator, the Board
shall have the power to vary or adapt the strict application of any of the
requirements of this chapter in the case of exceptionally irregular, narrow,
shallow or steep lots, or other exceptional physical conditions whereby such
strict applications would result in practical difficulty and unnecessary
hardship depriving the owner of the reasonable use of land or building
involved, but in no other case.
   (B)   In general, the power to authorize a variance from the terms of this
chapter shall be sparingly exercised and only under peculiar and exceptional
circumstances.
   (C)   No variance in the strict application of the provisions of this
chapter shall be granted by the Board unless the Board finds that the following
requirements and standards are satisfied. The appellant must show that the
variance will not be contrary to the public interest and that practical
difficulty and an unnecessary hardship will result if it is not granted. In
particular, the appellant shall establish and substantiate his appeal to show
that the appeal for the variance is in conformance with the requirements and
standards listed below:
      (1)   That the granting of the variance shall be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this chapter, shall not be injurious to or alter
the character of the neighborhood, will not impair adequate light and air to
the adjacent property and will not impair views from the adjacent property, or
otherwise be detrimental to the public welfare.
      (2)   That the granting of the variance will not permit the establishment
within a district of any use that is not permitted in that district.
      (3)   That special circumstances or conditions, fully described in the
findings, apply to the land or buildings for which the variance is sought,
which circumstances or conditions are such that strict application of the
provisions of this chapter would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of
such land or building or create unnecessary hardship. If the hardship is
general, that is, shared generally by the land or buildings in the
neighborhood, relief shall be properly obtained only by legislative action or
by court review of an attack on the validity of this chapter.
      (4)   That the granting of the variance is necessary for the reasonable
use of the land or building and that the variance as granted by the Board is
the minimum variance that will accomplish this purpose.
It shall not be considered sufficient proof of hardship to show that greater
profit would result if the variance were awarded. Furthermore, hardship
complained of cannot be self-created; it cannot be claimed by one who purchases
with or without the knowledge of restrictions; it must result from the
application of the chapter; it must be suffered directly by the property in
question; and evidence of variance granted under similar circumstances shall
not be considered.
      (5)   In the case of applications for variances involving lots that
qualify under the provisions of §
157.042 (Exceptions to Minimum Lot Sizes), the Board shall give specific
consideration to whether the variance would establish a structure that is
proportional in size, height, bulk and character to structures within the
general neighborhood.
   (D)   The Board may prescribe any safeguard that it deems necessary to
secure substantially the objectives of the regulation or provision to which the

§ 157.191 CONDITIONS FOR A ZONING AMENDMENT.
   (A)   Conditions established by Board of Commissioners.
      (1)   Under the authority of Md. Code § 4.01(b), the County Board of
Commissioners may, upon the rezoning of any land(s):
         (a)   Impose such additional restrictions, conditions, or limitations
as may be deemed appropriate to preserve, improve or protect the general
character and design of the land or improvements being rezoned, or of the
surroundings or adjacent lands and improvements; and
         (b)   Retain or reserve the authority to approve or disapprove the
design of buildings, construction, landscaping or other improvements,
alterations, and changes made or to be made on the subject land(s) to assure
conformity with the purposes of Md. Code Article 66B and this chapter.
      (2)   Restrictions, conditions or limitations imposed under the above
division (A)(1) above shall be enforceable in the same manner as any other
provisions of this chapter.

advance notice provided to the applicant. The legal advertisement shall state
that the Board of Commissioners may consider restrictions, conditions or
limitations connected to the zoning amendment.
      (4)    If conditions are established under this division (A), then a
requested zoning map change shall not become finally effective until all such
conditions are carried out in full. In the event all such conditions are not
carried out in full, then the map change shall become null and void, and the
property shall revert to its former classification.
   (B)   State law. As of 1996, Md. Code § 4.05 of Article 66B generally
provided the following: “Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment

grant the amendment based upon a finding that there was a substantial change in
the character of the neighborhood where the property is located or that there
was a mistake in the existing zoning classification.”

chapter is declared to be a misdemeanor.
   (B)   For any and every violation of the provisions of this chapter, the
owner, agent, architect, builder, contractor, tenant, lessee or any other
person who commits, takes part or assists in any such violation or who
maintains or uses any building or premises in which any such violation shall
exist, shall be, on conviction thereof, guilty of a misdemeanor and liable to a
fine or penalty not to exceed $100.
   (C)   Corrections.
      (1)   Whenever any such person specified in division (B) above, shall
have been notified in writing by the Zoning Administrator that he or she is
violating this chapter, such person shall commence correction of all violations
within 5 days of receipt of such notice and correct all violations within 30
days thereafter.
      (2)   If corrections are not commenced within 5 days and are not either
completed within 30 days or being pursued in good faith to completion each and
every day during which such illegal location, erection, construction,
reconstruction, enlargement, change, maintenance, use or other violation
continues shall be deemed a separate offense punishable by the like fine.
   (D)   Injunction.
      (1)   In case any building or structure is erected, constructed,
reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or maintained, or any building,
structure, sign of and is used in violation of this chapter, the appropriate
authorities of Garrett County, in addition to other remedies, may institute
injunction, mandamus or other appropriate action or proceeding to prevent such
unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, repair conversion,
maintenance or use to:
         (a)   Restrain, correct or abate such violation;
         (b)   Prevent the occupancy of such structure or land; and/or
         (c)   Prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in or about
such premises.
      (2)   The rights and remedies provided in this chapter are cumulative and
are in addition to all other remedies provided by law.
   (E)   Civil violations. Pursuant to Md. Code § 7.01 of Article 66B,
violations of this chapter may be considered to be civil zoning violations.
      (1)   The zoning official may deliver a citation to a person believed to
be committing a civil zoning violation. A copy of the citation shall be
retained by the zoning official and shall bear a certification attesting to the
truth of the matters set forth. The citation shall contain:
         (a)   The name and address of the person charged;
         (b)   The nature of the violation;
         (c)   The place where and time that the violation occurred;
         (d)   The amount of the fine assessed;
         (e)   The manner, location and time in which the fine may be paid; and
         (f)   The person’s right to elect to stand trial for the violation.

      (3)   A person who received a citation may elect to stand trial for the
offense by filing with the zoning official a notice of intention to stand
trial. The notice shall be given at least 5 days before the date of payment as
set forth in the citation. On receipt of the notice of intention to stand
trial, the Zoning Administrator shall forward to the District Court having
venue, a copy of the citation and the notice of intention to stand trial. On
receipt of the citation, the District Court shall schedule the case for the
trial and notify the defendant of the trial date. All fines, penalties or

the fine by the date of payment set forth on the citation and fails to file a
notice of intention to stand trial, a formal notice of the violation shall be
sent to the owner’s last known address. If the citation is not satisfied within
15 days from the date of the notice, the person is liable for an additional
fine not to exceed twice the original fine. If, after 35 days the citation is
not satisfied, the zoning official may request adjudication of the case through
the District Court. The District Court shall schedule the case for trial and
summon the defendant to appear.
      (5)   Adjudication of a violation under this division is not a criminal
conviction, nor does it impose any of the civil disabilities ordinarily imposed
by a criminal conviction.
      (6)   In a proceeding before the District Court, the violation shall be
prosecuted in the same manner and to the same extent as set forth for municipal
infractions herein. The Garrett County Commissioners may authorize the County
Attorney to prosecute a civil zoning violation.
      (7)   If a person is found by the District Court to have committed a
civil zoning violation, he or she shall be liable for the costs of the
proceedings in the District Court.

§ 158.03 AIRPORT ZONES.
   In order to carry out the provisions of this chapter, there are hereby
created and established certain zones which include all of the land lying
beneath the approach surfaces, transitional surfaces, horizontal surfaces, and
conical surfaces as they apply to the Garrett County Airport. The zones are
shown on the Garrett County Airport Zoning Map consisting of 1 sheet, prepared
by United Research Systems, and dated April 2003, which is attached to this
chapter and made a part hereof. An area located in more than 1 of the following
zones is considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height
limitation. The various zones are hereby established and defined as follows:
   (A)   Runway larger than utility visual approach zone. The inner edge of
this approach zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500
feet wide. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 1,500 feet
at a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline
is the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   (B)   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than 3/
4 mile non-precision instrument approach zone. The inner edge of this approach
zone coincides with the width of the primary surface and is 500 feet wide. The
approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of 3,500 feet at a
horizontal distance of 10,000 feet from the primary surface. Its centerline is
the continuation of the centerline of the runway.
   (C)   Heliport approach zone. The inner edge of this approach zone coincides
with the width of the primary surface and is based on present and future
heliport operations. The approach zone expands outward uniformly to a width of
500 feet at a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet from the primary surface.
   (D)   Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas beneath the
transitional surfaces.
   (E)   Heliport transitional zones. These zones extend outward from the sides
of the primary surface and the heliport approach zones a horizontal distance of
250 feet from the primary surface centerline and the heliport approach zone
centerline.
   (F)   Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is established by swinging arcs
of 10,000 feet radii from the center of each end of the primary surface of each
runway and connecting the adjacent arcs by drawing lines tangent to those arcs.
The horizontal zone does not include the approach and transitional zones.
   (G)   Conical zone. The conical zone is established as the area that
commences at the periphery of the horizontal zone and extends outward there
from a horizontal distance of 4,000 feet.
(Ord. —, passed 1-31-2006)
§ 158.04 AIRPORT ZONE HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, no structure shall be erected,
altered, or maintained, and no tree shall be allowed to grow in any zone
created by this chapter to a height in excess of the applicable height limit
herein established for such zone. The applicable height limitations are hereby
established for each of the zones in question as follows:
   (A)   Runway larger than utility visual approach zone. Slopes 20 feet
outward for each foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation
as the primary surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet
along the extended runway centerline.
   (B)   Runway larger than utility with a visibility minimum greater than 3/
4 mile non-precision instrument approach zone. Slopes 34 feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary
surface and extending to a horizontal distance of 10,000 feet along the
extended runway centerline.
   (C)   Heliport approach zone. Slopes 8 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
extending to a distance of 4,000 feet along the heliport approach zone
centerline.
   (D)   Transitional zones. Slope 7 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the approach surface, and extending to a height of 150 feet above the airport
elevation, which is 2,933 feet above mean seal level. In addition to the
foregoing, there are established height limits sloping 7 feet outward for each
foot upward beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach
surface, and extending to where they intersect the conical surface. Where the
precision instrument runway approach zone projects beyond the conical zone,
there are established height limits sloping 7 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the approach surface,
and extending a horizontal distance of 5,000 feet measured at 90 degree angles
to the extended runway centerline.
   (E)   Heliport transitional zones. Slope 2 feet outward for each foot upward
beginning at the sides of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and
the heliport approach zones and extending a distance of 250 feet measured
horizontally from and at 90 degree angles to the primary surface centerline and
heliport approach zones centerline.
   (F)   Horizontal zone. Established at 150 feet above the airport elevation
at a height of 3,083 feet above mean sea level.
   (G)   Conical zone. Slopes 20 feet outward for each foot upward beginning at

§ 158.05 USE RESTRICTIONS.
   (A)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, no use may be
made of land or water within any zone established by this chapter in such a
manner as to create electrical interference with navigational signals or radio
communication between the airport and aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to
distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
pilots using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport,
create bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with
the landing, takeoff, or maneuvering of aircraft intending to use the airport.
   (B)   Lighting for parking, recreational or transportation uses is exempt
from this section.
(Ord. —, passed 1-31-2006) Penalty, see §
158.99
§ 158.06 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Regulations not retroactive. The regulations prescribed by this
chapter shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering, or other
change or alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations
as of the effective date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the
continuance of nonconforming use. Nothing contained herein shall require any
change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any structure, the
construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of
this chapter and is diligently prosecuted.
   (B)   Marking and lighting. Notwithstanding division (A), the owner of any
existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to permit the
installation, operation, and maintenance thereon of the markers and lights as
shall be deemed necessary by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to
indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of the airport obstruction. The markers and lights shall be installed,
operated, and maintained at the expense of the owner.
(Ord. —, passed 1-31-2006)
§ 158.07 PERMITS.
   (A)   Future uses. Except as specifically provided in subsections (1, (2),
and (3), no material change shall be made to a structure, and no structure
shall be erected or otherwise established in any zone hereby created unless an
airport impact permit therefore shall have been applied for and granted. Each
application for an airport impact permit shall indicate the purpose for which
the permit is desired, with sufficient information to determine whether the
resulting use or structure would conform to the regulations herein prescribed.
If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit shall be granted. No
permit for a structure inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter shall
be granted unless a variance has been approved in accordance with division (D).
      (1)   In the area lying within the limits of the horizontal zone and
conical zone, no airport impact permit shall be required for any structure less
than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when, because of
terrain, land contour, or topographic features the structure would extend above
the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      (2)   In areas lying within the limits of the approach zones, but at a
horizontal distance of not less than 4,200 feet from each end of the runway, no
permit shall be required for any structure less than 75 feet of vertical height
above the ground, except when the structure would extend above the height limit
prescribed for such approach zones.
      (3)   In the areas lying within the limits of the transition zones beyond
the perimeter of the horizontal zone, no permit shall be required for any
structure less than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground, except when
the tree or structure, because of terrain, land contour, or topographic
features, would extend above the height limit prescribed for such transition
zones.
Nothing contained in any of the foregoing exceptions shall be construed as
permitting or intending to permit any construction, or alteration of any
structure in excess of any of the height limits established by this chapter
except as set forth in §
158.04.
   (B)   Existing uses. No permit shall be granted that would allow the
establishment or creation of an obstruction or permit a nonconforming use,
structure, or tree to become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was on
the effective date of this chapter or any amendments thereto or than it is when
the application for a permit is made. Except as indicated, all applications for
a permit shall be granted.
   (C)   Plans review. The County Planning and Zoning Office, acting in the
capacity of evaluating applications for building permits, will review all
building permit applications to determine compatibility with this chapter. If
the County Planning and Zoning Office determines that an airport impact permit
is required for any new or existing structure, the office will forward the
plans for the permit to the Airport Ordinance Administrator for his/her review
and approval, prior to issuing a county building permit.
   (D)   Application requirements. In the area lying within the limits of the
horizontal zone and conical zone, any application for an airport impact permit
for any structure greater than 75 feet of vertical height above the ground
shall be accompanied with a certified site location plan prepared by a
registered engineer or surveyor. The site plan shall certify the location of
all new buildings and structures and must also certify the ground level
elevation of the site as well as the height of the structure.
   (E)   Nonconforming uses, abandoned or destroyed. Whenever the Airport
Appeals Board determines that a nonconforming tree or structure has been
abandoned or more than 80% torn down, physically deteriorated or decayed, no
permit shall be granted that would allow such structure or tree to exceed the
applicable height limit or otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
   (F)   Variances. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure not in accordance with the regulations prescribed in this chapter,
may apply to the Airport Appeals Board for a variance from such regulations.
The application for variance shall be accompanied by a determination from the
Federal Aviation Administration and the Airport Advisory Commission as to the
effect of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the
safe, efficient use of navigable airspace. The variances shall be allowed where
it is duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations
will result in unnecessary hardship and relief granted, will not be contrary to
the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter.
Additionally, no application for variance to the requirements of this chapter
may be considered by the Airport Appeals Board unless a copy of the application
has been furnished to the Airport Advisory Commission and the Maryland Aviation
Administration for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the variance. If
the Airport Advisory Commission does not respond to the application within 30
days after receipt, the Airport Appeals Board may act on its own to grant or
deny the application.
   (G)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted may,
if the action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and
be reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner
of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and maintain, at the
owner's expense, such markings and lights as may be necessary per Federal
Aviation Administration AC 70-7460/1 K.

§ 159.004 EXEMPTIONS TO THIS CHAPTER.
   (A)   Lots over 50 acres. The requirements of this chapter shall be
temporarily waived if a new lot is proposed with a lot area exceeding 50 acres,
provided the lot includes a deed restriction stating that the lot will not be
used for 2 or more dwelling units or a principal industrial or commercial use
(other than agricultural or forestry uses).
      (1)   The deed restriction shall provide that if the lot in the future is
proposed for 2 or more dwelling units or a principal industrial or commercial
use, then the lot shall be required to be approved under this chapter, as
amended, and to meet all requirements of such ordinance. The deed restriction
shall be enforceable by the county.
      (2)   A plan shall be submitted showing the proposed lot lines. The plan
shall require a signature of the Planning Director and the Garrett County
Health Officer or his/her designee, and be recorded in the County Land Records
Office.
      (3)   If a lot of less than 50 acres results from the same subdivision,
the lot shall still be required to comply with this chapter.
   (B)   Merger of lots. The merger of 2 or more existing lots into a single
lot shall not be regulated under this chapter, provided that the merger is
recorded with a restriction that the pre-existing lots shall not be sold as

apply to a lot that is permanently deed restricted to prohibit any new
buildings on the lot, except utility buildings of less than 500 square feet of

condemnation of right-of-way or easements for improvements to a road or for
stormwater or utility improvements shall not by itself cause a need for
approval under this chapter.
   (E)   Boundary settlement. The settlement of a disputed property boundary
line between existing lots of record shall not, by itself, require approval
under this chapter.
   (F)   Bounded lots. A bounded lot is an area separated from the remainder of
the lot by a public road right-of-way or another lot. Creation of a lot
following the boundaries of the bounded lot shall be exempt from the

land resources, allow low density subdivision, and retain land value.
   (B)   Subdivision with three-acre minimum lot size.  Except as provided in
divisions (C) and (D) of this section, all subdivision in the AR and RR land
classifications shall be subject to the following standards:
      (1)   Minimum lot size: 3 acres.
      (2)   Minimum lot width: 200 feet.
   (C)   Subdivision with one-acre minimum lot size. Subdivision shall be
permitted in accordance with the standards applicable to the R land
classification, as provided in §
159.028, for subdivisions complying with the following standards:
      (1)   Subdivision of any lot for the purpose of creating lots that will
be transferred to a child or grandchild of the lot owner(s).
      (2)   Subdivision of any lot of record that had a gross area of 20 acres
or less on the effective date of this chapter.
      (3)   Subdivision of a lot of record having a gross area greater than 20
acres on the effective date of this chapter, provided the Planning Commission
grants a waiver to allow the subdivision. The waiver may be granted if the
Planning Commission finds that the waiver complies with §
159.006 and that the lot for which subdivision is proposed:
         (a)   Does not contribute to contiguous areas of farmland or forest;
and,
         (b)   Is primarily surrounded by lots of 20 acres or less. As a
guideline, a lot would meet this qualification if it abuts or is directly
across a road right-of-way from lots of 20 acres or less along at least 75% of
its perimeter.
   (D)   Cluster subdivision. Cluster subdivision shall be permitted, subject
to the following standards.
      (1)   Maximum density: 1 dwelling unit per 2 gross acres, plus 1
additional dwelling unit on a resource parcel.
      (2)   Minimum lot size: none. All lots shall comply with lot size
requirements of the Health Department.
      (3)   Minimum lot width:
         (a)   Lots 3 acres or larger: 200 feet.
         (b)   Lots at least 1 and less than 3 acres: 100 feet or the minimum
lot width determined by the Garrett County Health Department.
         (c)   Lots less than 1 acre: 80 feet or the minimum lot width
determined by the Garrett County Health Department.
      (4)   Minimum open space for cluster subdivision: 50% of the gross area
of the subdivision.
   (E)   If at least 50% and less than 66% of the gross area of a cluster
subdivision is open space, the subdivision shall be subject to §
159.030, single family cluster option.
   (F)   If at least 66% of the gross area of a cluster subdivision is open
space, the subdivision shall be subject to the following standards in lieu of §
159.030(A) through (C). The open space shall comply with §
159.030(D) and (E).
      (1)   The Planning Commission shall approve the subdivision if the
subdivision design meets the following standards to the extent possible, in
addition to other requirements of this chapter:
         (a)   Protects contiguous areas of natural resources, including farm
fields, forests, scenic views, environmentally sensitive areas, and cultural
features such as historic sites.
         (b)   Minimizes disturbance of sensitive environmental areas such as
flood plains, steep slopes, wetlands and forests.
         (c)    Locates subdivision lots and roads to avoid conflicts with
farming operations.
      (2)   The area of open space in excess of 50% of the gross area of the
subdivision may be provided by placing a conservation easement on portions of
subdivision lots contiguous with the open space. The easement area shall not be
used for buildings, patios, pavement or gravel surfaces but may be used for
septic systems or wells.
      (3)   Upon request of the property owner, qualifying open space parcels
may be designated as Garrett County Agricultural Preservation districts and
receive the tax incentive that agricultural districts enjoy.
      (4)   The following private road standards shall apply in lieu of the
right-of-way width, cartway width and paving requirements established by §
159.111(G). All other provisions of §
159.111(G) shall apply.
         (a)   Minimum private road right-of-way width: 30 feet.
         (b)   Minimum private road cartway width: 12 feet for a road serving 1
to 10 lots, or 16 feet with 1-foot shoulders for a road serving 11 to 40 lots.
         (c)   Road construction standards: a stone surface as specified in §
159.111(G)(3)(a) may be approved for a road serving up to 40 lots.
         (d)   For roads serving more than 40 lots, the standards of §
159.111(G) shall apply.
   (G)   If at least 80% of the gross area of a cluster subdivision is open
space, the subdivision shall be exempt from the design standards in division
(F)(1) of this section.
(Res. 2010-5, passed 5-25-2010)
§ 159.028 LOT AND DENSITY STANDARDS.
   (A)   Minimum requirements. The requirements of this section apply to any
lot approved in the R, SR, TR, TC, C and EC land classifications. For lots
within the area of the Deep Creek Watershed Zoning Ordinance, refer to the
requirements of the Zoning Ordinance. A lot shall be regulated based upon the
land classification that it is located within, based upon the Land
Classification Map. If a lot is not approved as part of a cluster development,
then only columns 1, 2 and 3 of this table shall apply. If a lot is approved
under §
159.030 as a "Cluster Development," then only columns 1, 4, 5 and 6 of this
table shall apply.

   (B)   Steep slope requirements. Where the steep slope regulations of the
Sensitive Areas Ordinance require a larger lot area or lot width, the more
stringent requirement shall apply.
   (C)   Additional lot width standards.
      (1)   Around the bulb of an approved cul-de-sac or hammerhead turnaround,
the minimum lot width as defined in §
159.016 may be reduced by 40%, provided that the average of the rear lot line
length and the lot width at the front of the proposed principal building is
equal to or greater than the full minimum lot width requirement.
      (2)   Within an approved cluster development, at the option of an
applicant, instead of the definition in §
159.016, the lot width may be calculated as the average of the following: the
length of the rear lot line and the lot width at the front of the proposed
principal building.
   (D)   Lot area and density. If townhouses or multi-family units are
proposed, the minimum lot area stated in §
159.028(A) shall not apply. If twin dwellings are proposed, the minimum lot
area shall be calculated as a minimum average lot area per dwelling unit.
   (E)   Open space calculation. Required open space shall be calculated as a
percentage of the total tract area.
   (F)   Youghiogheny River Corridor. Certain additional requirements have been
established along specific areas adjacent to a portion of the Youghiogheny
River, under regulations of the Maryland Department of Natural Resources. Where
such regulations and this chapter both regulate the same matter, the provision
that is most restrictive shall apply. (As of 2009, such provisions were in
COMAR, Title 8, Subtitle 15, entitled “Youghiogheny Wild River.” The
regulations include maps of the designated corridor.)

§ 159.030 SINGLE FAMILY CLUSTER OPTION.
   (A)   Purposes and applicability. This section provides an optional process
to reduce the minimum lot area and lot width if the applicant proves to the
satisfaction of the Planning Commission that a development will fully comply
with this section.
      (1)   Purposes of cluster option. To allow flexibility in the lot layout
of single family detached houses to avoid severe soil erosion and
sedimentation; avoid severely increased stormwater flows and speeds; steer
development to those areas that are more physically suited for it; avoid
construction of steep roads that are difficult, time-consuming, and expensive
to maintain and snow plow; avoid increased use of steep roads and driveways
that are dangerous to drive upon in snow and ice; conserve forested areas that
are an important part of the ecological cycle, providing for groundwater
recharge, air pollution reduction, wildlife habitats and renewable economic
resources; reduce construction costs; preserve the scenic character of the area
and protect the quality of creeks and lakes, which will help to promote
tourism; and preserve lands as crop farming. To provide a process that is
simpler than a PRD, and which offers the same types of improvement and
submission requirements as a conventional subdivision.
      (2)   For areas regulated by the Zoning Ordinance, see also §
157.073.
      (3)   The term “cluster development” shall mean a development of single
family detached dwellings and protected open space meeting the requirements of
and approved under §
159.030 or
157.073. A cluster development shall only include single family detached
dwellings, open space, their customary accessory uses, and uses specifically
permitted by this section within the open space. A cluster development shall
not include a mobile/ manufactured home park.
      (4)   A cluster development shall only be permitted on a lot or
contiguous lots including a minimum of 5 acres in the same ownership, not
including existing road rights-of-way but including the right-of-way of roads
proposed within the tract. The land area shall be contiguous, except that
portions of the tract may be separated only by existing or proposed roads or
creeks.
      (5)   The cluster development shall be designed as a unified, coordinated
residential development, and shall be approved within a development plan
controlled by a single development entity. After final subdivision approval, a
developer may sell individual lots to different builders or home buyers,
provided that the developer or his/her successor remains responsible for making
sure there is compliance with the approved development plan.
   (B)   Reduction of lot width and lot area. If approved as a cluster
development, then the minimum lot area and minimum lot width of the areas as
shown on the Land Classification Map may be reduced as stated in §
159.028, subject to provision of the required open space. In areas not
categorized by the Land Classification Map, the minimum lot width and lot area
provided by the applicable Zoning Ordinance shall apply.
   (C)   The applicant shall demonstrate to the Planning Commission that the
cluster development would clearly serve a valid public purpose that would
result in a development superior to a conventional development.
      (1)   The valid public purposes include but are not limited to the
following:
         (a)   The permanent preservation of forests, steep slopes, wetlands,
creek valleys, highly scenic areas or other sensitive natural features.
         (b)   The permanent preservation of a substantial area of land for
crop farming, in a tract of size and configuration that allows for efficient
agricultural use and that properly considers the issue of compatibility between
the agricultural uses and homes.
         (c)   The dedication of public recreation land at a site deemed
appropriate by the Planning Commission and suitable for active and/or passive
recreation. Any such land shall also be approved by the body proposed to accept
such land, such as the County Commissioners in the case of dedication to the
county.
         (d)   The clustering of homes in a location that will be substantially
buffered from nuisance-generating uses, such as an expressway or major arterial
road.
      (2)   The applicant shall demonstrate that the proposed cluster
development has been designed in full consideration of important natural
features, including mature woodlands, creek valleys, scenic views, steep slopes
and wetlands. At a minimum, the applicant shall establish that areas along
perennial creeks shall be preserved in their natural state, except for
landscaping, erosion control improvements, public recreation improvements and
needed utility, road and driveway crossings. The natural features of the site
shall be a major factor in determining the siting of dwelling units. The
conservation of forest cover shall be maximized.
      (3)   Phasing. The development shall include a phasing system that shall
be approved by the Planning Commission. The phases shall ensure that the
requirements of this section would be met after the completion of any 1 phase,
and that the development could properly function without the construction of
additional phases.
   (D)   Methods of preserving open space.
      (1)   The method(s) to be used to own, preserve and maintain the
protected open space shall be
determined prior to final subdivision approval and shall be acceptable to the
Planning Commission. Any subsequent revisions in the method of ownership or
maintenance or the use of the protected open space that is inconsistent with
the approved submission shall be subject to re-approval by the Planning
Commission. The revisions shall only be approved after a public hearing is
held, with notice provided to owners of record of lots within the cluster
development.
      (2)   Required open space shall be permanently preserved by 1 of the
following methods:
         (a)   Dedication to a government agency or Board of Education, if
authorized officials of such agency or board agree in writing to accept such
dedication and to maintain the land as public open space in perpetuity.
         (b)   Dedication to a homeowners association, if each property deed
legally requires each homeowner within the cluster development to fund the
proper maintenance of the land and other necessary expenses, and provided the
association is incorporated, follows written by-laws, and has the legal
authority to limit uses of the open space and to enforce assessments upon
homeowners. The developer shall not dedicate open space to a homeowners
association until the association is incorporated and able to maintain the
land. Until such time, the developer shall be responsible to maintain the land.
         (c)   Dedication to an incorporated and well-established nature
conservation organization acceptable to the Planning Commission.
         (d)   Retention of land in private ownership on a lot or lots that
each have a minimum acreage of 5 acres, provided the use(s) of the land are
specified and comply with division (E)(1) of this section and a conservation
easement is conveyed to the county to preserve the intended use(s). Open space
retained for private ownership and use shall be referred to and identified on
the plat as a resource parcel.
      (3)   The county shall not be obligated to maintain or accept dedication
of any protected open space, unless the Board of Commissioners voluntarily
accept such responsibility.
      (4)   Legal documents establishing the types of uses, method of
ownership, funding of maintenance, and form of deed restrictions or
conservation easements for the protected open space shall be provided for
acceptance by the Planning Commission prior to final subdivision approval. The
documents shall authorize remedies by owners of property within the cluster
development if the open space is not maintained and preserved in accordance
with written representations made to purchasers of property.
   (E)   Open space standards. Required protected open space shall meet all of
the following requirements:
      (1)   Required open space shall be permanently protected by appropriate
deed restrictions and/or conservation easements on each lot, to prevent
additional subdivisions and to prevent the construction of new principal
buildings and to prohibit any commercial use, other than buildings or uses
specifically approved by the Planning Commission. Land approved as required
open space shall only be used for the following:
         (a)   Non-commercial outdoor active or passive recreation;
         (b)   The preservation of natural features;
         (c)   Crop farming (which may include a Christmas tree farm), outdoor
pasturing and grazing of animals;
         (d)   Horseriding areas, which may include accessory stables;
         (e)   Golf courses, not including miniature golf and not including
lighting for nighttime use,
         (f)   Timbering as part of a long-range forest management plan
prepared by a professional forester, and which utilizes Best Management
Practices, and which is approved by the Planning Commission; or
         (g)   Other open space-oriented uses which the Planning Commission
determines are compatible with this section.
         (h)   One single-family dwelling shall be permitted on a resource
parcel in a cluster subdivision in the AR or RR land classification.
      (2)   See the definition of “open space, protected” in §
159.016 which limits the types of lands that can be used to meet the required
minimum open space requirement.
      (3)   The applicant shall establish that the disturbance of natural
slopes over 25%, wetlands and other important natural features within protected
open space will be minimized.
         (a)   See provisions in subsection (1) regarding forestry.
         (b)   No construction of buildings shall occur on natural or man-made
slopes of over 25%. The alteration of slopes with a natural grade of over 25%
shall be held to an absolute minimum.
      (4)   Improvements to open space. The application shall include a
detailed and legally binding (if approved) description of what improvements the
applicant will make to any land intended to be publicly dedicated to make it
suitable for its intended purpose.
         (a)   Examples of such improvements for areas intended for passive
recreation include preservation and planting of trees, development of nature,
bicycle or jogging trails, the stabilization of creek banks and the removal of
undesirable vegetation.
         (b)   Examples of improvements for areas intended for active
recreation include grading of land to create land suitable for free-play fields
for youth.
      (5)   All proposed open spaces shall be cleared of construction debris,
materials from illegal dumping and any rocks that were not naturally on the
land, unless those rocks are incorporated into landscaping improvements.
      (6)   The applicant shall establish that all required open space would be
suitable for its intended purposes as approved by the Planning Commission.
      (7)   Whenever possible, lots and open spaces shall be located to promote
pedestrian and visual access to open spaces intended for community or public
use.
      (8)   Protected common open space shall not be separated by an arterial
road from the majority of the dwellings within a cluster development.
      (9)   All protected open space shall be within 1 or 2 contiguous areas,
except as may be specifically permitted otherwise by the Planning Commission.
      (10)   If the Planning Commission approves the provision of protected
open space in private ownership, the Commission may require that 10% of open
space be a separate open space lot to provide appropriate recreation land for
residents of the development.
   (F)   Yield plan. This section shall apply to a proposed cluster development
in the R, SR, TR, TC, EC, and C Districts when required by §
159.028:
      (1)   Purpose. To make sure that the cluster development does not result
in an excessive increase in density from the maximum that would otherwise be
permitted.
      (2)   Yield plan. A yield plan shall be submitted as part of an
application for a cluster development. The yield plan shall be a sketch plan
drawn to scale that shows the number and location of lots that could reasonably
be expected to be permitted under the conventional zoning regulations of the
applicable district. The yield plan shall consider the impacts of regulations
regarding steep slopes, floodplains, wetlands and similar matters. The yield
plan shall consider the same areas of land as the proposed cluster development.
For the purposes of the yield plan, an applicant may assume that the same
flexibility in measuring lot width would apply to the conventional development
as would apply to a cluster development.
      (3)   A cluster development shall not be permitted to include a greater
total number of dwelling units than is determined to have been possible based
upon the yield plan, unless a density bonus is specifically permitted in
division (B). The yield plan shall be subject to acceptance by the Planning
Commission.
   (G)   Public water and sewer. Within the R land classification, no extension
of public water or public sewer services will be permitted as part of a cluster
development and no private wastewater treatment plants (including package
treatment plants) will be permitted.

§ 159.031 SENSITIVE AREAS.
   (A)   Ordinance. The County Sensitive Areas Ordinance, as amended, shall
apply.
   (B)   New lots. Any new lot submitted for subdivision approval after the
effective date of this chapter that would permit the construction of a new
principal building shall include a designated site (or outer extent of all
potential sites) for a principal building that is outside of all of the
following: the 100-year floodplain, natural slopes over 30%, a designated
stream buffer, wetlands and wetland buffers, and federally designated habitats
of rare, threatened or endangered species.

§ 159.032 FLAG LOTS.
   (A)   Definition. A flag lot is a lot approved under this chapter which does
not meet the minimum lot width requirements of this chapter. This section shall
not apply to lot width requirements under an applicable zoning ordinance.
   (B)   Requirements. A flag lot may be created if all of the following
requirements are met:
      (1)   A front lot line shall be designated in the non-flagpole area to
permit best utilization of the lot. The building setback line shall be measured
parallel to the designated front lot line. The lot shall meet the minimum lot
width requirement at the building setback line or along a line 50 feet from the
designated front lot line.
      (2)   The applicant shall establish to the satisfaction of the Planning
Commission that a flag lot is necessary to provide for the reasonable
development of the land and/or to preserve important natural features.
      (3)   In no case shall any portion of the flag lot have a width of less
than 25 feet.
      (4)   A maximum total of 1 flag lot shall be permitted to be created from
any lot that existed at the effective date of this chapter.
      (5)   A flag lot shall not be used for principal commercial or industrial
uses.

ARTICLE 4. SKETCH PLAT
§ 159.040 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the sketch plat is to indicate to the county the intent and
scope of the subdivision and to familiarize the applicant with the county's
planning goals and requirements which may affect the subdivision. A sketch plat
review often allows an applicant to save substantial time and engineering
costs, because many concerns about layout and issues concerning county
ordinances can be resolved prior to detailed engineering. This can often reduce
the need for future redesign at a more detailed stage, thereby saving the
applicant significant money and time.
(Ord. —, passed 6-24-1997; Am. Res. 2010-5, passed 5-25-2010)
§ 159.041 SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Pre-submission consultation. Prior to submitting a sketch plat,
applicants for larger developments are encouraged to informally discuss their
proposal with the Subdivision Administrator and/or other appropriate county
staff.
   (B)   Prior to the submission of a preliminary plat, applicants are very
strongly encouraged to submit a sketch plat.
   (C)   No official action shall be taken on a sketch plat. The county shall
not be bound by comments made or not made as part of a sketch plat review.
   (D)   The Subdivision Administrator shall distribute copies of the sketch
plat to the Planning Commission. The applicant shall provide a copy of the
sketch plat to the County Engineer.
   (E)   The sketch plat should be reviewed by the Subdivision Administrator
and Planning Commission, with any comments reported to the applicant or his/her
representative.
(Res. 2010-5, passed 5-25-2010)

shall constitute conditional approval of the subdivision as to the character
and intensity, but shall not constitute approval of the final plat or authorize
the sale of lots or construction of buildings.
      (5)   Disapproval. If the preliminary plat submission is disapproved, the
decision shall describe 1 or more defects in the submission and/or requirements
which have not been met and cite the provisions of a statute or ordinance
relied upon. If a submittal is reasonably complete, then the county staff
should endeavor to identify all obvious defects known to the staff.
      (6)   Joint preliminary/final approval. At the discretion of the Planning
Commission, the Commission may grant combined preliminary/final plat approval
if:

ARTICLE 7. MINOR SUBDIVISIONS AND LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS
§ 159.080 PURPOSE.
   This subchapter provides simplified procedures for submitting and reviewing
minor subdivisions and lot line adjustments. See the definition of a “minor
subdivision” in §
159.016.
(Ord. —, passed 6-24-1997)
§ 159.081 SUBMISSION AND REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   The following submission and review process shall apply for minor
subdivisions, annexations to a lot, and what the county determines to be minor
revisions of approved plats.
   (A)   Final plat submission required. A final plat submission for each minor
subdivision or lot line adjustment must be filed by the applicant and reviewed
in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. A preliminary plat is not
required for a minor subdivision or a lot line adjustment.
   (B)   Required submission.
      (1)   The Planning Director shall publish application forms and a
checklist of required information for minor subdivisions and lot line
adjustments. The checklist shall include the information listed in this article
and may include other items necessary to determine compliance with applicable
county requirements. The checklist and revisions to the checklist shall be
approved by the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The applicant shall file the required fee(s) and required number of
copies of required plats and materials (see §
159.082).
      (3)   The applicant is fully responsible to contact utility providers to
gain approval for utilities; obtain any needed permits or approvals from state
and federal agencies, such as approval from the State Highway Administration
for any work within the right-of-way of a state road or access to a state road;
and obtain approval from the County Health Department, as applicable.
   (C)   Initial actions by the staff.
      (1)   If the Subdivision Administrator determines that the submission is
significantly incomplete, then he/she shall either:
         (a)   Not accept the submission; or
         (b)   Accept the submission on the condition that the applicant
submits such additional information by a specific deadline.
      (2)   The maximum time limits for actions by the county shall not apply
until after a submission is complete, and after any needed zoning variance or
subdivision modification has been granted.
      (3)   The staff shall retain in the Commission's files 1 copy of all
materials submitted by the applicant.
      (4)   The applicant shall provide copies of the submission to the County
Engineer.
   (D)   Streamlined approval. An application under this section may be
approved by and signed by the Planning Director. The Director shall provide a
report to the Planning Commission at the next regularly scheduled meeting on
all minor subdivisions approved under this section.
   (E)   Review and action by the Planning Director. The Planning Director
shall accomplish the following within 30 days of receipt of the required number
of copies of the complete submission, unless the applicant grants a written
time extension.
      (1)   Review all applicable comments received from the appropriate review
agencies and officers. The Planning Director shall make sure that the signature
of the Garrett County Health Officer or his/her designee has been placed on the
plat before any action is taken;
      (2)   Determine whether the final plat submission meets the requirements
of this chapter and other applicable ordinances;
      (3)   Review the final plat submission and recommend any needed revisions
so that the submission will conform to this chapter and other applicable
ordinances; and
      (4)   Approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the final plat
submission, specifying any recommended conditions for approval. If a final plat
submission is disapproved, the decision shall specify at least 1 defect found
in the submission, and shall cite the provisions of a statute or ordinance
relied upon. If a submittal is reasonably complete, then the county staff
should endeavor to identify all obvious defects known to the staff.
      (5)   The decision of the Planning Director shall be in writing and shall
be communicated to the applicant personally or mailed to him/her at the last
known address following the decision.
      (6)   The approval of the final plat by the Planning Director shall not
by itself constitute an acceptance of the dedication of any road or other
proposed public way, space or area. An acceptance of dedication by the county
shall not occur until specifically authorized by the Board of Commissioners.
   (F)   Expiration.
      (1)   When the Planning Director provides written comments to the
applicant listing required revisions to a final plat submission for a minor
subdivision, the applicant must submit a revised final plat within 2 years of
the date of the comments. If a revised plat is not submitted within 2 years,
the final plat application shall be void and a new submission shall be
required.
      (2)   A final plat shall become void if a record plat is not recorded
within 10 years of the final plat approval.

ARTICLE 8. IMPROVEMENTS GUARANTEES
§ 159.090 INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS OR GUARANTEE REQUIRED.
   (A)   Purposes. To make sure that purchasers of lots have adequate utilities
and adequate access to roads. To avoid problems of lots being sold before
utilities and roads are installed, and then the improvements not being
completed. To avoid burdening home buyers or the county with unexpected costs
to complete improvements. To make sure that all lots have adequate access for
emergency vehicles. To permit developers the option of either completing
improvements in advance of home sales or providing financial guarantees. These
provisions are established under the authority of Md. Code, § 5.03(b) of
Article 66B.
   (B)   Prior installation or guarantees. Before approving any subdivision
plat for recording, the Planning Commission may require that the county be
assured by means of a proper legally binding agreement with the applicant that:
      (1)   The developer will install all required road, central water (if
applicable), central sewage (if applicable), stormwater management, erosion
control improvements, electric service connections and telephone service
connections and complete all rough grading prior to the sale of any lot or
condominium unit; or
      (2)   The developer has provided financial guarantees to make sure that
such required improvements will be properly installed in a timely manner
related to the sale and occupancy of each building.
   (C)   Phasing. If provided in a legally binding agreement between the county
and the developer, the installation of improvements or the provision of
financial guarantees may be related to specific phases of a development. (For
example, a developer may provide financial guarantees for improvements needed
to serve lots 1 through 6, and then be permitted to sell lots 1 through 6.
Then, after a developer provides additional financial guarantees for
improvements needed to serve lots 7 through 12, then the developer would be
permitted to sell lots 7 through 12.)
   (D)   Persons responsible.
      (1)   The applicant for a subdivision shall be responsible for the
installation of all improvements required by this chapter, unless the county
approves a legally binding agreement that transfers the responsibility to a
developer and which binds his/her successors.
      (2)   Any conveyance of all or a substantial portion of the unimproved
lots or public improvements or roads of any subdivision or change in
developers, whether voluntary or by action of law or otherwise, shall require
the prior approval of the county. In giving or denying the approval, the county
shall require the new landowner and/or developer fully assume all applicable
responsibilities under the agreement and post all the appropriate financial
security.
   (E)   Inspections. The County Engineer or his/her designee in coordination
with the Subdivision Administrator shall make the inspections of the road,
stormwater, erosion control and other required improvements at intervals as may
be reasonably necessary to assure compliance with this chapter. The reasonable
costs of such inspection shall be borne by the subdivider.
   (F)   Agreements. All agreements provided for in this subchapter may be
subject to review and acceptance by the County Attorney. All agreements
provided for in this subchapter shall be approved and signed by the County
Board of Commissioners, unless the Board of Commissioners delegates the
responsibilities to the County Planning Commission or another designee. Any
required agreement shall be signed by all responsible landowners and/or
developers. The county may require that the agreement be officially recorded.
   (G)   Amount of guarantees. If an applicant intends to provide financial
guarantees, then the applicant shall provide an accurate estimate of the market
cost of completing the required improvements.
      (1)   The estimate shall be prepared and signed by a state-licensed
professional engineer, surveyor, landscape architect or architect. The estimate
shall be subject to review and acceptance by the County Engineer.
      (2)   If such improvements would be completed over a number of years,
then a reasonable inflation factor may be required.
   (H)   Utility agreements. If a development will connect into a public water
or public sanitary sewage system, the applicable sanitary district, town or
other agency may also require separate agreements. If such separate agreements
guarantee the installation of water and sewage systems, then the agreement with
the county need not guarantee such improvements.
   (I)   Type of financial security.
      (1)   The guarantee shall be secured by the credit of any of the
following:
         (a)   An irrevocable and unconditional letter of credit of a federal
or state chartered lending institution;
         (b)   A restrictive or escrow account in a federal or state chartered
lending institution; or
         (c)   Such other appropriate financial security approved by the Board
of Commissioners, but not including a second or third mortgage on the
unimproved lands.
      (2)   The approved security shall provide for, and secure to the public
and lot owners, the completion of any improvements in a timely manner to serve
any lot(s) that need to be served by such improvements.
      (3)   The county may require that evidence that the entity proposed to
provide the security has sufficient secure assets.
      (4)   The county or its designee shall be the authorized signatory on any
account in which the escrow funds are held.
(Ord. —, passed 6-24-1997; Am. Res. 2010-5, passed 5-25-2010)
§ 159.091 APPROVAL OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Advance notice by developer of construction of improvements.
      (1)   The developer or his/her representative shall provide a minimum of
3 business days prior notice to the County Engineer and the Subdivision
Administrator prior to beginning each major facet of construction, in order to
allow the scheduling of inspections.
      (2)   The County Engineer or Subdivision Administrator shall complete
inspections within 2 weeks of receipt of the applicant's notification that an
inspection is needed, provided the application complies with all other
requirements of the Roads Department.
   (B)   Request for release of security. When an improvement has been
completed, the party posting the financial security shall notify the county and
request in writing to the county release of related financial security.
   (C)   Report on required improvements.
      (1)   In response to a request to release financial security, the County
Engineer or his/her designee and the Subdivision Administrator shall jointly
submit a written report certifying which required improvements have been
satisfactorily completed in accordance with the approved plat to the Board of
Commissioners or their designee.
      (2)   This report shall recommend approval or rejection of the
improvements, in whole or in part. One or more reasons shall be stated for a
proposed rejection.
   (D)   Release of security.
      (1)   The Board of Commissioners or their designee shall review the
County Engineer's and Subdivision Administrator's report and shall authorize
release of an amount that fairly represents the value of the improvements
completed.
      (2)   The county shall notify the developer or his/her representative in
writing of the decision.
      (3)   When the developer has properly completed all of the required
improvements, the developer shall request final release of all remaining
financial security.
   (E)   Completion of unaccepted improvements. The developer shall complete
any required improvements that the Board of Commissioners or their designee
determines are not satisfactory or complete. Upon completion, the applicant may
request approval in conformance with the above procedures.
(Ord. —, passed 6-24-1997; Am. Res. 2010-5, passed 5-25-2010)
§ 159.092 REMEDIES TO CAUSE COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Enforcement of security.
      (1)   In the event that any improvements that were required have not been
installed as provided in this chapter or the approved final plat or the
development agreement, or in the event of the bankruptcy of the owner or
developer, or in the event the performance security lapses in time before the
required improvements are completed, then the Board of Commissioners is hereby
granted the power to elect to enforce any security posted under this ordinance
by appropriate legal and equitable remedies.
         (a)   Such remedies may include taking all actions necessary to ensure
improvements are completed without cost to the county, including but not
limited to:
            1.   Seizure of lots or escrow funds;
            2.   Revocation or suspension of county permits or suspension of
issuance of any required county permits or occupancy certificates;
            3.   Non-release of performance securities;
            4.   Requirement for additional performance security;
            5.   Non-acceptance of improvements;
            6.   Removal, reconstruction or replacement of substandard
improvements at the cost of the developer; and
            7.   Prosecution of a violation of this chapter.
         (b)   Construction without inspection. If required improvements have
been completed without providing the county with proper opportunity for
inspection, and as a result the county cannot determine whether the
improvements were properly constructed, then the Board of Commissioners may
require that the developer, at the developer's expense, remove, replace,
sample, test or reconstruct the improvements as necessary to determine
compliance with this chapter and other applicable county standards.
      (2)   Rate of construction. Failure of a developer to construct roads and
other public improvements reasonably at the same time or prior to the
construction of the buildings served by those roads or public improvements, and
at the same rate in time at which buildings are completed, shall be a violation
of this chapter and a cause for default of the security.
   (B)   Completion by county. If the proceeds of the security are insufficient
to pay the cost of installing or correcting improvements covered by the
security, and the county has at its option installed or corrected the
improvements, then the county may institute appropriate legal or equitable
action to recover the moneys necessary to complete the work.

   (A)   Recording.
      (1)   Generally. The applicant shall submit the record plat to the
Planning Office as prescribed in §
159.101. The Planning Office shall submit the record plats to the Land Records
Office for recording with the appropriate fee supplied by the applicant.
      (2)   Conditions. If the final plat approval included conditions that
must be met prior to recording, then the record plat shall comply with the
conditions before it is submitted to the Land Records Office.
      (3)   Exact copy of final plat. As provided in §
159.071(G) of this chapter, the Planning Commission shall allow phasing of a
development by approving final plats for portions of an approved preliminary
plat. However, the record plat must be an exact copy of the approved final plat
(except that certain information can be omitted as provided in §
159.101 below) and must be recorded in its entirety.
      (4)   If a record plat is not recorded within 10 years after the date of
final plat approval, then the approval shall become null and void, unless a
written extension is granted by the Planning Commission after the applicant
shows good cause.
   (B)   Signature. A final plat shall not be recorded unless the plat bears an
original signature of the Chairperson or Acting Chairperson of the Planning
Commission, or, for minor subdivision or lot line adjustments, the original
signature of the Planning Director.
   (C)   Exception for single lots. If a single new lot or lot line adjustment
is approved, then the lot is not required to follow the formal plat recording
process, providing the following requirements are met:
      (1)   In place of the formal recording, a plat showing the lot shall be
recorded with the grantee's deed. The plat is intended to be approximately 8.5
by 14 inches in size, and may be on paper. The plat shall meet division (C).
      (2)   A maximum of 1 lot per calendar year per parent tract shall be
permitted to be exempted under this division.
      (3)   The plat shall be certified by a licensed surveyor.
      (4)   A deed description shall only be based upon a reference to a plat
if that plat is officially filed.

subdivision under §§
159.080 through
159.083.
      (6)   To be eligible for this simplified process, any new lot must be
along an existing road, or else meet all road requirements of this chapter.

excessive erosion or unsafe water supply) shall not be approved until the
developer has provided or has legally committed to provide adequate measures to
overcome or eliminate the hazards. However, the county accepts no
responsibility to identify hazards or to guarantee their resolution.
      (2)   No subdivision shall occur in such a way that would significantly
threaten the public health and safety, including hazards of toxic substances,
traffic hazards, explosive hazards and fire hazards.
   (E)   Other ordinances. All aspects of a proposed subdivision shall conform
to any applicable zoning ordinance and the county's sensitive areas ordinance,
stormwater management ordinance, floodplain ordinance, erosion and sediment
control ordinance and all other county ordinances and specifications.
   (F)   Nearby development. A subdivision and its roads shall be coordinated
with existing or approved nearby development and roads to allow efficient and
compatible development.
(Ord. —, passed 6-24-1997)
§ 159.111 ROADS.
   (A)   Access to roads.
      (1)   New lots. Any new lot approved under this chapter shall have
adequate and safe permanent access to 1 of the following:
         (a)   A public road;
         (b)   A private road meeting the requirements of this section; or
         (c)   A driveway with a minimum cartway width of 12 feet within a
right-of-way established on the record plat and at least 30 feet wide, provided
no more than 2 dwellings have road access via the driveway; or,
         (d)   In the case of a business park, townhouse, apartment or mobile
home park development, individual buildings may have vehicle access onto a
parking court, provided the parking court has access to a public road or an
approved private road.
      (2)   Emergency access. If doubt exists, the Subdivision Administrator
may require an applicant to provide evidence that a new or extended road will
be sufficient in width, surface, slope, height clearance, turning radius,
weight limits and drainage to provide adequate access for fully loaded fire
trucks and ambulances during normal weather conditions. A review by emergency
service providers may be requested. However, the county does not accept
responsibility to guarantee that such access will be possible.
      (3)   Existing private road. The following requirements shall apply if a
new lot is proposed to have vehicle access using a private road that existed on
July 1, 1997:
         (a)   The maintenance requirements of division (B) shall be met to the
extent feasible.
         (b)   A legally established easement or right-of-way shall provide
access by all affected property-owners. Along an existing private road, the
easement or right-of-way shall have a minimum width of 30 feet along all
property owned by the applicant.
         (c)   If 1 or more new lots are proposed along an existing private
road that does not include at least 3 inches total depth of stone and/or other
suitable surface and a width of 12 feet or 16 feet as required below, the
following conditions shall be met:
            1.   Approval of the final plat shall be subject to improvement of
the road to include a minimum depth of 3 inches of appropriate stone or other
county-approved surface across a minimum cartway width of 12 feet if between 1
and 10 new dwellings will be served by the road; or a minimum cartway width of
16 feet if 11 or more new dwelling units will be served.
            2.   The width and depth shall be provided along the entire portion
of the private road from the driveways of the new lots to a public road.
            3.   The road improvement shall be complete prior to issuance of
building permits for the new lots.
         (d)   The applicant shall show that the road will meet the emergency
access standards described in subsection (2) above, after any improvements that
the applicant may agree to make.
      (4)   New or extended private roads. For new or extended private roads,
see width requirements in division (G).
   (B)   Maintenance and ownership of private roads.
      (1)   The ownership and entity responsible for maintenance of a private
road shall be identified on the final plat. The documentation accompanying a
final plat must include legally binding language stating who is to be
responsible for the improvement and maintenance of any road or parking court
not offered for dedication.
      (2)   The developer shall be responsible for maintenance of a road until
it is dedicated to the county or a property-owners association.
      (3)   If a property owners association will own and maintain the private
road, the applicant shall submit proposed covenants that will govern the
association to the county for review and approval as part of the preliminary
plat application.
      (4)   If a private road is not owned by a property owners association,
the owners of a parent lot and any new lots shall be bound by a legal document
approved by the county that provides for periodic payments and maintenance of a
private road.
      (5)   Legal responsibility for maintenance of a private road shall be
enforceable by any affected property-owner, with the county not accepting
responsibilities for enforcement.
   (C)   Road continuations.
      (1)   Stub roads. If a road is proposed to be a public road, then where
deemed necessary by the Planning Commission for efficient movement of traffic,
a subdivision shall include the extension of a proposed road right-of-way or
emergency vehicle accessway to the boundary line of the tract to provide for an
eventual extension into the adjacent tract for efficient circulation of traffic
throughout the area.
      (2)   Widening. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing road of
inadequate cartway, shoulder or right-of-way width, additional right-of-way,
shoulder and/or cartway width may be required by the Planning Commission as
necessary for public safety, stormwater control and potential utility
extensions.
      (3)   If a property being subdivided fronts on a county or town road and
the road right-of-way adjoining the properties has not previously been conveyed
to the county or town, the applicant for the subdivision shall convey to the
jurisdiction sufficient right-of-way measured from the centerline of the road
to match the prevailing width of the road along its entire length.
   (D)   Intersections.
      (1)   Centerline of roads. The centerlines of roads shall intersect at
right angles where physically feasible. If right angles are not feasible, the
intersection shall be at as nearly a right angle as possible, with an absolute
minimum inside angle of 68 degrees.
      (2)   Alignment of road intersections. A maximum of 2 roads shall
intersect at 1 point.
         (a)   Where a proposed road or business driveway intersects an
existing perpendicular road, the proposed road or business driveway shall be
aligned with any road intersecting on the other side of the perpendicular road,
unless the Planning Commission or State Highway Administration determine that
the alignment is not reasonable or feasible.
         (b)   If a proposed road cannot intersect at the same location as a
road on the other side of the perpendicular road, then the proposed road shall
be offset by a minimum of 150 feet from the nearest intersection of roads,
where physically feasible.
      (3)   Two or more roads. All approaches to an intersection of 2 or more
roads shall have a leveling area not greater than 8% grade for a minimum
distance of 20 feet, measured from the nearest edge of cartway of the
intersecting road.
      (4)   Edge of roadways. At road intersections, the edge of the road
cartway shall be rounded by arcs with the radii listed below.
 
Highest Type of Road Involved          Minimum Radius of Arc at Intersection of
                                       Cartway Edge
Arterial road or commercial/industrial 30
road
Other road                             20
 
   (E)   Access management. The Planning Commission may require 1 or more of
the following methods of layout and site design if it determines the methods
will be reasonable, feasible and necessary to avoid increased traffic
congestion and improve traffic safety on public roads. The Commission's
decision to use 1 or more of the following methods will be based on
recommendations of the County Engineer, recommendations of the Subdivision
Administrator, comments from or requirements of the State Highway
Administration and professional traffic studies that have been submitted.
      (1)   The use of a marginal access or “frontage” road or access only onto
side or interior roads, to collect traffic from numerous driveways and direct
it to a select few number of entrances to the public road;
      (2)   The minimization of the number and length of driveway cuts or road
intersections onto a public road, which may include requiring the use of shared
driveways between adjacent uses or lots;
      (3)   The restriction of ingress and egress involving left-hand turns
onto or off of the public road;
      (4)   The prohibition of driveways from individual dwellings entering
directly onto an arterial road; and/or
      (5)   Where individual driveways are proposed to enter onto an arterial
road, or where driveways for nonresidential use are proposed to enter onto any
public road, sufficient turn-around space shall be provided on the lot for
vehicles so they do not need to back onto the road.
   (F)   New public roads or public road extensions.
      (1)   A new road or road extension that is intended to be dedicated to
the county shall meet all requirements of the county roads ordinance, as
amended, prior to acceptance by the county, in addition to requirements of this
section.
      (2)   A new road or road extension that is intended to be dedicated to
the State Highways Administration shall meet all requirements of such agency.
   (G)   Private road design and construction standards. (See the definition of
“road” in §
159.016). Any new road or road extension that is not intended to be dedicated
to the state or the county shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Right-of-way width.
         (a)   A new or extension of a private road shall have a minimum right-
of-way width of 50 feet, except such minimum width shall be 30 feet for a
segment of a road that will clearly serve a maximum total of 10 or fewer
dwelling units. (Note: as of 1996, a road is required to have a minimum right-
of-way width of 50 feet to be eligible for dedication.) The road right-of-way
may also be used for utilities.
         (b)   An additional construction easement shall be established if the
construction of the road will require grading beyond the right-of-way width.
         (c)   Any newly established right-of-way line shall be maintained at a
minimum distance of 5 feet from the cartway, including around any turn lanes,
cul-de-sacs and intersections.
         (d)   If an extended or new private road is proposed within an
existing right-of-way that does not comply with these minimum width standards,
the extension or new road shall be approved only if a waiver is granted in
accordance with this chapter. In reviewing the waiver application, the Planning
Commission shall consider the comments of the Subdivision Administrator and the
County Engineer.
      (2)   Cartway width. A new or extended private road shall be constructed
with the following minimum widths, based upon the total number of dwelling
units that the Planning Commission determines could eventually be served by
such road:
         (a)   In a portion of the county that is not regulated by a zoning
ordinance, all lots shall be considered commercial or industrial lots for the
purposes of these road width requirements, unless deed restrictions will
prohibit principal commercial and industrial uses on all new lots. Home
occupation businesses that are accessory to a dwelling may be permitted.
         (b)   If the road could eventually serve 20 or more dwelling units, or
2 or more commercial or industrial lots, then a minimum cartway width of 18
feet shall be required, with 2 feet wide shoulders on each side.
         (c)   If the road could eventually serve only 6 to 19 dwelling units,
then a minimum cartway width of 16 feet shall be required, with 1 foot wide
shoulders on each side.
         (d)   If the road could eventually serve only 3 to 5 dwelling units,
then a minimum cartway width of 12 feet shall be required, with no shoulders.
         (e)   If a cartway serves only 1 or 2 residential lots or dwelling
units or a single commercial or industrial lot, it shall be considered to be a
driveway, not a road. When a third residential or second commercial or
industrial lot is added, the subdivider shall upgrade the driveway to minimum
private road standards for the entire length of the driveway to the nearest
intersecting road.
         (f)   If a road will need to accommodate on-street parking, then the
minimum shoulder width shall be increased to a total of 8 feet on each side
that parking is to be permitted. The Planning Commission may also require
additional shoulder widths where necessary for public safety, such as around a
sharp curve.
      (3)   Road construction standards. All road pavements shall consist of
the following construction, unless the following standard may be revised by the
Planning Commission by resolution, and except as provided in subsection (G)(6):
         (a)   Stone. All roads shall be constructed on a rolled and compacted
subgrade free of organic matter. A well-graded crushed stone aggregate, or
other appropriate stone pre-approved by the County Engineer, shall be used. The
stone shall be placed and rolled in a moist condition so that fines remain
mixed with the more coarse material. The gravel surface shall be smooth,
uniform and tightly packed to result in a minimum 6 inches of depth, laid in 2
courses of 3 inches each. The Planning Commission may approve alternate road
surfaces under §
159.006, such as reducing requirements if a stone subsurface is present.
         (b)   Paving/tar and chip. Any segment of a road that will serve
traffic from 20 or more dwelling units, or 2 or more commercial or industrial
lots, or dwellings at an average density of 3 or more dwelling units per acre
shall also be paved with asphalt or tar and chip. The roads shall be
constructed in the same manner as described in subsection (a) above. Then, 1 of
the following methods shall be used:
            1.   A plant-mixed bituminous material rolled smooth to a depth of
at least 2 inches shall be applied to a well drained base; or
            2.   Triple coat tar and chip surface as follows: first, suitable
stone shall be spread, rolled and compacted; then emulsified asphalt shall be
applied; then additional suitable stone shall be spread, rolled and compacted;
then emulsified asphalt shall be applied; then additional suitable stone shall
be applied.
         (c)   Shoulders. Required shoulders shall be constructed of a minimum
of 3 inches of crusher run stone, unless the Planning Commission determines
that an acceptable stone sub-surface is present.
         (d)   Multiple subdivisions along a road.  The following provisions
apply to private roads and private road extensions built after July 1, 1997.
            1.   If a private road is built as part of 1 subdivision, and then
a second subdivision is submitted that will use the same private road, and the
addition of the second subdivision would cause the road to be required to be
improved to a higher standard under this division (G), then the applicant for
the second subdivision shall be required to improve the entire length of the
private road to the higher standard.
            2.   If an applicant would be required by this subsection (e) to
make unreasonable improvements considering the number of proposed lots, or
cannot gain permission to make improvements along a certain road segment, then
the Planning Commission may grant a modification under §
159.006. For example, the Planning Commission may permit an applicant to only
be responsible for improvements of road frontage along his/her subdivision, as
opposed to the entire length of road that serves traffic from his/her
subdivision.
      (4)   Road slopes.
         (a)   Proposed roads shall be adjusted to the contour of the land to
produce usable lots and reasonably sloped roads, while minimizing grading.
         (b)   A maximum slope of 12%shall apply to any private road, except: a
maximum slope of 14% shall be permitted for a road that will eventually serve a
total maximum of only 10 dwelling units, provided that all segments of such
road with a slope greater than 12% are paved with asphalt or triple coat tar
and chip, as specified in subsection (e) above.
         (c)   If road construction plans indicate that the slope of a proposed
road is 10% or greater, “as built” measurements shall be submitted with
verification from a licensed engineer to confirm that the built grade of the
road does not exceed the maximum allowed slope. The as-built verification shall
be submitted prior to release of improvement bonds.
      (5)   Radii and sight distance.
         (a)    New or extended private roads in any subdivision that could
eventually serve 40 or more dwelling units shall adhere to the standards
established in the AASHTO's latest publication of Geometric Design of Highways
and Streets. All roads shall be designed to meet a minimum design speed of 20
mph or greater and all roads shall be posted with the speed limit of design.
         (b)   New or extended private roads in any subdivision that could
eventually serve up to a maximum of 39 dwelling units shall adhere to the
standards established in the AASHTO'S latest publication of Geometric Design of
Very Low-Volume Local Roads (ADT < 400). All roads shall be designed to meet a
minimum design speed of 15 mph or greater and all such roads shall be posted
with the speed limit of design.
      (6)   Roads serving over 100 dwelling units. A new or extended segment of
a road that provides the primary means of access for 100 or more dwelling units
shall be built to the same minimum cartway width, cartway construction, cartway
slope and right-of-way width requirements as would apply to a county road,
regardless of whether the road would be public or private.
      (7)   Vertical curves. New private roads shall have minimum vertical
curves as specified in AASHTO standards for geometric design of highways and
streets.
   (H)   Additional standards for public and private roads.
      (1)   Roads shall be graded, improved and surfaced to the grades and
dimensions shown on plans approved by the county.
      (2)   The finished road surface shall be crowned or superelevated to
provide proper drainage.
      (3)   Any cut, fill or grading adjacent to roads shall result in stable
slopes considering the material involved, and that are protected against
erosion. All trenches shall be properly filled and compacted.
   (I)   Sight distance.
      (1)   At any intersection with a private road of another private road(s),
or the intersection of a private road with a driveway serving 2 or more
principal commercial or industrial uses, a clear sight triangle shall be
provided as follows:
         (a)   At the intersection of 2 or more private roads where any of the
intersecting roads are designed to serve 40 or more dwelling units, the sight
triangle shall adhere to the standards established in the AASHTO's latest
publication of Geometric Design of Highways and Streets.
         (b)   At the intersection of 2 more private roads, where all of the
intersecting roads are designed to serve up to a maximum of 39 dwelling units,
the sight triangle shall adhere to the standards established in the AASHTO's
latest publication of Geometric Design of Very Low-Volume Local Roads (ADT
<400).
      (2)   At any intersection of a private road with a public county road or
the intersection of a public county road with a driveway serving a principal
commercial or industrial use, the intersection shall comply with the County
Entrance Requirements.
      (3)   At any intersection of a private road with a public state road or
the intersection of a public state road with a driveway serving a principal
commercial or industrial use The intersection shall comply with the State
Highway Entrance Requirements.
   (J)   Alternative access; turnarounds.
      (1)   Where feasible and reasonable, the Planning Commission may require
that a development proposed to be served by a dead-end road longer than 1,500
feet shall include an internal loop in the road, a second entrance point to an
exterior road and/or an entryway limited to access by emergency vehicles. The
Planning Commission may also require that a subdivision include appropriate
road improvements or alternative access to prevent homes from being
inaccessible by vehicles during flood conditions.
      (2)   Appropriate turnarounds shall be provided at the end of any road.
If a road serves 10 or less dwelling units, it may be served with a hammerhead
turnaround designed to comply with either of turnaround designs shown below.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1582.jpg]
 
   Figure 1. Turnaround Designs
      (3)   Once a dead-end portion of a road serves more than 10 dwelling
units, it shall be provided with a cul-de-sac turnaround. Private cul-de-sac
roads must be provided with a turn-around with a minimum cartway radius of 25
feet to the edge of the cartway. If the private cul-de-sac turnaround area has
a center island, the paved travel lane shall have a minimum width of 20 feet. A
cul-de-sac on a public road shall meet the county roads ordinance.
      (4)   The circular cartway of the cul-de-sac shall be connected to the
approach paving by an arc having a radius of not less than 20 feet.
      (5)   The Planning Commission may permit acceptable alternative turn-
around designs, including a turn-arounds of acceptable radii incorporated into
a parking court or a landscaped island within a cul-de-sac.
      (6)   Temporary stub roads shall be required to include at least a
temporary turnaround, if the stub would be longer than 150 feet or serve 4 or
more dwellings or lots.
      (7)   The maximum cross slope on the circular part of a cul-de-sac shall
be 7%.
   (K)   Modifications of road requirements. Section
159.006 provides the Planning Commission with the authority to grant
modifications and exceptions to the requirements of this chapter.
      (1)   In addition to those standards, the Planning Commission may also
grant modifications and exceptions to the road requirements of this chapter if:
         (a)   The required road improvements would have severe negative
impacts upon the scenic character and natural resources of an area;
         (b)   The required road improvements would provide little benefit
because a relatively short segment of road would be improved at the end of a
long segment of road built to a much lower standard, and/or
         (c)   The required road improvements would represent an unreasonable
hardship considering the expense of the improvements compared to the number of
lots that would be developed.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may also permit road improvements to be
completed in logical phases that are tied to specified phases of construction
of buildings or sale of lots.
   (L)   Right-of-way reservation for proposed roads.
      (1)   When land in a subdivision is within the area of a future county or
state road right-of-way which is proposed in the Comprehensive Plan or in the
county's or state's capital program, the county may require that the land be
reserved.
      (2)   The following conditions apply to land reserved pursuant to this
section:
         (a)   The subdivision shall be designed so that the reserved land will
be available for purchase by the county or state.
         (b)   No reservation shall continue for longer than 3 years from the
date of recordation of the plat except with written approval of all legal and
equitable owners of the property.
         (c)   The period of time for which the land is reserved shall be
specified on the recorded plat.
         (d)   The reserved land may be included within the area of lots in a
subdivision as long as that area is not used to satisfy minimum lot size or lot
width requirements and is not used for buildings.

§ 159.112 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES.
   (A)   The Planning Commission may require a traffic impact study prior to
preliminary plat approval if the Planning Director or County Engineer recommend
such a study for:
      (1)   A subdivision of 50 or more lots or dwelling units; or,
      (2)   A major subdivision with fewer than 50 lots or dwelling units if
the Planning Director or the County Engineer recommends a traffic study based
on:
         (a)   The site's proximity to a county road where traffic, geometric
or safety concerns exist which may be worsened by the proposed subdivision or
development; or
         (b)   The cumulative impact of successive subdivisions that result in
50 or more lots or dwelling units in adjacent subdivisions.
   (B)   A traffic impact study will not be required by the county if the
Maryland State Highway Administration requires a Traffic Impact Study for the
development based upon its impact on a state road.
   (C)   The applicant is responsible for preparing and providing the traffic
impact study, and for all data collection efforts required, including peak
period volume and turning movement counts. In addition, the applicant is
responsible for ensuring that any submitted development plans meet the minimum
county standards for geometric design. Traffic counts available from the MD
State Highway Administration, other recent traffic impact studies performed for
the county, and other available sources may be used to avoid the need to
conduct traffic counts.
   (D)   The study shall be conducted only by a professional engineer with
verifiable experience or training in traffic engineering.
   (E)   Prior to preparing a Traffic Impact Study, the applicant shall meet
with the county to review and discuss the overall project, development activity
in the area, other prior traffic impact studies (if applicable), and other
critical points related to the satisfactory completion of the Study. The
applicant, the engineer and the county must mutually agree upon the study
limits, based on engineering judgment and an understanding of existing traffic
conditions.
   (F)   Upon submission of a draft Study, the county may review the data
sources, methods and findings, and provide written comments. The applicant
shall incorporate necessary revisions and submit a final Study.
   (G)   Traffic Impact Studies for county roads and intersections shall be
prepared using the procedures and standards required for state roads as
published in the Maryland State Highway Access Manual, Appendix E, Guidelines
for Traffic Impact Reports/Studies, or equivalent documents published by the
State Highway Administration.
   (H)   Improvements to roads.
      (1)   Improvements that are found to be necessary based upon the results
of the Traffic Impact Study shall be included on the preliminary and final
plats and constructed by the applicant if the road is fronting on or within the
proposed subdivision or development site. If the applicant owns property on
only 1 side of the road, the applicant shall make road improvements as feasible
within the available right-of-way.
      (2)   The Planning Commission, with a recommendations from the Director
of Planning and Land Development and the County Roads Engineer, may require the
applicant to construct the following off-site road improvements or pay the cost
of such construction:
         (a)   If the subdivision has frontage on or any point of access to a
public road, improvements to the public road extending up to 250 feet beyond
the subdivision frontage or access point, or to the nearest intersection with
another public road, whichever is less.
         (b)   If the subdivision has frontage only on private roads,
improvements to the nearest intersecting public road, extending up to 250 feet
beyond the intersection with the private road proving access to the
subdivision.
         (c)   Such off-site road improvements may be required if the necessary
rights-of-way exist or have been acquired by the developer or the county; and
the off-site improvements are necessary to make the required improvements
functional or to provide for safe traffic movements.
      (3)   Off-site improvements required of the applicant shall be
proportional to the impact of the proposed subdivision or development on levels
of traffic on the impacted county road. In lieu of making improvements, the
county may require that the applicant contribute to the cost of a county
capital project to make the necessary improvements.
(Res. 2010-5, passed 5-25-2010)
§ 159.113 DRIVEWAYS.
   (A)   Minimum width. A driveway is a cartway that provides access to a
public road for 1 or 2 residential lots or principal dwelling units or a single
commercial or industrial lot. A driveway shall have a minimum width of 10 feet
to provide access for fire trucks and ambulances.
   (B)   State roads. A state highway permit is required for all access onto or
work within the right-of-way of a state road. Where applicable, the issuance of
such permit shall be an automatic condition of final subdivision approval.
   (C)   Driveway slopes. Slopes of driveways shall be minimized so as to
accommodate access by emergency vehicles as provided in division (E) below.
Generally, driveway slopes should not exceed 15% for any horizontal distance
longer than 25 feet, except that the first 20 feet of a driveway from the
entrance to a road shall have a maximum slope of 10%.
   (D)   Drainage. The developer shall make adequate provisions to maintain
uninterrupted parallel drainage along a road where intersected by a driveway.
   (E)   Emergency access. The Subdivision Administrator may require an
applicant to provide a statement on a subdivision plan regarding whether or not
it will be possible to construct driveways on new lots that will be suitable
for emergency access. Proposed driveway should be sufficient in width, slope,
height clearance, weight limit, turning radius and drainage to provide adequate
access for fully loaded fire trucks and ambulances. Generally a 10 feet minimum
horizontal clearance and a 12 feet minimum vertical clearance should be
maintained.
      (1)   A review by emergency service providers may be requested.
      (2)   The county does not accept responsibility to guarantee that such
access will be possible.
   (F)   Sight distance. Driveway entrances onto roads shall be located to
maximize sight distances of oncoming traffic. See also State Highway
Administration requirements for entrances onto a state road, and county roads
ordinance requirements for entrances onto a county road.

§ 159.115 SANITARY SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   (A)   In general. All subdivisions shall be served with an approved and
adequate sewage disposal system (either on-lot or central) that will meet state
and county regulations.
   (B)   Central sewage service.
      (1)   If a municipality or a sanitary district is to provide the central
sewage service, the agency shall have the authority to approve or reject the
proposed sewage collection system for just cause.
      (2)   In order for central sewage service to qualify as “county-approved
central sewage service,” for the purposes of permitted reduced lot sizes, all
of the following requirements must be met:
         (a)   A municipality or a sanitary district must have agreed in
writing to operate and maintain
the sewage system.

§ 159.116 WATER SUPPLY SYSTEMS AND FIRE HYDRANTS.
   (A)   In general. All subdivisions shall be served with an adequate on-lot
or central water supply system that will meet state and county requirements.
   (B)   Central water service.
      (1)   Required connections to central water systems. The Planning
Commission, after requesting any recommendations of the County Engineer and the
appropriate water supplier, may require all lots and principal uses within a
subdivision to be connected to an existing central water system where the
Planning Commission determines that the connection would be feasible, cost-
effective and reasonable, considering the distances that the lines would need
to be extended and any available estimates of average cost per dwelling or lot.
      (2)   County-approved central water system. For the purposes of
permitting reduced lot sizes under Article 3 or an applicable zoning ordinance,
the term “county-approved central water system” shall mean a central water
system that is currently operated by a municipality or sanitary district, or
that meets all of the following standards:
         (a)   The system is constructed to proper standards that would allow
it to be incorporated into a public water system in the future.
         (b)   The subdivision plan states that the water system will be
offered to dedication to a municipal or sanitary district water system in the
future, if feasible.
         (c)   If the system will not be immediately dedicated to a public
water system, then the applicant proves that there will be a suitable process
to make sure there will be proper long-term operation and maintenance, such as
a long-term contract with a professional operator.
      (3)   Water supplier approval. Proposed extensions of existing central
water systems shall meet all applicable design approvals, construction
inspections and other requirements of the existing system. The extension shall
be approved by such agency prior to final plan approval, although specific
detailed service agreements are not required to be signed until prior to
recording.
      (4)   Non-public supplier. Any new central water system not owned by a
sanitary district or municipality shall be found to be acceptable in capacity,
pressure, design and construction by the Planning Commission, based upon review
of the County Engineer. The Planning Commission may deny permission for a
subdivision to be served by a non-public central water system if the system
cannot guarantee sufficient water pressure and capacity.
   (C)   On-lot water system (wells). When a subdivision will not be connected
to a central water system, acceptable locations for on-lot water systems shall
be shown on subdivision plans and shall be constructed in accordance with
regulations of the state. A well may be located on commonly owned land if
approved as part of the subdivision, and if appropriate easements are
established.
   (D)   Fire hydrants. Where the County Engineer determines that it would be
feasible to provide appropriate water supply and pressure, the Planning
Commission may require that a subdivision served by a public water system
provide fire hydrants so that all dwelling units and principal buildings are
within 600 feet of a fire hydrant.

§ 159.117 UTILITIES AND UTILITY EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Utilities. The subdivider shall extend all electric power and
telephone lines to a lot line of each lot prior to the sale of that lot, or
establish that a good faith effort was made to have the lines extended. All
utilities shall be installed in accordance with the current standards of the
utility serving the subdivision. The county staff may withhold issuance of a
building permit for a new dwelling until electric service will be available to
such lot. Electric service is not required to be extended if a lot will be
transferred to a person who will not use electric service for religious
reasons.
   (B)   Easements. Drainage, utility, emergency access and other types of
easements shall be provided as determined to be needed by the county and as
indicated on the plans.
      (1)   Separation. Minimum separation distances between utility lines
shall be as required by the applicable utility or as deemed necessary by the
Planning Commission based upon advice of the County Engineer.
      (2)   Easements shall be placed along lot lines or road rights-of-ways,
to the maximum extent possible, as opposed to the center of a lot.
      (3)   Maintenance and obstructions. The owner of the lot shall properly
maintain an easement or right-of-way in such a condition that does not inhibit
its intended purpose(s). Specifically, structures or grading that could alter
or obstruct stormwater flows in violation of the approved final plan shall be
prohibited within storm water easements.

§ 159.120 GUIDELINES TO PROTECT TREES.
   Reasonable efforts should be taken during construction to maximize the
protection of trees. Care is needed not only to minimize the cutting of trees,
but also to avoid accidental damage that will cause trees to eventually die.
Measures should be used to make sure that equipment does not damage tree
trunks, that roots are not compacted by vehicles and that the grade level
around trees is not changed by more than 6 inches. Temporary wooden barricades
or wire fencing should be placed below the “dripline” of trees to protect the
root system from being compacted by vehicles or material storage.

§ 159.159 GENERAL PARKING REGULATIONS FOR PRDS.
   (A)   Existing parking. Structures and uses in existence within a PRD at the
effective date of this chapter shall not be subject to the requirements of this
subchapter so long as the kind or extent of use is not changed, provided that
any parking facility now serving the structures or uses shall not in the future
be reduced to an amount less than that required by this chapter.
   (B)   Changes in use. Whenever a building or use within a PRDis changed or
enlarged in floor area, number of employees, number of dwellings, seating
capacity or otherwise to create a need, based upon the requirements of the
required off-road parking spaces table for an increase of 10% or more in the
number of existing parking spaces, the number of additional spaces to be
provided shall be based upon the incremental change or enlargement.
   (C)   Conflict with other uses. No parking area shall be used for any other
use that interferes with its availability for the parking need it is required
to serve.
   (D)   Continuing character of obligation. All required parking facilities
shall be provided and maintained so long as the use which the facilities were
designed to serve still exists. Off-road parking facilities shall not be
reduced in total extent except when the reduction is in conformity with the
requirements of this subchapter in conjunction with a change in the nature of
the use.
   (E)   Joint use.
      (1)   Two or more uses may provide for required parking in a common
parking lot. The total number of spaces in such lot shall not be less than the
sum of the spaces required for each use individually, unless such lot is
provided as specified in subsection (2).
      (2)   Up to 50% of the parking spaces required for a) theaters,
auditoriums, bowling alleys or private clubs, and up to 100% of the parking
spaces required for churches or meeting halls, may be provided collectively and
used jointly by b) banks, offices, retail stores, repair shops, service
establishments and similar uses not normally open, used or operated during the
same hours as those listed in a) provided, however, that a written agreement
assuring the continued availability of the parking areas shall be properly
drawn and executed by the parties concerned, approved as to legal sufficiency
by the County Attorney, and filed with the application for the building permit.
   (F)   Mixed uses.  Where a permitted use contains or includes more than 1 of
the types of uses identified in the required off-road parking spaces table, the
number of parking spaces required shall be the sum of the computed requirements
for the separate types of uses.
   (G)   Location of parking spaces. Required off-road parking spaces shall be
on the same lot or premises with the principal use served, or where this
requirement cannot be met, within 400 feet walking distance of the principal
use.
   (H)   Fractional spaces. Where the computation of required parking spaces
results in a fractional number, only the fraction of one-half or more shall be
counted as 1.

   (E)   Variances. Upon appeal from a decision by the Licensing and
Enforcement Manager, the Board shall have the power to vary or adapt the strict
application of any of the requirements of this chapter in the case of
exceptional physical conditions whereby the strict applications would result in
practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship depriving the owner of the
reasonable use of land or building as a transient vacation rental, but in no
other case.
      (1)   No variance to the provisions of this chapter shall be granted by
the Board unless the Board finds that the appellant establishes and
substantiates that all the following requirements and standards are satisfied.
         (a)   That the variance will not be contrary to the public interest.
         (b)   That a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result in
either practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship.
         (c)   That the granting of the variance would be in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of this chapter, and would not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
         (d)   The special circumstances or conditions (described in the
findings of fact) are peculiar to the transient vacation rental unit for which
the variance is sought, and are not the result of any action taken by the
applicant.
         (e)   1.   That because of the special circumstances or conditions,
the literal application of the provisions of this chapter would deprive the
applicant of the reasonable use of such land or building as a transient
vacation rental unit or create unnecessary hardship or create practical
difficulty.
            2.   It shall not be considered sufficient proof of hardship to
show that greater profit would result if the variance were awarded.
Furthermore, hardship complained of cannot be self-created; it cannot be
claimed by one who purchases with or without the knowledge of restrictions; it
must result from the application of the ordinance; it must be suffered directly
by the property in question; and evidence of variance granted under similar
circumstances shall not be considered.
      (2)   The Board may establish such conditions and safeguards that it
deems necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the regulation or
provisions to which the variance applies.

and Enforcement Manager within 30 days after the date of the Licensing and
Enforcement Manager's decision; provided however, that the Board may waive the
time limit if the appellant demonstrates good cause for doing so. All appeals
and applications made to the Board shall be in writing on standard forms
prescribed by the Board.

provisions of this chapter shall exactly set forth the interpretation that is
claimed by the appellant to be the correct interpretation.

chapter shall include a copy of the license application denied by the Licensing
and Enforcement Manager together with a statement containing any relevant
supporting arguments regarding the requirements listed in division (E).

interpretation will automatically terminate if a second application or appeal
concerning the same property is filed with the Licensing and Enforcement
Manager by the same applicant before the Licensing and Enforcement Board of
Appeals has reached its decision on the first application.

filed with the Licensing and Enforcement Manager for a variance or an appeal
from alleged error of the Licensing and Enforcement Manager, the Board shall
fix a reasonable time (not less than 14 days nor more than 45 days from the

determination appealed from and make such order, requirement, decision or
determination as ought to be made in conformity with the Zoning Code and this
chapter, and to that end shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the
appeal is taken.
      (2)   In making its decisions pursuant to the authority conferred by this
chapter, the Board shall study the specific property involved, as well as the
neighborhood, and consider all testimony and data submitted, and shall hear any
person desiring to speak for or against the issuance of the transient vacation
rental unit license. The application for a license shall not be approved where
the Board finds that the proposed use as a transient vacation rental unit would
adversely affect the public health, safety, security, morals or general
welfare, or would result in dangerous traffic conditions, or would jeopardize
the lives or property of people living in the neighborhood.
   (I)   Decision. A decision of the Board permitting the licensing of the
transient vacation rental unit shall be valid for a period of 1 year, unless
such use is established within said period; except that, where the use is

CHAPTER 163: AGRICULTURAL LAND PRESERVATION DISTRICT
Section
   
163.01   General
   
163.02   Program summary
   
163.03   Agricultural preservation districts
   
163.04   Terminations and alteration of districts
§ 163.01 GENERAL.
   The Maryland General Assembly created the Maryland Agricultural Land
Preservation Program to preserve productive agricultural land and woodland that
provides for the continued production of food and fiber for the citizens of the
state. The Board of County Commissioners supports this policy and wishes to
assist in preserving productive agricultural land and woodland by creating its
own agricultural district program. The county's district program is intended to
screen and pre-qualify landowners eligible for participation in the State's
easement program and to encourage landowners to participate in the preservation
program by allowing qualifying district owners to participate in the Garrett
County Agricultural Tax Credit program adopted July 6, 2000.
(Res. 2009-1, passed 1-13-2009)
§ 163.02 PROGRAM SUMMARY.
   (A)   Like the Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Program, the Garrett
County Agricultural Land Preservation District program is voluntary on the part
of landowners. The Board of County Commissioners has appointed a local
agricultural preservation advisory board to assist in the creation of
agricultural preservation districts where the subdivision and development of
land is restricted by agreement between the landowner and Garrett County, and
where agricultural and woodland production activities are encouraged and
protected. If a landowner requests that his property be included in a district,
that property must meet minimum criteria as established by the Maryland
Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation ("the Foundation") and this chapter.
If an easement has not been sold to the Foundation, a landowner may terminate
after 3 years his property's inclusion in a district. Notice to terminate may
be given at any time after the 3-year term.
   (B)   A landowner who includes his land within a district will receive the
following benefits:
      (1)   Direct and indirect support of agriculture;
      (2)   Insulation of normal agricultural activities from nuisance
complaints;
      (3)   Eligibility to apply for an agricultural land tax credit; and
      (4)   Eligibility to make an application to sell an agricultural land
conservation easement to the Foundation.
(Res. 2009-1, passed 1-13-2009)
§ 163.03 AGRICULTURAL PRESERVATION DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Conditions for establishment.
      (1)   To establish a district, a landowner shall:
         (a)   File a petition as provided under division (B) of this section;
and
         (b)   If the petition is approved as provided under this regulation,
execute a district agreement in the form prescribed by the county, agreeing,
among other things, that the following covenants, conditions and restrictions
contained in it run with the land covered by the agreement for so long as the
agreement remains in effect:
            1.   The landowner agrees to keep the land in agricultural use in a
district for, except as otherwise permitted by law, a minimum period of 3 years
from the date the district agreement is recorded in the land records of the
county;
            2.   The landowner agrees not to use the land for any commercial,
industrial, or residential purpose, except as otherwise permitted by Md. Code,
§ 2-513;
            3.   The landowner agrees not to subdivide the land for any purpose
unless the county first has approved the proposed subdivision and the
subdivision is consistent with the policies and requirements of the Maryland
Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation easement program; and
            4.   The landowner agrees not to construct buildings or structures
on the land that are not designed or intended to be used for agricultural
purposes unless the county first has approved the proposed construction.
      (2)   The Maryland Agricultural Land Preservation Foundation will
continue to process applications for the sale of easements on agricultural land
under Md. Code, Title 15, Subtitle 15 and may only purchase an easement on land
in a district.
   (B)   Petition for establishment.
      (1)   One or more owners of land actively devoted to agricultural use
within the county may voluntarily file a petition with the county governing
body requesting the establishment of an agricultural preservation district
composed of the land owned by the petitioners.
      (2)   The petition shall include a general description of each land
parcel including acreage and the current use of the land and shall be
accompanied by a map or plat of each subject parcel at a scale no smaller than
1 inch equals 600 feet (copy of tax map will meet requirement).
      (3)   The petition also shall be accompanied by a district agreement for
each subject parcel signed by the landowner or landowners.
      (4)   The petition and district agreement shall be submitted to the
county governing body.
   (C)   Agricultural preservation district establishment - procedures.
      (1)   Referral of petition.
         (a)   Upon receipt of a petition to establish an agricultural
preservation district, the county governing body shall refer the petition and
accompanying materials to both the Agricultural Preservation Advisory Board and
to the County Planning Commission.
         (b)   Within 60 days of the referral of a petition, the Agricultural
Preservation Advisory Board shall inform the county governing body whether the
land in the proposed district meets the qualifications established by the
county under division (D) of this section, and whether the advisory board
recommends establishment of the district.
         (c)   Within 60 days of the referral of a petition, the County
Planning Commission shall inform the county governing body whether
establishment of the district is compatible with existing and approved county
plans, programs, and overall county policy, and whether the Planning Commission
recommends establishment of the district. In the process of review, the County
Planning Commission shall consider compatibility of district establishment with
state and local plans and programs.
      (2)   If either the Agricultural Preservation Advisory Board or the
Planning Commission recommends approval, the county governing body shall hold a
public hearing on the petition. Adequate notice of the hearing shall be given
to all landowners in the proposed district and to landowners adjacent to the
proposed district. If neither body recommends approval of the petition, the
local governing body shall deny the petition and notify the landowner or
landowners stating the reasons for the denial.
      (3)   Approval of petition.
         (a)   Within 120 days after the receipt of the petition, the county
governing body shall render a decision on whether the petition is approved.
         (b)   If the county governing body decides to approve the petition,
this body shall so notify the Foundation.
      (4)   If the county governing body approves the petition, the
agricultural preservation district shall be established by the county governing
body. However, the establishment may not take effect until all parties have
executed agricultural preservation district agreements and until these
agreements have been recorded in the land records of the county. The county
shall record the agreements.
      (5)   The establishment of a district does not grant the public any right
of access or right of use of subject properties.
   (D)   Agricultural preservation districts - qualifying criteria.
      (1)   Productive capability criteria.
         (a)   Agricultural preservation districts shall consist of land that
is either used primarily for the production of food or fiber or is of such open
space character and productive capability that continued agricultural
production is feasible.
         (b)   Soils criteria:
            1.   The majority of the land area of any district shall consist of
U.S.D.A. Soil Capability Classes I, II and III;
            2.   The majority of the land area of any district shall consist of
U.S.D.A. Woodland Groups 1 and 2 which are applied to wooded areas only;
            3.   The majority of the land area of any district less the acreage
contained within the 100-year floodplain as delineated on Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps produced by the Federal Emergency Management Administration and state or
federal designated wetlands shall consist of U.S.D.A. Soil Capability Classes
I, II and III on cropland and pasture or Woodland Groups 1 and 2 on wooded
areas only;
            4.   A minimum of 60% of the land area of any district shall
consist of U.S.D.A. Soil Capability Classes I, II and III on cropland and
pasture and Woodland Groups 1 and 2 on woodland areas; or
            5.   A minimum of 60% of the land area of any district less the
acreage contained within the 100-year floodplain and state or federal wetlands
shall consist of U.S.D.A. Soil Capability Classes I, II, and III on cropland
and pasture and Woodland Groups 1 and 2 on wooded areas.
         (c)   Exceptions to division (D)(l)(b)1. - 5. of this section may
include land areas of lower soil capabilities, but with a rating similar to
Classes I, II and III on cropland and pasture and Woodland Groups I and II on
woodland areas. Land with lower soil capabilities may qualify to be in a
district if the soils on the applicant's farm otherwise comply with all the
requirements of this section and the applicant submits to the county a letter
from the appropriate U.S. Department of Agriculture district conservationist
that states that the soils on the applicant's farm have a cropland or pasture
rating similar to Classes I, II and III, or Woodland Groups I and II. Farm
areas with extensive specialized production, including but not limited to
dairying livestock, poultry, fruit or berry production may also be considered
by the county to be included in a district.
      (2)   District size criteria.  An agricultural preservation district
shall be 50 contiguous acres. However, a parcel of less than 50 acres may
qualify as a district if:
         (a)   It adjoins a 50 acre parcel which has been approved by the
county as an agricultural preservation district;
         (b)   It is added to 1 or more adjoining parcels which together have
been approved by the county as agricultural preservation districts;
         (c)   The land has extraordinary agricultural capability as provided
by division (D)(5) of this section and is of significant size; or
         (d)   It adjoins land subject to a recorded instrument which permits
agricultural activities and contains restrictions that are the same as or more
stringent than those found in the Foundation's deed of easement and the
collective mass of these lands total at least 50 acres.
      (3)   Location criteria. Land within the boundaries of a 10-year water
and sewerage service district may be included in an agricultural preservation
district only if that land is outstanding in productivity and is of significant
size. Note: Refer to County Water and Sewerage Plan.
      (4)   Agricultural land which is otherwise qualified for district
establishment and is comprised predominantly of land of lower general
capability also may meet minimum qualifying criteria if the following
conditions are met to the satisfaction of the county.
         (a)   The Agricultural Preservation Advisory Board of the county shall
obtain general information from the Agricultural Extension Agent and specific
written information from the soil conservation district in the county, and such
other sources as might be applicable, addressing the long-term productivity of
the land and farm management practices, and shall forward this documentation to
the local governing body; and
         (b)   The Agricultural Preservation Advisory Board shall state in its
recommendations, with the advice of the applicable soil conservation district,
that an approved soil conservation plan is being implemented.
      (5)   For the purpose of this chapter, land has "extraordinary
agricultural capability" if it:
         (a)   Has a soil conservation plan approved by a local soil
conservation district, fully implemented according to a schedule in the plan;
         (b)   Is located in an area designated by the county for agricultural
preservation;
         (c)   Is recommended by the majority of the local advisory board after
an on-site inspection is conducted by 1 or more members; and
         (d)   Meets either of the following:
            1.   Has at least 60% of the land area consisting of U.S.D.A. Soil
Capability Classes I, II and III, or U.S.D.A. Woodland Groups 1 and 2 which are
applied to wooded areas only; or
            2.   Has a minimum of 72% of the land area less any acreage
included within the 100-year floodplain and less any acreage included in state
or federal wetlands consisting of a combination of U.S.D.A. Soils, Class I, II
and III on cropland and pasture and Woodland Groups 1 and 2 on wooded areas.
   (E)   Additions to existing districts. The procedures for adding land to
existing districts shall be the same as for the initial establishment of
districts. There are no minimum size criteria for the addition of land parcels
contiguous to an agricultural preservation district.
   (F)   Exclusion of lots in districts.
      (1)   A landowner may request to have excluded from a district certain
portions of the owner's property, constituting lots of either 1 acre or less,
or when permitted, 2 acres or less if the purpose for excluding the property is
to construct a dwelling house for the owner or the owner's children.
      (2)   A landowner may request to have up to 3 building lots excluded from
a district. The number of lots allowed to be excluded shall be computed based
upon the total farm acres at the rate of 1 lot for 20 to 69.99 acres; 2 lots
for 70 to 119.99 acres; and 3 lots for over 120 acres.
      (3)   In reviewing the landowner's request, the county shall examine the:
         (a)   Location of the lot to be excluded; and
         (b)   Potential impact the lot's exclusion may have on the
agricultural use of the remaining property.
   (G)   Continuation of districts. Agricultural districts shall continue in
effect indefinitely unless terminated in accord with any of the procedures
provided in §
163.04.
   (H)   Access. In determining questions about easements, rights-of-way,
licenses, and other similar servitudes in land subject to a district agreement,
the county shall follow the same rules that are applicable to the establishment
of these servitudes in land subject to a preservation easement set forth under
Regulation 17F of COMAR, Title 15, Department of Agriculture, Subtitle 15,
Chapter 01.
(Res. 2009-1, passed 1-13-2009)
