with the purchasing power of the dollar, the Department for Local Government
shall compute by the second Friday in February of every year the annual

request to inspect public records may be presented by hand delivery, mail or
via facsimile, if one is available.
   (B)   If the custodian determines that a person’s request is in compliance
with this chapter and the open records law, and the requested public records
are immediately available, the custodian shall deliver the records for
inspection. A person may inspect public records at the designated office of the
city during the regular office hours, or in appropriate cases, by receiving
copies of the records through the mail.
   (C)   (1)   If the public records are to be inspected at the offices of the

POLICY PROHIBITING RACIAL PROFILING
§ 38.45 POLICY.
   The protection of, and the preservation of, the constitutional and civil
rights of individuals remains one of the paramount concerns of government, and
law enforcement in particular. To safeguard these rights, law enforcement
personnel shall not engage in any behavior or activity that constitutes racial
profiling. The decision of an officer to make a stop or detain an individual,
or conduct a search, shall not be solely motivated by consideration of race,
color or ethnicity. Stops, detentions or searches shall be based on
articulable, reasonable suspicions; observed violations of law; or probable
cause, and shall comply with accepted constitutional and legal provisions and
with the Code and Cannon of Ethics adopted by the State Law Enforcement Council
through Peace Officer Professional Standards.
(Ord. passed 8-20-2001)
§ 38.46 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   RACIAL PROFILING. A process that motivates the initiation of a stop,
detention or search which is solely motivated by consideration of an
individual’s actual or perceived race, color or ethnicity, or making
discretionary decisions during the execution of law enforcement duties based on
the above stated considerations. Nothing shall preclude an officer from relying
on an individual’s actual or perceived race, color or ethnicity as an element
in the identification of a suspect or in the investigation of a crime, a
possible crime or violation of law or statute.
(Ord. passed 8-20-2001)
§ 38.47 TRAINING.
   All officers shall complete the State Law Enforcement Council approved
training related to racial profiling. Such training shall comply with federal
law, state statutory provisions, case law and other applicable laws,
regulations and established rules.
(Ord. passed 8-20-2001)
§ 38.48 DISCIPLINE.
   An officer who violates a provision of this policy shall be subject to the
agency’s disciplinary procedures, which shall be consistent with other
penalties imposed for similar officer misconduct.
(Ord. passed 8-20-2001)
§ 38.99 PENALTY.
   (A)   Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which no
specific penalty is prescribed shall be subject to §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
   (B)   (1)   Except when another penalty is specifically set forth in §§
38.01 through
38.30, any officer or employee of the city or any city agency who is found by
the Board of Ethics to have violated any provision of §§
38.01 through
38.30 shall be deemed guilty of a civil offense and may be subject to a civil
fine imposed by the Board of Ethics not to exceed $1,000, which may be
recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of debt if the offender
fails to pay the penalty within a prescribed period of time.
      (2)   In addition to all other penalties which may be imposed under §§
38.01 through
38.30, any officer or employee of the city or any city agency who is found by
the Board of Ethics to have violated any provision of §§
38.01 through
38.30 shall forfeit to the city or the city agency an amount equal to the
economic benefit or gain which the officer or employee is determined by the
Board to have realized as a result of the violation. The amount of any
forfeiture may be recovered by the city in a civil action in the nature of
debt, if the offender fails to pay the amount of the forfeiture within a
prescribed period of time.
      (3)   In addition to all other penalties which may be imposed under §§
38.01 through
38.30, a finding by the Board of Ethics that an officer or employee of the city
or any city agency is guilty of a violation of §§
38.01 through
38.30 shall be sufficient cause for removal, suspension, demotion or other
disciplinary action by the executive authority of the city or city agency, or
by any other office or agency having the power of removal or discipline. Any
action to remove or discipline any officer or employee for a violation of §§
38.01 through
38.30 shall be taken in accordance with all applicable ordinances and
regulations of the city and all applicable laws of the commonwealth.

only shall be used, and these terms and lights shall indicate and be obeyed as
follows.
   (A)   Green alone or “Go”. Vehicular traffic facing the signal may proceed
straight through or turn right or left unless a sign at that place prohibits
either turn. However, vehicular traffic shall yield the right-of-way to other
vehicles and to pedestrians lawfully within the intersection at the time the
signal is exhibited.
   (B)   Steady yellow alone or “Caution” when shown following the green or
“Go” signal. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal is thereby warned

will be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter
the intersection. Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow signal may enter and
clear the intersection.
   (C)   Red alone or double red or “Stop”. Vehicular traffic facing the signal
shall stop before entering the nearest crosswalk at an intersection or at
another point as may be indicated by a clearly visible line, and shall remain

Way” sign shall bear the primary responsibility of safely entering the primary

purpose of controlling the direction of flow of traffic, vehicular traffic
shall move only in traffic lanes over which green arrows appear. However, when
flashing amber lights appear above a lane, all left turns shall be made from

purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official traffic device or
railroad sign or signal which attempts or purports to direct the movement of
traffic, or which conceals or hides from view or interferes with the
effectiveness of any official control device or any railroad sign or signal. No
person shall place or maintain, nor shall any public authority permit on any

tax permit has been obtained from the Department of Revenue shall be presented

   (J)   The State Fire Marshal may revoke the registration of any site which
is in violation of a requirement of this section, or any other requirement
provided pursuant to this chapter. If the violation renders any property
especially susceptible to fire loss, and there is present such hazard to human
life or limb that the public safety imperatively requires emergency action, the
State Fire Marshal may take that action, as provided in KRS 227.330(6).
   (K)   A person lawfully possessing consumer fireworks, as defined in §
93.01(B), may use those items if:
      (1)   He or she is at least 18 years of age;
      (2)   Fireworks are not ignited within 200 feet of any structure, vehicle

public places. The cable communications system shall be constructed and

safety codes.

accordance with all applicable laws, codes, ordinances, rules and regulations
of the commonwealth and the city affecting electrical installations and

simply because it shall be more convenient, economical or profitable for the
franchisee to so operate, and then only when expressly permitted, in writing,
by the City Engineer or the Mayor/Chairperson, under such conditions as he or
she shall prescribe for the public welfare, the franchisee shall not erect or
authorize or permit others to erect any poles or other facilities within the
streets of the city for conduct of its cable communications system, but shall

electric or telephone utilities shall be located underground, it shall be the
obligation of the franchisee to locate or to cause its property to be located
