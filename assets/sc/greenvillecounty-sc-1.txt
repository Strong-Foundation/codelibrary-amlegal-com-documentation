§ 2-2 SAME; SIZE, GENERALLY.
   No plat, map or drawing, or section of or amendment to any such plat, map or

set by both the City and County Planning Commissions.
(1976 Code, § 2-2) (Ord. 86, passed - -)
§ 2-3 SAME; INSTRUMENTS, AND THE LIKE, OTHER THAN PLATS OR DRAWINGS.
   The County Council has ascertained, after a thorough study, that to install
a complete and efficient microfilm system in the office of the Register of
Deeds for the county, it is necessary to limit the size of papers, instruments
and documents, to be filed or recorded in such office in accordance with such
finding, the County Council hereby determines that no instrument, paper, or
document measuring more than 8-1/2 inches by 14 inches, except a plat or
drawing, shall be received by the office of the Register of Deeds for filing or
recording.
(1976 Code, § 2-3) (Ord. 124, passed - -)

methods.
(1976 Code, § 2-4) (Ord. 86, passed - -)
§ 2-5 COLLECTION FEES AND CHARGES ON ALL PAST DUE ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   Findings. The County Council finds that numerous fees and charges due
Greenville County go unpaid and uncollected and that the county expends
resources and monies to collect these fees and charges. Furthermore, it is
unfair to the law abiding and honest citizens of Greenville County for them to
bear this additional burden to recover lawfully due accounts.
   (B)   Collection fee. Unless otherwise established by a specific ordinance
which establishes a higher collection fee, all past due accounts, exclusive of
taxes, shall be charged a $15 collection fee in addition to those amounts
already due.
   (C)   Unlawful failure to pay. It shall be unlawful for any individual,
company, corporation or other entity to fail to pay any fee or charge which is
due Greenville County. It shall be, furthermore, unlawful to fail to pay any
collection fees which shall have occurred because of a failure to timely pay
those amounts.
   (D)   Penalties. Any individual, company, corporation or other entity who
shall willfully fail to pay any fee, charge or collection fee due Greenville
County for a period of 6 months shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to
penalties not to exceed those within the jurisdictional limit of magistrate’s
court. This remedy is not exclusive and the county may pursue such other and
further relief necessary to collect the accounts.
   (E)   Exclusions. The provisions of this section shall only apply to fees
and charges created by the ordinances of Greenville County and shall not apply
to taxes, contracts or other debts that have not been created by an ordinance
of Greenville County.
(1976 Code, § 2-5) (Ord. 2113, passed 5-1-1990)
§ 2-6 WAIVER OF FEES FOR COUNTY STAFF REQUESTS.
   Fees normally charged to the public for requests, hearings, applications or
administrative action are hereby automatically waived for all requests or
applications that are requested by the staff of Greenville County.
(1976 Code, § 2-6) (Ord. 2137, passed 6-19-1990)
§ 2-7 PERFORMANCE OF MARRIAGE CEREMONIES.
   Except as provided in §
7-1(14) of this Code, any employee or official of Greenville County or any
employee of an elected official of the county who performs a marriage ceremony
during working hours or on county property is prohibited from accepting any
gratuity or fee.

member is associated, has an economic interest.
   (B)   In the event an action or vote on a transaction regulations under

§ 2-351 LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   It is the intention of the Greenville County Council to reasonably regulate
abortion in conformance with the decisions of the United States Supreme Court.
Greenville County Council does solemnly declare and find in reaffirmation of
the long standing policy of this county and state that the unborn child is a
human being from the time of conception and is, therefore, a legal person for
purposes of the unborn child’s right to life and is entitled to the right to
life at conception. County council is aware that the Supreme Court has not yet
recognized the right to life of the unborn child from conception and that this
legislation is intended to regulate to the extent allowed by the Supreme Court
decisions. However, the policy of this county is that abortions should be
prohibited in all cases unless necessary for the preservation of the mother’s
life.
   The matter of regulating abortion is not primarily a local matter. However,
since the intentions of the state legislature concerning this matter are
unclear, this article will regulate abortion in Greenville County to the extent
provided herein until the state legislature enacts legislation preempting local
regulation.
(1976 Code, § 2-351) (Ord. 2031, § 1, passed 9-5-1989)
§ 2-352 DEFINITIONS.
[For the purpose of this article, the following words and terms shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed:]
   Abortion means the termination of human pregnancy by any act, device,
instrument, procedure, medicine, prescription, or substance administered to or
prescribed for a pregnant woman by any person, including the pregnant woman,
with an intention other than delivery of a viable birth or removal of a dead
fetus.
   Child means a person under the age of 18 years old.
   Conception means the fecundation of the ovum by the spermatozoa.
   Physician means a person licensed to practice medicine in the state.
   Pregnancy means the condition of a woman carrying a fetus or embryo within
her body as a result of conception.
   Pregnant woman is any female who is pregnant.

of human beings from the moment of conception until birth at every stage of
biological development.
   Viability means that stage of human development when the fetus is

performed, such medical examinations and tests as are necessary to make a

determination of viability in the medical records of the mother or child.

2-361   Findings
   
2-362   County policy and prohibitions
§ 2-361 FINDINGS.
   The Greenville County Council hereby finds the following:
   A.   Acting through the United States Constitution, the people created
government to be their agent in the exercise of a few defined powers, while
reserving to the citizens the right to decide on matters which concern their
lives, liberty, and property in the ordinary course of affairs;
   B.   The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution states, “A well-
regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of
the People to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed”;
   C.   The United States Supreme Court in District of Columbia v. Heller 554
U.S. 570 (2008) recognized an individual’s right to keep and bear arms, as
protected by the Second Amendment of the United States Constitution, with
Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion in that case stating that the Second
Amendment protects an individual’s right to possess a firearm unconnected with
service in a militia, and the right to use that firearm for traditionally
lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home;
   D.   The United States Supreme Court in Printz v. United States, 521 U.S.
898 (1997) recognized the “Federal Government may neither issue directives
requiring the States to address particular problems, nor command the States’
officers, or those of their political subdivisions, to administer or enforce a
federal regulatory program”;
   E.   The United States Supreme Court in McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 742
(2010), affirmed that the right of an individual to “keep and bear arms,” as
protected under the Second Amendment, is incorporated by the Due Process Clause
of the Fourteenth Amendment against the states, and the Court in United States
v. Miller, 307 U.S. 174 (1939), opined that firearms that are part of ordinary
military equipment, or with use that could contribute to the common defense are
protected by the Second Amendment;
   F.   Article 1, Section 20 of the constitution of South Carolina reads “A
well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the
right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.”;
   G.   Certain legislation that has or may be introduced in the South Carolina
General Assembly, and certain legislation which has or may be introduced in the
United States Congress that has the effect of infringing on the rights of law
abiding citizens to keep and bear arms, as guaranteed by the Second Amendment
to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 20 of the Constitution
of South Carolina;
   H.   Local governments have the legal authority to object to state and
federal laws regarding firearms, firearm accessories, and ammunition which are
interpreted to violate federal and state constitutional rights and to proclaim
a Right to Keep and Bear Arms for law-abiding citizens in their cities and
counties;
   I.   Greenville County Council wishes to express its commitment to the
rights of all citizens of Greenville County to keep and bear arms and oppose,
within the limits of the Constitution of the United States and the State of
South Carolina, any efforts to unconstitutionally restrict such rights; and
   J.   Greenville County Council wishes to establish Greenville County as a
Right to Keep and Bear Arms jurisdiction for Second Amendment rights.
(Ord. 5335, passed 9-21-2021)
§ 2-362 COUNTY POLICY AND PROHIBITIONS.

unlawfully restrict the Second Amendment rights of the citizens of Greenville
County, or to aid federal or state agencies to knowingly and willingly engage
in the unlawful restriction of said rights.
      (iv)   Greenville County Council opposes any unlawful infringement on the
right of law-abiding citizens to keep and bear arms using such legal means as
may be expedient, including court action.
      (v)   An unlawful infringement shall consist of any act ordering the
confiscation of firearms, firearms accessories, or ammunition from citizens;
any registration or tracking of firearms, firearm accessories, or ammunition;
any registration or tracking of the owners of firearms, firearm accessories, or
ammunition; any prohibition, regulation, and/or use restriction related to
ownership or the constitutionally guaranteed lawful use or carry of non-fully
automatic firearms.
      (vi)   No employee of Greenville County, while acting in their official
capacity, shall knowingly and willingly participate in any way in the
enforcement of any of these prohibited acts, as defined herein, regarding
personal firearms, firearms accessories, or ammunition.
   B.   Exceptions.
      (i)   The protections provided to citizens by this article do not apply
to persons who have been convicted of felony crimes or who are prohibited from
possessing firearms under federal law.
      (ii)   This article is not intended to prohibit or affect in any way the
prosecution of any crime for which the use of, or possession of, a firearm is
an aggravating factor or enhancement to an otherwise independent crime.
      (iii)   This article does not permit or otherwise allow possession of
firearms in federal buildings.
      (iv)   This article does not prohibit individuals in Greenville County
from voluntarily participating in, assisting in permitting, licensing,

   It is the purpose of this article to regulate sexually oriented businesses
to promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of
the county, and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the
continued deleterious location and concentration of sexually oriented
businesses within the county. The provisions of this article have neither the
purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of
any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. Similarly,
it is not the intent or effect of this article to restrict or deny access by
adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent of this
article to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

violation of this article, or other information from law enforcement, the
health department, the fire department, or other official charged with
enforcing the law.
   (c)   When the zoning administrator revokes a permit, the revocation shall
continue for 1 year, and the permittee shall not be issued a sexually oriented

   This Article shall be known as the “Greenville County Motor Sports
Facilities Ordinance”.
(Ord. 3851, § 1, passed 11-16-2004)
§ 3-22 AUTHORITY.
   This Article is hereby adopted under the power and authority granted to the

(Ord. 3851, § 3, passed 11-16-2004)
§ 3-24 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   The purpose of this Article is to establish a minimum separation of new
motor sports facilities from health care facilities, schools, public libraries,

between motor sports facilities and the surrounding community by establishing
minimal specific site, operational and safety standards. The Greenville County
Council makes the following findings in support of the following stated
purposes:
   That motor sports facilities provide a recreational outlet for many persons,
including citizens of Greenville County;
   That motor sports facilities can produce noise, dust, glare, odor and
traffic, which could be detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the
citizens of Greenville County;
   That the operation of motor sports facilities may adversely affect the
operations and use of schools, public libraries, health care facilities,
religious institutions, and other properties located near such motor sports
facilities;
   That the conflicts arising from motor sports facilities may be minimized by
the imposition of reasonable site location, safety and operational standards;
and
   That it is in the best interest of the citizens of Greenville County that
motor sports facilities be regulated so as to minimize the conflicts arising
from such facilities.

(Ord. 3851, § 7, passed 11-16-2004)
§ 3-28 SAFETY STANDARDS.
   The safety standards provided in this Section shall apply to all motor

and safety standards have been met, the County of Greenville may consider the
type and size of racing events, size of parcel, frequency of racing events and
other relevant factors. The motor sports facility shall meet all of the
following operational and safety standards:
   (A)   Lighting. All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be installed and
operated in such a manner as to protect the streets and neighboring properties
from direct glare or hazardous interference of any kind.

along public rights of way, parking on property of others who do not consent to
the parking and parking on-site that allows for ease of flow of egress and
ingress. Off-site parking may be used to accommodate spectators provided egress
and ingress from off-site property does not create a safety hazard or interfere

§ 4-4 COST OF ANIMAL CARE PROVISIONS IN THE COUNTY.
   (a)   Custody and care after seizure.
      (1)   If an animal is legally seized by an animal control or law
enforcement officer as a result
of a violation of the provisions of § 4-19, Cruelty to animals, or subsections
(2), (7), or (8) of § 4-18, Unlawful acts, of this chapter, the responsible
agency may petition the court to require the owner of the animal(s) to deposit
funds at specified intervals to cover reasonable anticipated costs of care
during the seizure pending the disposition of the litigation.
      (2)   If the owner is found guilty, the agency may place the animal for
adoption or rescue. The owner and household members may not adopt the animal.
If adoption or rescue is not possible, humane euthanasia may be performed.
      (3)   At any time prior to final adjudication, the owner has the right to
forfeit ownership of the animal and avoid all future custodial costs related to
its care, but not costs already accrued, beginning with the date of the
seizure.
      (4)   In the event that an owner is adjudicated not guilty of all charges
related to the animal seizure, or all charges are dismissed not pursuant to
plea negotiations or an intervention program, the owner shall receive from the
filing agency a refund of all costs paid by the owner pursuant to the petition.
   (b)   Petition and court hearing.
      (1)   Every petition filed pursuant to § 4-4(a)(1) shall contain a
description of the time, place, and circumstances of the seizure, the legal
authority for the seizure, and the name and address of the owner of the animal
seized.
      (2)   Whenever possible, the animal control and/or law enforcement
officer(s) shall personally serve written process of the petition on the owner
of the animal at the time of its seizure. If the owner is unknown or personal
service is not feasible, a notice shall be posted in a conspicuous place at the
location where the animal or animals were seized.
      (3)   Upon its receipt of return of process of the petition on the owner,
the court shall set a hearing on the petition to determine the need to care for
and provide for the animal pending its final disposition. Any animal control
officer or law enforcement officer is authorized to serve written notice on the
owner of the date, time, and location of the hearing. If no name and address
for the owner are set forth in the petition, then such notice shall be posted
in a conspicuous place at the location where the animal or animals were seized.
      (4)   The hearing is limited to determining probable cause for the
seizure. If found, the court shall require payment to Animal Care Services for
reasonable seizure and care costs from the seizure date through 30 days after
the order. The hearing outcome and any owner statements are inadmissible in
related criminal proceedings.
      (5)   The owner must deposit funds with Animal Care Services equal to the
first 30 days of care and continue every 30 days until relinquishing the animal
or its final disposition. Failure to pay within 5 days of the order or any
subsequent due date results in automatic forfeiture to the petitioning agency
for transfer or humane disposition. The court may reduce the amount the owner
is required to pay under this section if the owner is indigent.
   (c)   Use of funds. Upon deposit, the funds are to be used to cover care
costs from seizure until final disposition. Any remaining funds shall be
refunded to the owner. This remedy is in addition to any other legal remedy. A
person convicted of animal cruelty forfeits custody of the animal, and may be
ordered, if not previously ordered, to pay costs incurred to care for the
animal or animals and related expenses.

date from the date of seizure, unless the magistrate shall determine there are
compelling reasons to extend the date. Leaving the written notice reasonably
secure at the front or primary entrance to the house or structure on the
property where the animal is seized shall be sufficient delivery to the owner,
if the owner is not present or if the owner’s location cannot be determined.
   (d)   Magistrates findings. The magistrate shall determine if the dog is a

§ 7-2 SPECIAL RESIDENTIAL OR AGRICULTURAL ASSESSMENTS; APPLICATION.
   (a)   As legal classification and equalization of assessments of properties
are prescribed by state law, the county council, in accordance with options
given to county governing bodies by S.C. Code, § 12-43-220(c) and (d), as
amended, real property owners shall apply for the special residential or
agricultural assessment of such property at intervals of the 5 years, beginning
with the tax year 1982, so long as the use of the property is not changed
during such period; i.e., real property owners, irrespective of the date on
which their properties were first qualified for such special assessment, must
requalify for the special assessment in the years 1987, 1992, etc.
   (b)   Should any parcel of real property which had not previously qualified
for the special assessment become qualified during any year of such 5-year
period, and shall be so qualified on January 1 of the succeeding tax year,
application for such special assessment shall be made prior to May 1 of such
succeeding tax year.
   (c)   Should all or any part of a parcel of real estate become disqualified
for special assessment during any year of such 5-year period by reason of a
change in use or the owner’s ceasing to use the property as his legal
residence, the owner of such parcel shall report such disqualification to the
county tax assessor on or before May 1 of the next succeeding tax year on forms
to be prescribed by the tax assessor. Penalties for failure to file such
reports shall be imposed as provided in S.C. Code § 12-43-220, as amended;
i.e., a penalty of 10% and interest at the rate of 1/2% per month on the
difference between the amount paid and the amount that should have been paid.
   (d)   Should the title to any parcel of real property be transferred during
any such 5-year period, the new owner shall apply for the special assessment
before May 1 of the year following the transfer of title, and the tax assessor
shall mail an application form to the new owner prior to January 31 of such
following year. A transfer of title ipso facto terminates the qualification for
a special assessment.
(1976 Code, § 7-2) (Ord. 979, § 1, passed 4-20-1982)
§ 7-3 SAME; NOTICES.
   The tax notices sent to any owner of property which has received the special
assessment shall contain the following information:
      (1)   The 5-year filing period as set forth in §
7-2(a).
      (2)   Circumstances requiring disqualification for the special
assessment; i.e., transfer of title or change in use.
      (3)   The requirement that the owner notify the tax assessor of any
circumstances requiring disqualification of property for the special
assessment.
(1976 Code, § 7-3) (Ord. 979, § 2, passed 4-20-1982)
§ 7-4 SAME; DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TO TAX ASSESSOR.
   All persons claiming classification for legal residence who have reasonable
cause for not having filed an application on or before May 1 of the current
year may apply to the tax assessor upon such forms and according to such
procedures as the tax assessor may provide, setting forth the reasons for their
not having timely filed an application. The tax assessor shall investigate the
claim and forward the matter to county council which shall determine if
reasonable cause exists. Upon approval by county council, the application for
legal residence shall be accepted; provided, however, that county council shall
only approve the late filing of the special assessment application for the year
in which the application is filed.

§ 7-5 REFUNDS FOR OVERPAYMENT OF TAXES.
   (a)   Should any taxpayer in the county determine that a payment by him to
the county for taxes on real or personal property was made pursuant to an
incorrect tax notice, he shall have the right to apply to the county auditor
for a refund of those amounts which he claims to be paid in error. Failure to
present such a claim to the county auditor within 2 years from the date of
payment of the incorrect tax notice shall constitute a waiver of any
deficiencies in the tax notice.
   (b)   Any taxpayer who shall apply to the county auditor for a refund of
payments made in error due to an incorrect tax notice shall present his claim
on a form to be provided by the county auditor’s office, and on which the
taxpayer shall state the nature of the alleged error in the tax notice and the
amount claimed as a payment in error; and the taxpayer shall attach thereto his
receipt for payment of taxes.
   (c)   The county auditor, upon receipt of a claim for a refund by a
taxpayer, shall review the claim so made together with the attached receipt of
payment and determine whether a payment in error has been made. Should the
county auditor determine that a payment in error has been made, he shall
certify this fact to the county treasurer together with the amount of such
error and provide such explanation of the error as he may deem appropriate.
   (d)   The county treasurer, upon the receipt of the claim for a refund, as
certified by the county auditor to be valid, shall issue a check in the name of
the county to the taxpayer concerned for the amount of such payment in error.

      (2)   Violations of this section shall be enforced by the sheriff or his
deputies.
   (f)   Effect of license. The issuance of a license under the provisions of
this section by the county does not make lawful the operation of any gambling
machine or device, the operation of which is made unlawful under the laws of
this state.
   (g)   Presumption. Upon application being made for a license to operate any
machine or apparatus under this section, the county may presume that the

§ 7-13 SPECIAL TAX ASSESSMENT FOR REHABILITATED HISTORIC PROPERTIES;
APPLICATION THEREFOR.
   (a)   General provisions. Pursuant to the provisions of S.C. Code § 4-9-195,
as amended, the County grants a special property tax assessment to real
property which qualifies as “rehabilitated historic property.” Unless otherwise
specified by resolution of the County Council, the special assessment period
shall be 10 years. County Council may, by resolution, approve a longer special
assessment period, up to an aggregate period not to exceed 20 years. To qualify
for a special assessment period greater than 10 years, County Council must find
that the proposed rehabilitation of the subject property is extensive in scale
and scope; will foster the economic viability of the surrounding community; and
that granting an assessment period greater than 10 years is in the best
interest of the County. County Council designates the Greenville County
Historic Preservation Commission to perform Council’s functions in regard to
determining property to be “historic” and to certifying property as having
qualified as “rehabilitated historic property” for special tax assessment
purposes when all statutory requirements have been met.
   (b)   Certification, criteria for “historic” designation. In order to be
eligible for the special property tax assessment, historic properties must
receive preliminary certification prior to the commencement of any work, and
final certification upon completion of approved work.
      (1)   To receive preliminary certification, a property must meet the
following conditions:
         a.   The owner of the property applies for and is granted historic
designation, pursuant to subsection (b)(3) below, by the Greenville County
Historic Preservation Commission; and
         b.   The proposed rehabilitation receives approval of rehabilitation
work from the Greenville Historic Preservation Commission.
      (2)   To receive final certification, a property must have met the
following conditions:
         a.   The property has received preliminary certification;
         b.   The completed rehabilitation receives approval of rehabilitation
work from the Greenville County Historic Preservation Commission as being
consistent with the plans approved by the Greenville County Historic
Preservation Commission as part of the preliminary certification; and
         c.   The minimum expenditures for rehabilitation were incurred and
paid.
      (3)   Property shall qualify as “historic” for the special assessment
when:
         a.   It is listed in the National Register of Historic Places;
         b.   It is at least 50 years old and is designated as a historic
property by the Greenville County Historic Preservation Commission in accord
with this section; or
         c.   It meets such other and additional requirements as may be
established by the South Carolina General Assembly in the future.
      (4)   In order for a 50-year-old building to qualify as “historic” when
it is not listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the building must
be shown to meet 1 of the following criteria:
         a.   The structure’s architectural design and materials of
construction are good examples of those types of design and construction
recognized among architects and preservationists as having had historical
significance in the County’s development;
         b.   The structure is associated in a meaningful way with a person or
group who made a significant contribution to the County’s political, economic,
religious, social, artistic, or literary development; or
         c.   The structure is associated with a person or group recognized on
the state or national level as having made significant contributions to
science, religion, politics, business, literature, the arts, or other
professions.
   (c)   Standards for review of rehabilitation work. To be eligible for the
special tax assessment, historic rehabilitations must be appropriate for the
historic building and the historic district in which it is located. This is
achieved through adherence to the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for
Rehabilitation and any applicable County-adopted design guidelines, as from
time to time are amended.
      (1)   Work to be reviewed. The following work will be reviewed according
to the standards set forth above:
         a.   Repairs to the exterior of the designated building;
         b.   Alterations to the exterior of the designated building;
         c.   New construction on the property on which the building is
located;
         d.   Alterations to interior primary spaces; and
         e.   Any remaining work where the expenditures for such work are being
used to satisfy the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation.
      (2)   Minimum expenditures for rehabilitation. Minimum expenditures for
rehabilitation means the owner or his estate rehabilitates the building, with
expenditures for rehabilitation exceeding 50% of the fair market value of the
owner-occupied building, or with expenditures for rehabilitation exceeding the
fair market value of the income-producing building. Fair market value means the
appraised value as certified to the Greenville County Historic Preservation
Commission by a real estate appraiser licensed by the State of South Carolina;
the sales price as delineated in a bona fide contract of sale within 6 months
of the time it is submitted; or the most recent appraised value published by
the Greenville County Tax Assessor.
      (3)   Expenditures for rehabilitation. Expenditures for rehabilitation
means the actual costs of rehabilitation relating to 1 or more of the
following:
         a.   Improvements located on or within the historic building as
designated;
         b.   Improvements outside of but directly attached to the historic
building which are necessary to make the building fully useable (such as
vertical circulation), but shall not include rentable/habitable floor space
attributable to new construction;
         c.   Architectural and engineering services attributable to the design
of the improvements; or
         d.   Costs necessary to maintain the historic character or integrity
of the building.
      (4)   Scope. The special tax assessment may apply to the following:
         a.   Structure(s) rehabilitated; and/or
         b.   Real property on which the building is located.
      (5)   Time limits. Upon preliminary certification, the property will be
assessed for 2 years on the fair market value of the property at the time the
preliminary certification was made. If the project is not complete after 2
years, but the minimum expenditures for rehabilitation have been incurred, the
property continues to receive the special assessment until the project is
complete, but not for more than 5 years. The total special tax assessment
period shall not exceed 10 years.
   (D)   Process.
      (1)   Plan required. Owners of property seeking approval of
rehabilitation work must submit a completed application for preliminary
certification for special tax assessment with supporting documentation prior to
beginning work.
      (2)   Preliminary certification. Upon receipt of the completed
application, the proposal shall be placed on the next available agenda of the
Greenville County Historic Preservation Commission to determine if the project
is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation in subsection (C) above.
Within 30 calendar days of its decision, the Greenville County Historic
Preservation Commission shall provide written notification of its decision to
the owner of property. Upon receipt of this determination, the owner may:
         (a)   If the application is approved, obtain required permits and
begin rehabilitation;
         (b)   If the application is not approved, revise such application in
accordance with comments provided by the Greenville County Historic
Preservation Commission; or
         (c)   If the application is not approved, appeal the decision to the
South Carolina Department of Archives and History.
      (3)   Substantive changes. Once preliminary certification is granted to
an application, substantive changes must be approved by the Greenville County
Historic Preservation Commission. Unapproved substantive changes are conducted
at the risk of the property owner and may disqualify the project from
eligibility. Additional expenditures will not qualify the project for an
extension on the special tax assessment.
      (4)   Final certification. Upon completion of the project, owners of
property must submit a completed application for final certification for
special tax assessment to receive final certification in order to be eligible
for the special tax assessment. The Greenville County Historic Preservation
Commission will inspect completed projects to determine if the work is
consistent with the approval granted by the Greenville County Historic
Preservation Commission. Final certification will be granted when the completed
work meets the standards and verification is made that expenditures have been
made in accordance with divisions (C)(3) and (4). Upon final certification, the
property will be assessed for the remainder of the special assessment period on
the fair market value of the property at the time of the preliminary
certification was made. If the completed project does not comply with all
requirements for final certification, final certification must not be granted
and any monies not collected by the Greenville County Tax Collector due to the
special assessment must be returned to the Greenville County Tax Collector. The
Greenville County Historic Preservation Commission shall notify the Greenville
County Tax Assessor if final certification is not granted.
      (5)   Additional work. For the remainder of the special assessment period
after final certification, the property owner shall notify the Greenville
County Historic Preservation Commission of any additional work, other than
ordinary maintenance. The Greenville County Historic Preservation Commission
shall review the work at a regularly scheduled hearing and determine whether
the overall project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation. If the
additional work is found to be inconsistent, the property owner may withdraw
his request, or revise the proposed additional work.
      (6)   Decertification. When property has received final certification and
is assessed as rehabilitated historic property, it remains so certified and
must be granted the special assessment until the property becomes disqualified
by any one of the following:
         a.   Written notice by the owner to the County to remove the
preferential assessment;
         b.   Removal of the historic designation by County Council; or
         c.   Rescission of the approval of rehabilitation work by the
Greenville County Historic Preservation Commission because of alterations or
renovations by the owner or his estate which cause the property to no longer
possess the qualities and features which made it eligible for final
certification.
      (7)   Sale or transfer of ownership of real property. Under no
circumstances shall the sale or transfer of ownership of real property
certified and assessed in accordance with this section and any ordinance in
effect at the time disqualify the property from receiving the special property
tax assessment under this section. Notification of any change affecting
eligibility must be given immediately to the appropriate county taxing and
assessing authorities.
      (8)   Notification. Upon preliminary certification and final
certification of a property, the owner of property shall notify the Greenville
County Assessor that such property has been duly certified and is eligible for
the special tax assessment. The owner has the responsibility to confirm the
special assessment status on an annual basis with the County. Furthermore,
notification of any change affecting eligibility must be given immediately to
the Greenville County Assessor. Upon decertification, the owner shall provide
the notification if he initiates the decertification; the Greenville County
Historic Preservation Commission shall provide the notification if it initiates
the decertification.
      (9)   Date effective. If an application for preliminary certification is
approved by August 1, the special assessment authorized herein is effective for
that year. Otherwise, it is effective beginning with the following year. The
special assessment only begins in the current or future tax years as provided
for in this section. In no instance may the special assessment be applied
retroactively.

§ 7-15 AD VALOREM TAXES.
   1.   Findings. Greenville County Council recognizes that the South Carolina
General Assembly has recently adopted a change in the law governing when
improvements to real property can be listed on the tax rolls for ad valorem
property tax purpose. In order to keep the County’s tax base as current as
possible under S.C. Code § 12-37-670, as amended, Greenville County Council
hereby adopts this section.
   2.   Requirement for listing new structures. A new structure can not be
listed for taxation and assessed until it is completed and fit for the use for
which it is intended, as evidenced by the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy or the structure actually is occupied if no certificate is issued.
Previously untaxed improvements to real property must be listed for ad valorem
property tax purposes with the County’s Real Property Services Division by the
first day of the next calendar quarter after a certificate of occupancy is
issued for the structure or improvement or when the County has notice of
occupancy of the structure.
   3.   Plan submission. To assist in the implementation of this section, as-
built plans showing dimensions of structures or improvements shall be submitted
to the permitting building official prior to the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy.
   4.   Accrual date. Additional ad valorem property taxes attributable to new
improvements or structures listed with the County’s Real Property Services
Division pursuant to this section shall accrue beginning on the listing date
and are due and payable when taxes are due on the property for that property
tax year.
   5.   Countywide implementation. Pursuant to S.C. Code § 12-37-670(B)(3),
County’s election to implement the new listing requirements set forth in this
section are also binding on all municipalities within the Greenville County
imposing ad valorem property taxes.

§ 7-81 APPROPRIATIONS AND DISBURSEMENTS GENERALLY.
   (a)   Appropriation of funds shall be made only by county council to

   (b)   Requests for county funds will be submitted to council for review
during the regular county budget process, and appropriations will be made only
for specific line-item purposes. As required by §
7-66 of this chapter, the annual report from departments and agencies to
council shall verify that funds were expended in accordance with the purposes
for which they were allocated.
   (c)   County funds will be disbursed to departments and agencies in 1 of the
following ways:
      (1)   Departments and agencies funded 100% with county funds. Departments
and agencies are required to conform with the accounting, purchasing and
personnel policies of the county. The Department of General Services will be
responsible for all fund disbursement through the county’s accounting system.
      (2)   Department or agencies funded less than 100% by county funds.
Agencies will be subject to the county’s purchasing and personnel policies if
comparable policies do not exist. If feasible, the department or agency will
receive county funds through the county’s accounting system. If not feasible,
departments or agencies will receive funds in accordance with a schedule
prepared by the county administrator to include the following:
         a.   The agency will estimate its first month’s expense. The
Department of General Services will issue a check to the agency for this
amount.
         b.   Subsequent payment will be made on an estimated basis predicated
on actual expenditures.
(1976 Code, § 7-81) (Ord. 527; Ord. 3680, § 1, passed 4-1-2003)
§ 7-82 ADJUSTMENTS TO BUDGET.
   (a)   Supplemental appropriations. A supplemental appropriation is an
allocation of funds to a county department or agency for a specific purpose not
anticipated when the original budget appropriation was approved. Council may
make supplemental appropriations which shall specify the sources of funds for
such appropriations. The procedure for approval of supplemental appropriations
shall be the same as that prescribed for enactment of ordinances.
   In the preparation of supplemental appropriations, council may require such
reports, estimates and statistics from any county agency or department as may
be necessary to perform its duties as the responsible fiscal body of the
county.
   The county council will consider a request for supplemental appropriations
only under the following criteria:
      (1)   That the department manager can demonstrate that the original
appropriation of funds was not sufficient to last through the entire year based
on the planned level of services that were originally approved by the council
in the budget ordinance.
      (2)   That new positions or capital items will not be eligible for
consideration except under extreme emergencies where the lack of additional
personnel or a new capital item would not allow the department to provide
essential budgeted services.
      (3)   That the department manager is responsible for providing county
services under adverse inflationary conditions and working with costs beyond
the manager’s control. If the expenditure of appropriated funds is not
controlled by the manager and he or she cannot alter either the level of
expenditures or the unit cost, the manager may, under extreme circumstances,
request a supplemental appropriation.
      (4)   That the funds are required either to provide a new service or
expand an existing service mandated by federal, state or county statute.
   The supplemental request must be created by a change in either the internal
or external environment.
   The department manager requesting a supplemental appropriation shall submit
detailed justification including the impact of the supplement on the existing
budget in accordance with the above criteria to the department of general
services. The request will be reviewed with the county administrator in
accordance with budget policies and submitted with a staff report to the
finance committee.
   Supplemental financing for any purpose shall not be approved unless at least
3/4 of all council members vote for its approval at a regular meeting.
   (b)   Fund transfers.
      (1)   Intradepartment transfers. Funds appropriated in the annual budget
may be transferred by the county administrator between line item accounts
within a department or nondepartment account for the purpose of providing
continuing county services approved by council in the budget ordinance.
      The county administrator will approve the transfer subject to appropriate
detailed justification by the department manager. The county administrator will
submit an informational report of such transfers to the council.
Intradepartment transfers will also be subject to the following criteria:
         a.   A transfer of funds shall not be made for the purpose of creating
new personnel positions. The powers and duties of the administrator shall
include, but not be limited to, being responsible for employment and discharge
of personnel subject to the appropriation of funds by the council for that
purpose.
         b.   Reserved.
         c.   A transfer of funds shall not be made from an account that will
knowingly result in a deficit in the account during the fiscal year.
         d.   A transfer of funds shall not be made which would result in the
need for additional county funds within the current fiscal year. (For example,
a transfer request to purchase an automobile would not be approved if the
department did not have sufficient funds for maintenance, gas, tires, etc.)
      (2)   Interdepartmental transfers. All fund transfers from 1 department
or nondepartment account to another department or nondepartment account must be

§ 7-83 EXPENDITURE OF APPROPRIATED OR NONAPPROPRIATED FUNDS.
   (a)   Generally. Budget appropriations are enacted by the county council in
the form of an ordinance. The resulting appropriations approved by ordinance
constitute legal authority for departments and/or agencies to make expenditures
and incur obligations in providing services. All expenditures:
      (1)   Shall be in conformity with generally accepted accounting
principles applicable to government entities. If there is a conflict between
legal provisions and generally accepted accounting principles applicable to
governmental units, legal provisions must take precedence.
      (2)   Shall not be made when they are in conflict with
Ch. 2 or this article of this Code.
      (3)   Must be in compliance with county purchasing and personnel rules.
   The powers and duties of the administrator shall include, but not be limited
to, supervising the expenditure of appropriated funds.
   (b)   Control of expenditures. The department or agency manager is the
person directly responsible for monitoring and controlling budget expenditures.
The county administrator will provide department or agency managers with
administrative tools to control and monitor their budget.
   (c)   Reserved.
   (d)   Reserved.
   (e)   Indebtedness incurred in excess of appropriations. Departments shall
not expend funds in excess of their total appropriations.
   (f)   Nonbudgeted expenditures. Expenditures for nonbudgeted items are
prohibited.
(1976 Code, § 7-83) (Ord. 527; Ord. 3680, § 1, passed 4-1-2003)
§ 7-84 FUND BALANCE.
   Fund balance is the excess of any fund’s assets over its liabilities and
encumbrances. The projected fund balance of the general fund during any fiscal
year shall be used for purposes determined by the county council, i.e., to fund
supplemental appropriations.
(1976 Code, § 7-84) (Ord. 527)
§ 7-85 NONCOUNTY FUNDS, ETC.
   (a)   Definition, use of noncounty funds. Noncounty funds are those funds
sought by a department, agency, board or commission from federal and state
grantor agencies, foundations and other private sources. Noncounty funds can be
utilized to:
      (1)   Provide new services;
      (2)   Supplement county revenue to increase the current level of services
provided by the county; and
      (3)   Replace county funds already appropriated for a service unless
prohibited by the grantor agency.
   (b)   General policy. All applications for noncounty funds which require
county government resources of any kind whether financial, physical, personnel,
or other, must first receive prior approval of the county council before
noncounty funding is pursued. Failure to obtain such approval will jeopardize
future county funding. The county council’s approval will be contingent upon
the following criteria which must be addressed by the department, agency,
board, or commission in a letter of intent to apply for noncounty funds:
      (1)   Proposed program goals and objectives. The goals and objectives of
the proposed program must be clearly and specifically stated. This should
include a statement on whatever financial and operational benefits the county
would receive or derive.
      (2)   Long-range and short-range financial commitments. “In-kind” or cash
requirements must be identified as well as any future county financial or
personnel commitments after the grant funds are exhausted.
      (3)   Effects of discontinuing the grant at any given point. The impact
on the proposed project of discontinuance of grant funds at the option of
either the county or the grantor must be fully evaluated.
   (c)   Responsibility of county administrator and county council.
      (1)   The county administrator is responsible for establishing a detailed
grants review process and informing the departments, agencies, boards and
commissions of the procedures they must follow in order to apply for noncounty
funds. The county administrator shall analyze all grant applications and make
recommendations to county council.
      (2)   Reserved.
      (3)   All grant preapplications, formal applications and grant contracts
shall be signed by the chairman of county council and the county administrator.
   (d)   Exceptions. Any exceptions to the above policy must be given tentative
approval by the county administrator and the chairman of county council before
noncounty funding is pursued. Such tentative approval, however, must be
ratified by the council at its next regular meeting or final approval will be
denied.
(1976 Code, § 7-85) (Ord. 527; Ord. 824, § 1, passed 8-5-1980)
§ 7-86 DEBT SERVICE FUND.
   The debt service fund shall be financed by the general property tax. A tax
rate shall be levied on each dollar valuation of taxable property sufficient to
cover the fiscal year principal payments, interest payments and fiscal agents’
fees.
(1976 Code, § 7-86) (Ord. 527)
§ 7-87 INVESTMENT OF AD VALOREM MONEYS.
   All moneys coming into the hands of the county treasurer from ad valorem
property taxes, or so much thereof as is not necessary for current expenses,
shall be invested by the treasurer in such securities or investments as are
authorized by S.C. Code, §§
6-5-10 and 12-45-220, as amended, and the interest or other income derived
therefrom, may be expended for general county purposes.
(1976 Code, § 7-87) (Ord. 911, § 1, passed 7-21-1981)
§ 7-88 REAL PROPERTY FUND.
   (a)   Creation. In order to assist in capital improvement programming, there
is hereby created within the office of the county treasurer a special fund to
be known as the real property fund. After November 17, 1981, the treasurer is
authorized and directed to place in such fund all sums representing the
proceeds of sales of real property belonging to the county.
   (b)   Investment of funds. The treasurer is hereby authorized to invest any
portion or all of such funds in those securities or investments authorized by
S.C. Code, § 12-45-220, as amended.
   (c)   Use of moneys; withdrawal of such funds. Moneys in the real property
fund may be used only for capital improvement projects or costs incidental
thereto, including without limitation, fees of architects, engineers, and
planners, attorney’s fees, land acquisition, and site preparation. Such moneys
may be withdrawn from the real property fund only upon a 2/3 vote of the
members of the county council.
(1976 Code, § 7-88) (Ord. 937, §§ 1-3, passed 11-17-1981; Ord. 3680, § 1,

§ 7-90 ANNUAL AUDIT.
   The council shall provide for an independent annual audit of all financial
records and transactions of the county and any agency funded in whole or in
part by county funds and may provide for more frequent audits as it deems
necessary. Such audits shall be made by a certified public accountant or firm
of such accountants who have no personal interest, direct or indirect, in the
fiscal affairs of the county government or any of its officers. The council
may, without requiring competitive bids, designate such accountant or firm
annually or for a period not exceeding 1 year; provided, that the designation
for any particular fiscal year shall be made no later than 30 days after the
beginning of such fiscal year. The report of the audit shall be made available
for public inspection.
(1976 Code, § 7-90) (Ord. 527; Ord. 558, § 1)
§ 7-91  INMATE CANTEEN FUND.
   (a)   Definition of welfare fund. According to S.C. Code, § 24-3-960 (as
amended), the term “welfare fund” means an account which receives funds
generated by the confined inmate population of the Greenville County Detention
Center. Profits will be generated primarily from inmate expenditures from the
canteen; secondary profits, however, may result from the confiscation of monies
and other items seized as contraband. Profits will be used to maintain the
inmate canteen and to purchase or repair items used by the inmate population
(i.e. recreation equipment, and the like). Hereinafter, for the purposes of
this section, the account shall be called the “inmate canteen fund.”
   (b)   Inmate canteen fund established. An inmate canteen fund is hereby
established on behalf of the inmate population. The revenue (i.e., profits)
generated by the County Detention Center’s canteen operation will be retained
and expended by the County Finance and Administrative Services Department for
the continuation of the canteen and other approved inmate welfare projects.
   The inmate canteen fund shall be treated as a fiduciary fund and not
subsidized by county-appropriated funds; it shall be maintained separately from
all other appropriated accounts, and will be governed by standard accounting
practices and procedures.
   (c)   Inmate Canteen Fund Board established. An Inmate Canteen Fund Board
will be established to: 1) manage the canteen operation; and 2) recommend
expenditures from the inmate canteen fund. At a minimum, the Inmate Canteen
Fund Board shall consist of county personnel as follows:
   1 member - Financial Operations Division;
   1 member - Detention Center Recreation/Programs Officer;
   1 member - Detention Center Accounting Specialist;
    1 member - Detention Center Administrative Lieutenant or Captain; and
   1 member - Detention Center Canteen Operator.
   The Board shall meet as needed and report its activities to County Council
through the County Administrator via the Director of Community Services.
   (d)   Disposition of profits. All profits derived from the canteen operation
shall be turned over to the Financial Operations Division for placement in the
inmate canteen fund. Excess funds may be invested pursuant to law. Interest
accrued on such investments may be used only on inmate welfare projects.
   (e)   Disposition of confiscated monies. In accordance with S.C. Code, § 24-
3-960 (as amended), any monies or things of like nature used as money in the
unlawful possession of any prisoner confined in the County Detention Center
will be declared contraband and deposited in the inmate canteen fund.
   (f)   Disposition of sales tax. All sales tax collected from the canteen
operation shall be turned over to the Financial Operations Division for payment
to the South Carolina Tax Commission as required.
   (g)   Expenditures. All expenditures will follow the small purchase
guidelines in §
7-308 of the Greenville County Procurement Ordinance. All items will be
approved by the Inmate Canteen Fund Board and the Director of the Department of
Community Services. The Board will be responsible for solicitations and quotes
as outlined in §
7-308. For purchases above the small purchase limit, the Board will follow the
competitive sealed bidding guidelines in §
7-305 of the Greenville County Procurement Ordinance, and utilize the services
of the County Purchasing Division.
   (h)   Personnel. The inmate canteen will be provided with sufficient
personnel to ensure its efficient operation. Such personnel shall include 2
canteen operators who will be part-time county employees. These canteen
operators shall be entitled to the same benefits as all other part-time county
employees. In addition, the Inmate Canteen Fund Board is authorized to enter
into a contract with a barber, for the benefit of the inmate population. The
barber shall be an independent contractor and will not be entitled to county
benefits. Additional personnel may be recommended by the Inmate Canteen Fund
Board, if the Board, subject to the Greenville County Personnel Ordinance,
determines that such additional staff is necessary to maintain the efficient
operation of the inmate canteen. The canteen operators and barber and any
additional personnel deemed necessary to maintain the efficient operation of
the inmate canteen shall be paid with funds from the inmate canteen.
   (i)   Audit. An audit of the canteen fund shall be conducted on an annual
basis by the county’s independent auditor, with the fees for any special
services required to be performed resulting from the inmate canteen fund being
paid by the inmate canteen fund. Internal audits may be conducted on an as-
needed basis.

names of the offerors disclosed at the proposal opening. Contents of competing
offerors shall not be disclosed during the process of negotiation. Proposals
shall be open for public inspection, in accordance with §
7-199, Public Access to Procurement Information, after contract award.
Propriety of confidential information marked as such in each proposal shall not
be disclosed without written consent of the offeror. If a proposal is received
after the advertised deadline, it will not be accepted.
   (5)   Request for Qualifications. Prior to soliciting proposals, the
procurement officer may issue a Request for Qualifications from prospective
offerors. Such request shall contain at a minimum a description of goods or
services to be solicited by the Request for Proposals and the general scope of
the work and shall state the deadline for submission of information and how
prospective offerors may apply for consideration. The request shall require
information only on their qualifications, experience, and ability to perform
the requirements of the contract.
   After receipt of the responses to the Request for Qualifications from
prospective offerors, the prospective offerors shall be ranked from most
qualified to least qualified on the basis of the information provided.
Proposals shall then be solicited from at least the top 2 prospective offerors
by means of a Request for Proposals. The failure of a prospective offeror to be
selected to receive the Request for Proposals shall not be grounds for protest
under §
7-701.
   (6)   Public Notice. Adequate public notice of the Request for
Qualifications shall be given in the manner provided in §
7-305.
   (7)   Evaluation Factors. The Request for Proposals shall state the relative
importance of the factors to be considered in evaluating proposals. Price may,
but need not be, an initial evaluation factor.
   (8)   Discussion with Responsive/Responsible Offerors and Revisions to
Proposals. As provided in the Request for Proposals, discussions may be
conducted with responsible offerors who submit proposals determined to be
reasonably susceptible of being selected for award for the purpose of
clarification to assure full understanding of, and conformance to, the
solicitation requirements. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment
with respect to any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals and
such revisions may be permitted after submissions and prior to award for the
purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting discussions, there
shall be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by
competing offerors.
   (9)   Selection and Ranking. Proposals shall be evaluated using only the
criteria stated in the Request for Proposals and there must be adherence to any
weightings that have been previously assigned. Once evaluation is complete, all
responsive offerors shall be ranked from most advantageous to least
advantageous to the County, considering only the evaluation factors stated in
the Request for Proposals. If price is an initial evaluation factor, award
shall be made in accordance with §
7-307. If price is not an initial evaluation factor, negotiations shall be
conducted with the top ranked responsive offeror for performance of the
contract at a price which is fair and reasonable to the County. Should the
procurement officer be unable to negotiate a contract at a price which is fair
and reasonable to the County, negotiations shall be formally terminated with
the top ranked responsive offeror and negotiations commenced with the second
most advantageous responsive offeror, and then the third and so on until a
satisfactory contract has been negotiated. In conducting negotiations, there
must be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted by
competing offerors.
   (10)   Award. Award must be made to the responsive offeror whose proposal is
determined in writing to be the most advantageous to the County, taking into
consideration price and the evaluation factors set forth in the Request for
Proposals, unless 1 of the options listed in §
7-307 is utilized. The contract file shall contain the basis on which the award
is made. Procedures and requirements for notification of intent to award the
contract shall be the same as those stated in §
7-305.
   (11)   Other. If, after following the procedures set forth in §
7-307, a contract is not able to be negotiated, the scope of the Request for
Proposals may be changed in an effort to reduce the cost to a fair and
reasonable amount, and all responsive offerors must be allowed to submit their
best and final offers.
   Where price was an initial evaluation factor, the using department, through
the procurement officer, may in its sole discretion, and not subject to
challenge through a protest filed under §
7-701, proceed in any of the following manners:
      (a)   Negotiate price with the highest scoring offeror. If a satisfactory
price cannot be agreed upon, price negotiations may be conducted with the
second, and then the third, and so on, ranked offerors to such level of ranking
as determined by the using department and/or procurement officer;
      (b)   Negotiate with the highest ranking officer on matters affecting the
scope of the contract, so long as the overall nature and intent of the contract
is not changed. If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated with the
highest ranking offeror, negotiations may be conducted with the second, and
then the third, and so on, ranked offerors to such level of ranking as
determined by the using department and/or procurement officer;
      (c)   Change the scope of the request for proposals and give all
responsive/responsible offerors an opportunity to submit best and final offers.
      If any of these options are chosen, and a contract is still unable to be
awarded, any of the procedures outlined herein may be repeated until a proposed
contract is successfully achieved.

   (1)   General. Any contract not exceeding $35,000 may be made in accordance
with the small purchase procedures authorized in this Section. Procurement
requirements shall not be artificially divided so as to constitute a small
purchase under this Section.
   (2)   Small purchases under $2,000. Any purchase not exceeding $2,000 may be
accomplished without securing competitive quotations if the prices are
considered to be fair and reasonable. Competitive quotations need only be taken
when the procurement officer suspects the price may not be fair and reasonable,
e.g., comparison to previous price paid, personal knowledge of the price range
of the item involved. The maximum amount for purchases that may be achieved by
using the Procurement Card is $2,000. Every effort should be made to distribute
such purchases equitably among qualified suppliers.
   (3)   Small purchases over $2,000 but not exceeding $7,500. Insofar as it is
practical, solicitations of verbal or written quotes from a minimum of 2
qualified sources of supply shall be made and documentation of the quotes
recorded on or attached to the purchase requisition. The award shall be made to
the lowest responsive/responsible source.
   (4)   Small purchases over $7,500 but not exceeding $35,000. Insofar as it
is practical, solicitations of verbal or written quotes from a minimum of 3
qualified sources of supply shall be made and documentation of the quotes

department signed by the department head stating why no other source will be
suitable or acceptable to meet the needs. A contract may be awarded for a
property, supply, service, or construction item without competition when the
Procurement Manager or his designee determines in writing that there is only 1
source for the required property, supply, service, or construction item or that
the proposed award to a single source is a permitted, non-competitive
procurement as established herein. After verification of a sole source vendor,
or the justification of a sole source purchase is warranted, the Procurement
Manager, or his designee, has the authority to negotiate the price, terms, and
conditions of the procurement.
   Examples of a permissible, non-competitive procurement include, but not
limited to:
   •   Where the Procurement Manager and the Department Head has deemed the
compatibility of equipment, accessories, services, systems, software or
replacement parts is of paramount importance.
   •   When public utility services are to be procured.

§ 8-20 AUTHORITY.
   The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code, Title 4,
Chapters 9 (Article 1), 25 and 27, and amendments thereto, delegated the
responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry.
(Ord. 4113, § 2, passed 5-1-2007; Ord. 4631, § 2, passed 6-17-2014; Ord. 5031,
passed 11-6-2018; Ord. 5276, passed 4-6-2021)
§ 8-21 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of Greenville County are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (b)   Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 4085, § 2, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 4631, § 2, passed 6-17-2014; Ord. 5031,
passed 11-6-2018; Ord. 5276, passed 4-6-2021)
§ 8-22 PURPOSE OF ARTICLE.
   It is the purpose of this article to protect human life and health, minimize
property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to minimize
public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that uses
vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the
floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are
restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of
natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are
involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading,
dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion.
(Ord. 4085, § 2, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 4631, § 2, passed 6-17-2014; Ord. 5031,
passed 11-6-2018; Ord. 5276, passed 4-6-2021)
§ 8-23 OBJECTIVES OF ARTICLE.
   (a)   The objectives of this article are to protect human life and health;
to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize damage from
flooding; and, to provide notification to potential home buyers that their
property is in a flood area. The provisions of the article are intended to
minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the
floodplain, and prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain
management objective of this article is to minimize expenditure of public money
for costly flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding.
   (b)   Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform
vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of
peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge,
prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations,
recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best
served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the
natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water
bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains should
be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource conditions
and human needs.

passed 11-6-2018; Ord. 5276, passed 4-6-2021)
§ 8-24 LANDS TO WHICH THIS ARTICLE APPLIES.
   This article shall apply to all parcels of land that lie either wholly or
partially within areas of special flood hazard, and certain parcels of land
immediately adjacent to areas of special flood hazard, as specifically
identified in this article, that are within the jurisdiction of the
unincorporated areas of Greenville County, South Carolina. These areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Department of Homeland Security-FEMA,
National Flood Insurance Program, in its Flood Insurance Study, dated May 4,
2021 with accompanying maps and other supporting data are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this article. Further, this article
shall apply to any areas of special flood hazard established and accepted by
Greenville County that utilize DHS-FEMA NFIP detailed flood study standards, or
better.
(Ord. 4085, § 2, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 4113, § 3, passed 5-1-2007; Ord. 4631,

Ord. 5477, passed 12-6-2022)
§ 8-25 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be required in accordance with the provisions of
this article prior to the commencement of any development activities in the
special flood hazard areas.
(Ord. 4085, § 2, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 4631, § 2, passed 6-17-2014; Ord. 5031,
passed 11-6-2018; Ord. 5276, passed 4-6-2021)
§ 8-26 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered or land developed without full compliance with the terms
of this article and other applicable regulations.
(Ord. 4085, § 2, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 4631, § 2, passed 6-17-2014; Ord. 5031,

§ 8-27 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall
be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the
governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state law. This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.
   (a)   If any part of this article is declared invalid, the remainder of the
article shall not be affected and shall remain in force.
   (b)   The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article
shall not create liability on the part of Greenville County or by any officer
or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
article or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

            2.   Directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without
approved programs.
      Some structures or districts listed on the state or local inventories MAY
NOT be "historic" as cited above, but have been included on the inventories
because it was believed that the structures or districts have the potential for
meeting the "historic" structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these
structures to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated
and evidenced that the South Carolina Department of Archives and History has
individually determined that the structure or district meets DOI historic
structure criteria.
      Increased cost of compliance (ICC). Applies to all new and renewed flood
insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable

floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a
building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged.
      Limited storage. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items, which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant material, void
of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be temperature
controlled. If the area is located below the base flood elevation in an A or AE
zone it must meet the requirements of Section 8-34(f) of this article.
      Lowest adjacent grade (LAG). An elevation of the lowest ground surface
that touches any of the exterior walls of a building or proposed building
walls.
      Lowest floor. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). Any unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a

   (a)   The Building Official or his/her designee (i.e. Floodplain
Administrator) is hereby appointed to administer and implement the provisions
of this article.
   (b)   Development permit and certification requirements. Application for a
development permit shall be made to the local administrator on forms furnished
by him or her prior to any development activities. The development permit may
include, but not be limited to, plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing: the
nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing
or proposed structures; and the location of fill materials, storage areas, and
drainage facilities. Specifically, the following information is required:
      (1)   A plot plan that shows the 1% (100-year) floodplain contour or a
statement that the entire lot is within the floodplain, must be provided by the
development permit applicant when the lot is within or appears to be within or
adjacent to the special flood hazard area as mapped by the Department of
Homeland Security-FEMA, National Flood Insurance Program or the floodplain
identified pursuant to either §
8-30(c) or §§
8-39 and
8-40. The plot plan must be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
S.C. registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
      (2)   The plot plan required by §
8-29(b)(1) must show the floodway, if any, as identified by the Department of
Homeland Security-FEMA, National Flood Insurance Program or the floodway
identified pursuant to either §
8-30(c) or §§
8-39 and
8-40.
      (3)   Where base flood elevation data is provided, the application for a

will be floodproofed.
      (4)   In the absence of other available data from another source, and
where no base flood elevation data is provided as set forth in §
8-24 or §
8-30(c), the application for a development permit must show construction of the
lowest floor at least a minimum of 4 feet above the highest adjacent grade. A
higher lowest floor elevation will be required if base flood elevation data
from adjacent areas indicate that the 4 feet minimum may be inadequate to
protect the structure and service facilities from flooding during a 1% annual
chance flood event. The requirements of §
8-39 must also be met, if applicable.
      (5)   Where any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of
proposed development, the application for a development permit shall include: a
description of the extent of watercourse alteration or relocation; an
engineering report utilizing detailed methods accepted by DHS-FEMA, US Army
Corps and any other applicable federal or state regulatory agencies, on the

area of special flood hazard, a flood elevation certificate is required, after
the lowest floor is completed and before any further inspections are accepted
and vertical construction commences. The "as- built" measurement shall be made
in relation to mean sea level, and be a minimum of 4 feet above the base flood
elevation. The certification shall be prepared, signed and sealed by a S.C.
registered land surveyor or S.C. professional engineer. Any work done prior to
submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review the floor elevation survey data submitted.
      Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit
holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to
proceed. Failure to submit the certification or failure to make said
corrections shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
      A final "Finished Construction" Flood Elevation Certificate is required
to be submitted to and approved by the floodplain administrator prior to final
inspections and/or certificate of occupancy.
      (8)   When a nonresidential structure is constructed and/or substantially
improved in the area of special flood hazard, a floodproofing certificate is
required for the structure if the lowest floor, mechanical system and utilities
are not elevated 4 feet above the base flood elevation. All construction to
accomplish this floodproofing shall be constructed of materials that prevent
the passage of water and the effects of buoyancy under the hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads imposed during flood inundation. The floodproofing
certificate shall be prepared by a SC registered architect or engineer and
submitted with the development permit application. Upon completion of the
floodproofing, a certification statement indicating that the floodproofing has
been completed according to the submitted plans shall be prepared, signed and
sealed by a SC registered architect or engineer. This statement shall be
submitted to the local administrator for review and acceptance. Any work done
prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk.
The local administrator shall review the floodproofing statement and any
accompanying data submitted. Deficiencies detected by such review shall be
corrected by the permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive
work being permitted to proceed. Failure to submit the certification or failure
to make required corrections shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project.
      (9)   If the proposed project will impact the configuration of the
watercourse, floodway, or base flood elevation for which a detailed Flood
Insurance Study has been developed, the applicant shall apply for and must
receive approval for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) with the
Department of Homeland Security-FEMA, National Flood Insurance Program. The
floodplain development permit will not be issued until DHS-FEMA has issued the
CLOMR. When a CLOMR has been issued for a project the following shall apply.
Within 30 calendar days of completion of construction activities, the applicant
shall apply to DHS-FEMA for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). The applicant is
responsible for all technical submissions and fees required to obtain the
CLOMR/LOMR.

is being constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this
article, the administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The
stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work.
The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific
reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be
resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes an unlawful continuance.
   (c)   Revocation of permits. The local administrator may revoke and require
the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing,
stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for departure
from the approved application, plans, or specifications; for refusal or failure
to comply with the requirements of state or local laws; or for false statements
or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any permit issued in error
in violation of an applicable state or local law may also be revoked.
   (d)   Violations to be corrected. When the local administrator finds
violations of applicable state and local laws, he has the authority to notify
the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or occupant
shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property he owns
or occupies.
   (e)   Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of
a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
administrator shall give him written notice, by certified or registered mail to
his address provided on the application for permit or by personal service, that
the building or property is in violation of this article/
   (f)   Order to take corrective action. Pursuant to the notice prescribed
above, the administrator shall find that the building or development is in
violation of the this article, he shall make an order in writing to the owner,
requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such reasonable period.
Where the administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other
property, he may order that corrective action be taken in such lesser period as
may be feasible.
   (g)   Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice
of appeal in writing to the administrator within 10 days following issuance of
the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the administrator
shall be final. The Greenville County Construction Board of Adjustments and
Appeals shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify
and affirm, or revoke the order.
   (h)   Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal
has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body
following an appeal, he shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished
within the jurisdictional limits of magistrate's court. Each such person, firm,
corporation or agent shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each and
every day or portion thereof during which any violation of any of the
provisions of this article is committed, or continued.
   (i)   Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared
in violation of this article and the violation is not remedied then the local
administrator shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency to initiate
a Section 1316 of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 action against the
structure upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation
into compliance with this article. Once a violation has been remedied the local
administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the Section 1316 be
rescinded.

alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved.
Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures
cannot be located out of the areas of special flood hazard and that
encroachments onto the areas of special flood hazard are minimized. In all
areas of special flood hazard, as set forth in §
8-24, the following provisions are required:
   (a)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
   (b)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
with flood- resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage
in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials
Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from FEMA.
   (c)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed
by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.
   (d)   Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning
equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall be designed
so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of flooding, and at a minimum of 4 feet above the base flood
elevation (BFE). This requirement does not preclude the installation of outdoor
faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses, etc., as long as cut off devices and
back flow devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service
components and thereby minimize any flood damages to the building.
   (e)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
   (f)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters. Gravity sewer manholes must be
constructed at or above the base flood elevation or flood proofed.
   (g)   On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. Refer to
FEMA P-348, Edition 2/February 2017.
   (h)   All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or
buried, shall be anchored to prevent flotation and lateral movement resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure
must be in compliance with the provisions of this article, and shall meet the
requirements of new construction as contained in this article. This includes
both pre-FIRM and post-FIRM development and structures.
   (j)   Non-conforming buildings or uses may not be enlarged, replaced, or
rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in

been provided, as set forth in §
8-24 and §
8-30(c), the following provisions are required:
   (a)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
lowest floor and the associated electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and
air conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities,
elevated no lower than 4 feet above the base flood elevation. No basements are
permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of
floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with §
8-34(f).
   (b)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential structure
(including manufactured modular buildings) shall have the lowest floor and the
associated electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning

than 4 feet above the level of the base flood elevation. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient
to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with §
8-34(f). No basements are permitted. Structures may be floodproofed in lieu of
elevation provided that all areas of the structure below the required elevation
are watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water,
using structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy.
   A SC registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
standards of §
8-33 are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the official as
set forth in §§
8-29(b)(7) and
8-29(b)(8). A variance may be considered for wet floodproofing agricultural
structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in §
8-44. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of §
8-44 must meet the nonresidential construction standards and all other
applicable provisions of this article. Structures which are floodproofed are
required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The
maintenance plan must be approved by the local administrator and notification
of the annual exercise shall be provided to same.
   (c)   Critical development.
      (1)   Existing critical development located in the 1% or 0.2% area of
special flood hazard that are substantially damaged or improved shall be
elevated or floodproofed in accordance with §§

§ 8-34 MANUFACTURED HOMES, RECREATIONAL VEHICLES AND ELEVATED BUILDINGS.
   (a)   Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites
outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a new manufactured home
park or sub-division; in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood,
must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor and the
associated electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning
equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities of the
manufactured home is elevated no lower than 4 feet above the base flood
elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
   (b)   Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved on
sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not subject
to the provisions of §
8-34(a) must be elevated so that the lowest floor and the associated
electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air conditioning equipment
(including ductwork), and other service facilities of the manufactured home is
elevated no lower than 4 feet above the base flood elevation, and be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement.
   (c)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse,
or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement, manufactured homes
must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement in
accordance with Section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing
Board Regulations. When the elevation requirement would be met by an elevation
of the chassis at 36 inches or less above the grade at the site, the chassis
shall be supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least
equivalent strength. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in
height an engineering certification for the support system is required.
   (d)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all residents
of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged manufactured home
parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This plan shall be
filed with and approved by the local administrator and the local emergency
preparedness coordinator.
   (e)   Recreational vehicles. A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use
if it is on wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick-
disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached
additions. Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be on site for
fewer than 180 consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway
use, or meet the requirements of §§
8-32 (and its subsections) and
8-34 (and its subsections).
   (f)   Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas that are usable solely for
the parking of vehicles, building access, or storage in an area other than a
basement, and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to preclude
finished space and be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
Elevated buildings where the lowest floor is elevated more than 5 feet above
the base flood elevation must either: (1) provide from a South Carolina
licensed surveyor certify that the elevation below the lowest floor is at least
4 feet above the base flood elevation, or (2) execute a non-conversion
agreement.
      (1)   Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a SC Professional Engineer or Architect or meet the following
minimum criteria:
         a.   Provide a minimum of 2 openings on different walls having a total
net area of not less than 1 square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding;
         b.   The bottom of each opening must be no more than 1 foot above the
higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening;
         c.   Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood
elevation (BFE) may be counted towards the required net open area;
         d.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions; and
         e.   Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the
grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade
outside the building on at least 1 side of the building.
      (2)   Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in
the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for
debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than 5 feet per
second), foundation systems must be designed by a registered professional
engineer.
      (3)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
      (4)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms, except to enclose a single storage area and
must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required, and cannot
be temperature controlled. One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a
ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor
elevation specified in §§
8-33(a),
8-33(b),
8-34 (and its subsections).
      (5)   All construction materials below the required lowest floor
elevation specified in §§

§ 8-37 FLOODWAYS.
   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
8-24, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous
area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris and potential
projectiles. The following provisions shall apply within such areas:
   (a)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted.
   (b)   Stream crossings for any temporary purpose (i.e., timber harvesting
operations), shall be permitted in accordance with §
8-29(b). Otherwise, the development shall comply with all applicable flood
hazard reduction provisions of Article IV. Water, sewer, electrical
telecommunication lines and other public infrastructure may be located within
the floodway; however, they must be placed no lower than 4 feet above the base
flood elevation, or constructed utilizing floodproofing methods that prevent
the intrusion of flood waters, and causes no adverse effect on the floodway.
   (c)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted.
   (d)   Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming,
pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary,
game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also,
lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, biking, walking, hiking and
horseback riding trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do
not employ structures or fill. The uses listed in this subsection are
permissible only if it causes no adverse effect on the floodway.
(Ord. 4085, § 2, passed 2-20-2007; Ord. 4631, § 2, passed 6-17-2014; Ord. 5031,
passed 11-6-2018; Ord. 5276, passed 4-6-2021; Ord. 5613, § 1, passed 4-2-2024)
§ 8-38 FILL.
   Fill is discouraged because storage capacity is removed from floodplains.
Elevating buildings by other methods must be considered. An applicant shall
demonstrate that fill is the only alternative to raising the building to at
least 4 feet above the base flood elevation, and that the amount of fill used
will not affect the flood storage capacity or adversely affect adjacent
properties. The following provisions shall apply to all fill placed in the
special flood hazard area:
   (a)   Fill may not be placed in the area of special flood hazard except in
accordance with the provisions of §
8-38(f)
   (b)   Fill may not be placed in tidal or non-tidal wetlands without the
required state and federal permits;
   (c)   Fill must consist of soil and rock materials only. Dredged material
may be used as fill only upon certification of suitability by a registered
professional geotechnical engineer. Landfills, rubble fills, dumps, and
sanitary fills are not permitted in the floodplain;
   (d)   Fill used to support structures must comply with ASTM Standard D-698,
as amended and its suitability to support structures certified by a SC
Registered Professional Engineer;
   (e)   Fill slopes shall be no greater than 2 horizontal to 1 vertical.
Flatter slopes may be required where velocities may result in erosion; and
   (f)   No encroachment/development, including fill, shall be permitted within
the area of special flood hazard unless certification with supporting technical
data, prepared by a SC registered engineer, is provided to demonstrate that the
encroachment will not result in adverse impact to the floodplain. Adverse
impact includes, but is not limited to, any increase in base flood elevation,
floodway elevation and floodway width.
   The floodplain administrator will evaluate each encroachment/development and
determine which of the following options will be required.
      (1)   Option 1: Compensatory storage may be allowed for all storage lost
or displaced in a regulatory floodplain. Hydraulically equivalent compensatory
storage requirements for fill or structures in a riverine regulatory floodplain
shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of regulatory floodplain
storage lost or displaced. Such compensation areas shall be designed to drain
freely and openly to the channel and shall be located opposite or adjacent to
fill areas. A recorded deed or plat restriction is required to prohibit any
modification to the compensation area. The regulatory floodplain storage volume
lost below the existing ten-year frequency flood elevation must be replaced
below the proposed ten-year frequency flood elevation. The regulatory
floodplain storage volume lost above the ten-year existing frequency flood
elevation must be replaced above the proposed ten-year frequency elevation;
and/or
      (2)   Option 2: A detailed hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in
accordance with standard engineering practice that meets the requirements of
the NFIP. The analyses may incorporate compensatory storage at hydraulically
equivalent sites within the proposed project area as part of the required
demonstration.
   If the encroachment results in adverse impact to the floodplain, the
applicant shall submit to DHS-FEMA a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
or other appropriate map change application. Within 60 calendar days of
completion of construction activities, the applicant shall apply to DHS-FEMA
for a Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). The floodplain development permit will not
be issued until DHS-FEMA has issued the CLOMR. The applicant is responsible for
all technical submissions and fees required to obtain the CLOMR/LOMR (See §
8-29(b)(9)).

§ 8-39 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS.
   (a)   Standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or
floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
8-24, are small streams where no base flood data has been provided or where no
floodways have been identified (Flood Zone A). The following provisions apply
within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements or new development shall be permitted within 100 feet of the
stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a S.C.
registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such
encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge.
      (2)   If §
8-39(a)(1) is satisfied and base flood elevation data is available from other
sources, all new construction and substantial improvements within such areas
shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance provisions, and shall
be elevated or floodproofed to the elevations established in accordance with §
8-30(c). Data from preliminary, draft and final flood insurance studies
constitutes best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical
Bulletin 1-98 Use of Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Data as Available Data. If an
appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and
67.6, the data does not have to be used.
      (3)    When base flood elevation data is not available from a federal,
state, or other source, one of the following methods may be used to determine a
BFE, subject to approval by the local administrator. For further information
regarding the methods for determining BFEs listed below refer to FEMA's manual
Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas. See §§
8-30(c) and
8-40(c) for specific flood study requirements.
         a.   Contour interpolation.
            1.   Superimpose approximate Zone A boundaries onto a topographic
map and estimate a preliminary BFE; and
            2.   Add ½ of the contour interval of the topographic map to
determine the final BFE.
         b.   Data extrapolation. A BFE can be determined if a site is located
within 500 feet upstream of a stream reach for which a 100-year profile has
been computed by detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope
characteristics are relatively similar to the downstream reaches. No hydraulic
structures shall be present.
            c.   Hydrologic and hydraulic calculations. Perform hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations to determine BFEs using FEMA approved methods and
software.
      (4)   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation
data are not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analysis that generates base flood elevations for all subdivision
proposals and other proposed developments containing at least 30 lots or 3
acres, whichever is less.
   (b)   Standards for streams with established base flood elevations, but
without floodways. Along rivers and streams where base flood elevation (BFE)
data is provided but no floodway is identified for Special Flood Hazard Area on
the FIRM or in the FIS, the following provisions apply within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless a flood study is
provided with supporting technical data by a SC registered professional
engineer identifying the floodway boundary. Refer to §
8-37 for floodway restrictions.

§ 8-40 STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS.
   (a)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood infiltration damage. Access
roads, bridges and culverts located in or adjacent to the area of special flood
hazard shall meet the requirements of §
8-35.
   (b)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have
adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
   (c)   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals.
The base flood elevation data shall be obtained in accordance with §
8-24, or if the proposed subdivision area is unstudied (Zone A), then a flood
analysis study shall be prepared in accordance with §
8-30(c).
   (d)   All building lots containing areas of special flood hazard or
immediately adjacent to these areas shall have the proposed lowest floor
elevation for each structure, in accordance with §
8-33(a), noted on the preliminary and final plans.

§ 8-44 AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURES.
   Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure provided
it is used solely for agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages
during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure
must meet all of the conditions and considerations of §
8-47, this section, and the following standards:
   (a)   Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as
listed below:
      (1)   Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for
the storage of farm machinery and equipment;
      (2)   Steel grain bins and steel frame corn cribs;
      (3)   General-purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock which
are open on at least one side;
      (4)   For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy
operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be issued for
structures, which were substantially damaged. New construction or substantial
improvement of such structures must meet the elevation requirements of §
8-33(b); and
   (b)   The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an
existing building which is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant
materials for the exterior and interior building components and elements below
the base flood elevation.
   (c)   The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components
must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including
hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood
velocities exceed 5 feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert
considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls.
   (d)   The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of §
8-34(f)(1).
   (e)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located
4 feet above the base flood elevation or may be contained within a watertight,
floodproofed enclosure, which is capable of resisting damage during flood
conditions.
   (f)   The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment
provisions of §
8-37; and
   (g)   Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such
protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the
building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents,
permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood
elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents
without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site
out of the floodplain.

§ 8-45 CONSIDERATIONS.
   In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other sections of
this article, and:
   (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
   (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and
the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
   (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
   (e)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
   (f)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
   (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
   (h)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
   (i)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and
   (j)   Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain
areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure
exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting
of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be
in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the

§ 8-47 FLOODWAY VARIANCE.
   Floodway variances can only be issued by the Board. Variances shall not be
issued within any floodway identified in §
8-24 if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result, unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In order
to ensure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the
variance is granted the applicant must provide a bond for 100% of the cost to
perform the development.
(Ord. 4631, § 2, passed 6-17-2014; Ord. 5031, passed 11-6-2018; Ord. 5276,
passed 4-6-2021)
§ 8-48 CONDITIONS.
   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
article, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. The
following conditions shall apply to all variances.
   (a)   Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure
in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
   (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient
cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will
not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (d)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. Such notification shall be
maintained with a record of all variance actions.
   (e)   The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
upon request.
   (f)   Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other
development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this article.
Violations must be corrected in accordance with §
8-31(e).

§ 8-49 STREAMBANK RESTORATION.
   Upon approval of the floodplain administrator, shorelines or streambanks
that have experienced erosion may be restored to their condition as of the
current FIRM in that community without the need to provide compensatory storage
for the fill used to restore the eroded area according to the following
criteria: The restoration fill shall meet existing grades. Within riverine
areas the current effective regulatory floodplain and floodway conveyance shall
be maintained. The amount of eroded property being restored shall be documented
and submitted by the applicant with certification by a South Carolina licensed
surveyor or professional engineer as part of the permit process. Proper
documentation shall be either field survey information or photo documentation
of the erosion that has occurred for the property being restored. Additionally,
an endangered species and wetland verification/certification must also be
provided as part of the permit process.
   All Corp of Engineers regulations must be followed and may require a
separate permit. A Greenville County floodplain permit is also required prior
to any site disturbance. Placing of the fill shall not significantly alter the
alignment of the shoreline with adjoining properties as determined by the
administrator or designee.
   Replacement of banks shall be stabilized to withstand all events up to the
base flood without increased erosion.
   Upon completion of the stream bank restoration project, a SC registered
professional engineer must submit documentation with certification that the
placement of fill to restore the stream bank has not altered or impacted the
configuration of the watercourse, floodway or base flood elevation per the
current effective FIRM.

DIVISION 1. GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 8-61 TITLE.
   This article shall be known as the “Stormwater Management Ordinance of
Greenville County, South Carolina.”
(1976 Code, § 8-51) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-62 AUTHORITY.
   This article is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred upon the County
of Greenville (the “County”) by the South Carolina Constitution, the South
Carolina General Assembly and in compliance with the requirements imposed upon
the County by the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”)
Permit No. SC230001 issued in accordance with the federal Clean Water Act being
33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq., the South Carolina Pollution Control Act being S.C.
Code, Title 48, Ch. 1 and regulations promulgated thereunder.
(1976 Code, § 8-52) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-63 FINDINGS.
   Greenville County Council makes the following findings:
   (a)   Uncontrolled stormwater runoff may have significant, adverse impact on
the health, safety and general welfare of Greenville County and the quality of
life of its citizens by transporting pollutants into receiving waters and by
causing erosion or flooding.
   (b)   The County of Greenville is required by federal law (33 U.S.C. 1342(p)
and 40 CFR 122.26) to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
permit from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control
(“DHEC”) for stormwater discharges from the Greenville County Stormwater
System. The NPDES permit requires the County to impose controls to reduce the
discharge of pollutants in stormwater to maximum extent practicable using
management practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering
methods, and such other provisions which are determined to be appropriate for
the control of such pollutants.
   (c)   Additionally, certain facilities that discharge stormwater associated
with an industrial activity, including land disturbing activities, are required
to obtain NPDES permits. Also, the South Carolina Stormwater Management and
Sediment Reduction Act (S.C. Code §§ 48-14-10 et seq.) requires a state permit
for certain land disturbing activities.
(1976 Code, § 8-53) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-64 PURPOSE.
   (a)   It is the purpose of this article to protect, maintain, and enhance
the environment of Greenville County and the short-term and long-term public
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Greenville County by
establishing requirements and procedures to control the potential adverse
effects of increased stormwater runoff associated with both future development
and existing developed land. Proper management of stormwater runoff will
minimize damage to public and private property, ensure a functional drainage
system, reduce the effects of development on land and stream channel erosion,
attain and maintain water quality standards, enhance the local environment
associated with the drainage system, reduce local flooding, reduce pollutant
loading to the maximum extent practicable and maintain to the extent
practicable the pre-developed runoff characteristics of the area, and
facilitate economic development while mitigating associated pollutant, flooding
and drainage impacts.
   (b)   It is further the purpose of this article to comply with the Federal
and corresponding state stormwater discharge (NPDES) regulations (40 CFR 122.26
and South Carolina Regulation 61-9.122.26) developed pursuant to the Clean
Water Act, being 33 U.S.C. §§ 1251 et seq. and to ensure that Greenville County
has the authority to take any action required by it to obtain and comply with
its NPDES permit for stormwater discharges. Among other things, these
regulations require Greenville County to establish legal authority which
authorizes or enables Greenville County at a minimum to:
      (1)   Control the contribution of pollutants to the Greenville County MS4
and receiving waters by stormwater discharges associated with residential,
commercial, industrial, and related facilities activity and the quality of
stormwater discharged from sites of residential, commercial, industrial, and
related facilities activity;
      (2)   Prohibit illicit discharges to the Greenville County MS4 and
receiving waters;
      (3)   Control, the discharge to the Greenville County MS4 and receiving
waters of spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than stormwater;
      (4)   Control, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of
pollutants from one municipal stormwater system to another;
      (5)   Require compliance with conditions in ordinances, permits,
contracts or orders;
      (6)   Carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures
necessary to determine compliance and noncompliance with permit conditions
including the prohibition on illicit discharges to Greenville County MS4 and
receiving waters.
   (c)   The application of this article and the provisions expressed herein
shall be the minimum stormwater management requirements and shall not be deemed
a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by statute. In addition, if
site characteristics indicate that complying with these minimum requirements
will not provide adequate designs or protection for local property or
residents, it is the responsibility of the owner and the operator to provide
appropriate management practices, control techniques and system, design and
engineering methods and such other programs and controls as are required by
Greenville County’s NPDES permit.
   (d)   This article is to be construed to further its purpose of controlling
and reducing pollutant discharges to the Greenville County MS4 and thus to the
Waters of the State to assure the obligations under its NPDES permit issued by
the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) as required by 33
U.S.C. 1342 and 40 CFR 122.26.
(1976 Code, § 8-54) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-65 CONSTRUCTION AND SCOPE.
   (a)   It is the goal of the Greenville County Council that the provisions of
this article will result in reduction of the discharge of pollutants to the
Greenville County MS4 and thus its receiving waters to the maximum extent
practicable using management practices, control techniques and system, design
and engineering methods and such other programs and controls as are required by
Greenville County’s NPDES permit.
   (b)   The application of this article, the provisions expressed herein, and
the Federal and State stormwater regulations shall be minimum stormwater
management requirements and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any
other ordinances of Greenville County or powers granted to Greenville County by
the State of South Carolina statues, including, without limitation, the power
to require additional or more stringent stormwater management requirements.
   (c)   This article is also construed to further its purpose of controlling
stormwater runoff in Greenville County to reduce flooding using best management
practices, control techniques and system, design and engineering methods and
such other programs and controls as necessary to achieve this goal.
   (d)   The provisions of this article shall apply throughout the
unincorporated areas of Greenville County and within any municipality that
chooses to participate as a co-permittee with the County in its NPDES permit.
   (e)   The Director shall be primarily responsible for the coordination and
enforcement of the provisions of this article, the Greenville Stormwater
Management Program, and Greenville County’s NPDES permit.
(1976 Code, § 8-55) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-66 SEVERABILITY.
   Should any word, phrase, clause or provision of this article be declared
invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
declaration shall not affect this article as a whole or any part hereof except
that specific provision declared such court to be invalid or unconstitutional.
(1976 Code, § 8-56) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-67 PROHIBITIONS AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (a)   No person shall:
      (1)   Develop any land,
      (2)   Engage in any industry or enterprise,
      (3)   Construct, operate or maintain any landfill, hazardous waste
treatment, disposal or recovery facility, or any other industrial or related
facility, or
      (4)   Dispose of any hazardous or toxic substance or other pollutant
without having provided for compliance with this article and with any program,
plan, permit, or regulation of the Greenville County Stormwater Management
Program (SWMP) adopted in accordance with this article.
   (b)   The following development activities are exempt from the provisions of
this article:
      (1)   Construction or improvement of single family residences or their
accessory buildings which are separately built and not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale and which are anticipated to disturb an area of
less than 5,000 square feet.
      (2)   Land disturbing activities on agricultural land for production of
plants and animals useful to man, including but not limited to: forages and sod
crops, grains and feed crops, tobacco, cotton, and peanuts; dairy animals and
dairy products; poultry and poultry products; livestock, including beef cattle,
sheep, swine, horses ponies, mules, or goats, including the breeding and
grazing of these animals; bees; fur animals and aquaculture, except that the
construction of an agricultural structure resulting in the disturbance of one
or more acres of land are not exempt from the provisions of this article.
      (3)   Land disturbing activities undertaken on forestland for the
production and harvesting of timber and timber products. For sites that are
substantially cleared of trees, pursuant to legitimate forestry activities, no
land development applications that would result in a change from forestland to
non-forest or non-agricultural use shall be approved for 12 months after the
date the clearing is completed, in accordance with S.C. Code § 48-23-205(C)(1)
(a).
      (4)   Activities undertaken by persons who are otherwise regulated by the
provisions of S.C. Code Title 48, Chapter 20, the South Carolina Mining Act.
      (5)   Certain land disturbing activities undertaken by persons who are

Act as set forth in S.C. Code § 48-14-40, as amended.
(1976 Code, § 8-72) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015; Ord. 4745, passed 10-6-2015)
§ 8-68 CONTIGUOUS PROPERTY.
   In order to preclude inappropriate phasing of developments to circumvent the
intent of this article, when a proposed development activity will occur on a
lot or parcel that has contiguous lots or parcels of lands owned in whole, or
in part, by the same property owner, the criteria defined in §
8-78 will be applied to the total land area comprising the contiguous lots or
parcels of lands. The criteria defined in §
8-78 also applies to any development regardless of size or disturbed area that
is part of a larger common plan of development or sale.
(Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009; Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-69 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The Director shall develop, maintain, implement, and enforce such design or
engineering standards, as may be required, that is consistent with the
Stormwater Management Program and provides a sound technical basis for the
achievement of storm water management and water quality objectives.
   (a)   The Director shall develop and maintain a Stormwater Management Design
Manual in accordance with the approved Stormwater Management Program. The
Stormwater Management Design Manual shall serve as guidance for the design,
construction, and maintenance of facilities which discharge stormwater. The
Stormwater Management Design Manual shall be used to assist in the design and
evaluation of stormwater management facilities in the County of Greenville. The
Stormwater Management Design Manual will include, but not be limited to,
guidance in selecting environmentally sound practices for managing stormwater.
Description of specific techniques and practices shall be included. Use of
techniques emphasizing use of natural systems shall be encouraged.
      Best Management Practices (BMPs) can be either structural or non-
structural and may be enforced by specific prescription in zoning requirements,
subdivision regulations, or on a site-specific basis as may be prescribed to
meet Stormwater Management Program objectives. The Stormwater Management Design
Manual shall be updated periodically to reflect the most current and effective
practices and shall be made available to the public. The Stormwater Management
Design Manual is not designed to replace the need for engineering judgment.
Other accepted best management practices may be used and will be encouraged if
they equal or exceed the performance of practices contained in the Stormwater
Management Design Manual and they are approved by the Director.
      Although the intention of the Stormwater Management Design Manual is to
establish uniform design practices, it neither replaces the need for
engineering judgment nor precludes the use of information not presented. Other
accepted engineering procedures may be used to conduct hydrologic and hydraulic
studies if approved by the Director. The Manual will include, but not be
limited to:
         a.   Guidance and specifications for the preparation of comprehensive
Stormwater pollution prevention plans. Acceptable techniques for obtaining,
calculating and presenting the information required in the plans shall be
described, as will design conditions which must be accounted for;
         b.   Minimum specifications for designing, constructing, and
maintaining Stormwater management facilities. These specifications shall be
established in accordance with current good engineering practices;
         c.   Post-development performance standards for stormwater management
facilities and practices. Methodology/criteria for evaluation will include:
            1.   Hydrologic and hydraulic evaluations;
            2.   Evaluation of best management practices (BMPs); and
            3.   Evaluation of downstream impacts.
   (b)   The Director shall develop and maintain a Best Management Practices
(BMP) Field Manual in accordance with the approved Stormwater Management
Program. The BMP Field Manual shall serve as a during construction guidance
document for inspectors and contractors for the installation, construction, and
maintenance of BMPs which discharge stormwater. The BMP Field Manual is not
designed to replace the need for engineering judgment. Other acceptable
management practices may be used and will be encouraged if they equal or exceed
the performance of practices contained in the Stormwater Management Design
Manual and they are approved by the Director.

DIVISION 3. PERMIT AND SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS
§ 8-76 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   Federal regulations governing stormwater management, as specified in 40
C.F.R. 122.26, and State regulations, as specified in South Carolina Regulation
61-9.122.26 adopted pursuant thereto, and South Carolina Regulation 72.300 et
seq. are adopted as the minimum requirements for all facilities as defined in
the respective regulations.
(1976 Code, § 8-64) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-77 SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Requirements of operators:
      (1)   An owner, developer(s), or operator of a project is a primary
permittee. This person meets the definitions of operator. This person may
include, but is not limited to a developer, landowner, realtor, builder,
utility provider, public or private entity. The primary permittee is
responsible for preparation of the Comprehensive SWPPP and to comply with the
requirements of this article and the most current SC NPDES Permit for Storm
Water Discharges from Construction Activities (GCP).
      (2)   In developing plans for residential subdivisions, individual lots
in a residential subdivision development shall be required to obtain and comply
with the OS-SWPPP and the residential subdivision development, as a whole,
shall be considered a Larger Common Plan for Development or Sale (LCP) and to
be a single land disturbing activity requiring a C-SWPPP. Hydrologic parameters
that reflect the Larger Common Plan for Development or Sale shall be used in
all engineering calculations.
      (3)   If individual lots or sections in a residential subdivision are
being developed by different operators, all land disturbing activities related
to the residential subdivision shall be covered by the approved C-SWPPP for the
residential subdivision. If the primary permittee obtains coverage under a C-
SWPPP for the development and then sells lots within the development, then
coverage under this permit may either continue with the primary permittee or
the primary permittee may require that the new lot owner (or the new lot owner
may choose to) obtain their own coverage under the C-SWPPP as a secondary
permittee. The primary permittee must make the OS-SWPPP and a copy of the GCP
available to the new owner seeking individual lot(s) coverage.
      (4)   When the operator (new owner) makes changes after the C-SWPPP has
been approved the new owner must notify the County in writing within 14
calendar days. The new owner may not commence work at the construction site
until the C-SWPPP has been modified with the new owner information and they
have received NOI coverage from SCDHEC. If the new owner elects to modify the
layout of the construction site, thereby altering the approved C-SWPPP then the
new owner must apply for a new permit and new NOI coverage.
      (5)   If an individual lot owner or residential builder elects to not
follow the drainage provisions in the primary permittee’s approved OS-SWPPP,
the County will require the individual lot owner or residential builder to
obtain coverage under their own C-SWPPP as a primary permittee.
      (6)   If a lending institution takes operational control of a
construction site due to foreclosure, permittee filing for bankruptcy,
abandonment etc. then that entity is responsible for construction site’s
stormwater discharges. A permit is required under this article prior to the
entity initiating construction activity at the site.
      (7)   Contractors employed by the primary or secondary permittee whose
work at the construction site may disturb soils or whose work may otherwise be
necessary to implement the OS-SWPPP must complete a contractor certification
form or must submit an annual Blanket Notice of Intent covering all
construction activities within a LCP statewide to SCDHEC.
   (b)   Residential subdivisions which were approved prior to the effective
date of these regulations and have an active approved land disturbance permit
with Greenville. Greenville at the time of the effective date re exempt from
these requirements but must comply with the article requirements that were in
effect at the time that the phase of residential subdivision permitted were
approved. They must also comply with the requirements of the most current SC
NPDES Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Construction Activities as outlined
under Section 2.4.2 of that permit. Development of new phases of existing
subdivisions which were not included in the total disturbed area of an active
land disturbance permit shall comply with the provisions of these regulations
and the most current SC NPDES Permit for Stormwater Discharges from
Construction Activities (GCP).
      (1)   When the subdivision development reaches the condition where it is
50% built the following actions must be taken:
         a.   Where a detention pond is installed as-built certification and
drawings are due to the Director; and
         b.   The detention pond shall be cleaned of all deposited sediment,
and overgrowth of invasive vegetation (weeds, vines, shrubs, trees) shall be
removed, and all areas of the detention pond shall have reached final
stabilization;
         c.   A new home owner’s association document must be filed with the
Director defining the new contact person for the responsible party for
maintaining the detention pond and/or any water quality features or BMPs
installed in the subdivision.
         d.   The primary permittee may elect at this stage of development to
request for a Notice of Termination of the permit coverage and closure of the
land disturbance permit with the County as long as all common area and rights
of way have reached final stabilization and secondary permittees have NOI
coverage for the lots under their ownership.
      (2)   When the subdivision development is developed to a point between
50% and 90% built, individual lot controls as well as other erosion and
sediment control BMPs shall provide the sediment control to meet 80% trapping
efficiency rather than only the sediment/detention pond. Once the subdivision
is 90% or greater built and the disturbed areas are stabilized according to the
requirements of South Carolina Regulations 100000 and 72-300 then all
permittees may file a request for a Notice of Termination of the permit
coverage for the subdivision.
   (c)   Land disturbing activities involving more than 5,000 square feet but
less than 1 acre of actual land disturbance which are not part of a larger
common plan of development or sale, operator shall submit a simplified
Stormwater Management and Sediment Control Plan (SMSCP) meeting the
requirements listed below. This plan does not require approval by SCDHEC and
does not require preparation or certification by the designers.
      (1)   A narrative description of the stormwater management facilities to
be used (if applicable).

(GIS) Division’s internet mapping system.
      (6)   A sketch plan or use a GIS map to accompany the narrative which
shall contain:
         a.   Site location drawing of the proposed project, indicating the
location of the proposed project in relation to roadways, jurisdictional
boundaries, streams and rivers; the boundary lines of the site on which the
work is to be performed;
         b.   All areas within the site which will be included in the land
disturbing activities shall be identified and the total disturbed area
calculated;
         c.   A topographic contours of the site;
         d.   Anticipated starting and completion dates of the various stages
of land disturbing activities and the expected date the final stabilization
will be completed.
         e.   The location of temporary and permanent vegetative and structural
sediment/erosion control BMPs and stormwater management control measures (if
applicable).
      (7)   Simplified SMSCP shall contain certification by the operator that
the land disturbing activities will be accomplished pursuant to the plan.
      (8)   Simplified SMSCP shall contain certification by the operator of the
right of the Director to conduct on-site inspections.
   (d)   Land disturbing activities disturbing 1 or more acres or will result
in more than 1 cubic foot per second increase in peak runoff rates, requires a
storm drain pipe conveyance system (1 or more pipes), or alterations to
existing storm drain systems, or cause downstream impact requiring preparation
by an engineer or design professional, all of the requirements of C-SWPPP as
described in §
8-78 shall apply. For sites that disturbed less than 1 acre but meet 1 or more
of the other criteria listed the Director has the discretion to reduce some of
the requirements of the C-SWPPP as described in §
8-78.
   (e)   Commercial and industrial sites which disturb 5,000 square feet but
less than 1 acre of area and otherwise are not part of a LCP may be eligible to
submit a simplified plan as described in §
8-77(c). If any of the constraints listed in §
8-77(d) are required as part of the C-SWPPP then the plan must meet some or all
of the requirements of §
8-78.

DIVISION 5. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT
§ 8-84 MINIMUM RUNOFF CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   The Storm Water Management and Sediment Control section of the C-SWPPP shall
comply with SCDHEC’s Regulations 72-300 and the NPDES General Permit for Storm
Water Discharges from Construction Activities and contain minimum storm water
control requirements to accomplish the following:
   (a)   Storm water management facilities to limit the 2-year, 10-year and 25-
year developed peak discharge rates to pre-developed peak discharge rates using
a storm with a duration of 24 hours with a SCS Type II distribution and pass
the 100-year, 24-hour storm event. The design of these facilities shall be
based on; procedures contained in the Storm Water Management Design Manual or
approved by the Director.
   (b)   The requirements, or portions of this section may be waived by the
Director if it can be shown by detailed engineering calculations and analysis
which are acceptable to the Director that one of the following conditions
exist:
      (1)   The installation of storm water management facilities would have
insignificant effects on reducing downstream flood peaks; or
      (2)   The installation of storm water management facilities are not
needed to protect downstream developments and the downstream drainage system
has sufficient capacity to receive any increase in runoff for the design storm;
or
      (3)   The installation of storm water management facilities to control
developed peak discharge rates at the exit to a proposed development would
increase flood peaks at some downstream locations; or
      (4)   The installation of storm water management facilities are not
needed to control developed peak discharge rates and installing such facilities
would not be in the best interest of the County.
   (c)   The requirements, or portions thereof, of §
8-84(a) may not be waived if the Director determines that not controlling
downstream flood peaks would increase known flooding problems, or exceed the
capacity of the downstream drainage system.
   (d)   A waiver shall only be granted after a written request is submitted by
the applicant containing descriptions, drawings, and any other information that
is necessary to evaluate the proposed land disturbing activity. A separate
written waiver request shall be required if there are subsequent additions,
extensions, or modifications which would alter the approved storm water runoff
characteristics to a land disturbing activity receiving a waiver. The Director
will conduct a review of the request for a waiver within 10 working days.
Failure of the Director to act by the end of the tenth working day will result
in the automatic approval of the waiver.
   (e)   For all storm water management facilities, a hydrologic-hydraulic
study shall be done showing how the drainage system will function with and
without the proposed facilities. For such studies the following land use
conditions shall be used. Existing land use data shall be determined by
comparing the most recent aerial photograph to historical aerial photographs at
the period of time prior to the County adopting storm water management
requirements and field checked to confirm the current site conditions.
      (1)   For the design of the facility outlet structure, use developed land
use conditions for the area within the proposed development and existing land
use conditions for upstream areas draining to the facility.
      (2)   For any analysis of flood flows downstream from the proposed
facility, use existing land use conditions for all downstream areas.
      (3)   All storm water management facilities emergency spillways shall be
checked using the 100-year storm and routing flows through the facility and
emergency spillways. For this analysis, developed land use conditions shall be
used for all areas within the analysis.
      (4)   The effects of existing upstream detention facilities can be
considered in the hydrologic-hydraulic study.
   (f)   A downstream peak flow analysis which includes the assumptions,
results and supporting calculations to show safe passage of post-development
design flows downstream. The analysis of downstream conditions in the report
shall address each and every point or area along the project site’s boundaries
at which runoff will exit the property. The analysis shall focus on the portion
of the drainage channel or watercourse immediately downstream from the project.
This area shall extend downstream from the project to a point in the drainage
basin where the total area of the development comprises 10% of the total basin
area. In calculating runoff volumes and discharge rates, consideration may need
to be given to any planned future upstream land use changes. The analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the County’s Storm Water Design Manual.
   (g)   All storm water systems shall be designed to have no increase in
velocity, peak flow, water surface level elevation in relationship to upstream,
adjacent, and downstream property in the 100-year storm, unless an adequate
permanent drainage easement is obtained.
(1976 Code, § 8-80) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-85 MINIMUM WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   All storm water runoff generated from a site shall be adequately
treated before discharge in order to ensure maximum pollutant removal is
achieved to the extent where these discharges shall not cause or contribute to
violations of the water quality standards. It will be presumed that a storm
water management system complies with this requirement if:
      (1)   The preferred method is to design water quality BMPs to trap 85% of
total suspended solids (TSS) based on annual loadings by particle class. An
alternative method as a default criterion is to design BMPs, to capture the
first inch of runoff from the impervious area of the site and discharge it over
a 24-hour period.
      (2)   The Director has discretion to require more stringent controls for
water quality where the Director determines the minimum standards of this
section are not adequate. Areas where more stringent controls may apply include
outstanding resource waters, trout waters, wetlands, steep slopes, 303(d)
listed waters, TMDLs or other sensitive areas.
   (b)   All development and redevelopment projects and portions of
redevelopment projects disturbing 1 acre or more or that will result in more
than 1 cubic foot per second increase in peak runoff rates shall meet the
requirements of this section even though there is not a change in land use.
(Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009; Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-86 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.
   (a)   Stormwater management facilities may include structural and non-
structural practices. Natural swales and other natural runoff conduits shall be
retained where practicable.
   (b)   Where additional stormwater management facilities are required to
satisfy the minimum control requirements, the following measures are examples
of what may be used in their order of preference:
      (1)   Low impact development (LID) practices, such as minimizing the area
of streets, parking lots and rooftops; bio-retention swales and basins; porous
pavement; or other innovative measures to reduce runoff volume and protect
water quality;
      (2)   Facilities designed to encourage overland flow, slow velocities of
flow, and flow through buffer zones;
      (3)   Regional stormwater detention structures (dry basins);
      (4)   Regional stormwater retention structures (wet basins);
      (5)   On-site stormwater detention structures (dry basins);
      (6)   On-site stormwater retention structures (wet basins); and
      (7)   Infiltration practices, where permeable soils are present.
   (c)   Where detention and retention structures are used, designs which
consolidate these facilities into a limited number of large structures are
preferred over designs which utilize a large number of small structures, unless
LID features are used to provide post construction water quality.
   (d)   C-SWPPPs can be rejected by the Director if they incorporate
structures and facilities which have the potential to result in significant
long-term maintenance problems. The structure design parameters outlined in the
Design Manual must be met to prevent being rejected.
   (e)   The drainage system and all stormwater management structures within
the County (including both public and private portions) will be designed to the
same engineering and technical criteria and standards. The Land Development
Division’s review will be the same whether the portion of the drainage system
will be under public or private control or ownership.
   (f)   All stormwater management measures shall be designed in accordance
with the design criteria contained in the Stormwater Management Design Manual
using procedures contained in this manual or procedures approved by the
Director.
(1976 Code, § 8-81) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-87 HYDROLOGIC CRITERIA.
   The hydrologic criteria to be used for the C-SWPPP’s Stormwater Management
and Sediment Control section shall be as follows:
   (a)   Twenty-five-year 24-hour duration design storm for all cross-drain
culverts and drainage designs.
   (b)   Ten-year design storm for all interior culverts and drainage
conveyance system designs, plus 25-year design storm for all channels
conveyances.
   (c)   Two-year, 10-year and 25-year design storms for all detention and
retention basins using procedures contained in the Stormwater Management Design
Manual or approved by the Director.
   (d)   All drainage designs shall be checked using the 100-year storm for
analysis of local flooding, and possible flood hazards to adjacent structures
and/or property.
   (e)   All hydrologic analysis will be based on land use conditions.
   (f)   For the design of storage facilities, a secondary outlet device or
emergency spillway shall be provided to discharge the excess runoff in such a
way that no danger of loss of life or facility failure is created. The size of
the outlet device or emergency spillway shall be designed to pass the 100-year
storm as a minimum requirement.
(1976 Code, § 8-83) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;

§ 8-88 FEE-IN-LIEU OF ON-SITE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT FACILITIES.
   (a)   The Director may allow the payment of a fee-in-lieu of on-site
stormwater storage to fulfill all or part of the on-site stormwater storage
requirement.
   (b)   The following fee-in-lieu of stormwater storage procedures shall be
used by the Director for requiring and collecting fee-in-lieu of revenues for
stormwater storage requirements in this article:
      (1)   The applicant may submit a written request for the payment of a
fee-in-lieu of on-site stormwater storage to fulfill all or part of the on-site
detention requirements established by this article. A request for fee-in-lieu
of on-site stormwater storage shall be either rejected or approved by the
Director within 45 days of the written request unless additional engineering
studies are required.
      (2)   Fee-in-lieu of on-site stormwater storage shall be the estimated
construction cost of the applicant’s proposed and approved on-site stormwater
storage, including land costs, as approved by the Director.
   (c)   A fund will be maintained by the County for the purpose of identifying
and controlling all revenues and expenditures resulting from fee-in-lieu of on-
site stormwater storage approvals. All fee-in-lieu of on-site stormwater
storage revenues received from each watershed shall be deposited in these funds
for use within that watershed.
   (d)   Fee-in-lieu of on-site stormwater storage revenues may be used to
plan, design or construct an upgrade to existing or future stormwater
management systems if the upgrades are consistent with a stormwater master
plan, floodplain study or stormwater system improvement that has been approved
the Director.
   (e)   All fees shall be refunded to the person who paid the fee, or to the
person’s successor in interest, whenever the County fails to encumber the fees
collected within 10 years from the date on which such fees are collected.
Refunds shall be made provided the person, who paid the fee, or that person’s
successor, files a request with the County for the return of the fees within 1
year from the date on which the fees are required to be encumbered.

(Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009; Ord. passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-91 OWNERSHIP AND COUNTY PARTICIPATION.
   (a)   All stormwater management facilities required by this article shall be
privately owned and maintained unless the County accepts the facility for
County ownership and maintenance.
   (b)   When the Director determines that additional storage requirements for
water quantity and/or water quality beyond that required by the owner for on-
site stormwater management is necessary in order to enhance or provide for the
public health, safety and general welfare, to correct unacceptable or
undesirable existing conditions or to provide protection in a more desirable
fashion for future development, the County may agree to participate financially
in the construction of such facility to the extent that such facility exceeds
the required on-site stormwater management as determined by the Director. The
Director and the owner will jointly develop a cost sharing plan which is
agreeable to both parties.

§ 8-96 RESOURCE REMEDIATION FUND.
   (a)   A monetary performance guarantee for every new development is
required. This guarantee will provide assurance that all exposed soil surfaces
will be stabilized and any other areas of stormwater management and sediment
control deficiency addressed, in the event a development discontinues or proper
control measures are not installed and/or maintained.
   (b)   Prior to the issuance of any building and/or land disturbance permit
for a development or phase of development, every applicant must pay Greenville
County a non-refundable Resource Remediation Fee. The non-refundable Resource
Remediation Fee is set at $150 per disturbed acre. These fees will be held in a
separate, use restricted, interest bearing account known collectively as the
Resource Remediation Fund (the “RRF”). Monies deposited into the RRF may be
used by the County to remediate sites that have been abandoned, sites left in
an unstable condition, or sites with stormwater management or sediment control
deficiencies, as determined by the Director. By submitting an application for
land disturbing activity, each applicant gives the County express authority to
enter upon the subject property during and after development activities for the
purpose of performing inspections and/or needed remediation, as determined by
the Director.
   (c)   For all new development and all redevelopment of sites, an applicant
must provide to the County a notarized certification that the applicant has no
known direct or indirect contractual, business, financial, or familial
relationship (“relationship”) to a RRF site where fund money is outstanding or
operator at such site. Based on this statement, the County has the right to
request, and the applicant must supply, additional specific information
concerning any such affiliations.
   (d)   For sites at which monies from the RRF are spent, an applicant with a
relationship to any operator on such RRF site(s) or a relationship with a
person who in the past has significantly failed to comply with any provision of
this article or previously issued permit, will not be allowed to further
participate in this program and no further review of a permit for land
disturbing activity will be conducted by the County or permit issued, until
such time that all RRF monies are repaid to the County in full by the applicant
or other such related person. This is in addition to any other penalty or
injunctive relief authorized under this article.
   (e)   Staff will review funding on an annual basis and recommend any needed

DIVISION 9. SPECIAL POLLUTION ABATEMENT PERMITS
§ 8-105 GENERAL.
   (a)   A Special Pollution Abatement Permit is required when development or
re-development occurs within a watershed that drains to a waterbody listed as
impaired by the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control
or has an established total maximum daily load (TMDL) developed and implemented
for a pollutant(s) of concern to ensure that effective best management
practices are used to control water quality for these waterbodies. A Special
Pollution Abatement Permit will be valid for a period of 5 years, at which
point it must be renewed. At the time of renewal, any deficiencies in the
control of the targeted pollutants or management method must be corrected. Any
development that occurs without a required permit shall be a violation of this
chapter of the code.
   (b)   Development in other areas known to have particular adverse water
quality pollutant impacts may be required to comply with this section at the
discretion of the Director. Areas that qualify have been identified by sampling
and monitoring results and are given as priority areas for water quality
treatment. Outstanding resource waters may also qualify for compliance under
this section for protection of their classification.

DIVISION 10. MONITORING AND INSPECTIONS
§ 8-111 MONITORING.
   The Director shall monitor the quantity of, and the concentration of
pollutants in stormwater discharges from the areas and/or locations designated
in the Greenville County Stormwater Management Program.
(1976 Code, § 8-101) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-112 INSPECTIONS.
   (a)   The Director and/or other authorized personnel, bearing proper
credentials and identification, may enter and inspect all properties for
regular inspections, periodic investigations, monitoring, observation
measurement, enforcement, sampling and testing, to effectuate the provisions of
this article and of the SWMP programs. The Director shall duly notify the owner
of said property or the representative on site and the inspection shall be
conducted at reasonable times.
   (b)   Upon refusal by any property owner to permit an inspector to enter or
continue an inspection, the inspector shall terminate the inspection or confine
the inspection to areas concerning which no objection is raised. The inspector
shall immediately report the refusal and the grounds to the Director. The
Director and/or other authorized personnel shall promptly seek appropriate
compulsory process.
   (c)   In the event that the Director or the designee reasonably believes
that discharges from the property into the Greenville County MS4 may cause an
imminent and substantial threat to human health or the environment, the
inspection may take place at any time and without notice to the owner of the
property or a representative on site. The inspector shall present proper
credentials upon reasonable request by the owner or representative.
   (d)   Inspection reports shall be maintained in a permanent file located in
the Land Development Division office.
   (e)   At any time during the conducting of an inspection or at such other
times as the Director or his designee may request information from an owner or
representative, the owner or representative may identify areas of its facility
or establishment, material or processes which contains or which might reveal a
trade secret. If the Director or his designee has no clear and convincing
reason to question such identification, all material, processes and all
information obtained within such areas shall be conspicuously labeled
“CONFIDENTIAL - TRADE SECRET.” The trade secret designation shall be freely
granted to any material claimed to be such by the owner or representative
unless there is clear and convincing evidence for denying such designation. In
the event the Director does not agree with the trade secret designation, the
material shall be temporarily designated a trade secret and the owner or
representative may request an appeal of the Director’s decision in the manner
in which all such appeals are handled in this article.
   (f)   All trade secret material which are prepared or obtained by or for the
Director shall be marked as such and filed in a secure place separate from
regular, non-secret files, and documents. Reports from samples prepared or
obtained by or for the Director or Appeal Board or submitted for laboratory
analysis shall be marked as such and treated in the same manner as other trade
secret material. Trade secret material shall not be divulged by the Director to
anyone other than:
      (1)   Other employees of the County or employees of the State or Federal
governments engaged in an inspection or enforcement proceeding involving the
designated material; and
      (2)   To administrative or judicial courts upon order to so divulge the
material to the court.

§ 8-113 CONSTRUCTION INSPECTION.
   Inspection and enforcement can be divided into two distinct categories,
during construction and post construction. Construction inspection ensures that
the storm drainage systems, stormwater management facilities and erosion and
sediment control measures are constructed and installed in accordance with the
approved C-SWPPP and OS-SWPPP. All construction inspection shall conform as
outlined in the most current SCDHEC NPDES General Permit for Stormwater
Discharges for Construction Activities. In addition, the following apply:
   (a)   No stage of work, related to the construction of stormwater management
facilities, shall proceed the next preceding stage of work, according to the
sequence specified in the approved staged construction and inspection control
schedule until it is inspected and approved.
   (b)   The permittee shall notify the Land Development Division before
commencing any work to implement the OS-SWPPP and upon completion of the work.
   (c)   Third party inspections, by a qualified individual who is independent
of the owner must comply as outlined in the most current SCDHEC’s NPDES General
Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Construction Activities or may be
required at the discretion of the Director at sites that have compliance
problems and at sites where stormwater discharges to environmental sensitive
waters (such as waters classified as Trout Waters, Outstanding Resource Waters,
Shellfish Harvesting Waters, etc.).
   (d)   Once construction is complete, a final inspection will be conducted,
and as-built documentation will be submitted to show that the constructed
project meets the requirements of the approved C-SWPPP and OS-SWPPP. At this
point the land disturbance permit is closed and the responsibility for the
operation and maintenance of the storm drainage systems and stormwater
management facilities is transferred from the operator to the persons
responsible for maintenance.
   (e)   The operator shall provide an “as-built” plan certified by a
registered professional to be submitted upon completing of the stormwater
management facilities included in the C-SWPPP. The registered professional
shall certify that:
      (1)   The facilities have been constructed as shown on the “as-built”
plan; and
      (2)   The facilities meet the approved C-SWPPP or achieve the function
for which they were designed.
   (f)   Acceptable “as-built” plans shall be submitted prior to:
      (1)   The use or occupancy of any commercial or industrial site.
      (2)   Final acceptance of any road into the Official County Road
Inventory.
      (3)   Release of any performance security held by the County.
      (4)   Approval of a new C-SWPPP if the plan proposes to use an existing
stormwater management facilities that does not have an acceptable “as-built”
plan on file at the Land Development Division’s office.
      (5)   Approval and/or acceptance for recording of map plat or drawing,
the intent of which is to cause a division of a single parcel of land into 2 or
more parcels.
   (g)   The Director shall report the performance of any non-performing
Certified Erosion and Sediment Control Inspector to the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control and to Clemson University for
appropriate action.
   (h)   After construction is complete the persons responsible for maintenance
are required to conduct periodic inspections of the stormwater management
facilities, features or BMPs. Inspections must be documented and maintenance
for future verification. The County will conduct periodic post-construction
compliance inspections. During the compliance inspections the persons
responsible for maintenance may be required to provide copies of their
inspection and maintenance activities documentation to the County.
(1976 Code, § 8-85) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;

DIVISION 11. ENFORCEMENT, PENALTIES, AND ABATEMENT
§ 8-121 VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Upon determination that a Violation of any of the provisions of this
article or the SWMP has occurred, the Director may give timely actual notice at
the property where the violation has occurred or at the address of the permit
holder and shall give written notice to the violator within 15 days. This
notice shall specify: the nature of the violation, the potential penalty, if
applicable, the corrective action required, which may include restoration of
impact to offsite land and waters, and the amount of time in which to correct
deficiencies, if appropriate. It shall be sufficient notification to deliver
the notice to the person to whom it is addressed, or to deposit a copy of such
in the United States Mail, properly stamped, certified and addressed to the
address used for tax purposes.
   (b)   Upon determination that a violation of any of the provisions of this
article or the SWMP have occurred, the County may choose to pursue in
magistrate court action for criminal and/or civil fines and penalties to the
maximum extent allowed by law. The County may also choose at its sole
discretion, to proceed with a consent process. The first step for the consent
process is for the County’s enforcement officer to hold a fact finding meeting
with the violator. Second, the enforcement officer develops a draft consent
decree that contains corrective actions and penalties based on the facts found.
This draft consent decree is presented to the violator and may be negotiated
for a mutually agreeable action. If the parties fail to agree on the consent
action the enforcement officer will present an administrative order to be
enforced on the violator. In cases where the violator refuses to comply with
the administrative order the County will pursue criminal and/or civil penalties
for violations as authorized by this article. Nothing in this section shall
limit the ability of the County to pursue corrective action, including, but not
limited to, stop work orders under §
8-125.
   (c)   The County Attorney may institute injunctive, mandamus or other
appropriate action or proceedings at law or equity, including criminal
proceedings, for the enforcement of this article or to correct violations of
this article, and any court of competent jurisdiction shall have the right to
issue restraining orders, temporary or permanent injunctions, mandamus or other
appropriate forms of remedy or relief.

§ 8-123 ADDITIONAL LEGAL MEASURES.
   Where the County is fined and/or placed under a compliance schedule by the
state or federal government for a violation(s) of its NPDES permit, and the
County can identify the person(s) who caused such violations) to occur, the
County may pass through the penalty and cost of compliance to that person(s).
(1976 Code, § 8-113) (Ord. 3551, passed 11-11-2001; Ord. 4281, passed 5-5-2009;
Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-124 CORRECTIVE ACTION.
   Any person violating any of the provisions of this article shall be required
to comply with the Director’s notice. Where a violation of this article has not
been corrected by the violator within the applicable time period for
correction, Greenville County, or its contractor, may enter upon the lot or
parcel of land and correct the violation, including offsite impact, and the
costs incurred as a result of such action (including inspection,
administration, labor and equipment costs) shall be collected from the
remediation fee or other means of security in place and sufficient to cover
such costs, or shall become a lien upon the property and shall be collected in
the same manner as County taxes are collected. These costs shall be assessed in
addition to any other penalty or injunctive relief authorized under this
article.

Ord. 4698, passed 5-5-2015)
§ 8-125 STOP WORK.
   Any person who shall proceed with any work which requires a C-SWPPP or SMSCP
hereunder without first submitting a plan and obtaining a land disturbance
permit, where applicable, shall have automatically placed on the subject
property a stop work order, pay to Greenville County Land Development Division,
a working without a permit, fee and fines, and payment of any other applicable
penalties and fees, prior to lifting of the stop work order. The stop work
order may allow or require correction of violations, but no other project
related activities. Any person in violation of a stop work order is subject to
impoundment of any and all equipment on the property, and payment of all fees,
performance securities, penalties and payment of impoundment charges prior to
retrieving such equipment.

§ 8-161 FINDINGS.
   Greenville County Council makes the following findings:
   That the Greenville County Stormwater Management Program (the “Program”) and
associated fees are a result of unfunded mandates from the Federal and State
Governments, which forced Greenville County to adopt required ordinances and
fees;
   That every parcel of real property in the County either contributes to or
benefits from the Program either directly or indirectly, and thus every parcel
of real property should be charged a portion of the administrative costs and
certain other costs of the Program;
   That current and anticipated growth in the County will contribute to the
need for improvements to and maintenance of the Greenville County Stormwater
System (the “System”), which is the system of conveyances designed or used for
collecting or conveying stormwater;
   That the use of the System by each parcel of real property is dependent on
factors that influence runoff and create a services demand, such as the amount
of impervious area and location in a particular watershed or basin; and
   That property owners and users should finance the Program to the extent they
contribute to the service need, and charges therefor should bear a substantial
relationship to the cost of the service.
(Ord. 3617, passed 8-20-2002)
§ 8-162 AUTHORITY.
   This article shall be known as the “Stormwater Service Fees Ordinance” of
Greenville County, South Carolina and is adopted pursuant to the authority
conferred upon the County of Greenville (the “County”) by the South Carolina
Constitution, the South Carolina General Assembly, and in compliance with the
requirements imposed upon the County by the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (“NPDES”) Permit No. SC230001 and the County’s Stormwater
Management Ordinance to develop and impose Stormwater Service Fees (the
“Stormwater Fees”) to fund implementation of the Stormwater Management
Ordinance and its associated programs and plans, including but not limited to
the expansion, maintenance and operation of the System and the development and
funding of Stormwater quantity programs.
(Ord. 3617, passed 8-20-2002)
§ 8-163 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this article to protect, maintain, and enhance the
environment of Greenville County and the short-term and long-term public
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Greenville County by
establishing Stormwater Fees such that the Greenville County Stormwater
Management Program (the “Program”) is a self-sustaining enterprise fund of the
County. A description of the Program is set forth in Permit No. SCS 230001 of
the Greenville County NPDES Stormwater Discharge Permit and as may be amended.
(Ord. 3617, passed 8-20-2002)
§ 8-164 ESTABLISHMENT OF STORMWATER FEES.
   It is the intent of this article to establish a reasonable and equitable
stormwater fee schedule. The Stormwater Fee Schedule shall be based on the
principle that users shall pay to the extent they contribute to the service
demand of the System, and stormwater fees must bear a substantial relationship
to the cost of the service. In accordance with this principle the County’s
stormwater fees will be based on the amount of impervious area on the parcel.
(Ord. 3617, passed 8-20-2002)
§ 8-165 PROGRAM COSTS.
   The County Administrator or his designee shall establish a Program which
addresses 4 categories of Program Costs (as more fully described below).
   (a)   Administrative Costs, including but not limited to the salaries of
Program administrators and staff and the costs of general planning and
development.
   (b)   NPDES Permit Compliance Costs, including but not limited to the costs
of complying with the provisions of Permit No. SCS 230001 and subsequent
permits.
   (c)   Quantity Project Costs, including but not limited to the costs of
projects related to flooding or other drainage problems as approved by Council.
   (d)   New Construction Costs, including but not limited to permitting and
inspection of land on which new construction is occurring that results in a
“land-disturbing activity” which (1) requires a permitted plan and (2) which
changes the natural cover or topography and which may cause erosion or
contribute sediment and alter the quantity or quality of Stormwater runoff. New
Construction Costs will only be chargeable to those parcels of land on which
New Construction is occurring which results in land-disturbing activities equal
to or greater than 1 acres in size, regardless of the size of the parcel.
(Ord. 3617, passed 8-20-2002)
§ 8-166 ESTABLISHMENT OF LAND USE CLASSIFICATIONS.
   The amount of the Stormwater Fee to be paid will be dependent on the
classification of the property into 1 of 4 use classifications as follows:
   Classification 1.   Developed Residential Properties, which shall include
all single-family detached units and all duplexes and developed agricultural
properties.
   Classification 2.   Developed Non-residential Properties, which shall
include but not be limited to triplexes; apartment buildings and complexes;
condominiums, boardinghouses; commercial properties; industrial properties;
parking lots; recreational, institutional, and governmental facilities; hotels;
offices; schools and other educational facilities; theaters and other
facilities for performance; and churches and other religious institutions and
facilities.
   Classification 3.   Undeveloped Residential Properties and Agricultural
Properties.
   Classification 4.   Undeveloped Non-residential Properties.
   Each of these 4 classifications shall pay Stormwater Fees according to the
fee schedule adopted by Greenville County Council.
(Ord. 3617, passed 8-20-2002)
§ 8-167 CALCULATION AND ADJUSTMENTS.
   To pay for the unfunded Federal and State mandated stormwater requirements,
Stormwater Fees shall be established by County Council using the following
formula:
   (a)   For purposes of calculating the Stormwater Fee:
      (1)   Impervious surfaces shall mean those hard surfaces which either
prevent or retard the entry of water into the soil and include, such surfaces
as roof tops, asphalt or concrete paving, driveways, parking lots, walkways,
sidewalks, patio areas, storage areas, graveled areas, or other surfaces which
affect the natural infiltration.
      (2)   The Assistant County Administrator for Public Works shall determine
the amount of impervious area on each developed non-residential property. The
determination will be made using information derived from digital and other
photographic data, Greenville County Geographic Information System (GIS) data,
and other additional information, if available, to supplement such data. Upon
written request to the Assistant County Administrator for Public Works, an
owner, or lawful occupant obligated to the owner for payment of the stormwater
fee shall be provided with a written determination of the amount of impervious
area for which the stormwater fee was charged.
      (3)   The Assistant County Administrator for Public Works shall determine
the mean average amount of impervious surface on all developed residential
properties in the County using a statistical process. This mean average shall
constitute the Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) that shall be used to
calculate the fee for residential and non-residential parcels.
      (4)   The ERU shall be the billing unit used in the formula for
calculating the stormwater fees for each parcel. The number of ERUs for all
developed and undeveloped residential properties shall be 1. The number of ERUs
for all developed non-residential properties shall be determined by amount of
impervious area on the property divided by the ERU and rounded up to the
nearest whole integer. The number of ERUs for all undeveloped non-residential
properties shall be 1.
   (b)   The annual stormwater fee shall be calculated using the following
procedure:
      (1)   Classification 1. The stormwater fee for all developed residential
properties shall be calculated by multiplying 1 ERU by the applicable developed
residential property rate.
      (2)   Classification 2. The stormwater fee for all developed non-
residential properties shall be calculated by multiplying the number of ERUs
calculated in subsection (a)(4) above by the applicable developed non-
residential property rate.
      (3)   Classification 3. The stormwater fee for all undeveloped
residential properties shall be calculated by multiplying 1 ERU by the
applicable undeveloped residential property rate.
      (4)   Classification 4. The stormwater fee for all undeveloped
residential properties shall be calculated by multiplying 1 ERU by the
applicable undeveloped non-residential property rate.
   (c)   The County Administrator or his designee may establish 1 or more rates
for residential properties. These rates may be based on lot size, house size or
other relevant factors determined by the County Administrator or his designee.
   (d)   The County Administrator or his designee shall develop rules and
regulations that allow for an on-going reduction in a customer’s stormwater fee
for non-residential properties. The credit shall be allowed for certain
qualifying activities that reduce either the impacts of stormwater runoff or

from placing the vehicle in custody, and state that the failure of the owner or
lienholder to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle within the time
provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner and all lienholders of all
right, title and interest in the vehicle and consent to the sale of the vehicle
at public auction.
   (b)   If the identity of the last registered owner cannot be determined, or
if the registration contains no address for the owner, or if it is impossible

DIVISION 7. DISTRIBUTION OF UNSOLICITED    HANDBILLS UPON PRIVATE PREMISES
§ 9-171 FINDINGS.
   The county council finds that unwanted and unsolicited handbills are often
left on private premises. These handbills create a litter problem when they are
carried or deposited by the elements onto streets, sidewalks, and other public
and private areas. In addition, the county finds that an accumulation of
unsolicited handbills can be a signal to burglars and vandals that a residence
is unoccupied.
(Ord. 3863, § 1, passed 11-30-2004)
§ 9-172 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this division, the following definitions shall apply.

magistrate’s court. Each location at which a violation occurs shall constitute
a separate offense. Each day a violation occurs shall constitute a separate
offense.
(Ord. 3863, § 4, passed 11-30-2004)
DIVISION 8. TIRE BUSINESSES SELLING USED AND/OR WASTE TIRES
§ 9-185 FINDINGS.
   Greenville County Council finds that tires provide habitats for rodents,
insects, and other vermin and serve as excellent breeding grounds for
mosquitoes that carry diseases and present a fire hazard. Greenville County
Council further finds that improperly stored used and waste tires are a
nuisance that decreases property values and contributes to the decline of
neighborhoods and the degradation of the environment. In order to provide for
the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Greenville County, and to
prevent the spread of disease and the creation of nuisances, Greenville County
Council finds it necessary to regulate the storage, transportation, collection,
processing, and disposal of used and waste tires.
(Ord. 4771, § 1, passed 1-5-2016)

   Used tire for resale: a previously used tire that is suitable for use on a

person or tire business to cause, suffer or allow the dumping of tires at any
place in Greenville County including without limitation, in or on any public
highway, road, street, alley, or thoroughfare, including any portion of the
right-of-way thereof, or in or on any public or private property in the County
or any waters in the County.

   This division shall not apply in the unzoned areas within the County of
Greenville, South Carolina.
(Ord. 4771, § 5, passed 1-5-2016)
§ 9-189 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Right of entry. Where it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce
the provisions of this code, or whenever the code official or law enforcement

shall only receive one seven-day grace period after the first Notice of
Violation is issued.
      (2)   It shall be sufficient notification to deliver the Notice of
Violation to the person to whom it is addressed, or to deposit a copy of such
in the United States Mail, properly stamped, certified, and addressed to the
person to whom the notice is directed or to deposit a copy of such in the
United States Mail, properly stamped, certified and addressed to the address
used for tax purposes.
   (c)   Violation Penalties.
      (1)   Any person, firm, corporation or agent who violates a provision of
this DIVISION or fails to comply with any of the requirements thereof shall be
subject to a civil penalty of fifty ($50) dollars for each improperly stored

labor and equipment costs) shall become a lien upon the property and shall be
collected in the same manner as county taxes are collected.
(Ord. 4771, 6 1, passed 1-5-2016)
DIVISION 9. WASTE TIRE HAULERS
§ 9-190 FINDINGS.
   Greenville County Council finds that illegally dumped waste tires create
significant health and safety risks for Greenville County. Stockpiles of waste
tires create an ideal breeding ground for mosquitoes and rodents to thrive,
creating a health hazard for the community. Waste tires can result in large
scale tire fires, which release toxic pollutants in the air and are difficult

§ 11-1 COMMISSIONING OF CERTAIN COUNTY EMPLOYEES AS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
   (a)   Findings. Because of recent changes by the South Carolina Law
Enforcement Division, hereinafter referred to as SLED, certain law enforcement
officers of Greenville County can no longer be commissioned by the state. The
county council finds that certain officers need to be commissioned as law
enforcement officers for Greenville County.
   (b)   Procedures. The county administrator shall forward to the county
council a list of all county employees that are not directly under the
authority of the Greenville County Sheriff who, because of their necessary
duties and functions, must possess all the pertinent power and authority of law
enforcement officers. The county council shall refer to the county sheriff a
list of all employees that shall be commissioned as law enforcement officers.
The county sheriff, through his cooperation and agreement, shall commission the
employees referred to him, pursuant to his authority to commission law
enforcement officers.
   (c)   Qualifications. All employees, prior to referral to the sheriff of
Greenville County for commissioning, shall meet the minimum qualifications of
law enforcement officers as established by the statutory and decisional law of
South Carolina. All employees who are presently commissioned or who, within the
past 6 months, were commissioned by the state shall be immediately eligible,
upon the approval of the county council for the referral and commissioning by
the sheriff.
   (d)   Effect of authority. This section shall not be construed to limit,
alter, change, encumber or otherwise affect the duties, or authority of the
sheriff of Greenville County. The county shall indemnify, hold harmless and
defend the sheriff of Greenville County from any and all claims, causes of
actions, suits or proceedings, that may arise against him personally, in his
official capacity, or against his office as a result of the commissioning,
acts, omissions, control or lack of control or authority over the herein
referenced county employees. The sheriff shall have no direct authority over
these employees; however, in cases of severe emergency or crises, the county
may make these employees available to assist in the maintenance of public order
and the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the
county.

1-4, passed 5-1-1990)
§ 11-2 ORDINANCE SUMMONS ADOPTED.
   (a)   Authority and findings. Greenville County Council finds that the Code
of Laws of South Carolina, 1976, was recently amended by adding S.C. Code, §
56-7-80, which authorizes counties to adopt by ordinance and use an ordinance
summons for the enforcement of county ordinances. Greenville County Council
further finds that the use of an ordinance summons would greatly enhance the
ability of the county to enforce its ordinances.
   (b)   Ordinance summons. There shall be made available to the code
enforcement officers and sheriff’s department of this county an ordinance
summons which complies with the requirements of S.C. Code, § 56-7-80 (1976).
The form shall be substantially the same as the form which is attached hereto,
and incorporated by reference, as Attachment A.
   (c)   Responsibilities. The building standards department shall be
responsible for having the summons books printed and issuing blank summons
books to the appropriate code enforcement departments, including the sheriff’s
office of this county. Those departments receiving blank summons books shall be
responsible for keeping a record of the summons books issued to it and for
assigning the summons books to its respective law enforcement or code
enforcement officers.
   (d)   Officer’s responsibilities. Any officer issuing an ordinance summons
shall be responsible for forwarding the copy of the summons labeled “court
copy” to the appropriate judicial office within 72 hours of issuing the
summons. It shall also be the issuing officer’s responsibility to keep the copy
of the summons labeled “officer copy” until the appointed hearing time. After
all action concerning the summons has been concluded, the issuing officer shall
turn the “officer copy” of the summons in to the person designated by the
issuing officer’s department head to receive this copy of the summons within 72
hours.
   (e)   Further responsibilities. It shall be the further responsibility of
any department receiving a summons book from the Building Standards Department
to keep all summons forms that have been turned in by its respective law
enforcement or code enforcement officers in a manner which will allow for
annual audit of the summons forms, as provided in S.C. Code, § 56-7-80, as
amended.

§ 11-22 DIRECTOR.
   The law enforcement support department shall be under the direction and
supervision of a director, who shall be appointed by the county administrator
to serve at his pleasure. He shall receive such compensation as the county
council may prescribe and shall appoint such assistants as may be authorized by
the council.

§ 11-23 FUNCTION OF DEPARTMENT.
   The law enforcement support department shall provide its services to the
county and may provide law enforcement support services to the City of
Greenville and those municipalities located within the county which may request
such services. Such services shall be provided free of charge to the aforesaid
municipalities until January 1, 1984. Further resolution of the tax inequity
question could identify offset credits for municipalities. Such credits would
be recognized by county council as reimbursement for services provided through
the law enforcement support department. The county would continue to fund all
departmental costs so long as the tax inequity credits equal the cost of
services provided. Periodic reviews of the tax inequities claimed and the cost
of services provided to municipalities would ensure system parity for both
parties. Such reviews would be performed jointly by county and city personnel
to assure mutual agreement.

   (a)   The Greenville County Council is enacting this article to encourage
security alarm users and alarm system monitoring companies to maintain the
operational reliability and proper use of security alarm systems in order to
reduce unnecessary sheriff’s office responses to false alarms. The council
finds that false alarms are not only a public nuisance but also a threat to
public safety by diverting limited sheriff’s office resources from legitimate

by the sheriff’s office when there is no evidence of a crime or other activity
that warrants a call for immediate sheriff’s office assistance and no person
who was on or near the property or has viewed a video communication from the
property called for the sheriff’s office dispatch or confirmed the need for
sheriff’s office assistance. “False alarm” does not include an alarm signal
caused by violent conditions of nature or other extraordinary circumstances
beyond the control of the alarm user.
   Security alarm system means any system, device, or mechanism for the
detection and reporting of any unauthorized entry or attempted entry or
property damage upon premises protected by the system that may be activated by

§ 11-48 SECURITY ALARM VERIFICATION PROCESS.
   A verification process is an independent method of an alarm system
monitoring company for determining that a signal from a security alarm system
requires immediate sheriff’s office response. The verification process shall
not take more than 5 minutes, calculated from the time that the alarm company
receives the alarm signal until the alarm company determines whether to request
a sheriff’s office dispatch. The means of verification shall include at least 1
of the following:
      (1)   Attempt to verify, by calling the alarm site and/or alarm user by
telephone, to determine whether an alarm signal is valid before requesting
dispatch. Telephone verification shall require, at a minimum, that a second
call also known as Enhanced Call Verification, be made to a different number,
if the first attempt fails to reach an alarm user who can properly identify
themselves to determine whether an alarm signal is valid;
      (2)   A feature that permits the alarm user or a person authorized by the
user to send a special signal to the alarm company that will cancel the alarm
immediately after the signal has been sent and prevent the alarm company from
calling the sheriff’s office;
      (3)   The installation of a video system that provides the alarm company
when the alarm signal is received with the ability to ascertain whether
activity is occurring that warrants immediate sheriff’s office response;
      (4)   A confirmation that an alarm signal reflects a need for immediate
sheriff’s office response from either the alarm user or a person authorized by
the user or an alternate response agency made before dispatching the sheriff’s
office; or
      (5)   An alternate system that the sheriff determines has or is likely to
have a high degree of reliability.

   (a)   No person shall activate a security alarm system for the purpose of
summoning the sheriff’s office except in the event of an unauthorized entry,
robbery, or other crime being committed or attempted on the premises, or if the
person needs immediate assistance in order to avoid injury or serious bodily
harm.
   (b)   Any person who shall notify the sheriff’s office of an activated alarm
and have knowledge that such activation was apparently caused by an electrical
or other malfunction shall at the same time notify the sheriff’s office of the
apparent malfunction.
   (c)   Violations of this section are subject to fine as established in §
11-54(b).

extraordinary circumstances beyond the control of the alarm user caused the
activation of the alarm.

§ 11-51 PENALTY FOR FALSE ALARM.
   (a)   Every establishment in the unincorporated area of Greenville County
having a security alarm system shall be entitled to report 2 false alarms to
which the sheriff’s office will respond without charge in each calendar year.

alarm user either follows the instructions on the back of the notice of
violation to arrange an appearance in court or mails a written response to the
court requesting a waiver and clearance as a warning.
   (c)   In any appeal of a false alarm penalty, the alarm user may present
evidence before the sheriff, magistrate, or in the written response to the

DETERMINATION.
   (a)   When the sheriff’s office determines whether to make an immediate
dispatch in response to notification of a signal from a security alarm system,
the sheriff may disregard a call for sheriff’s office assistance when:
      (1)   The call for assistance comes from an alarm system for a premises
that has a record of sending 4 false alarms in a 6-month period; and
      (2)   The call is the only basis for making the dispatch.
   (b)   The sheriff may consider such a call for assistance as an additional
factor in the sheriff’s decision to order an immediate sheriff’s office
response when an in-person call, verification from a person at or near the
premises, or other independent evidence shows a need for immediate sheriff’s
office assistance at the premises.
   (c)   To discourage false alarms, the sheriff shall adopt a process of
sending a letter or delivering other written notice informing the alarm user
who has had a false alarm of the consequences of excessive false alarms, the
need to take corrective action, and the prospect that 4 false alarms in a 6-
month period shall result in the sheriff’s office disregarding alarms from the
premises and not responding to requests for immediate sheriff’s office
assistance unless there is an in-person call for assistance from someone at or
near the premises or other independent information that verifies the need for
an immediate sheriff’s office response.

approval as to construction and component parts pursuant to the state building
code, and are subject to applicable provisions of local zoning ordinances and

those subject to listing for ad valorem tax purposes and subject to other
applicable local ordinances as referred to herein.
   (c)   It is desirable to establish a means of registering such vehicles
within the county, and to provide an annual record of mobile homes and similar
devices located within the county for ad valorem tax purposes, and to provide a
record of such vehicles for other lawful governmental purposes.
   (d)   It appears the establishment of a procedure and means of registering

penalties remain unpaid after the expiration of 60 days from the due date of
the road maintenance fee, the fees and penalties may be enforced by judgment
and attachment or such other means as provided under the laws of the State of
South Carolina. Nothing in this section shall be construed as a limitation on
the time for the bringing of an action to collect such fees and penalties. In
addition to the penalties provided herein, the county may recover reasonable
attorney’s fees and other expenses of litigation or collection.
   (c)   Prohibition. It shall be unlawful for any person required to pay the
road maintenance fee described in subsection (a) of this section to drive or
allow another person to drive a vehicle on a county road without having paid
the road maintenance fee therefor on or before its due date.
   (d)   Any person, firm, corporation or agent, who shall violate the
provisions of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
punished within the jurisdictional limits of magistrate’s court. Each such
person, firm, corporation or agent shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense
for each and every day or portion thereof during which any violation of any of
the provisions of this section is committed or continued.

accident or the law enforcement officer in charge at the scene of the accident.
(1976 Code, § 14-31) (Ord. 814, § 2)
§ 14-32 PROCEDURE FOR DISPATCHING WRECKERS.
   (a)   Should the owner or driver of a vehicle involved in an accident within
the unincorporated area of the county request the services of a particular
wrecker service or operator (whether or not such service is on the approved
lists hereafter mentioned), the law enforcement officer who is in charge at the
scene of the accident shall so inform his dispatcher who will thereupon call
the requested wrecker service or operator and ask such service or operator to
proceed to the scene of the accident.
   (b)   If the owner or driver of the vehicle involved in the accident
expresses no preference or has no information as to available wrecker services,
the following procedures shall apply:
      (1)   For purposes of this article, all references to “zones” will mean
those established for wrecker services by the South Carolina Highway Patrol
District.
      (2)   All wrecker services operating within the unincorporated areas of
the county who wish to assist in an accident shall make application to the
state highway patrol on the form set forth in
appendix A to this article, sending a copy of such application to the county
sheriff’s office. Wrecker operators meeting the requirements set forth in
appendix B to this article, will be placed on lists of participating wrecker
services which shall be maintained by the sheriff’s communication center.
Approval may be withdrawn from an approved wrecker if at any time it fails to
meet the requirements of
appendix B, but no such action shall be taken unless the wrecker service fails
to correct a deficiency after 30 days’ written notice. Separate lists shall be
maintained for heavy duty wreckers. No wrecker service shall be placed on the
rotation list for a particular zone unless the service is physically located
within that zone; provided, that if a wrecker service has a separate business
and storage lot in more than 1 zone, it may place its name on the rotation list
in any zone where such separate business and storage lot are located.
      (3)   Law enforcement officers shall make no recommendation to the owner
or driver of a disabled vehicle as to their preference of a wrecker service.
      (4)   When called by a law enforcement officer, the dispatcher will refer
to the list of wrecker operators located in the zone in which the accident
occurred and call the wrecker operator or service which appears next on the
list after the name of the last operator which has been called. If a particular
wrecker service is unavailable when called, the dispatcher shall call the next
service on the list. Where the law enforcement officer at the scene indicates
that the services of a heavy duty wrecker are needed and the owner or driver
has no preference as to a wrecker service, the dispatcher will call the next
available operator appearing on the heavy duty rotation list.
      (5)   If the highway patrol or the sheriff’s office advises the
dispatcher that the wrecker service which next appears on the list is incapable
of handling the particular task, the dispatcher shall call the next available
service which is capable of handling the task, but in that event the service
which was passed over shall remain on the top of the rotation list.
(1976 Code, § 14-32) (Ord. 814, § 3; Ord. 1103, § 1, passed 4-19-1983; Ord.

§ 14-36 SECURING PERSONAL PROPERTY.
   Each wrecker service shall be responsible for securing personal property in
a vehicle in an accident scene as best it can and the wrecker service shall be
responsible for reasonably attempting to preserve personal property in a
vehicle which is about to be towed from an accident scene. In no event,
however, shall a wrecker service be responsible for personal items which do not
come into the possession of the wrecker service.
(1976 Code, § 14-36) (Ord. 1146, § 2, passed 7-19-1983)
§ 14-37 SIGNS REQUIRED ON WRECKER.
   Each wrecker service on the rotation list must place a sign on the door of
each of its wreckers indicating the company name, address, and the telephone
number. This sign shall be painted on the door of the wrecker or otherwise
permanently affixed to the door. The letters of the sign must be no less than 2

traffic control sign as a result of a vehicular accident or otherwise shall be
responsible for reimbursing the county for the replacement costs of such sign,

(1) Street sign (single face) $68
(2) Street sign (double face) $101

   (c)   Procedure. The county engineer shall request the state highway patrol
and the county sheriff’s department to notify the county engineer whenever a
county street sign or traffic control sign has been damaged as a result of a
vehicular accident or otherwise. A copy of the accident report, if applicable,
shall be obtained by the county engineer and forwarded to the county attorney.
The county attorney shall take appropriate legal actions to collect the
replacement cost of the damaged sign.

§ 15-21 FINDINGS.
   The county council hereby finds that:
   (1)   The Surgeon General of the United States has declared that smoking is
the number 1 public health issue of our time;
   (2)   The United States Environmental Protection Agency has concluded that
passive smoking appears to pose a public health risk larger than the hazardous
air pollutants from all industrial emissions combined;
   (3)   The County of Greenville recognizes the increasing evidence that smoke
creates a danger to the health of some citizens, and is a cause of annoyance
and discomfort to those who are in confined spaces where smoke is present;
   (4)   It is the right of citizens to be able to choose for themselves to
smoke either actively or passively;
   (5)   It is the policy of this county to require food product establishments
which have enclosed dining areas to provide adequate seating for those patrons
who prefer to dine in a non-smoking area;
   (6)   It is desirable to authorize employers to designate non-smoking areas
in certain workplaces;
   (7)   In order to protect the health and welfare of those citizens, as well
as to protect the rights of smokers and non-smokers, it is necessary to
restrict smoking in public places except in areas designated as smoking areas;
and
   (8)   The citizens of Greenville have demonstrated a desire to comply with
county ordinances which protect public health and welfare.
(1976 Code, § 15-21) (Ord. 2065, § 1, passed 1-16-1990)
§ 15-22 PURPOSE.
   The possession of lighted smoking materials in public places may be
hazardous to the public health, safety, comfort, convenience and indoor
environment. The purpose of this division is to protect the public by
restricting the possession of lighted smoking materials to designated smoking
areas within public places. This section is intended to protect the public from
the involuntary inhalation of tobacco smoke in places which are normally
frequented by the general public. It is not intended to restrict smoking in
purely private places.
(1976 Code, § 15-22) (Ord. 2065, § 2, passed 1-16-1990)
§ 15-23 RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b), the possession of lighted

lighted cigarettes, cigars, pipes, or other tobacco products, is prohibited in
any of the following places used by or open to the public:

feet of space, provided that smoking may be allowed in the common area of
shopping malls.

patrons.
      (3)   Any vehicle of public transportation, including but not limited to
trains, buses, limousines for hire and taxicabs.

elevator).
      (5)   Libraries, educational facilities, museums, auditoriums and art
galleries.
      (6)   Any public area of a health care facility, including but not
limited to laboratories associated with the rendering of health care treatment,
hospitals, rest homes, doctors’ offices and dentists’ offices.
      (7)   Any indoor place of entertainment or recreation, including but not
limited to gymnasiums, theaters, concert halls, arenas and swimming pools.
   (b)   The restrictions set forth in subsection (a) above shall not apply to:

accordance with §
15-24.

§ 15-24 DESIGNATION OF SMOKING AREAS.
   (a)   Smoking areas, including the open common area of malls, may be
designated by proprietors or other persons in charge of places described in §
15-23(a), except in places in which smoking is otherwise prohibited by the fire
marshal, or by other statute, ordinance or regulation. The size of the
designated smoking areas in restaurants seating 100 or more persons should
closely approximate the ratio of smokers to nonsmokers who patronize the
establishment as long as any nonsmoker is provided a seat in a nonsmoking
section if so requested. However, in all cases, the smoking area cannot:
      (1)   Include the entire establishment;
      (2)   Include cashier areas, over-the-counter service or sales areas, and
service or sales lines; or,
      (3)   Be larger than 75% of the common area of the establishment.
   (b)   Subsection (a) above shall not be construed to require proprietors or
other persons in charge of places described in subsection 15-23(a) to provide
smoking areas.
   (c)   Where smoking areas are designated, existing barriers and/or
ventilation systems should be used where practicable to minimize the irritating
and toxic effects of smoke in adjacent no-smoking areas.
   (d)   No public place described in subsection 15-23(a), other than a
restaurant which derives more than 50% of its gross receipts from the sale of
alcoholic beverages, shall be designated as a smoking area in its entirety;
provided, that if such a facility is designated as a smoking area in its
entirety, this designation shall be conspicuously posted on all entrances
normally used by the public.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, where smoking
areas can be established in any governmentally owned or operated facility

DIVISION 2. ROLLING PAPERS
§ 15-71 FINDINGS.
   The county council finds that “rolling papers” commonly known as “cigarette
papers” or “marijuana wraps” are dangerous to the health, safety and welfare of
the community. Although historically rolling papers have previously been used
for the otherwise legitimate purpose of rolling tobacco cigarettes, the county
council finds that they are now almost exclusively used for the consumption of
illicit and illegal drugs which are a serious threat to the health, safety, and
welfare of the citizens and community. Furthermore, the council finds that the
danger to the health, safety and welfare outweighs the interest of individuals
who want to use these items for legal tobacco consumption which, in and of
itself, is also known to cause serious health problems.

cocaine, cocaine derivatives, heroin, opiates or other controlled substances.

used for, or intended for use in smoking or administering the abovementioned

into account the latest scientific advances in noise measurement and control
while at the same time, preserving the common sense and common law
determination of what constitutes a disturbance or public nuisance. Therefore,
sound level measurements, while universally desirable, shall not be required to
demonstrate violation of any other ordinance or statute which establishes the
creation of a disturbance or public nuisance.
   (b)   Sound measurements shall utilize the peak intensity of sound, measured
in decibels, the “A” frequency weighting and the “slow” response characteristic
of a sound level meter conforming in all respects to the American National
Standards Institute (ANSI) standard S 1.4-1071, as revised, for Type 1 or Type
2 instruments.
   (c)   The microphone used to measure the intensity of a noise may be placed
at any point on the exterior property line of the complaining party and shall
be at least 5 feet from any wall and not less than 3 feet above the ground. If
it is not possible to measure 5 feet from a wall, a 5 dB variance will be
allowed. In the case of multifamily dwellings, condominiums or other closely
confined living areas, the exterior property line shall be considered the walls
separating individual family units and the microphone shall be placed at least
5 feet from any wall and not less than 3 feet above the floor. In the case of
vehicles or persons in common areas, public areas, roads, streets or highways,
the exterior property line shall be considered the wall of any nearby dwelling
unit or school and the microphone shall be placed at least 5 feet, but no more
than 10 feet from the exterior side of the wall and not less than 3 feet above
the ground.

§ 15-111 FINDINGS.
   It is hereby found and declared by Greenville County Council:
   (1)   The storage, handling and dispensing of hazardous substances in the
County has the potential for creating a dangerous situation that may adversely
affect the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the County;
   (2)   There is the need to utilize and take advantage of the existing data
base concerning the location and use of hazardous substances in the County;
   (3)   It is important to identify those facilities that pose a significant
risk to the community. This shall be accomplished by determining those
facilities that under the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986
(“SARA”), Title III, annually submit to the local fire services, the LEPC and
the SERC, Tier II reports concerning hazardous chemicals which the facility
stores.
   (4)   Information provided to the County through the implementation of this
article will be used to protect County citizens and emergency response
personnel from the detrimental effects of the explosion, fire, or release of
hazardous substances.
   (5)   The implementation of a hazardous substances user fee will generate
the funds necessary to provide a county-wide comprehensive response capability
to the hazardous substances problem, and such fee is authorized by S.C. Code §
4-9-30(5), which section permits the County to establish uniform user fees.
   (6)   The implementation of a comprehensive hazardous substances response
capability in the County necessitates the training of personnel and the
purchase of specialized equipment to combat hazardous substances emergencies in
the County.
   (7)   In the event of a hazardous substances emergency, it is necessary to
be able to provide proper and effective planning and response which
specifically addresses the particular hazardous substance or substances being

potential through increased density to parcels of land which may or may not be
contiguous or under the same ownership.
   (b)   Only those zoning classifications as designated by the county council
shall contain transfer of development rights.
   (c)   Once a parcel of land has transferred its development right, it is
permanently reserved from specified development uses; except in the case of
where a single parcel has been developed to less than its maximum yield, then
such land may receive development rights transferred to it from other eligible
property in the particular zoning classification.
   (d)   Transferable development rights shall be acquired only by property
owners within a zoning classification which contains such rights and in no
event shall a property owner own more transferable development rights than the
maximum yield allocated to property owned.
   (e)   No development rights may be transferred from 1 zoning classification
to another.
   (f)   For each zoning classification containing transfer development rights,
the planning commission shall recommend and the county council shall adopt the
manner in which development rights are allocated to individual owners.
   (g)   Development of land in zoning classification which contain transfer of
development rights is limited to those uses as specified in the particular
zoning classification.
   (h)   Transferable development rights belong to the owner of the fee-simple
title.
   (i)   If no mention is made of reserving to the grantor transferable
development rights in a general warranty deed conveying a fee-simple title,
such rights shall pass to the purchaser of the fee.
   (j)   A round-off system will be used to calculate the number of
transferable development rights eligible for a particular piece of property.
The transferable development rights will be calculated and carried 2 decimal
points and then rounded off accordingly (i.e., any fractional unit greater than
or equal to .50 will be rounded up to the next whole number). Fractional units
of development rights may be transferred.
   (k)   In no event shall an owner transfer more development rights than that
required for a building(s) actually constructed and no building permit may be
issued for a piece of property which has less than 1 whole transfer development
right.
(1976 Code, § 17-32) (Ord. 1064, § 2, passed 12-21-1983)
§ 17-33 PROCEDURE.
   Development rights maybe transferred to land within specific zoning
classifications pursuant to the following procedure:
      (1)   The county planning commission shall be responsible for the initial
calculation of transferable development rights. This calculation is subject to
correction upon submission of a more recent property survey which invalidates
the previously recorded plat.
      (2)   Such allocation to property owners shall be recorded by plat in the
register of deeds office.
      (3)   The transfer of development rights must be documented through deeds
which particularly describe the property from which and to which said rights
are transferred.
      (4)   Certification of the number of development rights eligible for
transfer from a particular piece of property must be obtained from the county
auditor before transfer can be effected. No transfer shall be recorded in the
register of deeds office for the county without certification attached to the
deed.
      (5)   Notification of development right transfer shall be given by the
register of deeds office to the county auditor and the county building codes
department within 3 days of said transfer.
      (6)   Whenever a building permit is obtained by a property owner for use
within a zoning classification which contains transferable development rights,
the county building codes department shall notify the county auditor within 3
days. The county auditor will then adjust transferable development rights
accordingly.
      (7)   Upon the transfer of the development rights from a particular piece
of property, said rights are forfeited indefinitely for such property.
(1976 Code, § 17-33) (Ord. 1064, § 3, passed 12-21-1983)
§ 17-34 REZONING.
   In the event that property for which a development right has been conveyed
pursuant to this article or for additional development rights have been
acquired, shall have its allowable density of development altered by amendment
to the underlying zoning classification, the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   If such amendment increases allowable density of land, the owner
shall be entitled to the full number of units allowed by the amendment plus the
number of development rights previously obtained by the conveyance.
      (2)   If such amendment decreases the allowable density of land, the
owner may develop at the density formerly allowed if the affected land has
previously obtained additional development rights prior to the effective date
of the amendment.
(1976 Code, § 17-34) (Ord. 1064, § 5, passed 12-21-1983)
§ 17-35 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, corporation or agent, who shall violate the provisions of
this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished within the
jurisdictional limits of magistrate’s court. Each such person, firm,
corporation or agent shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for each and
every day or portion thereof during which any violation of any of the
provisions of this article is committed or continued.
(1976 Code, § 17-35) (Ord. 1064, § 6, passed 12-21-1983; Ord. 2626, § 3, passed

§ 17-51 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this article is to mitigate the adverse effects of the loss
of trees in Greenville County occurring as a result of residential, commercial,
institutional and industrial land development practices. The intent of this
article is to protect the rights of all citizens and property owners by
insuring that a reasonable and prudent policy of conservation and replenishment
of tree cover is applied during the process of land development.
   Trees and tree cover provide positive benefits to all residents of
Greenville County. Healthy trees reduce air, water, and noise pollution,
provide energy-saving shade and cooling, furnish habitat for wildlife, enhance
aesthetics and property values, and are an important contributor to community
image, pride, and quality of life. The loss of trees and tree cover associated
with mass grading and of other development practices can negatively impact
human health, environment quality, the overall quality of life and general
property values. The loss of trees and tree cover resulting from development
practices can have adverse affects on air quality, water quality, stormwater
runoff, property values, business revenues, scenic quality, urban design, human
health and well-being, outdoor recreation, forest products, and wildlife.
(Ord. 4173, passed 1-22-2008)
§ 17-52 GENERAL POLICY.
   It is the policy of Greenville County to protect and preserve established
healthy trees where possible and practical; to require the planting of trees to
replace the trees lost due to development; to require reasonable maintenance
after planting; and to provide public education on the benefits of trees, tree
conservation, and tree care.
(Ord. 4173, passed 1-22-2008)
§ 17-53 APPLICATION AND EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Application. The provisions of this article shall apply to all new
development except that land disturbing activity that disturbs less than one
acre of land, is not part of a larger common plan development, does not fall
under the NPDES Industrial Stormwater Permit, or does not create a peak flow
increase of greater than one cubic foot per second. For purposes of this
article, “new development” is defined as any development for which a grading
permit is required, with the exception of a “simplified grading permit”, after
the effective date of the article. Developments with Planning Commission
approval on the effective date of the article are exempt from the requirements
of this article if development activity is commenced within two years of the
approval of this article.
   (B)   Exemptions. This article shall not apply to individual dwelling lots,
farms, undeveloped acreage, agricultural acreage, existing commercial or
industrial properties, or any other real property that is not being developed
(or redeveloped), substantially changed, or subdivided as described in division
(A) above.
(Ord. 4173, passed 1-22-2008)
§ 17-54 TREE PROTECTION PLANS.
   Tree Protection Plan (TPP) is a plan of the same scale as, and superimposed
on a development site plan or preliminary plat, that indicates the Root
Protection Zone of all trees to be protected or preserved on a development
site. TPP shall locate and identify by species and size those trees that are to
be protected during land disturbance (development) activities for the purpose
of using the protected trees to comply with the “tree density units” required
by this article. No existing tree can be used for “tree density credit” unless
it is shown on a TPP that has been approved by the County under the terms and
conditions of this article.
   A TPP is required if the developer is going to use tree credits for existing
trees. A TPP is not required if the developer is not going to use existing
trees for tree credits and/or is going to mass grade the parcel of land being
developed. The developer shall submit a TPP prior to any grading or clearing
activities and the issuance of a grading permit. The tree protection plan, when
required, along with the approval letter from the County, shall be submitted
with the grading permit application.
   When required, a TPP will be prepared after the proposed land development
plan has been given preliminary approval by the appropriate governing
authority. This allows the TPP to identify those areas where trees that will be
subject to removal based on the development plan as well as those trees that
are the best candidates for being saved and used to meet tree density
requirements. Trees that are in floodplains, undevelopable areas on the
property and required stream buffers do not have to be located or identified on
the TPP unless they are being used to meet the minimum “tree density units” for
the acreage requirements in §§
17-58 and 17-59.
   The TPP shall show the required tree protection areas for the trees to be
saved and used for tree unit credit. Upon receipt of a Tree Protection Plan,
the County will review the plan for compliance with the density units and tree
protection measures within 15 calendar days of receipt. If the submitted TPP
does not meet the technical requirements of this article, staff will ask the
developer for additional information or a revised plan.
   If during the review process, it is determined that specimen or heritage
trees are on the site and are in areas that are to be part of the land
development activity, the developer may be asked to consider minor redesign of
the development plan for the purpose of saving the heritage or specimen tree
(s). Upon approval by the County, a saved Heritage or Specimen tree will
receive 2.0 times the credits published in §
17-61 for the DBH of the tree being saved.
   As an incentive for a developer to preserve trees and exceed the required
tree density unit credit by 10% or more, the developer may be awarded financial
and administrative incentives by the County (for example, expedited permitting
and/or a 2% density bonuses for each 10% density overage up to 10% total
bonus). Developers who incorporate approved land use conservation practices to
protect tree roots, reduce run-off and erosion, and to increase water
infiltration using pervious pavement and rain gardens, may be allowed to reduce
curbs and gutters, stormwater pipes and inlets, receive a variation on
retention ponds and other drainage abatement practices.
(Ord. 4173, passed 1-22-2008)
§ 17-55 GENERAL CRITERIA FOR TREE CONSERVATION IN ALL NEW DEVELOPMENTS.
   The following requirements shall apply to all new land development projects:
   (A)   On-site tree planting is encouraged.
   (B)   Existing trees in ungraded areas, excluding stream buffers, shall
count in all project types toward the density unit requirements, provided they
meet the tree protection area requirements.
   (C)   All trees to be saved and credit received, must be identified on a TPP
and must provide a root protection zone equal to a six-foot radius around the
tree or a one-foot radius from the trunk of the tree per each inch of diameter
at breast height (“dbh”), whichever is greater. All trees to receive credit
must be healthy and in good condition and are subject to review by the County.
The County may approve an exception of up to 35% of the Root Protection Zone
requirement, but if the exception is granted, the density unit credit for the
existing tree will be reduced by 50%. All construction practices for protecting
existing trees (including protective barriers and identification of tree
protection areas) shall be consistent with International Society of
Arboriculture and American National Standards Institute standards whenever
possible.
   (D)   In accordance with the provisions of §
17-54, unless no tree credits are going to be sought, prior to any grading or
clearing activities on a lot or parcel for development and applying for a
grading or building permit, the developer shall have conducted a tree survey
identifying the location and size of trees to be used for tree credits and they
shall be shown on a TPP survey.
   (E)   The design of any land development project or subdivision shall take
into consideration the location of all Heritage Trees, Specimen Trees, and
stands of Trees. The County, at the request of the developer or landowner, may
field survey the site and identify opportunities and incentives to save said
trees.
   (F)   The County has the authority to postpone required tree planting until
the appropriate planting season.
   (G)   The buffer requirements of this article shall be in addition to the
landscaping and screening requirements in Ordinance No. 4048 of the Greenville
County Zoning Ordinance. In the event of conflicts between the two ordinances,
the most restrictive shall apply.
   (H)   In perimeter buffers and setbacks, canopy trees cannot be placed
closer than 15 feet on center except for evergreen trees, which may be placed
10 feet on center.
   (I)   A tree warranty must be provided by the contractor, who must
adequately maintain trees for the first year after planting. After one year,
tree maintenance is the responsibility of the property owner.
(Ord. 4173, passed 1-22-2008)
§ 17-56 BUFFER CRITERIA.
   (A)   A buffer shall be established along each side of all blue line streams
in new developments. Consistent with Greenville County Code § 18-24, a 15-foot
drainage easement is required on normally dry waterways. A 15-foot drainage
easement is required from the top of the stream bank on each side of live
streams draining less than 50 acres. A 35-foot wide stream buffer is required
on each side of all stream banks for live streams draining 50 acres or more.
The stream buffer may be wooded or non-wooded. New and replacement trees
required to be planted under this article may be planted in the stream buffers.
The management requirements for stream buffers are:
      (1)   The existing vegetation within the stream buffer shall not be
disturbed except as provided in (B) below. This prohibition includes, but is
not limited to, disturbance by tree removal, shrub removal, clearing, mowing,
burning, spraying, and grazing.
      (2)   Soil disturbance shall not take place within the stream buffer by
grading, stripping of topsoil, plowing, cultivating, or other practices, except
as provided in (D) below.
      (3)   Filling or dumping shall not occur within the stream buffer.
      (4)   Except as permitted by the County and/or State, the stream buffer
shall not be drained by
ditching, under drains, or other drainage systems unless an existing drainage
system is in place that adequately services the new uses.
      (5)   Motorized vehicles shall not be stored or operated within the
stream buffer, except for maintenance and emergency use approved by the
Building Official and Zoning Administrator.
   (B)   The following structures, practices, and activities are permitted in
the stream buffer:
      (1)   Roads, bridges, trails, storm drainage, stormwater management
facilities, and utilities approved by Greenville County and/or the State of
South Carolina are permitted within the buffer provided that no other practical
alternative exists and that minimal disturbance will take place. Simple road
crossings, close to perpendicular to the buffer, are permitted. All structures
shall be located, designed, constructed, and maintained to provide optimum
erosion protection, to have the least adverse effects on wildlife, aquatic
life, and their habitats, and to maintain hydrologic processes and water
quality.
      (2)   Stream restoration projects, facilities and activities approved by
Greenville County or the State of South Carolina are permitted within the
stream buffer.
      (3)   Scientific studies approved by the department, including water
quality monitoring and stream gauging, are permitted within the stream buffer.
      (4)   Horticulture practices, including thinning and planting, may be
used to maintain the health of individual trees in the stream buffer.
      (5)   Hazard trees and invasive species in the buffer may be removed.
Removal of trees in the buffer must be accomplished using equipment with which
a minimal disturbance will take place.
      (6)   Other forest management and timber cutting techniques approved by
Greenville County and/or the State of South Carolina may be undertaken within
the buffer if necessary to preserve the buffer from extensive pest infestation,
disease infestation, or threat from fire.
   (C)   Minimum 25-foot undisturbed buffer on all sides of jurisdictional
wetlands is required. Buffers shall not apply to the specific wetlands, other
than blue line streams, for which an impact permit has been issued by SCDHEC
and/or the USACE. If a jurisdictional wetland falls below the minimum size
required for a permit by SCDHEC and/or USACE, no buffer is required.
   (D)   The acreage contained within the stream buffer(s) shall count toward
the allowable density when developing under provisions of either option in an
Open Space Residential Development.
   (E)   The buffer requirements of this article shall be in addition to the
landscaping and screening requirements in Ordinance No. 4048 of the Greenville
County Zoning Ordinance. In the event of conflicts between the two ordinances,
the most restrictive shall apply.
(Ord. 4173, passed 1-22-2008)
§ 17-57 DENSITY VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   (A)   In the event that the density unit requirements can not be achieved on
site, the developer may elect to make an application to the Greenville County
Board of Zoning Appeals for a variance. The variance may be granted in an
individual case of unnecessary hardship if so determined by the Board of Zoning
Appeals. Variance applications shall be processed and governed by the
requirements for other variances as set forth in the Greenville County Zoning
Ordinance, as amended. In granting any variance, the Board may prescribe
appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this article.
Violation of such conditions and safeguards shall be a violation of this
article and punishable under §
17-64. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have authority to waive density
requirements of this article through the grant of a variance.
   (B)   Orders, decisions or determinations made by the County relative to the
application and interpretation of this article may be appealed to the Board of
Zoning Appeals. All appeals must be made in compliance with the rules and
procedures of the Board of Zoning Appeals. Applications for appeal shall be
based on a claim that the intent of this article, or the rules legally adopted
thereunder, have been incorrectly interpreted; or the provisions of this
article do not fully apply.
(Ord. 4173, passed 1-22-2008)
§ 17-58 PROVISIONS FOR RESIDENTIAL PROJECTS.
   The following requirements shall apply to residential projects:
   (A)   Minimum preserved or planted trees shall be equal to 10 density units
per disturbed acre (see charts in §§
17-60 and 17-61) as described in the required grading permit for all projects.
   (B)   Dwelling, Single Family Detached; Dwelling, Two-Family; and Dwelling,
Zero Lot Line:
      (1)   In addition to the required 10 density units per disturbed acre,
two (2) trees are required per lot for developments zoned for a gross density
of greater than 3.63 units per acre and four (4) trees per lot for developments
zoned for a gross density of less than 3.63 units per acre. (3.63 units per
acre conforms with R-12 zoning density.) Each tree shall have a minimum caliper
of 1.25 inches.
      (2)   It is the intent of the “trees per lot” requirement, that the trees
be planted on the individual lots; however, in dense developments, some of the
“lot trees” may be planted elsewhere on site, provided there is not adequate
growing space on the lot for multiple trees.
      (3)   In residential projects with units intended for workforce or
affordable housing, the developer may apply to the County to use 3-gallon trees
to be planted to meet the trees per lot requirement so long as the tree species
is on the Recommended List in
Appendix A. The variance shall be subject to the condition that the specified
project units are constructed and maintained primarily for affordable and
workforce housing.
   (C)   Dwelling, Multiple Family and Dwelling, Single Family Attached:
      (1)   Minimum preserved or planted trees shall be equal to 2 density
units per 4,000 SF of the building footprint.
      (2)   All multiple family and single family attached development shall
comply with the parking lot landscaping standards in section 12.4 of the
Greenville County Zoning Ordinance, 2007 edition.
   (D)   In the case of a phased development, the tree warranty requirement
will apply to each phase upon completion of buffer plantings.
(Ord. 4173, passed 1-22-2008)
§ 17-59 PROVISIONS FOR PUBLIC RECREATION, INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, RETAIL, AND
INSTITUTIONAL PROJECTS.
   The following requirements shall apply to all public recreation, industrial,
commercial, retail, and institutional projects:
   (A)   In the zoned areas of the County, all Public Recreation, Industrial,
Commercial, Retail, and Institutional Projects shall comply with the parking
lot landscaping standards in section 12.4 of the Greenville County Zoning
Ordinance, as amended.
   (B)   Minimum preserved or planted trees shall be equal to 15 tree density
units per disturbed acre (see charts in §§ 17.60 or 17.61) as described in the
required grading permit.
   (C)   In the zoned areas of the County, current zoning requirements for
buffers, screens, and/or fences along the common line with residential uses
shall remain.

§ 17-62 DEFINITIONS.
   Affordable/Workforce Housing: Affordable Housing is housing for persons in
households earning 30 to 80 percent of the area median income (AMI), while
Workforce Housing is housing for persons in households earning 80 to 120
percent of the AMI.
   Blue Line Stream: Any stream shown as a solid or broken blue line on 7.5
Minute Series quadrangle maps prepared by the U.S. Department of the Interior
Geological Survey (USGS).
   Buffer: A portion of property designated to mitigate impacts between land
uses or transportation routes, or to protect water features from pollutants.
   Front Buffer: A zone of specified distance between a specified land use and
a roadway fronting the land use.
   Perimeter Buffer: A zone of specified distance surrounding a specified land
use.
   Planted Buffer: A zone of specified distance between a specified land use
and other properties, streets, streams, or other geographic area in which
plants are installed.
   Stream Buffer: A natural or vegetated area adjacent to water courses through
which stormwater runoff flows in a diffuse manner so that the runoff does not
become channeled and which provides for the infiltration of pollutants.
   Ungraded Buffer: That portion of a lot set aside for open space and or
visual screening purposes. Any such ungraded buffer shall not be graded or
otherwise disturbed, and shall be left in a natural state or supplemented with
additional plantings, if specified. No storage, structures, or other non-
growing items may be placed in the buffer.
   Caliper: The diameter of a tree trunk measured 6 inches above the ground on
trees with calipers of 4 inches or less and measured 12 inches above the ground
for trees between 4 and 12 inches caliper. For trees larger than 12 inches
caliper, see Diameter at Breast Height.
   Clearing: Removing trees and stumps and all woody debris and other
vegetation from an area of land.
   Commercial: Of or pertaining to trade or production which deals with the
exchange of goods and/or services from producer to final consumer, including
but not limited to entertainment, mercantile trade, finance, real estate, and
all other commercial services, including tourism.
   Diameter at Breast Height (DBH): Diameter at Breast Height is used for
measuring all trees greater than twelve inches caliper. The DBH of a tree is
the total diameter in inches of a tree trunk or trunks measured in inches at a
height of 4.5 feet above existing grade (at the base of the tree). If a tree
trunk splits at ground level and does not share a common base, then each trunk
shall be measured as a separate tree. If a multi-trunk tree splits below the
4.5’ mark, all trunks shall be measured separately and count as one tree.
   Dwelling, Multiple-Family: A residential building containing three or more
individual dwelling units located on a single lot or parcel of ground, commonly
called an apartment house.
   Dwelling, Single-Family: A residential building containing only one dwelling
unit and not intended to be occupied by more than one family.
   Dwelling, Single Family-Attached: Two or more single-family dwelling units,
each with its own outside entrance, which are generally joined together by a
common party wall or connecting permanent structures such as breezeways,
carports, or garages, whether or not such a group is located on a single lot or
parcel of ground or on adjoining individual lots. For the purpose of this
article, dwellings such as townhouses and condominiums shall be treated as
single-family attached dwellings.
   Dwelling, Single-Family Detached: A single-family dwelling unit which is
entirely surrounded by open space or yards on the same lot. See Dwelling, Zero
Lot Line.
   Dwelling, Two-family: A residential building containing two individual
dwelling units located on a single lot or parcel of ground; a duplex.
   Dwelling, Zero Lot Line: A single-family dwelling that has a zero-foot
setback from a side and/or rear property line. For purpose of this article, a
zero lot line dwelling shall be treated as a single-family detached dwelling.
   Floodplain: A relatively flat or low area adjoining a river, stream or
watercourse which is subject to partial or complete inundation, or an area
subject to unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface areas. These
areas are defined as “Special Flood Hazard Areas” in the County Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance No. 4085.

cultural significance. As time and resources allow, a voluntary list of
historic and unique specimen (extremely large, old, and/or uncommon) trees may
be compiled as a matter of public record. Trees that are listed on the Historic
and Specimen Tree List would not be protected from any use its owner may
desire. However, if Heritage trees, and /or Specimen trees (defined below), are
preserved during land development, they are given double tree density unit
credits.

additional trees if incentives were available, but do not want to develop their
property.
   Industrial: Enterprises engaged in any activity that is not otherwise
considered to be residential, recreational, or commercial, as defined herein.

Appendix A
§ 17-81 FINDINGS.
   As an incident to the adoption of this ordinance, the Greenville County
Council makes the following findings:
   (1)   The South Carolina General Assembly has enacted the “Vested Rights
Act” which is codified as S.C. Code, § 6-29-1520 et seq., as amended, (the
“Act”).
   (2)   The Act requires local governments to enact ordinances implementing
the provisions of the Vested Rights Act on or before July 1, 2005. The Act
authorizes local governments to establish a procedure for the vesting of rights
in certain development plans, and provides that local governments that do not
pass ordinances implementing a procedure for the establishment of vested rights
will be subject to the requirements of S.C. Code, § 6-29-1560 of the Act, under
which a landowner has a vested right to proceed in accordance with an approved
site specific development plan upon the terms and conditions and subject to the
requirements and limitations of S.C. Code, § 6-29-1560(A), which section
substitutes statutory conditions for vesting, reducing local control and
flexibility.
   (3)   Council finds that the affected Greenville County Ordinances should
conform to the requirements of the Vested Rights Act; in a manner to facilitate
the administration of Greenville County zoning and land use codes, ordinances
and regulations.
(Ord. 3913, passed 5-17-2005)
§ 17-82 DEFINITIONS.
   The following words and terms shall have the following meaning as used in

the local governing body or body authorized by the local governing body to make
land-use decisions that shows the types and density or intensity of uses for a
specific property or properties to be developed in phases, but which do not
satisfy the requirements for a site specific development plan.

   17-82.9   “Site specific development plan” means a development plan
submitted to the local governing body or a body authorized by the local
governing body to make land-use decisions by a landowner describing with
reasonable certainty the types and density or intensity of uses for a specific
property or properties. The plan may be in the form of, but is not limited to,
the following plans or approvals: planned unit development; subdivision plat;
preliminary or general development plan; variance, conditional use or special
use permit plan; conditional or special use district zoning plan; or other
land-use approval designations as are used by Greenville County with regard to
submitted plans.

§ 17-83 ESTABLISHMENT OF VESTED RIGHT.
   17-83.1   A vested right as defined herein is established for 2 years upon
the approval of a site specific development plan.
   17-83.2   The landowner of real property with a vested right may apply
before the end of the vesting period but not thereafter to the Greenville
County Planning Commission for an annual 1-year extension of the vested right.
The Greenville County Planning Commission must approve applications for at
least 5 annual extensions of the vested right if a timely application has been
filed with the Planning Commission unless an amendment to land development
ordinances or regulations has been adopted that prohibits such approval. If no
timely application is made by the landowner to the Greenville County Planning
Commission for an annual extension, the vesting period or annual extension
applicable to such real property shall expire at the end of the vesting period
or the last annual extension granted thereof.
   17-83.3   The Greenville County Planning Commission may, but is not
required, to provide for the establishment of a 2-year vested right in a
conditionally approved site specific development plan. No 2-year vested right
is established in a conditionally approved site specific development plan
unless such vested right is specifically and expressly approved by the
Greenville County Planning Commission in writing when a site specific
development plan is conditionally approved.
   17-83.4   The Greenville County Planning Commission may, but shall not be
required, to approve the establishment of a vested right in an approved or
conditionally approved phased development plan for a period not to exceed 5
years.
   17-83.5   No vested right in a site specific development plan shall attach
or be established until plans have been received, all required approvals have
been given or granted, and all fees have been paid in accordance with the
procedures outlined in this code. No vested right attaches or is established
until a final decision has been rendered favorable to the applicant on all
administrative appeals.
   17-83.6   The Greenville County Zoning Board of Appeals is not authorized to
grant or approve a vested right and no vested right shall be established,
created or accrue as a result of any decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(Ord. 3913, passed 5-17-2005)
§ 17-84 CONDITIONS AND LIMITATIONS ON VESTED RIGHT.
   17-84.1   A vested right established by this article and in accordance with
the standards and procedures in Greenville County zoning, land development and
land-use ordinances and regulations is subject to the following conditions and
limitations.
      (1)   The form and content of a site specific development plan submitted
by a landowner must conform and comply with all applicable Greenville County
zoning, planning, stormwater management and sediment control, building,
electrical, mechanical, life safety, fire and other land-use codes, ordinances
and regulations;
      (2)   No vested right in a site specific development plan shall be
established except in conformity with Greenville County zoning, planning,
stormwater management and sediment control, building, electrical, mechanical,
life safety, fire and other land-use codes, ordinances and regulations;
      (3)   If the Greenville County Planning Commission approves a vested
right for a phased development plan, a site specific development plan shall be
required for approval with respect to each phase in accordance with regulations
in effect at the time of vesting.
      (4)   A vested right established under a conditionally approved site
specific development plan or conditionally approved phased development plan may
be terminated by the Greenville County Planning Commission upon its
determination, following notice and a public hearing, that the landowner has
failed to meet the terms of the conditional approval;
      (5)   A vested right established in accordance with the provisions of
this article shall be vested upon approval by the Greenville County Planning
Commission of the site specific development plan or phased development plan
that authorizes the developer or landowner to proceed with investment in
grading, installation of utilities, streets and other infrastructure and to
undertake other specific expenditures necessary to prepare for application for
a building permit. No developer or landowner shall proceed with investment in
grading, installation of utilities, streets or other infrastructure, or shall
undertake other significant expenditures necessary to prepare for application
for a building permit before a site specific development plan or phased
development plan authorizing such improvements and expenditures has been
approved by the Greenville County Planning Commission. No investments in
grading, installation of utilities, streets, or other infrastructure, or other
significant expenditures shall give rise to or establish a vested right until
the Greenville County Planning Commission has approved the site specific
development plan or phased development plan that authorizes the developer or
landowner to proceed with improvements or undertake other significant
expenditures on the real property which is proposed for development. Any vested
right so granted is subject to all land development regulation requirements,
including, but not limited to, meeting all financial security requirements
prior to acceptance of final plats.
   17-84.2   A site specific development plan for which a variance, regulation
or special exception is necessary, does not qualify and may not claim or
receive vested right status unless and until the variance, regulation or
special exception is obtained. A phased development plan for which a variance,
regulation or special exception is necessary does not qualify and may not
obtain a vested right until the variance, regulation or special exception is
obtained.
   17-84.3   A vested right for a site specific development plan expires 2
years after vesting; provided, however, that the landowner of real property
with a vested right may apply to the Greenville County Planning Commission
before the end of the vesting period for an annual extension of the vested
right for a period of 1 year. If a timely application is made, the Planning
Commission must approve applications for no more than 5 successive annual
extensions unless an amendment to land development ordinances or regulations
has been adopted that prohibits approval of such annual extension applications.
The Greenville County Planning Commission shall designate the vesting point for
a phased development plan as the date of approval of the phased development
plan. The Greenville County Planning Commission may extend the time for a
vested site specific development plan to a total of 5 years upon a
determination that there is just cause for the extension and that the public
interest is not adversely affected. Upon expiration of the vested right, a
building permit may be issued for development only in accordance with
applicable land development ordinances and regulations and may require new plan
submissions in accordance with the applicable ordinances and regulations.
   17-84.4   A vested site specific development plan or a vested phased
development plan which has been approved by the Greenville County Planning
Commission may be subsequently amended if the amendments are approved by the
Greenville County Planning commission pursuant to the provisions of applicable
Greenville County land development ordinances and regulations.
   17-84.5   A validly issued building permit does not expire or is not revoked
upon expiration or termination of a vested right, except for public safety
reasons or as prescribed by the applicable building code.
   17-84.6   A vested right to a site specific development plan or phased
development plan may be revoked by the Greenville County Planning Commission
upon its determination, after notice and a public hearing, that there was a
material misrepresentation by the landowner or substantial non-compliance with
the terms and conditions of the original or amended approval.
   17-84.7   A vested site specific development plan or vested phased
development plan is subject to later enacted federal, state or local laws or
ordinances adopted to protect public health, safety and welfare, including, but
not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes and
non-conforming structure and use regulations which do not provide for the
grandfathering of the vested right. The issuance of a building permit vests the
specific construction project authorized by the building permit to the
building, fire, plumbing, electrical and mechanical codes in force at the time
of the issuance of the building permit.
   17-84.8   A change in the zoning district designation or land-use or
regulations made subsequent to vesting that affects real property does not
operate to affect, prevent or delay development of the real property under a
vested site specific development plan or vested phased development plan without
the consent of the landowner.
   17-84.9   If real property having a vested site specific development plan or
vested phased development plan is annexed, the governing body of the
municipality to which the real property has been annexed must determine, after
notice and public hearing in which the landowner is allowed to present
evidence, if the vested right is effective after the annexation.
   17-84.10   The Greenville County Council, the Greenville County Planning
Commission and local zoning, planning and codes officials must not require a
landowner to waive his vested rights as a condition of approval or conditional
approval of a site specific development plan or phased development plan.
(Ord. 3913, passed 5-17-2005)

in its application. The Board, on a case by case basis, may require an Eligible
Trust Recipient acquiring fee title to land to place a conservation easement on
such property to ensure its permanent protection.
      vii.   Where an Eligible Trust Recipient seeks a Trust grant to acquire a
conservation easement, the Eligible Trust Recipient must demonstrate both the
expertise and financial resources to monitor and enforce the restrictions
placed upon the land for the purposes set forth in its application. The Board
shall evaluate each application to determine the qualifications of the proposed
managing party and to determine whether the proposed management is consistent
with the purposes set forth in the application.
   b.   Application Review
      i.   The Board shall accept three rounds of applications each calendar
year in accordance with the following deadlines: April 1, August 1, and

criteria contained in §§
17-106 and

disapproval.
      iv.   In its decision the Board shall set forth findings that indicate:
         1.   How the application meets the criteria set forth in §§
17-106 and

         2.   Greenville County and the Trust shall be indemnified as to title
in the amount of the grant, and this indemnification shall be secured by a
title insurance policy acceptable to the Board and obtained by the grant
recipient. The indemnification requirement as to title may be waived by the
Board in extraordinary cases where insurable title is unobtainable, the risk of
adverse claims is small, the land in question presents a particularly valuable
conservation opportunity according to the criteria of §
17-106, and the cost of the interest in land acquired reflects the lack of
insurable title.
         3.   In order to identify potential liability pursuant to applicable
state or federal environmental laws or regulations, a certified environmental
hazard assessment shall be conducted on lands before the disbursement of a
grant from the Trust for the acquisition of all interests in such lands except
as provided below in §
17-108(c)(iii)(4).
         4.   An application for such interest in land shall qualify as a small
grant application if the amount requested is less than thirty thousand dollars
($30,000) or 10% of the appraised fair market value of either the conservation
easement or fee simple acquisition, whichever value is smaller. The
environmental assessment required in §
17-108(c)(iii)(3) shall be waived for applications for interest in land
qualified as a small grant unless specifically required on a case-by-case basis
by the Board.
      iv.   The Trust and Eligible Trust Recipients receiving monies from the
Trust shall retain all records of acquisition of interests in land with a grant
from the Trust including, but not limited to deeds, title documents, contracts,
surveys, inventories, appraisals, title insurance policies, environmental
assessments, and closing documents.
      v.   The Board shall disburse the grant from the Trust to Eligible Trust
Recipient and the closing shall occur after all applicable requirements of this
section are fully satisfied, provided the closing shall take place no later
than one year after the Eligible Trust Recipient and owner of the interest in
land decide to accept the award unless the Board, for good cause shown, extends
the deadline for a period not to exceed six months.

approval of the Board by two-thirds vote.
   e.   The owner of the fee simple title to property upon which a conservation
easement was purchased with a grant from the Trust, whether the original owner
that conveyed the conservation easement or a successor-in-interest, may
reacquire and thereby terminate or extinguish that conservation easement,
whether in whole or in part, only by complying with all of the following: (i)
proving that the original conservation and/or historic values of the protected
land have been lost or substantially impaired by factors beyond the owner's
control, (ii) obtaining unanimous approval by the Trust Board, (iii) obtaining
approval by at least nine members of Greenville County Council, and (iv)
payment in cash of the current fair market value of the conservation easement,
as determined by a certified appraisal.
   f.   If an Eligible Trust Recipient acquires fee simple title to land for
conservation and/or historic purposes with a grant from the Trust, that land
may not be sold, transferred, assigned, alienated, or converted to a use other
than the use set forth in the grant award except by complying with all of the
following: (i) proving that the original conservation and/or historic values of
the protected land have been lost or substantially impaired by factors beyond
the owner's control, (ii) obtaining unanimous approval by the Trust Board,
(iii) obtaining approval by at least nine members of Greenville County Council,
and (iv) payment in cash of the current fair market value of the protected
land, as determined by a certified appraisal.
   g.   If any interests in lands that have been acquired by an Eligible Trust
Recipient with a grant from the Trust are extinguished, terminated, sold,
transferred, assigned, alienated, or converted pursuant to §
17-109(e) and (f), the Eligible Trust Recipient extinguishing, selling,
transferring, assigning, alienating, or converting the interests in land shall
replace them with interests in land of substantially equal current fair market
value, with any deficit being made up by contribution to the Trust. The
replacement land shall have the same or greater significance when evaluated
under the criteria set forth in §§
17-106 and
17-107. The Board shall verify that suitable replacement interests in lands
have been identified and will be obtained before authorizing that any interest
in land purchased with a grant from the Trust be extinguished, sold,
transferred, assigned, alienated, or conveyed. Where replacement in whole or in
part is impossible, funds realized which are not used for replacement interests
in land must be credited to the Trust. Where funding for an original
acquisition was from multiple sources, funds realized must be credited to the
Trust under this section in proportion to the contribution that the grant from
the Trust made to the original acquisition.

§ 18-23 PRELIMINARY PLAT REQUIRED PRIOR TO CONSTRUCTION.
   (a)   Prior to beginning work, a preliminary plat is to be submitted to the
executive director of the planning commission or authorized representative for
approval. The plat will be presented on 3 mil (.003) Mylar reproducible film
accompanied by an application for preliminary approval and appropriate fee. The
plat must include, existing and proposed drainage easements; proposed drainage
improvements; road names; north arrow and general location map; graphic scale;
name of subdivision and owner, date; boundaries of tracts with bearings and
distances; name of adjoining property owners; the location of existing streets,
roads, bridges, culverts, railroads, water courses; names, locations and
approximate dimensions of proposed streets, easements, parks, reservations, lot
lines; contour lines not greater than 10-foot intervals; proposed lot and
building lines and approximate dimensions; lot number; existing zoning of the
subject area if applicable; current county tax identification number; location
of proposed water and sewer systems, and any letter of request for a variance
from the minimum standards. The preliminary plat shall be submitted according
to the planning commission’s monthly application date shown on the subdivision
activity schedule.
   (b)   The subdivision will be submitted to the subdivision advisory
committee for their review and recommendations. The advisory committee is made
up of the following representatives as well as others which the commission may
request:
      (1)   Greenville County school district;
      (2)   Greenville County health department;

      (10)   Appropriate fire district.
   (c)   The developer or his representative may attend the advisory committee
meeting. Also, any interested citizen may attend this meeting for information
about the subdivision. Upon review of the subdivision by the advisory
committee, the planning commission staff will approve, deny or amend the
proposed subdivision plat. All recommendations will then become requirements
that must be met.
   (d)   Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by the planning
commission staff, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the requirements of
this ordinance and the preparation of the final subdivision plat. Approval of a
preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute approval of the final
subdivision plat. Preliminary approval shall constitute approval of the
proposed widths and alignments of streets and dimensions and shapes of lots.
The final plat will be considered eligible for approval only after the
requirements for final plat approval, as specified herein, have been fulfilled
and after all other specific conditions of the planning commission staff have
been met.
   (e)   Once the preliminary plat has been approved, a set of construction
plans shall be submitted to the county engineer for approval. The construction
plans must include graphic scale, north arrow and general location map; name of
subdivision and owner(s); property lines; location of existing and proposed
sewer, water, gas, storm drain, and other utilities; the proposed road plan and
profile at not greater than 1-inch equals 50-foot scale, roads, culverts,
railroads, water courses; existing and proposed contours not greater than 10-
foot intervals; and necessary drainage calculations for the proposed conveyance
system, including all offsite areas which drain through the site. All storm
drainage designs for subdivisions shall comply with the latest edition of the
Greenville County Stormwater Management Design Manual. Additionally, compliance
with any applicable county ordinances or state laws shall be adhered to in the
designing of the proposed development. Subdivisions which include water supply
and sewage disposal systems, either public or private, must adhere to all
local, county, and state regulations for installation, connection and
operation.
(1976 Code, § 18-23) (Ord. 3342, § 1, passed 3-7-2000)
§ 18-24 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   A 50-foot right-of-way is required on a normal roadway; 50-foot right-
of-way radius for cul-de-sacs. Cul-de-sacs are required on all dead-end roads.
Twenty-five-foot sight triangles are required at all intersections.
   (b)   Stream buffers:
      (1)   A 15-foot drainage easement is required on normally dry waterways.
A 15-foot drainage easement is required from the top of the stream bank on each
side of live streams draining less than 50 acres.
      (2)   A 35-foot wide stream buffer is required on each side of all stream
banks for live streams draining 50 acres or more.
         a.   Stream buffers are defined as strips of land located on each side
of perennial and ephemeral streams which are intended to allow floodplains and
stream side riparian zones to function naturally to buffer flooding, reduce
sedimentation, filter non-point source pollution, and to provide protection
from flood and drainage hazards.
         b.   The purpose of stream buffers is to protect these floodplain
lands from development and land disturbing activities. No removal of trees and
natural vegetation will be allowed within these streamside zones except the
following:
            (i)   Lots created prior to the adoption of this article, except
for lots subsequently subdivided in which case the entirety of the subdivision
shall comply.
            (ii)   The creation of recreational facilities.
            (iii)   Roads and utilities.
            (iv)   Engineer/architectural designed structures where it can be
demonstrated that the facility will not impair stream function, cause flooding
hazards and that are compatible with the spirit of the buffers program where
these exceptions are necessary, these facilities should be sited and
constructed so as to minimize encroachment into the streamside zone, and
landscaped so as to minimize fragmentation of the buffer system through
replanting of native riparian species.
            (v)   In subdivisions where existing vegetation in these zones are
not suitable to perform the functions of a stream buffer, a buffer must be
created. A landscape plan using native riparian vegetation designed by an
engineer or landscape architect must be submitted to and approved by the
Greenville County Soil and Water Conservation District office.
         c.   The location and width of all stream buffers shall be shown on
the final plat along with a statement saying “No disturbance of vegetation
allowed within stream buffer area.”
   (c)   Drainage design storms: Proposed drainage improvements shall be
designed to convey maximum flows without roadway overtopping according to the
following criteria:
      (1)   Interior roadway pipe systems and crosslines: Ten-year design
storm.
      (2)   Culverts on live streams and all structures which convey offsite
flows in excess of 15 CCFS (25-year storm,) through the site: Twenty-five-year
design storm.
      (3)   Small bridges: Fifty-year design storm.
      (4)   River crossings: One hundred-year design storm.
   (d)   Drainage design methods must conform to current engineering standards.
   (e)   All concrete pipe must be Class III or better and meet the
requirements of SCDOT’s latest edition of the manual entitled “Standard
Specifications for Highway Construction.” Aluminum or aluminized steel
corrugated metal pipe may be used upon approval of the county engineer. Minimal
pipe size is 15 inches in diameter.
   (f)   Roads must be centered within the 50-foot right-of-way.
   (g)   Side slopes must be no greater than 2 to 1; except that where cut
slopes would extend more than 100 feet beyond the center line, a 1-to-1 slope
may be used with proper stabilization.
   (h)   Standard cross-section:
      (1)   Thirty-six feet from center of ditch to center of ditch or top of
fill to top of fill.
      (2)   A paved roadway width of 20 feet shall be provided. The pavement
section shall consist of 4 inches of stone and 1-1/2 inches of asphalt surface
or a 2-inch asphalt base course and 1-1/2 inches of asphaltic surface. All
thicknesses refer to the full in-place compacted thickness. All materials and
methods of construction shall meet the requirement of SCDOT’s latest edition of
the manual entitled “Standard Specifications for Highway Construction.”
      (3)   Five-foot minimum shoulders with no less than 2% and no greater
than 5% grade sloping away from the roadway.
      (4)   Roadway crown 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch per foot from the center of the
road to the edge of pavement.
   (i)   Minimum horizontal curve radius is 165 feet without superelevation.
Horizontal curves with lesser radii are allowed with superelevation as follows:
 
Superelevation Min. Radius
0.04 ft/ft     145 ft
0.06 ft/ft     135 ft
 
   (j)   Reverse curves must be separated by a minimum tangent of 100 feet.
   (k)   Intersection approaches must be no greater than 5% grade within feet
of the edge of the intersecting road’s traveled way.
   (l)   Intersections must be as close as possible to 90 degrees but in no
case less than 60 degrees.
   (m)   If intersecting streets are offset, the minimum center line offset
must be 125 feet.
   (n)   Maximum grade is 10% unless immediate surrounding terrain averages 20%
or more, in which case a 15% maximum grade may be used for limited distances.
Minimal grade is 1%.
   (o)   Minimal lengths of vertical curves shall be based on the AASHTO
formula, K=L/a, where “L” equals the minimum length of the vertical curve in
feet and “a” equals the algebraic difference between the incoming and outgoing
tangent grades in percent, accordingly:
      (1)   Use K>9 (crest) and K>15 (sag) for the following:
         *Residential access streets
         All Streets, *mountainous classification
         All Streets where “a”>15
      (2)   Use K>17 (crest) and K>24 (sag) for the following:
         *Residential collector and *subcollector streets where “a”<10
         *Residential collector and *subcollector streets, **non-mountainous
         Definitions for roadway classifications:
         (*Residential collector provides access to 50 or more lots)
         (*Residential subcollector provides access to between 50 and 15 lots)
         (*Residential access street provides access to less than 15 lots)
         (**Mountainous classification denotes that immediate surrounding
terrain has an average slope of 20% or greater)
      (3)   For criteria not covered in (1) or (2) above, minimum K factors
ranging between 9 to 17 (crest) and 15 to 24 (sag) shall be determined by the
county engineer on a case by case basis.
   (p)   Design for roadway ditches shall comply with standard engineering
design methods as detailed in the latest edition of the Greenville County
Stormwater Management Design Manual.
   (q)   All items shown as design standards must be shown on the plans in
sufficient detail to assure compliance.
   (r)   A variance to any requirement may be granted upon approval by the
Greenville County planning commission. A developer requesting a variance is to
submit a plan showing all details of the request to the planning commission.
Upon completion of the county planning commission staff’s review, the request
will be submitted to the Greenville County planning commission for
consideration. The requestor will be notified of the time and location of the
planning commission meeting.

§ 18-31 DEFINITIONS.
   As used herein, the following terms shall have the meanings herein ascribed
to them:
   County road: A public road or public way that is listed on the official
inventory of county roads and bridges adopted by county council and/or revised
as provided by §
18-34 or by action of county council.
   Full width: The width of a road that is appropriate for the right-of-way
available. Full width improvement on a 50-foot right-of-way would consist of a
20-foot roadway, 5-foot shoulders, 3 additional feet to the center of the
ditches and 7-foot back slopes. Full width improvement of a 36-foot right-of-
way would consist of an 18-foot roadway, 3-foot shoulders, 2 additional feet to
the center line of the ditches and 4-foot back slopes. Improving a road to full
width includes installation of proper drainage facilities.
   Residence: A primary occupied dwelling place including houses, modular homes
and mobile homes which have permanent electrical power installation.
   Unimproved property: Any tract of land that does not contain a residence as
defined above. Improving a road to property with a residence when that road is
not the primary access to the residence shall be considered improvement of a
road to unimproved property.
(1976 Code, § 18-31) (Ord. 1222, § 2, passed 2-21-1984; Ord. 2181, § 2, passed
11-6-1990)
§ 18-32 WORK ON COUNTY RIGHT-OF-WAY AND PROPERTY.
   (a)   Waste soil. Waste soil from county road maintenance operations may be
deposited on private property subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   Each maintenance camp must build and maintain a stockpile of at
least 500 cubic yards of soil before giving any away.
      (2)   An actual savings to the county must be involved in giving the soil
away (example: no savings is achieved by giving away soil when the truck is
headed for the maintenance camp such as with the last load from a day’s work).
      (3)   The soil must be requested in writing by the property owner who
must also hold the county harmless in connection with depositing the soil on
his property. The property owner must sign an agreement not to resell the soil.
      (4)   The soil may be dumped only. No spreading, leveling or other work
is allowed.
      (5)   Absolutely no payment for waste soil may be accepted by any county
employee, official or agent.
   (b)   Gravel. County crews may place gravel on a county road from its
beginning to the last residence served by the road; however, county crews may
not improve or widen a road unless criteria set forth in subsection 18-32(d)(2)
have been met. Beyond the last residence, the existing surface may be
maintained by scraping but no sand, gravel or cinders will be added at county
expense, except as provided for hereinafter. County crews may place gravel
purchased by others on a county road that does not meet the above criteria. If
a cul-de-sac is within 100 feet of the last residence, the 100 feet of road and
cul-de-sac may be graveled. Additionally, gravel may be placed on a county road
to a house or business that is under construction after the floor slab is
complete or the floor framing begins. Such gravel placed during construction
may be maintained as long as construction on the structure is progressing at an
acceptable rate.
   (c)   Through roads serving no homes. The placement of gravel on through
roads may be approved by the director of public services, provided the
following criteria are met:
      (1)   The length of the gravel improvement should not exceed 50% of the
road length between the terminal intersections of the road segment under
consideration; and
      (2)   When a road is maintained as a passable dirt surface, an average
traffic count must exceed 15 vehicles per day.
   (d)   Road improvements. A county road may be improved according to the
following guidelines:
      (1)   A road may be improved for 1-way traffic (average 10 to 15 feet
wide) in dry weather to unimproved property provided the property owner submits
to the county a written request and a copy of his/her new home building permit
or mobile home permit, or for roads previously improved, if the purpose of the
improvement is to continue access to property used for fruit or vegetable
cultivation; but no sand, stone, or drainage facilities will be placed thereon.
      (2)   A road may be improved to full width to a residence by the most
economical route, provided that 3 residences must exist on the section to be
improved, with a maximum [minimum] density of 1 residence per 1,500 feet.
Density is to be determined by dividing the number of residences on the section
to be improved by the length of the same section. Houses at the intersection of
paved roads or with driveways to paved roads do not count toward the 3
required.
   (e)   Roadside ditches. The county will install culverts and storm drainage
system in lieu of roadside ditches if required to provide adequate protection
for a county road or bridge. The piping of roadside ditches by property owners
requires an encroachment permit. All materials and methods of installation
shall conform to the state highway department “Standard Specifications for
Highway Construction,” latest edition. The sizes of all structures and culverts
shall be approved by the county engineering department. All costs associated
with the piping of roadside ditches shall be borne by the permittee. All
maintenance associated with culvert, inlets, etc., installed in roadside
ditches, shall be the responsibility of the property owner, his heirs or
assigns.
   (f)   Driveway entrances.
      (1)   The county, on county roads, may provide and install private
residential driveway entrances and any related culverts to facilitate proper
roadway drainage, subject to the following conditions:
         a.   The county will provide and install not more than 20 lineal feet
of drainage culvert for a private residential driveway entrance up to a maximum
diameter of 36 inches or the equivalent thereof. Where additional pipe lengths
are provided by the property owner on site at the time of the driveway
installation, the county will install not more than an additional 10 lineal
feet of driveway pipe per entrance. The installation of culverts under
driveways will be made only if it is essential to the drainage pattern of the
area.
         b.   Driveways and/or culverts may be installed only for the purpose
of providing a single access to an individual parcel of land as shown on the
Greenville County tax maps.
         c.   For properties which front on a state and/or municipal and county
roads, no culverts or driveways shall be furnished if access is already
provided by a driveway entrance to the property from a state or municipal road.
         d.   Prior to providing and installing private residential driveway
entrances and/or related drainage culverts, the county will require the
purchase of a building permit, mobile home permit, or other suitable
construction permit indicating plans for a taxable real property improvement, a
$100 liquidated damages deposit, returnable upon compliance with this
subsection 18-32(f), and an agreement by the property owner or requesting that
if the improvements are not initiated within 1 year that he will be liable to
the county for the direct and indirect costs of providing a driveway entrance
and any related drainage culvert, plus an additional $100 penalty, court costs,
and attorney fees for collection of the damages as is necessary. Additionally,
all costs and penalties for violating subsection 18-32(f) shall act as a lien
against the property of the owner until payment thereof.
         e.   The county shall not be responsible for providing a second
driveway entrance to any property unless the property owner or requesting party
can present evidence to the satisfaction of the county in the form of
encroachment permits, invoices for services rendered, and/or receipts for
materials purchased that the initial driveway entrance was not only installed
at the property owner’s expense, but also in accordance with county policy.
      (2)   The following situations shall require the property owner to secure
an encroachment permit for and bear all expenses related to the installation of
driveway entrances and/or related drainage culverts:
         a.   Where the county road and bridge department determines that the
appropriate culvert size for a driveway installation exceeds 36 inches in
diameter; or
         b.   When driveway entrances are required to provide access to vacant
lots; or
         c.   Where the connection of private roads and the installation of
related drainage culverts is required. Private roads shall mean those roads
servicing 2 or more properties.
         The responsibility for maintenance, repair and/or replacement of
driveway entrances, related drainage culverts, inlets and appurtenances
requiring an encroachment permit shall be that of the property owner on whose
behalf such encroachment exists. Any and all work related to driveway entrances
on county road rights-of-way shall fully comply with the requirements of the
latest edition of the Encroachment Permit Policy of the County of Greenville.
      (3)   Where both the driveway and county road are paved, the driveway
apron may be paved by the county with asphalt (limit 2 driveways per parcel at
20 feet wide each). Asphalt driveway aprons may be installed from paved roads
to unpaved roads or driveways only when necessary to protect the edge of the
road or control drainage. All work must be within county rights-of-way.
      (4)   Where drainage culverts are placed in roadside ditches, a catch
basin or manhole will be placed at intervals not greater than 100 feet.
Exceptions to this policy may be granted by the director of public services
upon review of the site’s specific conditions and the diameter of the pipe
proposed for the installation.
      (5)   No pipe may be furnished, installed, or maintained on private
roads. Roads being constructed for dedication to the county shall be deemed to
be private roads prior to final acceptance by the county.
   (g)   Dirt road paving. Paving a county dirt road may be recommended by the
road and bridge department to county council provided the road meets the
following conditions:
      (1)   The road must have served 3 residences for a minimum of 2 years,
but this requirement shall not apply if all materials are supplied at no cost
to the county. (Summer homes and houses at the intersection of paved roads and
dirt roads do not count toward the required 3).
      (2)   When special circumstances exist, county council may approve and
fund the paving of a county dirt road that does not meet the above
requirements.
   (h)   Resurfacing. The road and bridge department shall prepare and submit
to council annually a proposed resurfacing program. The roads in the program
shall be presented to county council in the order of their priority based upon
their structural condition and use. All resurfacing that is more than 500 feet
in length or 25% of the length of a road is subject to this requirement.

(c) and (e) below.
   (b)   If the matter is initiated by an individual, firm or corporation, such

public hearing provided for in subsection (e).
   (d)   At least 15 days prior to the public hearing, the road and bridge
department will give notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the county
that a public hearing will be held to receive information from the general
public as to the advisability of abandoning the road. The notice will state the
time and place of the hearing. The road and bridge department will also notify
affected public agencies and public utilities of the public hearing and inquire
of them if they have any objections to the abandonment of the road by the
county. The road and bridge department will also try to ascertain the means by
which the county acquired its interest in the right-of-way.
   (e)   The public hearing will be held by the county council at the time and
place specified in the newspaper notice.
   (f)   After the hearing, the county council will refer the question to its
public service planning and development committee for recommendations as to its
proper course of action. Such reference, however, will not be required if the
proposed road abandonment was initiated by the county council.
   (g)   If the road and bridge department has been able to determine the owner
of the underlying fee, a quit claim deed should be given to that person or his
heirs or devisees, if they can be ascertained. Otherwise a quit-claim deed
should be made to the abutting property owners on both sides of the right-of-
way.
   (h)   Upon completion of the abandonment process, the applicant, if other
than the county, shall submit the appropriate quit-claim deed to the county
attorney who shall, upon approval, transmit said quit-claim deed to the clerk
of council for execution and filing on behalf of the county.

§ 18-46 TRANSFER OF SUBDIVISION ROADS TO HOMEOWNERS’ ASSOCIATION.
   (a)   In residential subdivisions in which the property owners are
represented by a nonprofit corporation whose membership is composed of the
owners of lots in the subdivision, (herein referred to as “owners association”)
the owners association may petition the county council to have the streets
within their subdivision conveyed to the owners association by the county. The
petition must be signed by the president or a vice-president of the
organization confirming each of the following:
      (1)   A 66 % majority of the members of the owners association have voted
in a duly-called meeting of the owners association (hereinafter referred to as
“owners association meeting”) to submit to the members for a vote the issue of
transferring the roads to the owners association;
      (2)   Within a period of 45 days following the owners association meeting
a 66 % majority vote of the non-owner occupied resident members (as defined
below) voting and an 80% majority vote of the owner-occupied resident members
(as defined below) voting have approved the transfer of the roads to the
association;
      (3)   The vote taken in subsection (2) above was by written secret ballot
and the vote was counted and verified in writing to the owners association by
an independent accounting firm;
      (4)   Each owners association member had a minimum period of 10 days in
which to cast such member’s vote following the date the written ballot was
mailed by first class mail or delivered to such member; and
      (5)   The petition has been filed with county council within 75 days of
the owners association meeting.
      An owner-occupied resident member means an owners association member that
owns and occupies a residence within the subdivision. A nonowner-occupied
resident member means an owners association member other than an owner-occupied
resident member.
   (b)   The procedure provided by this section shall be available only to
residential subdivisions which do not include any streets which are necessary
or essential for general traffic purposes to members of the public. All of the
streets which are subject to the petition must be internal to the subdivision
and essential only for purposes of gaining access to homes, amenities, common
areas and other properties within the subdivision itself. If the subdivision
includes amenities which are owned and operated by a separate nonprofit
organization, such as a country club, tennis club, or golf club, then the
streets are eligible for transfer under this section so long as the separate
organization is also a member of the owners association, or has a contractual
relationship to the owners association, so as to assure that the members of the
separate organization will have the right to use the streets which are
necessary to gain access to such amenities.
   (c)   In order to be eligible for ownership of the streets in a subdivision,
the owners association must demonstrate in its petition that its organizational
documents, restrictive covenants, and other instruments contain sufficient
authority to assure that it will be able to raise the funds needed to maintain
the roads through periodic and special assessments against the property owners
who comprise its membership, together with the authority to enforce such
assessments by placing liens upon the properties of those members who decline
to pay their share.
   (d)   In order to initiate such a petition, the owners association will file
a written request with the road and bridge department. The road and bridge
department will conduct such studies and research as it deems necessary in
order to make a recommendation to the county council. In formulating its
recommendation, the road and bridge department will seek to determine whether
the association has the legal and financial capability to maintain the streets
as private streets and otherwise assure that the condition, maintenance, and
utilization of the streets will meet the standards required of developers and
associations who elect not to dedicate the streets in a residential subdivision
but to allow those streets to remain private under the Greenville County
subdivision regulations. The road and bridge department will also notify
affected public agencies and public utilities and inquire of them whether they
have any objections to the transfer of subdivision streets to the owners
association and what their requirements may be. All of these requirements will
be relayed to the owners association by the road and bridge department within
90 days of receipt of the application. The owners association will have the
responsibility for making necessary arrangements, granting appropriate
easements, and otherwise meeting the requirements of public agencies and public
utilities as they pertain to private residential streets.
   (e)   County council shall conduct a public hearing to receive information
from residents of the areas, public utilities, public agencies, and others
affected as to the advisability of the transfer. The public hearing will be
conducted following the posting of suitable notices at the subdivision and
after 15 days’ notice of the public hearing in a newspaper of general
circulation in the county. After the hearing, the county council will refer the
question to its public service, planning, and development committee.
   (f)   The road and bridge department will submit its recommendation and
report to the public service, planning and development committee. If the public
service, planning and development committee recommends approval of the request,
it shall submit a recommendation to the county council, designating by name the
streets to be transferred to the owners association, together with such other
details as the committee shall deem pertinent to the council’s consideration.
   (g)   Upon approval by a majority of the members of the county council
voting upon such recommendation in a regular meeting, the county shall issue a
quit-claim deed to the streets which are the subject of such petition to the
owners association.
   (h)   The owners association submitting any such application shall be
required to pay an application fee of $250 and to submit with its application
the proposed form of a quit-claim deed to be utilized for such purposes.
   (i)   Following the transfer of the streets in a subdivision pursuant to the
procedure set forth above, the county shall have no further responsibility for
the maintenance of those streets. The streets shall in all respects have the
same status as residential subdivision streets which were not dedicated to the
county by the developer when the subdivision was initially approved. The owners
association will prepare the following documents and record them simultaneously
with the deed transferring the streets:
      (1)   Revised subdivision plat(s) depicting the streets as private
streets and noting that owners of property in the subdivision have easements
over those streets to gain access to 1 or more adjacent public roads; and
      (2)   An amendment to the restrictive covenants of the subdivision, if
necessary, to grant or confirm the easement rights of property owners and the
power of the owners association to impose assessments for the monies required
to maintain the streets.
   (j)   Rededication of any roads transferred hereunder shall not be
considered unless such roads meet the subdivision standards in effect at the
time of the dedication.
   (k)   If a petition requesting the transfer of roads in subsection (a) above
is either denied by county council or withdrawn by the owners association, then
the owners association may not file another petition requesting the transfer of
roads for a period of 2 consecutive years from the date the petition was denied
or withdrawn.

§ 18-64 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Permit Duration.
      Applications for Encroachment Permits shall be made not less than 2
working days prior to the start of construction. In the case of an emergency
cut, permittee shall notify the Division immediately and submit a full
encroachment permit within 7 working days following the date of the emergency.
The County Engineer or his/her designee shall have sole discretion in
determining whether an emergency situation existed and how it shall be
repaired.
      Encroachment permits will begin on the date of Division approval stated
on the permit and will expire 1 year from that date. Those working under an
expired permit shall be fined in the same manner as an individual working
without a permit. If no work has begun, encroachment permits shall expire 3
months (90 days) from the date the permit was approved. Extensions of time may
be granted by the Division upon request, and will be considered on a case-by-
case basis with the Division reserving the right to deny any or all extensions.
      The Division reserves the right to refuse issuance of a permit to any
applicant if any monies are due and outstanding as a result of charges made
against the applicant or its duly authorized agent for inadequacies in
performance of work related to previous permits. The Division also reserves the
right to increase the amount of the bond required based on prior poor
performance by any permittee or licensed contractor, including but not limited
to failure to make proper repairs and maintain the installation.
   (b)   Exemptions.
      (1)   It shall not be necessary to make application for or obtain an
Encroachment Permit for repairs to, maintenance of, or new installations to be
made inside existing pits, manholes, conduits, ducts, pipes or vaults. However,
this paragraph shall not be interpreted to include any excavation operations
requiring a disturbance of the surface surrounding such installations.
      (2)   It shall not be necessary to make application for or to obtain an
Encroachment Permit for adjustments to manhole covers, valves, inlets and other
protective coverings situated within pavements when such work is done at the
request of the Division to accommodate pavement resurfacing and repairs being
performed by the Division. No fees shall be charged for permits for work
requested by the Division.
      (3)   Encroachment permits for landscaping purposes are not required;
however, no trees, shrubbery or other natural obstructions in height over 2-1/
2 feet shall be placed within the right-of-way in a manner so as to obstruct
the sight distances for traveling vehicles. Those property owners encroaching
on County rights-of-way for landscaping purposes do so at their own risk. The
County is not responsible for the replacement of any such features should it
become necessary to regrade the ditch lines, widen pavements, or maintain the
Division’s clear roadside policy.
      (4)   Aerial utility line crossings over public right-of-way which do not
require any disturbance of property within the County right-of-way shall not
require an Encroachment Permit; provided that the minimum vertical clearances
specified herein are maintained. Placement of a utility pole on County right-
of-way requires a permit; however subsequent attachments to that pole would not
require a new permit, provided that the minimum vertical clearances specified
herein are maintained.
      (5)   It shall not be necessary to obtain an encroachment permit for the
installation of a mailbox. The location and construction of all mailboxes shall
conform to the rules and regulations of the U. S. Postal Service and the
following minimum requirements:

back of the mountable curb.
         (b)   Wherever possible, the roadside face of the mailbox shall be no
closer than 4 feet to the edge of any paved surface.
         (c)   Under no condition shall a mailbox be permitted to obstruct any
sidewalk.
(Ord. 3673, § 2, passed 4-1-2003)
§ 18-65 ENCROACHMENT.
   (a)   General Requirements.
      (1)   All work shall be done in accordance with provisions of the permit
issued. The expense of restoring the roadway and adjacent areas within the
right-of-way shall be paid for by the permittee.
      (2)   All work within the rights-of-way shall be designed and constructed
in accordance with appropriate Federal, State, and local standards. Local
standards shall include, but not be limited to, requirements of the Planning
Commission, Building Standards Dept., Engineering/Maintenance Division and the
Soil Conservation District. Permits shall not be issued or may be revoked for
work that is not done in accordance with sound engineering and construction
principles.
      (3)   In the event the permittee fails to properly provide back-filling
and pavement restoration, in addition to all other penalties provided for
herein, the Division reserves the right to perform or have such operations
performed and to charge all associated costs (including but not limited to
labor, material, equipment, supervisory and administrative) to the permittee.
      (4)   The permittee shall notify the Division when backfilling operations
will occur. In all cases where weather conditions permit, pavement must be
restored within 10 working days after backfilling has been completed. Temporary
gravel surfaces will be maintained at the permittee’s expense.
      (5)   Steel plates shall be used to cover cuts in roadways with over 500
vehicles a day (ADT) until it can be restored. Restoration shall be done within
7 days from the beginning of construction.
      (6)   In any case where settlement occurs after the permittee has
completed the pavement restoration or other restoration work is improper or
incomplete, the Division shall give the permittee written notice and require
that the problem be corrected within 10 working days after receipt of such
notice. Should the permittee fail to timely correct the problems, in addition
to all other penalties provided for herein, the Division reserves the right to
correct or have the problems corrected and to charge all associated costs
(including but not limited to labor, materials, equipment, supervisory, and
administrative) to the permittee.
      (7)   All manholes/water valves and similar coverings or devices used for
servicing or marking locations of various utilities within the pavement shall
be mounted flush with the surrounding pavement. Reflective markers, buttons,
etc., normally installed as delineators in the pavement must be recessed within
the pavement where practical, or be of such design, and constructed of such
materials so as not to create a hazard for traffic or maintenance equipment
when projecting above the surface of the roadway.
      (8)   Safe and efficient traffic flow is an important consideration in
the review of Application for Encroachment Permits. A traffic control plan
shall be submitted along with the application for encroachment if permittee
deems it necessary to restrict access or detour traffic because of any
condition. This plan shall conform to The South Carolina Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices (SCMUTCD), latest edition, and shall be subject to
approval by the County Engineer or his/her designated representative. The
permittee shall provide, erect and maintain all necessary barricades, lights,
danger signals, signs and other control devices. Qualified flaggers and
watchmen shall be provided by the permittee where necessary to maintain a safe
and efficient work area. The Division reserves the right to require daily
closure of trench excavations. Notification of all emergency service providers
shall be the responsibility of the Permittee. Any major road closures or
detours shall be advertised in a newspaper of general circulation within the
county as determined by the Division and shall be the responsibility of the
Permittee.
      (9)   When the conditions required by this Ordinance cannot be met, the
Division reserves the right to require additional protection of the roadway and
the public. Such additional requirements may include, but not be limited to,
new requirements for larger pipe sizes, higher quality/strength of conduits,
increased backfilling requirements up to and including concrete encasement, and
increased thickness of pavement/ driveways.
      (10)   The erection of any structure within the right-of-way shall
generally be prohibited. The erection of signage at entrances to subdivisions
shall be in accordance with current regulations of the Greenville County
Planning Commission. All zoning requirements must be met.
      (11)   Sprinkler and irrigation systems shall not be installed within the
County right of way unless specifically approved by the Division. All such
approved sprinkler and irrigation systems shall be accompanied by an
appropriate under drain system to remove excess water in the sub-grade for the
protection of the pavement. All sprinkler systems, including those adjacent to
the County right of way shall be constructed so as not to cause water to be
cast or stand upon the pavement.
   (b)   Safety and Convenience.
      (1)   Traffic controls for construction and maintenance operations shall
conform to applicable portions of the SCMUTCD, latest edition. All excavations
off the pavement or shoulders shall be properly barricaded and marked at all
times. During daylight hours, if any part of the pavement or shoulders is
necessarily occupied by equipment, trench or other obstructions, the applicant
will furnish all proper warning signs and lights, and as many flagmen as may be
deemed necessary by the Division to direct 1-way traffic where necessary. Not
more than 1000 feet of 1-way traffic shall exist during construction. The
utility shall make every effort to warn the traveling public of any emergency
nighttime excavation or pavement obstruction, and shall provide all necessary
signs, lights, and flagmen.
      (2)   All construction and maintenance operations shall be planned to
keep traffic interference to an absolute minimum. On roadways with a peak hour
volume of 400 vehicles per lane for 2-lane roadways or 450 vehicles per lane
for 4-lane roadways, no work interfering with traffic operations shall be
performed and no obstructions will be allowed during the peak hours unless said
work is of an emergency nature. All work shall be planned to minimize the
closure of intersecting streets, roads, approaches, or other access points.
      (3)   Except in emergencies, the full width of pavement will be
maintained free of all obstructions and in a safe condition for traffic during
the hours of darkness. Any excavation in the shoulder area shall be barricaded,
covered or backfilled, and marked by the proper warning signs and lights. No
equipment shall be parked in the shoulder area at night except as an additional
protection to the excavation. Any such equipment shall be well lighted.
   (c)   Location.
      (1)   Utility lines should be located to minimize later adjustments to
accommodate planned future roadway improvements and to permit servicing such
lines without interference to roadway traffic.
      (2)   In expanding areas along Arterial and Collector roadways, it is
expected that utilities will normally install distribution or feeder line
crossings, spaced as needed to serve consumers in a general area along either
or both sides of the roadway, so as to minimize the need for crossings for
service connections.
      (3)   Longitudinal installations should be located so as to provide a
safe environment for traffic operations and preserve space for future roadway
improvements.
      (4)   To the extent feasible and practical, utility line crossings of the
roadway should be normal to the roadway alignment.
      (5)   Where practical, manholes are not to be located in the pavement or
shoulder of any roadway. Exceptions may be made on streets at locations where
manholes are essential parts of existing lines that are permitted to remain in
place under existing roadways. However, such installations should: (1) Be
designed and located in a manner that will cause the least interference to
other utilities and future roadway expansion and (2) not be placed in the wheel
path of vehicles. This subsection shall apply to all roads with traffic counts
over 1000 vehicles per day (ADT). Exemptions will be granted to this Ordinance
on less traveled residential roads on a case-by-case basis, provided the
installations are constructed in accordance with sound engineering principles
and the detrimental effects to the traveling public can be minimized.
      (6)   The horizontal and vertical location of utility lines within the
road right-of-way should conform with the clear roadside policies applicable
for the type of roadway and specific conditions for the particular roadway
section involved.
      (7)   Utility lines shall not be permitted to be installed within any
stormwater culvert. Any and all utilities, including cable television lines,
placed in culverts will be removed at the owners expense; all penalties and
fines apply. Nor shall the effective capacity of any catch basin, manhole,
headwall, or other appurtenances be impeded in their function by utility lines
or other encroachments.
      (8)   In all cases, full consideration shall be given to sound
engineering principles, overall economic aspects, protection of the integrity
and scenic appearance of the roadway, maintenance operations and the safety of
roadway traffic.
   (d)   Design.
   The Permittee is responsible for the design of the facility to be installed
within the road right-of-way or attached to a roadway structure. The Division
will be responsible for review and approval of the proposal with respect to the
location, construction materials, procedures, and the manner of attachment and/
or installation. All utility installations should be of durable materials
relatively free from routine servicing and maintenance, and as a minimum, meet
the following requirements and latest revisions thereto:
      (1)   Electric power and communication facilities shall conform to the
National Electrical Safety Code.
      (2)   Water lines shall conform to the specifications of the American
Water Works Association and the State Department of Health and Environmental

permit, whether such operations be by permittee or by any subcontractor or by
anyone directly or indirectly employed by either.
      At the discretion of the Assistant County Administrator for Public Works
or the County Engineer, a Permittee may not be required to submit a Certificate
of Insurance on projects that are not permitted by a utility company or require
a licensed and bonded contractor. This waiver shall not be construed to relieve
the Permittee of any liability for property damage claims or bonding
requirements covered under subsection (j)(4).
   (h)   Liability For Personal Injuries and Property Damage. Permittee assumes
the sole responsibility for the safety and protection of the premises and of
employees and other persons, and assumes liability for any injury or damage
occurring on account of the performance of work under this encroachment permit,
whether due to the negligence, faults or defaults of permittee or not. Such
liability of permittee under this encroachment permit is absolute and is not
dependent upon any question of negligence on its part or on the part of its
agents, servants or employees, and neither the approval by the engineers or the
chief engineer of the methods of doing the work nor the failure of the
engineers or the chief engineer to call attention to improper or inadequate
methods or require a change in methods, nor the neglect of the engineers or the
chief engineer to direct the permittee to take any particular precautions or to
refrain from doing any particular thing shall excuse the permittee in case of
any such injury to person or damage to property.
   (i)   Indemnity Against Liability. Permittee shall indemnify Greenville
County, its agents, officials and employees, against all injuries, deaths,
loss, damages, claims, patent claims, suits, liabilities, judgments, costs and
expenses, that may in any way accrue against Greenville County in consequence
of the granting of this encroachment permit or that may in any way result from
that grant, whether or not it shall be alleged or determined that the act was
caused through negligence or omission of the permittee or permittee’s
employees, of the subcontractor or subcontractor’s employees, if any, and the
permittee shall, at permittee’s own expense, appear, defend and pay all charges
of attorneys and all costs and other expenses arising from or incurred in
connection with that activity, and, if any judgment shall be rendered against
Greenville County in any such action, the permittee shall, at permittee’s own
expense, satisfy and discharge that judgment. Permittee expressly understands
and agrees that any performance bond or insurance protection required by this
contract, or otherwise provided by permittee, shall in no way limit the
responsibility to indemnity, keep and save harmless and defend Greenville
County as here provided. Insurance coverage specified herein constitutes the
minimum requirements and requirements shall in no way lessen or limit the
liability of permittee. Permittee shall procure and maintain, at his own cost
and expense, any additional kinds and amounts of insurance, which, in his own
judgment, may be necessary to properly protect the interest of the work. The
permittee agrees to hold the County harmless for any damage to persons or
property, which may arise during the progress of or by reason of the work
performed.
   (j)   Bonding or Financial Guarantee Requirements.
      (1)   Bonds or cash equivalent (cash, certified check) for all
longitudinal installations and for crossing pipes, installed in unpaved
roadways or unpaved areas, shall be required in the following amounts: A
minimum $200 bond or cash equivalent for the initial 50 feet of each
encroachment, plus an additional $100 bond or cash equivalent for each
additional 50 feet, or portion thereof, per encroachment.
      (2)   Utility companies and licensed contractors/subcontractors shall be
required to post a continuous $5,000 performance bond or cash equivalent upon
which an unlimited number of permits may be issued annually. All bonds shall
remain in effect for 1 year after the completion of the construction work. All
bonds shall be released and returned to the Permittee if the work remains in an
acceptable condition or is satisfactorily corrected 1 year after completion.
      (3)   Licensed and bonded contractors/ subcontractors or utility
companies shall be required to perform all work in, on, under or over roadways.
      (4)   Permits shall not be issued to licensed and bonded contractors/
subcontractors for work that is not related to the certification or license
they may hold.
      (5)   Misc. Bonds: Any person, firm, corporation, organization or public
utility wishing to encroach on county rights-of-way for purposes other than
those generally addressed herein shall post not less than a $100 bond or cash
equivalent for such work. A minimum $300 bond or cash equivalent is required
for curb cuts for driveways. A $1,000 minimum bond or cash equivalent is
required for connection of new streets associated with subdivision developments
onto existing roads when permittee is not adequately bonded with the Greenville
County Planning Commission.
      (6)   Exemptions: Any telephone, public or electrical utility shall be
exempt from all bonding requirements, provided they have on file with the
Division an active Cooperative Agreement for the Encroachment Enforcement
Program.
   (k)   Penalties and Other Relief.
      Any person, firm, corporation, public utility, or agent, who shall
violate the provisions of this Ordinance shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and,
shall be punished within the jurisdictional limits of magistrate’s court. Each
such person, firm, corporation, public utility, or agent shall be deemed guilty
of a separate offense for each and every day or portion thereof during which
any violation of any of the provisions of this article is committed, or
continued.
      Greenville County may also seek injunctive relief, impose civil fees, or
may institute any other appropriate action in courts of competent jurisdiction
to enforce the provisions of this Ordinance.
   (l)   Permit Provisions. In addition to the conditions of encroachments
listed above, the following provisions are given concerning the use and
occupancy of the highway right-of-way by permit:
      (1)   No permit shall be issued until the applicant has deposited with
the Division a check, money order, or bond in an amount sufficient to meet the
requirements of the Division.
      (2)   Permits shall not be issued to individuals for work in, on, under
or over pavements. Licensed and bonded contractors/subcontractors or utility
companies shall be required to perform all work in, on, under or over roadways.
The issuance of permits to individuals shall be restricted to situations where
the nature of the encroachment is such that a licensed and bonded contractor/
subcontractor is not required to ensure and protect the integrity of the
roadway and the safety of the public. Permits to individuals shall not be
issued if the excavation, grading, and restoration require compaction of fill,
erosion protection measures, and other activities that would place at risk the
integrity and stability of the right-of-way.
      (3)   The Division reserves the right at any time to cancel the permit
should the applicant fail to comply with the terms and conditions under which
it was granted.
      (4)   The location of all existing utility facilities shall be determined
in advance of an excavation by the contractor and the necessary precautions
taken by him to safeguard them from damage during the execution of the work.
Anyone starting any operation that includes excavating, boring, pile driving,
blasting or digging must report this information to area utility operators at
least 3 working days in advance. A toll free call to Palmetto Utility
Protection Service (PUPS) will have most utilities located in 1 call. Other
non-participating utilities must be notified individually by the contractor.
      (5)   The costs of repairing any damage to existing pipes, driveways,
culverts, and/or other existing appurtenances shall be borne by the applicant.
Where cuts, replacements or resurfacing repairs are made to existing pavements
the required bond shall remain in effect for 1 year following the date of
completion of all work, however this does not relieve the permittee of the
responsibility of any maintenance required during the lifetime of the
encroachment.
      (6)   In an emergency where immediate action is necessary for protection
of the public, to minimize property damage, or to restore essential utility
service, the Utility may, at its sole risk and responsibility, repair its
facilities provided appropriate safety methods and devices are used to provide
adequate warning and protection to persons and property. The utility assumes
full responsibility for its operations, and ensures the Division harmless from
liability in all respects. In all such cases, a confirming permit shall be
prepared and submitted to the Division within 7 working days, and shall contain
complete information concerning the matter.
(Ord. 3673, § 2, passed 4-1-2003; Ord. 3806, § 1, passed 8-17-04)
§ 18-66 FEE SCHEDULE.
   The initial permit fee for all longitudinal and transverse installations
within the road rights-of-way shall be required in the following amounts:
   (a)   Linear Feet. A permit fee of $35 for the initial 20,000 lineal feet of
each encroachment plus an additional $35 permit fee for each additional 20,000
lineal feet or portions thereof.
   (b)   Non-Linear. When a project is such that a lineal measurement cannot
accurately describe the amount of disturbance, the permit fee shall be
determined in accordance with the following:
      (1)   A minimum $35 permit fee for disturbance of up to 5 acres and an
additional $35 for each additional 5 acres of disturbance or portions thereof,
per encroachment.
      (2)   All permit fees as enumerated above, may be waived by the Division
for telephone, public or electrical utilities who participate in the
cooperative agreement for the encroachment permit in the Encroachment
Enforcement Program.
   (c)   Newly Paved Roads. If it becomes necessary to cut any road, which has
been resurfaced within 3 years of the permit application date, a fee of $335
shall apply for the first year, $235 for the second and $135 for the third.
Restoration of the cut shall entail compaction reports from a third party geo-
technical firm confirming 95% compaction. The patch shall be restored per
Figure 3-A or an overlay of the entire roadway at the discretion of the County
Engineer.
   (d)   General Fee. A general fee of $10 is surcharged on all Building
Permits issued by the Building Standards Department for new construction. This
fee entitles a permittee to construct 1 driveway connection to any existing or
proposed county road. The general $10 fee does not cover any additional
Encroachment Permits required for all utility connections or any other work
required within the confines of Greenville County rights-of-way.
   (e)   Fee Authority. Any subsequent increase or decrease in the permit fee
shall be determined by Greenville County Council at the time it adopts its
operating ordinary and capital budgets.
   (f)   Penalty Fee. Failure to obtain an encroachment permit prior to the
start of construction, other than an emergency as defined in §
18-64(a), shall constitute a violation of this section. Violations under this
subsection shall result as follows:
   Violators shall submit a permit with all required information and
documentation at Suite 3800, County Square.
      (1)   (a)   First time violators will be subject to a double permit fee.
         (b)   The second violation in any 12-month period will result in a
permit fee of $135.
         (c)   Three or more violations in any 12-month period will result in
the violator being required to comply with the provisions of §
18-65(j)(2) of this section for “Bonding or Financial Guarantee Requirements.”
      (2)   Any person, firm, corporation, public utility, or agent, previously
bonded pursuant to §
18-65(j)(2), who proceeds to commit 3 or more violations in any 12-month period
will be subject to the Division accessing their right to increase the amount of
the bond.
   (g)   Encroachment Enforcement Program.
      (1)   Generally. Under a Cooperative Agreement, participating telephone,
public or electrical utilities may agree to take responsibility for enforcement
of the Encroachment Permit Ordinance when listed on the permit as the
permittee. The participating utility will also verify that each contractor/
subcontractor has obtained an Encroachment Permit before a permit or
authorization will be issued from that utility agency for any work to be done
on their system. Participating utilities will assist the Division in
enforcement of the Encroachment Permit Ordinance by providing notice to the
Division of any suspected or unauthorized activity.
      (2)   Revocation. Upon termination or revocation of the Cooperative
Agreement by the Division, any participating utility shall be deemed non-
performing. Upon determination by the Division that the agency is non-
performing, all usual fee and bonding requirements as required in this section
shall be applicable.
      (3)   Cooperative Agreement Fee. Those utilities which maintain active
Cooperative Agreements with the County shall be exempt from fees and bonds as
otherwise provided for herein. An annual fee shall be imposed on each utility
signing this agreement as follows:
 
1 - 10     encroachments per year No Fee
11 - 20    encroachments per year $100
21 - 30    encroachments per year $200
31 - 40    encroachments per year $300
41 - 50    encroachments per year $400
51 or more encroachments per year $500
 
   This fee includes any encroachment and is not limited to just road cuts.
Multiple cuts, taps, etc. on 1 permit are considered separate encroachments.
      (4)   Non-Compliance. Any utility working within a right-of-way without
an encroachment permit shall be deemed to be in non-compliance of the
cooperative agreement. If a utility is cited 3 times in a year for non-
compliance, they shall be struck from the cooperative agreement list and
required to pay fines, fees, bonds and post insurance certificates for all work
for a period of no less than 3 years. These exemptions in no way relieve a
participating utility from securing permits and complying with all other
provisions contained herein. The Cooperative Agreement does not relieve the
utility from paying fees associated with cutting newly paved roads or complying
with emergency cut requirements outlined in this document.
   (h)   Inspections. Inspections will be made on an as needed basis on each
permit. A final inspection 9 months after the completion of construction shall
be required before Greenville County shall release the bond required by the
provisions of this section. Emergency cuts will be inspected immediately after
receipt of the permit and again after 9 months.
(Ord. 3673, § 2, passed 4-1-2003; Ord. 3806, § 1, passed 8-17-2004)
§ 18-67 PIPELINES.
   (a)   Backfill Requirements.
      (1)   The following backfilling specification is required in connection
with any work performed within road rights-of-way: After conduit pipe or other
underground facility is installed, it is to be backfilled as indicated in
Figure 3. All backfill material shall be free from particles larger than 6
inches and free from cinders, ashes, refuse, vegetable or other organic
material. The backfill material shall be deposited in the trench for its full
width, in lifts appropriate to the type of compaction equipment used. In all
cases, contractor must achieve 95% compaction (Standard Proctor) for the entire
length, depth, and width of the installation. This method shall be followed
until the top of the trench is reached. Backfilling shall be compacted to a
minimum of 95% of the maximum density. In areas outside the construction and
maintenance limits of the roadway, but within County right-of-way, compaction
to the density of 90% of maximum density is sufficient. Care shall be taken to
compact the material under the haunches of the conduit pipe or other facility,
to place the backfill evenly on each side, and to avoid displacement of
conduit. All material and compaction requirements shall be in accordance with
Division Specifications and subject to Division approval. No jetting or
puddling will be permitted.
      (2)   In all cases, utilities should be placed at the back of the ditch
line. Where utilities must be placed in the roadway for over 500 feet, the
utility/contractor must provide compaction reports from a third party geo-
technical firm, or provide proof of filling the trench with either SC#57 stone
or Flowable Fill. Where utilities must be placed in the ditch or shoulder for
over 500 feet, it will be the responsibility of the utility/contractor to
provide compaction reports from a third party geo-technical firm when 3 or more
repetitive failures occur without mitigating factors within 1 year.
      (3)   Aggregate base course and/or aggregate shoulder stone is to be
replaced on the shoulder at a thickness equal to 6 inches or its original
thickness, whichever is greater. Paved shoulders shall be re-paved in kind.
      (4)   Backfilling shall not be performed in freezing or wet weather
except by permission of the Engineer and backfilling with frozen material will
not be permitted. No backfilling shall be made where the material already in
the trench is frozen.
   (b)   Blasting. Blasting will not be permitted within road right-of-way
unless there is no feasible alternate. Provisions must be made for adequate
protection of the roadway facility, the safety of the traveling public and
nearby residents. Notification of each case must be forwarded to the division
upon receiving blasting approval from the State Fire Marshal’s Office.
   (c)   Longitudinal Installations.
      (1)   To the greatest extent possible, longitudinal installations will
not be permitted. Where necessary to connect to existing structures, conduits
or appurtenances located within a traveled way, longitudinal installations will
be permitted to the maximum lengths necessary to remove additions or extensions
of existing services from within the traveled way.
      (2)   Only public utility companies may occupy the County’s right-of-way
longitudinally along the roadway. Perpendicular crossings may be permitted to
private companies or individuals. No private individuals or companies shall be
allowed to place any utility parallel with the roadway. All installations that
run parallel with the pavement shall be the direct responsibility of the
utility. On longitudinal installations, other than in municipal pavement
sections, pipelines should be parallel to the pavement preferable at or
adjacent to the right-of-way line.
      (3)   The nearest edge of trench should be a minimum of 2 feet or more
beyond the slope, ditch or curb line, when practical. Where possible to do so
for any length of 500 feet, or more, a greater distance will be expected. The
minimum required depth of cover on all longitudinal lines shall be 24 inches.
The trench should not be deeper than the distance from the edge of the
pavement, curb, paved shoulder, toe of slope, or ditch, as may govern, to the
nearest edge of the trench without using a bulkhead. (See Figure 2.) Material
excavated or plowed from the trench shall not be stockpiled or stored within 2
feet of the pavement edge or in a highway ditch line.
      (4)   Municipal pavement sections will be handled on an individual basis
in a manner consistent with the prevailing limitations and conditions. Whenever
practical, pipelines should be placed under the sidewalk. If the sidewalk
location is not practical, pipelines should be placed under the parking lane.
Placing of pipelines under the traveled lanes is discouraged and will only be
considered as a last resort.
      (5)   Where longitudinal installations cannot be avoided within a paved
roadway, the appropriate methods of pavement repair as detailed in the Appendix
will be required. Where the length of a longitudinal installation exceeds 50
lineal feet, as measured along the centerline of the disturbance, the surface
restoration of the roadway in whole or in part as defined hereinafter shall be
required to a point not less than 25 feet beyond each end of the disturbed
pavement. If the longitudinal installation lies within the outer 25% of the
paved roadway width on either side of the centerline, the surface restoration
of the roadway to 1/2 width shall be required. Care should be taken not to
create uneven pavement situations that can be detrimental to traffic. If the
longitudinal disturbance occurs within the center 50% of the roadway width,
full width surface restoration will be required to the limits herein before
specified.
      (6)   Where the trench patch is within the roadway, the County Engineer
may require partial or full width resurfacing of the roadway for a distance up
to 50 feet beyond each end of the trench patch. The application rate for the
hot laid asphalt surface course shall be not less that 195 lbs./sy.
   (d)   Crossings.
      (1)   All crossings should be located as near to a right angle to the
road centerline as practical, based on economic consideration of alternates.
Locations which are generally unsuitable for pipeline crossings include deep
cuts; near footings of bridges and retaining walls; at cross drains where flow
of water or stream bed may be obstructed; or within basins of an underpass
drained by a pump if pipeline carries a liquid.
      (2)   No pipe, conduit or other facility shall be placed inside any
drainage pipe or culvert. No pipe, conduit, or other facility shall be placed
across the ends of any drainage pipe or culvert in a manner that will obstruct
the free flow of water. All existing pipes, conduits or other facilities
located within existing drainage pipes or culverts shall be allowed to remain
in place. Any change in the drainage characteristics of the area which may
occur in the future and cause existing pipes, conduits, etc. within existing
drainage pipes or culverts to create an obstruction to the free flow of water
shall be removed at the expense of the owner of such pipes, conduits or other
facilities.
      (3)   Open trenching will not be employed, except when approved by the
County Engineer or his/ her representative. The County reserves the right to
require all utility lines and service lines to be bored, to preserve the
integrity of the existing pavement and to prevent the disruption to traffic or
protection of pedestrians on heavily congested road ways. Where crossings have
to be made by open trench, pavement cuts and replacements shall be made in
accordance with “Repaving Pipe Trenches” (See Figure 3A and 3B).
      (4)   The minimum required depth of cover for a crossing is 24 inches.
For cover over pipes, commonly specified surfaces are the top of pavement,
natural ground, or the flow line of drainage ditches. A protective coating is
considered part of the pipe. When the carrier is encased, cover is measured
from top of the casing. The critical control for cover on a pipeline crossing
is the low point in the highway cross-section, usually the bottom of the
longitudinal ditch.
      (5)   Markers, vents, drains, and shut-offs are appurtenances to pipeline
installation. Major pipeline crossings shall be identified by permanent
markers. These markers shall furnish sufficient information to enable
identification and contact of the owner. Casing pipe over 4 inches in diameter
shall be sealed and, if carrying combustibles, provided with a screened vent on
each end. Vent standpipes and location markers should be located and
constructed outside the clear zone, so as not to interfere with maintenance of
the highway nor to be concealed by vegetation; preferably they should stand on
a fence or right-of-way line, or in a protected location such as behind
guardrail.
(Ord. 3673, § 2, passed 4-1-2003; Ord. 3806, § 1, passed 8-17-04)
§ 18-68 ELECTRIC AND COMMUNICATION LINES.
   (a)   Overhead.
      (1)   General. A consideration for locating poles, guys and related
facilities along the highway is the width of the space between the edge of
shoulder or curb line and the right-of-way line and its availability and
suitability for accommodating such facilities. The safety, maintenance,
efficiency, and appearance of the highway are enhanced by keeping this space as
free as practical from encroachment by obstacles above the ground. Poles, guys,
or other facilities shall not be located in a highway median. Where the road
makes a curve, the conductor overhangs the road without crossing from 1 side to
the other, all crossing, and longitudinal clearance criteria must be met. In
all construction details not specifically covered herein, the current
requirements of the National Electrical Safety Code shall govern.
      (2)   Type of Construction.
         (a)   Longitudinal installations within highway right-of-way should be
limited to single pole type of construction. Joint-use single pole construction
is encouraged, as indicated by Rule 222 of Part 2 of the National Electrical
Safety Code, at locations where more than 1 utility or type of facility is
involved. This is of particular significance at locations where right-of-way
widths approach the minimum needed for safe operations or maintenance
requirements, or where separate installations may require extensive removal or
alteration of trees.
         (b)   Self-supporting poles or towers and/or dead-end construction
should be employed at all highway crossings of overhead lines. The prime
concern is the safety and appearance of the crossing. It is necessary to assure
that structures will not fall or allow conductors to drop on the roadway and
become a hazard. The National Electrical Safety Code, Section 24 through 26,
sets forth the strengths required for grades of construction for different
situations. Construction that complies with this part of the Code will meet the
division’s requirements. No lines shall be attached to trees or any other items
not specifically designed and constructed for carrying them.
      (3)   Vertical Clearance. The minimum vertical clearance for overhead
electrical and communication lines shall conform to the current National
Electrical Safety Code (See Figures 1 and 4). Cable television lines and
individual television lead-in wires shall not be placed above existing power
lines.
      (4)   Location.
         (a)   Poles and related facilities should be located at the right-of-
way line, or as near the right-of-way line as possible, outside of all
intersecting radii and the Division’s maintenance operating areas. As a
minimum, the poles should be located outside the applicable clear zone for the
highway section involved. This location is to be consistent with the standards
applied to the elimination of other obstacles. On curbed sections in urban
areas, the utilities should be located as far as practical behind the face of
the curb and, where feasible behind the sidewalk. Exception to these clearances
may be made where poles and guys can be placed at locations behind guardrails,
deep drainage ditches, toe or top of steep slopes, retaining walls and other
similarly protected locations, or where they are of a breakaway type design.
The nature and extent of highway development and the ruggedness of the terrain
being traversed are controlling factors for locating poles, guys and related
facilities near the right-of-way line.
         (b)   Location of overhead utility installations on roadways with
narrow right-of-way or on urban streets with abutting improvements are special
cases which must be resolved in a manner consistent with the prevailing
limitations and conditions. Before locating the utility at other than the
right-of-way line, consideration should be given to designs employing self-
supporting, armless, single pole construction, with vertical alignment of wires
or cables, or other techniques permitted by government or industry codes that
are conducive to a safe traffic environment.
         (c)   Where irregular shaped portions of the right-of-way are
involved, variances in location from the right-of-way line may be allowed as
necessary to maintain a reasonably uniform alignment for longitudinal
installations.
      (5)   Service Drops and Guy Wire. Guy wires to ground anchors and stub
poles should not be placed between a pole and the traveled way where they
encroach upon the clear zone. No poles, stubs for guys, or anchors should be
located in such a manner as to interfere with highway maintenance activities.
An installation, made in accordance with an approved permit or utility
agreement, covers future construction of service drops and guy wires where no
poles or stubs are to be located within the roadway right-of-way, and the
installation conforms with this manual.
   (b)   Underground.
      (1)   General. All the regulations previously outlined for pipelines
shall be applied to underground installations of electric and communication
lines, except as indicated below.
      (2)   Crossings. Buried cable crossings under paved roads will require
conduit if diameter of the bore is in excess of 3 inches. In all cases, the
conduit will be extended a minimum of 2 feet beyond the edge of the roadway;
however, if the entire right-of-way is being crossed, then the conduit limits
shall be the same as required for pipeline encasement (See Figure 2). Buried
cable crossings shall be marked in conformance with the requirements for
pipeline crossing.
      (3)   Longitudinal Installations. The burial of cable along the edge of
pavement may be by direct burial or trenching methods, maintaining a minimum
offset of 3 feet where the width of the shoulder permits. A minimum depth of 24
inches below the lowest point of the typical road cross section is required
unless the existence of rock prohibits. If rock or hard shale is encountered,
and upon the approval of the County Engineer, the depth of direct burial may be
reduced to 16 inches.
      (4)   Backfill Requirements. Backfilling of the direct burial furrow
shall be done with suitable material free from rock or large lumps, which could
create a void during compaction. Unless otherwise specified by the County
Engineer, the spoil removed by the plow will be placed over the furrow and
tracked down by the plow, this operation being repeated until the area of the
furrow is thoroughly compacted. Where trenching methods are used, backfilling
will be done in accordance with the requirements shown under pipelines.
   (c)   Installations on Roadway Structures.
      (1)   General. Attaching utility lines to a roadway structure can
materially affect the safe operation of traffic, the structure, and the
efficiency of maintenance. Where it is feasible and reasonable to locate
utility lines elsewhere, attachments to roadway structures will not be
permitted. However, where other locations prove to be extremely difficult and
unreasonably expensive, consideration will be given for attaching the utility
line to a roadway structure. The method should conform to logical engineering
considerations for preserving the highway, its safe operation, maintenance and
appearance. The following considerations apply:
         (a)   Since roadway structure designs and site conditions vary, the
adoption of standardized methods to accommodate utility facilities on
structures is not feasible. Each proposed attachment will be considered on its
individual merits.
         (b)   Attachment of a pipeline carrying a combustible transmittant
will not be permitted. Consideration may be given if applicant demonstrates
that no feasible alternative exists and, further, provided that the elevation
of the installation is above the 50-year floodplain elevation.
         (c)   Attachment of a utility will not be considered unless the
structure in question is adequate to support the additional load and can
accommodate the facility without compromising roadway features, including
reasonable ease of bridge maintenance.
         (d)   Manholes will not be allowed in bridge decks.
         (e)   Installations that would inhibit access to any structural part
for painting or repair will not be allowed.
         (f)   The installation must maintain minimum appropriate vertical
clearances.
         (g)   Support rollers, saddles and hangers, should be padded or coated
to muffle vibrations.
         (h)   Electric and communication lines shall be insulated, grounded,
and carried in protective conduit from point of exit.
      (2)   Existing Bridges. An application for the placement of any
installation on an existing bridge shall be accompanied by a complete
description and plans. This information must include the weight per lineal foot
of each line and details of the proposed method of attachment. The following
conditions apply:
         (a)   As a general rule, welding to main steel members or anchoring to
the concrete deck, parapet, or sidewalk will not be approved.
         (b)   All installations shall be placed below the elevation of the
bridge floor.
         (c)   Trenching in the vicinity of piers or abutments shall be kept at
a minimum of 2-1/2 times the depth of the trench to prevent under cutting or
sloughage of material from under the footing into the trench. An application
involving reduction of existing waterway area will not be approved.
      (3)   New Bridges. The placement of utility lines or other facilities on
new bridges will be approved only in accordance with the following conditions:
         (a)   The applicant is responsible for obtaining any desired
information regarding the Division’s proposed construction schedule.
         (b)   Applicant shall submit complete plans and specifications of
their proposed installation, including the weight per lineal foot and detail
drawings, prior to the Division’s completion of plans and specifications for
the proposed bridge or drainage structure.
         (c)   The applicant shall bear all related engineering and
construction costs incurred by the Division.
(Ord. 3673, § 2, passed 4-1-2003)
§ 18-69 STORMWATER CULVERTS.
   Where culverts are required to maintain the integrity of roadside drainage,
the minimum culvert diameter and slope shall be determined by the Division. The
minimum number of inlets and/or manholes required for proper operation and
maintenance shall be established by the Division. The responsibility for
maintenance of all culverts remains with the Permittee. The Division shall
maintain only culverts that are essential to the protection of a County-
maintained road or bridge. All stormwater conduits installed under driveways or
within County rights-of-way shall conform to applicable specifications stated
in Figure 6. Minimum cover for stormwater culverts shall be as recommended by
the manufacturer for the size, type, and quality of pipe utilized. All
stormwater culverts shall be designed in accordance with the County Stormwater
Management Design Manual.
(Ord. 3673, § 2, passed 4-1-2003)
§ 18-70 DRIVEWAYS.
   (a)   Generally. It shall generally be prohibited for a commercial driveway
to enter a road that is primarily residential. The County Engineer may grant
exceptions if the property’s only access is the residential road, or if a
second entrance on the residential road improves the safety of the motoring
public. If an exception is granted, the County Engineer may condition the
approval by requiring road improvements, including (but not limited to) road
widening, shoulder improvements, turn lanes, drainage work, and the like.
   (b)   Standards.
      (1)   Driveway installations shall conform to the details indicated on
Figures 5A, 5B, and 6 of the Appendix. Other details regarding driveways shall
conform to the SCDOT Manual entitled “Access and Roadside Management Standards”
(latest edition), or any replacement document when adopted.
      (2)   On corner lots, driveway entrances shall not be constructed within
25 feet of the intersection of the rights-of-way, including any sight triangles
on any residential-type road. Nor shall entrances be constructed within 40 feet
of the intersection of the rights-of-way on any collector or residential-type
road intersecting with any collector or arterial road.
      (3)   Where multiple flag-lots are 2 or 3 deep, a single easement must be
established to create a minimum 20 feet shared access for these lots. This
shared access may not serve more than 3 lots. On easements needed for more than
3 flag lots, the minimum allowances for street entrances shall apply.
      (4)   No concrete will be allowed except if a concrete curb is present on
the intersecting road and a construction joint is placed at the street
junction. In addition, there shall be a 6-inch thickness within the right-of-
way.

any purpose, and does not impose any of the civil disabilities imposed by a
criminal conviction.

   (1)   The registrant’s operation of the business constitutes a public
nuisance, provided the determination of the public nuisance arises from 1 or
more of the following activities on the premises or in the immediate vicinity
thereof and the registrant has actual or constructive knowledge of the
activities:
      a.   Frequent arrests of persons for crimes of violence, possession or
sale or controlled substances, possession or sale of deadly weapons, the
discharge of firearms, excessive noise, disorderly conduct, prostitution,
disturbance of the peace, and the illegal acts correspond with or relate to the
hours of operation of the business operations of this registrant;
      b.   Law enforcement agencies make an unusually high number of response
calls, regardless of arrests, to the business premises, or to the immediate
vicinity, and the high number of response calls corresponds with or relates to
the hours of business operations of the registrant;
      c.   There are ongoing and significant deposits of litter and debris in
the immediate vicinity, whether the persons making the deposits can be
identified or not, when the litter and debris relate to the business operations
of the registrant; and
      d.   Material violations of property maintenance codes, environmental
codes, fire code, and/or building codes where violations are applicable to the
business premises.
   (2)   Failure to provide sufficient security measures to protect people and

APPENDIX E: STORMWATER BANKING PROGRAM MANUAL
SECTION 1: AN OVERVIEW OF THE STORMWATER BANKING PROGRAM
1.1   Program Overview
The Stormwater Banking Program is a voluntary program that offers a predictable
process for developers to increase density in residential developments located
within Single-Family Zoning Districts.
Benefits to Developers:
   1.   Predictable process and program
   2.   Increased profits from additional units
   3.   Minimum lot size waived
   4.   Reduced setback requirements
   5.   Approval for single-family attached
Basic Steps:
   1.   Developer determines eligibility for and chooses to participate in the
program. Developer applies to County Council for approval to utilize the
Stormwater Banking Program which requires placement of the request on Council’s
next Zoning Public Hearing. The application shall then be acted on and reported
out by the Planning & Development Committee at its next regular meeting. The
application shall be forwarded to County Council who shall take final action on
the application at its next meeting.
   2.   Developer participates in the program and receives a residential
density bonus.
   3.   County uses funds generated to implement stormwater retrofits
throughout the County.
Eligibility Requirements:
   1.   Develop within the Program Area (See: Figure 2)
   2.   Use the Decision Making Tool (See Decision Making Tool) and attain
minimum score of 70.
   3.   Pay a participation fee.
   4.   Provide at least two public access roads to the subdivision. (Note: If
specific site conditions, such as very little road frontage, do not permit two
public access roads, a developer may request permission for eligibility without
meeting this requirement.)
   5.   Any development that was previously denied a re-zoning request by
Council or withdrew a re-zoning request is eligible for participation in the
Program for one year from the date of the Council decision or withdrawal.
Infrastructure capacity issues will likely exist within portions of the Program
Area. The developer will be responsible for coordination with the appropriate
infrastructure provider(s) to determine current capacity and potential upgrades
of the system. Funding for these upgrades is not provided by the Program and is
typically the responsibility of the developer.
Additional information:
      The Decision Making Tool (DMT) is an Excel® based tool that is best used
electronically to automatically calculate the overall score and participation
fee.
      A minimums score of 70 must be attained on the DMT in order to
participate in the Program; however, increases in the DMT score can reduce the
participation fee.
      The Program will be administered by the Greenville County Land
Development Division, with assistance from the Greenville County Planning
Department.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
1.2   Program Details
In order to participate in the SBP, a development must:
   1.   Be located within the Program Area,
   2.   Attain a minimum score of 70 on the Decision Making Tool (DMT),
   3.   Pay a participation fee, which is in part based upon the score
attained, and
   4.   Provide at least two public access roads to the subdivision (Note: If
specific site conditions, such as very little road frontage, do not permit two
public access roads, a developer may request permission for eligibility without
meeting this requirement.)
In exchange for their participation in the SBP, developers will receive a
residential density bonus which will allow them to develop more lots on their
site than would be allowed by the site’s current zoning (See Section 5.2:
Density Levels). Increased density will result in a number of benefits,
including increased profits for the developer as well as more compact
development which will provide fiscally conservative use of existing County
infrastructures as well as benefits to water and air quality throughout the
County.
For developments participating in the SBP the following provisions will apply:
   1.   There will be no required minimum lot area per dwelling unless
otherwise provided by SCDHEC.
   2.   There is no minimum lot width, except as required by SCDHEC and/or the
International Building Code.
   3.   No structures shall be erected within five feet from any external lot
line of any SBP development; otherwise, no front, side, or rear setbacks are
required for internal lots, except as required by the International Building
Code, and the Greenville County Encroachment and Transportation Corridor
Preservation Ordinances. (Note: Utility easements and rights of way are still
required specific to utility provider.)
   4.   The permitted uses will include Single-Family Attached and Detached.
See Section 5.2 for allowable density levels.
The participation fee paid by developers will be directed to a restricted fund,
also managed by the Greenville County LDD, which will be used to implement
strategic stormwater retrofit projects that will benefit overall water quality
in the County. Staff shall receive Council approval of the retrofit projects
and associated funding prior to using SBP funds.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
SECTION 2: PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION
2.1   Overview
The SBP will be administered by the Greenville County LDD with assistance from
the Greenville County Planning Department. See Figure 1: County SBP Flow Chart.
It will likely be necessary to periodically update several elements of the SBP
in the future. Elements that may need to be updated on a 5-year or shorter
basis include, but are not limited to: participation fee levels, DMT elements,
and the instruction manual. Council approval is necessary to make changes to
the participation fee levels, DMT elements, and the instruction manual. Density
levels should be updated in conjunction with Future Land Use Map revisions.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
2.2   Role of Land Development Division
Responsibilities of the LDD will include:
   °   To determine if a development is eligible to participate based on
location of site and proper use of the DMT.

deposited and used for strategic stormwater retrofits.
   °   To track CEPSCI evaluation reports of participating developments during
construction, to determine eligibility for and amount of participation fee
rebate, and to pay applicable participation fee rebates.
   °   To track developments participating in the bank, funds generated by the
bank, and retrofit projects completed with bank funds.
   °   To ensure that retrofit projects are completed, maintained, and
protected in perpetuity.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
2.3   Role of Planning Department
   Responsibilities of the Planning Department will include:
   °   Coordinate with the LDD to determine if developers are eligible to
participate in the SBP.
   °   To verify the following specific questions on the DMT:
      °   Property Location
      °   Proximity to a Mix of Uses
      °   Locate project within existing well-connected neighborhood
      °   Provide street connectivity and multiple route choices within

(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
SECTION 3: DECISION MAKING TOOL, INSTRUCTION MANUAL, AND PARTICIPATION FEE
3.1   Decision Making Tool
The Decision Making Tool (DMT) is designed for residential properties that have
been, or intend to be, subdivided. The DMT scores sites based on factors
related to existing physical characteristics (e.g., soils on-site), on-site
design interventions (e.g., site layout, installation of BMPs), the associated
impacts of off-site disturbances resulting from site selection (e.g.,
transportation and commercial-related impervious surfaces), and the amount of
anticipated vehicle-miles traveled that would result from the development.
Through use of the DMT, users will be educated on how site design and selection
choices play a critical role in how their development impacts water quality.
Developers must score at least a 70 in total on the DMT to participate in the
program, with at least 40 of the 70 points being earned through the Site Scale
(which is the anticipated score of developments meeting the County's minimum
stormwater requirements).
The scoring mechanism of the DMT is based in Excel®. It consists of brief
questions and answer choices that must be made by the user. Answers are either
selected via a checkbox, or are inserted as numbers through use of arrow
buttons. More detailed information and guidance on the questions is contained
in the DMT Instruction Manual.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
3.2   DMT Instruction Manual
A DMT Instruction Manual has been prepared that will walk users of the DMT
through each question of the scoring tool. (See: Instruction Manual)
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
3.3   Participation Fee
The Participation Fee is calculated using three input factors:
   1.   the development’s DMT score,
   2.   the number of additional lots allowable through the density bonus, and
   3.   the average anticipated price of lots in the development.
The user will input each of these criteria into an electronic version of the
DMT to automatically calculate their Participation Fee. The developer will be
asked to input a justification for the amount they designate as their average
anticipated price of lots.
There are two types of participation fees: the Base Participation Fee (assuming
a minimum DMT Score of 70) and the Effective Participation Fee (includes
applicable reductions based on actual DMT Score).
As a developer increases the DMT score of their development, the Base
Participation Fee may be reduced. The Base Participation Fee is reduced by
varying increments and varying percentages at the following point targets: 100
(18% reduction), 130 (36% reduction), 160 (51% reduction), 190 (61% reduction),
220 (66% reduction), 250 (69% reduction), and 280 (70% reduction). Once the
reduction is determined, it is subtracted from the Base Participation Fee. The
remaining amount is the amount a developer will actually pay the County, or the
Effective Participation Fee. The Effective Participation Fee formula is set up
to strongly incentivize developers scoring lowest on the DMT to move to the
next tiers (e.g., from a 70 to a 100, or from a 100 to a 130). Incentives still
exist as point values increase; however, at higher point level increments
incentives are reduced slightly.
See the table below to determine how a developer's fee would change if he was
provided 30 additional lots at an average selling price of $40,000/lot;
DMT Score   Base Participation Percentage Amount Reduction Effective
(in points) Fee                Reduction                   Participation Fee

130 to 159  $90,000            36%          $32,400          $57,600
160 to 189  $90,000            51%          $45,900          $44,100
190 to 219  $90,000            61%          $54,900          $35,100
220 to 249  $90,000            66%          $59,400          $30,600
250 to 279  $90,000            69%          $62,100          $27,900
280 & above $90,000            70%          $63,000          $27,000
 
When the Effective Participation Fee is collected, at least 75% will be
directed to a restricted fund intended for the direct costs associated with
retrofit installation, including design and construction, while 25% may be
directed towards administrative costs associated with the SBP, All funds will
be managed by the Greenville County Land Development Division.
See: Decision Making Tool (Summary Page)
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
SECTION 4: DISTURBANCE ASSESSMENT AND POST CONSTRUCTION REBATE
4.1   Overview
The program also takes into account a minimum compliance with required during-
construction Best Management Practices (BMPs) to minimize construction impacts
to receiving streams. This minimum compliance will be measured through CEPSCI
evaluation reports, in conjunction with any site inspections conducted by
County Staff. All CEPSCI evaluation reports of participating developments must
be electronically sent to the Greenville County LDD, who will be responsible
for tracking the CEPSCI report answers using their existing database.
After construction has ceased and final stabilization is confirmed by
Greenville County, the LDD staff will evaluate the implementation of erosion
prevention and sediment control techniques during construction. At this time
Greenville County will determine if the project should receive a rebate for
maintaining outstanding construction practices, using information from CEPSCI
reports and County inspections. Below are the conditions that would need to be
met in order to be eligible for the different rebate levels. The value of the
rebate is a percentage of the Effective Participation Fee: 15% for a full
rebate and 7.5% for a partial rebate.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
4.2   Rebate Levels
Full Rebate Level: 15% of Effective Participation Fee (If all the following
conditions are met.)
°   No Stop Work Order.
°   No Notice of Violation (NOV).
°   No unpermitted impact to offsite or onsite Waters of the US or Waters of
the State.
°   No unpermitted impact to adjacent property owners or public right of way.
°   No perimeter silt fence failures. No wash outs or sediment over tops.
°   No perimeter sediment pond or sediment basin failures.
   °   All deficiencies and corrective measures were completed prior to the
next inspection report. This includes perimeter control BMPs and internal BMPs.
   °   All silt fence and perimeter control BMPs were installed correctly and
according to the plan before any land disturbing activities took place.
°   Site stabilization measures were taken within 14 days of ceased
construction activities as required by state law.

SECTION 5: PROGRAM AREA, DENSITY LEVELS, AND REVIEW
5.1   Program Area
The area of the County in which the SBP will operate is called the Program
Area. The Program Area was determined by assessing Greenville County Priority
Management Unit (PMU) subwatersheds and evaluating a number of factors
including existing development, existing infrastructure, and transit
availability.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
5.2   Density Levels
The density levels used in the SBP are geographically based and are listed
below. Density levels have been pre-determined for various locations in the
County by consulting the Future Land Use (FLU) Map approved by County Council.
It is expected that these density levels will be updated when any significant
changes are made to the Greenville County FLU Map:
   °   Employment Center: 10 units/acre
   °   Residential Land Use 3: 10 units/acre
   °   Residential Land Use 2: 6 units/acre
   °   Residential Land Use 1: 3.6 units/acre
   °   Rural Land Use 1: 3 units/acre
Note: See Figure 2: Program Area & Density Levels.
Once Council adopts the SBP, allowable density bonuses for applicable parcels
will be integrated into the Greenville County Real Property Search webpage and
will be publicly accessible. Thus, to determine the density level allowed on a
particular parcel, a developer will access that parcel information through the
County’s website. Once the density level is accessed, a developer will multiply
the density level allowed (specified in units/acre) by the number of acres of
that site. It is important to note that the density level of a parcel is not
related to the parcel’s current zoning.
If a parcel contains “undevelopable land” as defined by the Greenville County
Zoning Ordinance, a developer may calculate the allowable density bonus based
upon the “developable land” acreage as defined by the Greenville County Zoning
Ordinance.
Note: as of 9/29/2010, the definitions for developable and undevelopable land
in the Zoning Ordinance are as follows:
   °   Developable Land: Land which is suitable as a location for structures.
   °   Undevelopable Land: Land that has development constraints due to one of
the following constraining factors: land with a slope greater than 30 percent,
lakes, marshes, sloughs, wetlands, areas within the Area of Special Flood
Hazard, defined as the land in the floodplain within a community subject to
inundation by the base flood having a one percent or greater chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year, and areas of recent or active
landslides.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
5.3   Administrative and Development Review
The initial phase of the SBP will commence upon approval of Council. The
initial phase will be defined as follows:
County Staff will conduct an Administrative and Development review of the
Program upon meeting any one of the following conditions:
(1)   Eighteen months following the date of Council approval of the Program;
(2)   After two development projects within the Priority Investment Areas (PIA)
have successfully participated in the Program; or
(3)   After two development projects outside the PIAs but within the Program
Area have successfully participated in the Program.
County Staff may initiate new projects as participating projects are
successfully completed. Upon completion of the Administrative or Development
Review the County Staff will report its findings to the SBP Stakeholders,
including County Council, who will have the opportunity to submit comments.
After receipt of comments, the County Staff will decide whether to allow the
program to function throughout the Program Area, or whether to recommend to
Council the termination or required amendments to the SBP. A report of Staffs
findings must be presented to the SBP Stakeholders and County Council within
two years of the enactment of this ordinance or the Program will be suspended
until Staffs findings are presented to the SBP Stakeholders and County Council.
For purposes of this Section (5.3), “successfully participate in the Program”
shall mean acceptance of the infrastructure for the project by the
infrastructure providers and the submission of the Final Plat.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
5.4   Triggers for Successful Completion
A.   Development Evaluation:
The development will be considered a success based on meeting the following
stormwater requirements:
1.   The current SCDHEC General construction permit for water quality
standards;
2.   The County’s Best Management Practices;
3.   Meeting the requirements of the DMT in the Stormwater Banking Program;
4.   The successful completion of all inspections of stormwater structures;
5.   Pre and post construction water quality and quantity will be modeled in
IDEAL/appropriate software and applied to the development;
6.   All water quality and quantity features installed as a part of the program
will be included as part of our annual inspection program to ensure long term
efficiency and effectiveness; and
7.   If the project receives a rebate.
B.   Overall Program Evaluation:
Success of the program will be evaluated at the time of the County’s NPDES
Permit renewal. Performance measures include: an administrative review, a
development review, funds generated by the SBP, and modeled water quality and
quantity improvements from stormwater retrofits will be evaluated. The County
Staff shall report its finding (success/shortcomings of the program) to the SBP
Stakeholders. The SBP Stakeholders will have the opportunity to comment on the
findings.
Figure 2. Program Area & Density Levels - A map with the streets and marked
priority investment areas shall be shown for each program area. (Appendix C)

SECTION 6: PENALTY AND DEFAULT FEES
6.1   Penalty Fee
If a developer pays an Effective Participation Fee based upon an expected DMT
score that is not actually attained upon completion of the development, he may
be assessed a penalty fee. At least 75% of any penalty fee assessed will be
directed to the retrofit fund, while 25% of the fee can be utilized for
administration purposes. The fee will only take effect if a developer’s
inability to attain his originally anticipated DMT score drops him into a lower
“tier” of the participation formula (See Section 3.3: Participation Fee). For
example, if a development initially calculated and paid an Effective
Participation Fee of $57,600 based upon a score of 130-159 and then only
“earned” between 100 - 129 of those points when the project was completed, the
developer would be responsible for paying the difference as if the development
had earned only a 100 - 129 originally (in which case his fee would have been
$73,800). The assessed penalty fee would be $73,800 - $57,600, or $16,200.
 
Penalty Fee = (Corrected Effective Participation Fee) - (Initial Effective
Participation Fee)
 
Penalty Fee Example:
This example assumes the developer received 30 additional lots at an average
selling price of $40000 for each lot and expected a DMT score of 130 but actually
achieved a DMT score between 100-129.
 
•   Base Participation Fee: = $90,000
•   Initial Effective Participation Fee: (Fee paid based on expected DMT score of
130-159)
$90,000 - $32,400 = $57,600
•   Corrected Effective Participation Fee: (Fee according to actual DMT score of
100-129)
$90,000 - $16,200 = $73,800
•   Penalty Fee: (Owed to County)
[($73,800) - ($57,600)] = $16,200
 
Note: To avoid penalty fees, any development whose score is close to the
threshold between two “tiers”, should pay special attention to ensuring that
enough points are earned so as to avoid dropping into a lower “tier”.
(Ord. 4542, passed 3-5-2013)
6.2   Default Fee
If a developer pays an Effective Participation Fee based upon an expected DMT
score that is not actually attained upon completion of the development, AND in
so doing, fails to meet the minimum participation score of 70 on the DMT, he
will be assessed a default fee. (Note: This is a highly unlikely scenario since
the average score of typical developments in Greenville County is above a 70.)
At least 75% of any default fee assessed will be directed to the retrofit fund,
while 25% of the fee can be utilized for administration purposes. The default
fee will consist of double the Base Participation Fee (fee if the development
had received the minimum participation score of 70), minus the amount that has
already been paid as an Effective Participation Fee. The default fee is
calculated using the following formula (where the Base Participation Fee equals
the fee that would have been paid if the developer had earned a score of 70
originally):
 
Default Fee =
[2 x (Base Participation Fee)] - (Effective Participation Fee)
 
For example, if a development initially calculated and paid an Effective
Participation Fee of $57,600 based upon a score of 130-159 and then only
“earned” 69 of those points when the project was completed, it would drop below
the minimum score required of 70 points. Therefore, the developer would be
assessed a default fee of two times the Base Participation Fee had he
originally earned a 70, minus the amount already paid; or 2($90,000) - $57,600
= $122,400, where $90,000 equals the Base Participation Fee he would have
originally paid had he scored a 70 on the DMT.
 
Default Fee Example:
This example assumes the developer received 30 additional lots at an average
selling price of $40,000 for each lot and expected a DMT score of 135, but actually
achieved a DMT score of 69 (which is lower than the minimum of 70 required for
participation).
•   Base Participation Fee: = $90,000
•   Effective Participation Fee: (Fee paid based on expected DMT score of 135)
$90,000 - $32,400 = $57,600
•   Default Fee: (Owed to County)
[2 x ($90,000)] - ($57,600) = $122,400
 
Note: A default fee will only be assessed if a development falls below the
minimum participation score of 70 points. Thus, if a development is close to
the 70-point threshold, the developer should take special note to ensure that
all points are attained in order to avoid paying a Default Fee.
