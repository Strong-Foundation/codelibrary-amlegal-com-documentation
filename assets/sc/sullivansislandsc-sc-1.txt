(Ord. 2020-22, passed 1-19-2021)
§ 37.02 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted pursuant to and in compliance with South

Town Council shall develop the policies dictating the procurement of goods and
services. Town Council has the right to assume full and final authority in any

through receipt and acceptance of delivery and processing of a final invoice
for payment.
   (C)   The Council of the town delegates to the Town Administrator, or
designee, the duties and responsibilities for administering the procurement of
all supplies, services, and construction, as well as the management and
disposal of surplus supplies and equipment in accordance with this chapter.
   (D)   The Town Comptroller or authorized designee, shall provide for
implementation and compliance with all requirements of this chapter in order to
maximize the purchasing value of public funds, providing safeguards for
maintaining quality and integrity within the procurement system, yet providing
for the fair and equitable treatment of all involved in public procurement. The
Town Comptroller shall organize and execute all procurement activities for the
town as set forth in this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 22-2) (Ord. 2020-22, passed 1-19-2021)
§ 37.03 COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall prevent any municipal department from
complying with the terms and conditions of state or federal laws and/or
regulations which may be applicable.
   (B)   Procurement which involves the expenditure of federal assistance,
contract funds, any grants, gifts, or bequest shall also comply with such
federal and state laws and authorized regulations as are mandatorily applicable
regardless of whether they are presently reflected in this chapter.
Notwithstanding where requirements within this chapter are more restrictive,
federal or state requirements shall be followed.
   (C)   The Town Administrator and Comptroller have created a set of
regulations which are hereby adopted and are incorporated into this chapter as
Appendix A.
(Ord. 2020-22, passed 1-19-2021)
§ 37.04 ETHICAL PROCUREMENTS.
   (A)   In all actions involving the procurement of supplies, services, or
construction for the town, the provisions of S.C. Code, Title 8, Chapter 13
(State Ethics Act), 1976, as amended, shall be complied with and observed.
Every contract or duty imposes an obligation of good faith in the negotiation,
performance, or enforcement by town staff. GOOD FAITH means honesty in fact in
the conduct or transaction concerned and the observance of reasonable
commercial standards of fair dealing. All procurement activities shall be
performed in an ethical manner. No member of Town Council or any officer or
employee of the town, shall have a financial interest in any contract or in the
sale to the town or to a contractor supplying the town of any land or rights or
interest in any land, material supplies or services; except when a majority of
the Town Council determines such exception is in the best interest of the town,
provided, that no Councilperson whose interest is involved shall vote on the
question. Any willful violation of this section shall constitute malfeasance in
office, and any officer or employee of the  town found guilty thereof shall
thereby forfeit his or her office or position. Any violation of this section
with the knowledge, expressed or implied, of the person or corporation
contracting with the town shall render the contract voidable by the Town
Administrator or the Town Council.
   (B)   The following actions are prohibited and shall be avoided by all those
involved in the procurement activities of the town:
      (1)   Not obligate the town financially or otherwise by any means,
including but not limited to purchase orders and contracts, when the employee
or Councilmember has a personal, financial, or other interest in the
obligation;
      (2)   Prohibited from directly or indirectly soliciting or accepting any
rebate, kickback, gift, gratuity, or favor for personal gain from any
individual, corporation, organization, or group. Doing so may lead to
disciplinary action.
      (3)   Prohibited from accepting any form of gratuities, with the
exception of nonconsumable marketing or promotional mementos valued at $25 or
less which may be accepted but shared with all town employees (i.e., pens,
paper clips, pencils, cups, and the like). Accepting any other such form of
gratuities, may lead to disciplinary action.
(Prior Code, § 22-1) (Ord. 2020-22, passed 1-19-2021)
§ 37.05 PROCUREMENT LIMITATIONS AND AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   It is the town’s policy to develop competition to ensure maximum
purchasing value for all procurements and to make awards based on the lowest,
responsive, responsible bid/offer received. Nothing in this section shall
prohibit a higher level, more stringent procurement method being used if it is
determined that the town’s best interest would be better served. No contract or
purchase shall be subdivided to avoid the requirements of this section.
   (B)   Upon verification of adequate monies, procurement of goods and/or
services shall be executed as follows:
      (1)   $1 to $5,000 - administrative process “delegated authority.”
Competitive bidding is not required. The department initiating the purchase
should exercise good judgment in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   $5,001 to 10,000 – verbal quotations.
         (a)   Competitive pricing is required. The departments will request
verbal quotations from vendors in order to obtain competitive pricing. At
minimum, three verbal quotes shall be solicited.
         (b)   The Town Administrator or the Town Comptroller, or designees,
must approve before the purchase is made.
      (3)   $10,001 to $25,000 – written quotations.
         (a)   Competitive pricing is required. The departments will request
written quotations from vendors in order to obtain competitive pricing. At
minimum, three written quotes shall be solicited.
         (b)   The Town Administrator and the Town Comptroller, or designees,
must approve before the purchase is made.
         (c)   Purchases inclusive of grants and those with federal funds shall
be referred to the Town Comptroller for processing.
      (4)   $25,001 to $49,999 – informal solicitations for bids or proposals.
         (a)   Competitive bidding is required. The Town Council will issue a
written Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Proposals (RFP), or Request for
Qualifications (RFQ) depending on the type of procurement. At minimum, three
written bids or responses should be solicited.
         (b)   The Town Administrator and the Town Comptroller, or designees,
must approve before the purchase.
         (c)   Purchases inclusive of grants and those with federal funds shall

      (5)   Purchases $50,000 and over – formal solicitations for bids or
proposals.
         (a)   Competitive, sealed bidding is required; however, approval by
Council is required before the purchase is made.
         (b)   Procurements involving construction may use a construction
contracting administration method which is most advantageous to the town and
will result in the most timely, acceptable quality, economical, and successful
completion of the construction project. The Town Administrator or designees,
shall make a determination regarding the appropriate method of construction
contracting administration for a particular construction project.
         (c)   When it is determined that competitive, sealed bidding is either
not practical, appropriate, or advantageous, competitive, formal sealed
proposals shall be used. Approval by the Council is required before the
purchase is made.
   (C)   Exceptions to bidding include the sole source, professional services,
emergency procurements, purchasing cooperatives, multiterm contracts, and
critical procurements as defined below.
      (1)   SOLE SOURCE.
         (a)   Sole source procurement is acceptable when, after a good faith
review of all possible sources, it is determined there is only one viable
source for material, supply, or service.
         (b)   Sole source requests should not be made unless town staff is
confident the request is reasonable and appropriately justified.
         (c)   For sole source procurements between $5,001 and $25,000, at the
request of the department manager, the Town Administrator, the Comptroller, or
their designees, must approve the written sole source justification prior to
the purchase being made. Approval by the Town Administrator, or designee is
required for procurements between $25,001 to $50,000.
      (2)   PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. Professional services shall be advertised
formally when services are expected to be $50,000 or greater.

agencies, Charleston County and other South Carolina counties, South Carolina
municipalities or purchasing cooperatives write numerous indefinite-delivery-
type contracts yearly with manufacturers, service providers and contractors for
regional and/or nationwide items or services. In all cases, town procurement of
equipment, goods or services may be made from suppliers which have contracts in
place through the State of South Carolina or one of its agencies, or Charleston
County or other South Carolina county, or South Carolina municipality, or the
U.S. General Services Administration, or purchasing cooperative, without
seeking competitive bids or proposals.
      (5)   MULTITERM CONTRACTS. Multiterm contracts, also known as indefinite
delivery or indefinite quantity contracts, may be used for products, goods,
and/or services of such nature that an ongoing annual requirement exists. Where
and when such conditions exist, multiterm contracts should be used as much as
possible to be in the best interests of the town. Multiterm contracts for
supplies and services may be entered into for specified periods of time, not to
exceed five years.
         (a)   Subject to the limitations of this chapter, any type of contract
which promotes the best interests of the town may be used, with the exception
of cost-plus-a-percentage-of-cost contract which is prohibited. A cost
reimbursement, or a cost reimbursement-plus-a-fixed-fee, may be used when it is
determined that such a contract would be less costly to the town than any other
type, or that it is impracticable to obtain the supplies, services, or
construction required except under such a contract.
         (b)   The town’s best interest shall be served by contracts originated
by using competitive prices obtained by: itemized unit measurement with cost,
itemized project description breakdown with costs itemized, and lump sum
project cost.
      (6)   CRITICAL PROCUREMENT. The Town Administrator, or designee, may make
or authorize procurements that in nature are critical to the town, and time
does not permit for solicitation or re-solicitation, and that the procurement
may be accomplished in such a method that provides the town’s best interest be
served.

SECTION 1: WHAT IS PROCUREMENT
Procurement is the process through which requisitions are received,
solicitations issued, vendors selected, contracts awarded, purchase orders
issued, goods or services are received, and payment is made.
One of Procurement’s main roles is ensuring goods and services are of high
quality, available when needed and not overpriced. Additionally, taxpayers must
know that public funds are spent wisely on its behalf and not for the personal
benefit of government employees, officials, or their friends.
The Procurement Agents, consisting of the Town Administrator and the
Comptroller, procure goods and services for the Town of Sullivan's Island
(Town) by performing the following tasks:
   •   Process and approve certain purchase requisitions
   •   Issue purchase orders and change orders
   •   Review specifications
   •   Advertise and issue solicitations
   •   Evaluate bids, proposals, and quotations
   •   Negotiate and draft contracts
   •   Maintain vendor contact lists
   •   Administer and closeout contracts
   •   Resolve vendor/contractor performance complaints and contract compliance
issues
   •   Verify licenses and insurance coverage for contractors (as needed)
   •   Provide procurement training
   •   Ensure compliance with the Procurement Code (Chapter 37 of Town
Ordinances) and audit procurement files
   •   Manage surplus and seized property and disposition
   •   Review and Update the Town’s Procurement Regulations Guide on an annual
basis.
1.1: Procurement Authority
The Procurement Agents derive their authority from Town Ordinance Chapter 37.
Town Council passed and adopted Ordinance Chapter 22, to govern the procurement
activities of the Town, under the direction of the Town Administrator and the
Comptroller. In general, the Ordinance established that the Procurement Agents'
duties have been prescribed by the laws of the State of South Carolina and Town
Council. Federal law is applicable to Town procurement activities anytime
Federal funds are used for certain procurements.
1.2: Procurement Mission Statement
To effectively manage the costs of goods and services to best meet the needs of
Town departments and to deliver superior performance in a manner that is
distinctive and impactful to each person served and establishes a standard for
quality that endures for generations.
1.3: Procurement Objectives and Standards
All procurements will be conducted with the following values:
   •   Avoid unfair practices and give all qualified vendors an equal
opportunity to do businesses with the Town.
   •   Refuse to accept any form of bribery and prevent any appearance of doing
so.
   •   Receive counsel from colleagues and cooperate with them to promote a
spirit of teamwork and unity.
   •   Behave with fairness and dignity, and demand honesty and truth
throughout the procurement process.
   •   Strive for greater knowledge of procurement methods and the materials
and services purchased.
   •   Purchase without prejudice, stimulate competition on all procurements,
and seek to obtain the maximum value for each dollar spent of taxpayer monies.
   •   Maintain competitive bidding procedures as the primary, preferred,
method of procurement.
   •   Develop material standards that afford a wide area of competitive
bidding consistent with the required levels of quality.
   •   Maintain open, public records of firms solicited, and all prices quoted
and paid for items obtained for Town use.
   •   Furnish clear indications of quality and service required in all bid
solicitations.
1.4: Procurement Ethics
The following ethic statements are applicable to all Town employees who
participate in the procurement process:
   •   Town employees shall not obligate the Town financially or otherwise by
any means, including but not limited to purchase orders and contracts, when the
employee has a personal, material, financial or other interest in the
obligation.
   •   Employees are prohibited from directly or indirectly soliciting or
accepting any rebate, kickback, gift, gratuity, or favor for personal gain from
any individual, corporation, organization, or group. Doing so may lead to
disciplinary action.
   •   Town employees shall not accept any form of gratuities, with the
exception of non-consumable marketing or promotional mementos valued at $25 or
less which may be accepted but shared with all Town employees (i.e., pens,
paper clip holders, pencils, cups, etc.). Accepting any other such form of
gratuities, may lead to disciplinary action.
Every contract or duty imposes an obligation of good faith in the negotiation,
performance or enforcement by Town staff. Good faith means honesty in fact in
the conduct or transaction concerned and the observance of reasonable
commercial standards of fair dealing.
In all actions involving the procurement of Town items, the provisions of South
Carolina State Ethics Act shall be complied and observed.
1.5: Procurement Organization Structure
The Town Administrator, or designee, shall be responsible for administering the
Procurement Code.
The Comptroller, or designee, shall provide for implementation and compliance
with all the requirements of this policy to meet the objectives and standard
set forth. The Town Administrator and Comptroller shall coordinate with the
Department Heads in establishing specifications for use in the procurement of
all materials, supplies, equipment, construction, or services, including
directing the bidding process of appropriate purchases, supervising the
evaluation of bids, and participating in contract negotiations. They shall
coordinate the awarding and executing of contracts and purchases within the
confines of the procurement ordinance and ensure compliance with local, State,
and Federal guidelines. The Comptroller shall be responsible for training staff
in the procurement policies and establishing and maintaining an effective
professional working relationship between all personnel and suppliers,
department heads, contracts, and other governmental units and the public.
Department heads and/or any Town agent shall provide for implementation and
compliance with all the requirements of this policy and as applicable to small
purchases, departmental procurement inclusive of internal departmental
processes and procedures or the expenditure of public monies.
The Administrative Department is located at the Town hall at 2056 Middle
Street. Office hours are Monday through Friday, 8 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.
SECTION 2: TOWN POLICIES AFFECTING PROCUREMENT
2.1: Solicitation Policies
It is the Town’s policy to develop competition to ensure maximum purchasing
value for all procurements and to make awards based on the lowest, responsive,
responsible Bid/Offer received.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit a higher level, more stringent
procurement method being used if it is determined that the Town’s best interest
would be better served.
Purchase orders will be issued, using the Town’s financial software, to the
recommended vendor. Purchase requisitions entered into the financial software
must be approved based upon the correct level of authorization which
corresponds to the purchase price.
2.2: Procurement Levels
$1 to $5,000 - Administrative Process “Delegated Authority”
Competitive bidding is not required. At the Buyer’s discretion, a purchase
order will be issued to the vendor recommended by the requesting department.
The department head, or designee, must approve the purchase requisition in the
financial software which authorizes the purchase. The department should
exercise good judgement in accordance with this Guide. The department head, or
designee, shall ensure funds are budgeted sufficient for the purchase.
$5,001 to $10,000 - Verbal Quotations
Competitive pricing is required. Departments shall request verbal quotations
from vendors in order to obtain competitive pricing. At minimum, three quotes
shall be solicited.
$10,001 to $25,000 - Written Quotations
Competitive pricing is required. Departments shall request written quotations
from vendors in order to obtain competitive pricing. At minimum, three written
quotes shall be solicited.
If three quotes cannot be solicited, please see section on Sole Source. Award
is made to the lowest quote.
The Town Administrator and the Comptroller, or designees, must approve before
the purchase is made if between $10,001 to $25,000.
Purchases inclusive of grants, those with Federal funds, or those requiring
contracts shall be referred to the Town Administrator for processing.
$25,001 to $49,999 - Informal Solicitations for Bids or Proposals
Procurement will issue a written Invitation for Bids (IFB), a Request for
Proposal (RFP), or a Request for Qualifications (RFQ), depending on the type of
procurement. Typically, commodity items are procured using a bid process where
an award is made to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. However, in
some instances an RFP may be used.
At minimum, three written bids should be solicited in the case of an IFB. If
three bids cannot be solicited, please see section on Sole Source. Award is
made to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder. In the case of RFP/RFQ,
award is made in accordance with the evaluation criteria, terms and conditions
stated therein.
Purchases inclusive of grants, those with Federal funds, or those requiring
contracts shall be referred to the Town Administrator for processing.
For normal competitive purchases, the department manager, the Town
Administrator, and the Comptroller, or designees shall approve before the
purchase is made.
Purchases over $49,999 - Formal Bids or RFQ/RFPs
Competitive, sealed bidding is required; however, approval by the Town Council
for purchases over $49,999 is required before the purchase is made.
Procurements involving construction may use a construction contracting
administration method which is most advantageous to the Town and will result in
the most timely, acceptable quality, economical, and successful completion of
the construction project. The Town Administrator or designee, shall make a
determination regarding the appropriate method of construction contracting
administration for a particular construction project.
When it is determined that competitive, sealed bidding is either not practical,
appropriate or advantageous, competitive, formal sealed proposals shall be
used. Approval by the Council is required before the purchase is made.
2.3: Exceptions to Bidding
2.3A: Sole Source
Sole Source procurement is acceptable when, after a good faith review of all
possible sources, it is determined there is only one viable source for
material, supply, or service. To be a sole source:
   •   a vendor shall have the ability to deliver a unique material or service,
   •   have technical expertise or qualifications,
   •   have software license,
   •   the ability to deliver at a particular time, or
   •   have the ability to fulfill the needs for a special purpose or situation
from a qualified provider.
Sole source requests should not be made unless the department is confident the
request is reasonable, appropriately justified to meet the Town’s requirements,
and can withstand a possible audit. Sole source minimizes or eliminates
competition and should be prudently used.
The department manager, or designee, may use “delegated authority” practices
for purchases $5,000 and under. From $5,000 to $25,000 the department manager,
the Town Administrator, or the Comptroller, or designees, must approve the
written sole source justification before the purchase may be made. For
purchases between $25,001 to $49,999, the department must coordinate with the
Comptroller, or designees, before obtaining approval by the Town Administrator,
or designee.
2.3B: Emergency Procurement
The Town Administrator, or designee, may make or authorize others to make
emergency procurements when there exists a threat to public health, welfare, or
safety under emergency conditions or where normal daily operations are affected
or in jeopardy.
Technically, an emergency need is one that could not have been foreseen.
Failure to submit a requisition on time does not constitute a valid emergency.
2.3C: Purchasing Cooperatives
The State of South Carolina and its agencies, Charleston County and other South
Carolina counties, South Carolina municipalities or purchasing cooperatives
write numerous indefinite-delivery-type contracts yearly with manufacturers,
service providers and contractors for regional and/or nationwide items or
services. In all cases, town procurement of equipment, goods or services may be
made from suppliers which have contracts in place through the State of South
Carolina or one of its agencies, or Charleston County or other South Carolina
county, or South Carolina municipality, or the U.S. General Services
Administration, or purchasing cooperative, without seeking competitive bids or
proposals.
For purchases over $10,000, departments must coordinate with the Comptroller,
or designee, to ensure proper procurement.
The Town may sell to, under the guidance of the Town Administrator, may acquire
from, or use any supplies belonging to another public procurement unit as
agreed upon between the parties. The Town, under the guidance of the Town
Administrator, may enter into agreements for the common use or lease of
warehousing facilities, capital equipment, and other facilities with another
public procurement unit under the terms agreed upon between the parties.
2.3D: Critical Procurement
The Town Administrator, or designee, may make or authorize procurements that in
nature are critical to the Town, and time does not permit for solicitation or
re-solicitation, and that the procurement may be accomplished in such a method
that provides the Town’s best interest be served.
The Town Administrator, or designee, may make or authorize others to make,
critical procurements when in nature, it is critical to the Town and time does
not permit for solicitation or re-solicitation and that the method provides
that the Town’s best interest is served. In such cases, the department head
must coordinate with the Comptroller, or designee, before seeking written
approval by the Town Administrator, or designee.
2.4: Invalid purchases
The Town may consider as void, any purchase or contract made on behalf of the
Town which is contrary to the provisions of Town Ordinance
Chapter 37 or this policy. The employee making such purchase transactions will
be considered for disciplinary action by their department manager or the Town
Administrator as appropriate.
2.5: Insurance
The Town requires that contractors have, and maintain, certain types of
insurance coverage when they repair, install, construct, or otherwise perform
services. Insurance requirements vary depending on the type/scope of services
provided. In certain cases, the contractor will need to provide insurance
coverage. Insurance coverage may include commercial general liability,
automobile liability, worker's compensation insurance, and/or professional
liability insurance. The departments are required to follow up with the
contractor to ensure insurance records are kept and maintained up-to-date. If
the contractor fails to provide insurance coverage requirements, or
documentation is not provided to the Town; the Town reserves the right to
terminate the contract with the contractor for cause.
2.6: Training
The Town will provide, at least annually, a training session for all Town
departments to familiarize themselves with the Town’s policies, procedures and
guidelines for the procurement process.
2.7: Retention and Disposition
The Public Records Act (Code of Laws of South Carolina 1976, as amended,
Sections 30-1-10 through 30-1-170) sets forth requirements for the retention
and disposition of Procurement Files. Departments should coordinate records
retention and disposition with the Town Clerk.
SECTION 3: METHODS OF PROCUREMENT
3.1: Appropriated Monies
Except for emergencies or other authorized exceptions, no procurement or
commitment of monies shall be made by any department, or employee of the Town
unless monies have been appropriated and are available in the appropriate
account. Monies can be transferred from other line items within a department
with the approval of the Town Administrator, Comptroller, or designee.
3.2: Contracts or Agreements
A contract, or an agreement, is a legally binding document that is used for
most purchases over $50,000. It authorizes the contractor to design, build,
provide services or deliver materials or supplies in accordance with the terms
and conditions specified thereon (or incorporated from a bid or other document
by reference). It also acknowledges the obligation of the Town to pay for goods
or services ordered, upon the receipt and proper invoice. The Town Council and/
or the Town Administrator, or authorized designee, may legally bind the Town in
procurement documents. All negotiations, contracts and the like are not
finalized until written signature of the Town Administrator or authorized
designee.
3.3: Purchase Orders
A purchase order (PO) authorizes the vendor to deliver materials or supplies in
accordance with the terms and conditions specified thereon (or incorporated
from a bid or other document by reference). It also acknowledges the obligation
of the Town to pay for goods or services ordered, upon the receipt and proper
invoice. Unless a separate contract document is executed, the purchase order
establishes the contractual relationship between the Town and the vendor.
A PO is a legally binding contract. The PO is the Town’s commitment for the
value of the material or service ordered.
One-time purchase orders are generally issued for a finite quantity of
products, construction, or services. Once a PO has been issued, the accounting
system will automatically encumber, or set aside, the monies from the
department’s budget. This allows the department to more closely monitor their
budget. Once the goods or service has been received, and the invoice has been
received and approved; payment may be applied.
A blanket purchase order may be used for purchases that are made on an “as-
needed” basis. Only items, or services, that are described on the blanket
purchase order may be purchased. Control of the use of the blanket purchase
order is the responsibility of the Comptroller, or designee. Blanket PO’s allow
departments to order as-needed items throughout the fiscal year without having
to request a new PO for each purchase as well as the ability to qualify for
lower, consolidated pricing. Any authorized Town employee may issue a release
for specific goods described by the blanket PO pursuant to its terms and
conditions.
In certain instances, for example, purchases from utilities, PO’s may not be
required. It is the responsibility of the Comptroller to make the determination
as to the necessity of a PO for such purchases.
3.4: Change Orders
Because the contract or purchase order (PO) is a legal document that
represents, or forms the basis of, the contractual relationship between the
Town and a vendor, any changes to that contract must be in writing. When change
orders are needed, they must be approved in the same sequence as the initial
contract or PO, up to and including approvals by the Comptroller, Town
Administrator, or designees. Any payments to the vendor will be delayed while
proper documentation is completed. Furthermore, the contractual rights of the
Town and the vendor are jeopardized by such unauthorized changes.
SECTION 4: TOWN PROCEDURES FOR SOLICITATIONS
4.1: Notice/Advertisement of Solicitations
Offers shall be requested and obtained from at least three sources whenever
possible. When the procurement of goods or services is anticipated to be
greater than $25,000, the solicitation must be accomplished in writing.
Solicitations shall be issued in an efficient and economical manner to at least
attempt to secure, if available, three qualified sources.
All suppliers solicited shall be afforded complete, unbiased information as to
the description or requirements of the goods and services, including any
special conditions of the expected procurement.
Solicitations shall include specifications, a clearly defined scope of goods or
services, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the
procurement.
Adequate notice for the formal solicitations shall be given, no less than ten
calendar days prior to the date set forth therein for the opening of the bids.
Such notice shall include publication in a newspaper of general circulation
within the appropriate classified section, or publication on the Town’s
website, or publication on the South Carolina Business Opportunities (SCBO)
website.
Written responses will be acceptable as disclosed in the solicitation.
4.2: Specifications
Specifications are defined in this context as, any technical or purchase
description or other description of the physical quality or functional
characteristics, or of the nature of a supply, service, or construction item.
It may also include a description of any requirement for inspecting, testing or
preparing a supply, service, or construction item for delivery. It is the
primary responsibility of the requesting department head to furnish adequate
specifications to the Town Administrator. The Town reserves the right to
specify brand names based on its experience, current inventory and other
qualifications specified by the requesting department. However, on occasion
brand names may be noted as descriptive, not restrictive information, and in
such cases, are used to indicate the quality and characteristics of products
that will be satisfactory. In these instances, the Town in its solicitation
will note that it will consider Bids offering “equal” products other than the
one described by brand name if such products are clearly identified in the Bid
response to the Town.
Specifications should be adequately detailed, precise, clear but simply worded,
not unduly restrictive to permit competitive bidding, and to encourage cost
effective procurement.
No changes in specifications shall be made to an invitation or any
solicitation, unless all prospective offerors shall be notified of any changes.
In the case of formal invitations, this shall be accomplished by written
addenda and delivered to all offerors known to have received an invitation. In
the case of informal solicitations, this may be accomplished by telephone,
verbally, email, through the Town’s Procurement Portal, by fax transmission or
in writing, depending on the complexity of the change. The changes must be
clear, precise, assuring no misunderstanding by an offeror, no matter how the
change is communicated. The changes shall be made available to all prospective
offerors.
Should it be determined, after all bids of $50,000 or more have been received
and reviewed, that a product or service with an alternate specification would
prove to better serve the Town’s needs and best interest; all such bids may be
rejected at the discretion of the Council.
It is desirable that the Town stay abreast and current with rapid changes in
methods and state-of-the-art products, goods, and services. Alternate
specifications may be requested and considered when it is determined by the
Town that such proposals would be in the Town’s best interest and clearly
indicated within the invitation.
Specifications as written and solicited are generally the minimal requirements
which will be acceptable for the needs of the Town. Superior or “better than”
offers may be considered and accepted by the Town if the following conditions
are met:
   •   Superior products, goods, or services do not exceed the cost of the
lowest or next lowest responsive offer or under budget;
   •   the overall integrity is not jeopardized as far as the form, fit, and
function is maintained; and
   •   it is in the best interests of the Town.
4.3: Receipt, Safeguarding and Opening of Solicitations
All bids received prior to the advertised opening shall be kept secure and
unopened. Formal, sealed bids and proposals that are hand delivered will be
initialed, indicating the date and time received into the Administrative
Department.
Sealed bids shall be opened in the presence of one or more witnesses at the
time and place designated in the solicitation. The name of each bidder, the
amount of each bid, and other relevant information as specified in the
solicitation, will be tabulated. The bid tabulation shall be open to public
inspection at that time.
Proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at
the time and place designated in the solicitation. However, only the names of
the offerors will be read aloud, recorded, and open for public inspection.
Contents of the successful offeror’s proposal, upon written request, shall be
made available for inspection. Information considered confidential shall not be
disclosed.
The Town Administrator may authorize use of electronic submission of bids/
proposals. If electronic submission is authorized, the solicitation shall
specify the acceptable method that offerors may use.
4.4: Corrections or Withdrawals
Corrections or withdrawals or inadvertently erroneous bids prior to bid
opening, withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids after award, or
cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes may be permitted
in accordance with this Guide and the solicitation.
Any offeror may, by requesting in writing, withdraw the bid or proposal for any
reason prior to the scheduled opening.
Properly worded and directed changes or corrections, which do not disclose the
total bid amount, may be made by any bidder if submitted to the Town in writing
prior to the bid opening. Changes that indicate or openly divulge the total
amount of the bid shall not be accepted. These changes or corrections may be
delivered as disclosed in the solicitation.
   •   To increase or decrease a previously submitted lump sum bid amount, the
bidder shall instruct the Town the amount that the bid is to be increased or
decreased by.
   •   In a case of a bid which contains multi-items, the bidder shall instruct
the Town the item and the amount that is desired to be increased or decreased.
After the opening, no changes in offeror prices or other provisions of the bid/
proposal prejudicial to the interest of the Town or fair competition shall be
permitted.
4.5: Late Bids/Proposals
It shall be the responsibility of all offerors to provide adequate means
whereby their proposal or bid, whether electronically submitted, mailed or
hand-delivered be received by the Town no later than the date and time as
stated in the solicitation. Any proposal, modification, or withdrawal received
at the Town’s designated office in the solicitation after the exact time
specified for receipt of solicitation is “late” and will not be considered.
4.6: Acceptance and Evaluation
All responses received shall be evaluated for price, quality, acceptability, as
specified, availability of goods or services, past performance, transportation
or any other special cost or factors which may apply, including any special
conditions or exceptions which the offeror may have stipulated.
Bids and proposals shall be accepted unconditionally without alteration or
correction, except as may be otherwise authorized in this Guide. The
solicitation, whether sealed bids or proposals, shall state the evaluation
criteria. No criteria may be used in the bid evaluation that is not set forth
in the invitation for bids. The request for proposals shall state the relative
importance of price and of each evaluation factor. The Town may, prior to the
evaluation of any offer received, establish numerical weightings for each
factor. Additionally, the Town may determine that the use of competitive sealed
bidding is either not practicable or advantageous, and as such may use
competitive best value bidding. The purpose of best-value bidding is to allow
factors other than price to be considered in the determination of award for
specific supplies, services, or information technology based on pre-determined
criteria identified by the Town in the solicitation. With best-value bid, the
award shall be made to the responsive and responsible bidder whose bid is
determined, in writing, to be most advantageous to the Town; taking into
consideration all evaluation factors set forth in the best-value bid.
The Town should be able to evaluate bids solely using the information as
supplied by the offeror’s bid. However, it is sometimes determined that, for
clarification and more professional evaluation, additional information is
desirable and often necessary. Therefore, as provided in the IFB, the Town
reserves the right to hold discussions, review the specifications as believed
offered, and request clarification or any additional technical information
which may provide a fair and impartial evaluation by the Town. All discussion
shall be limited to the offeror’s products, goods or services, and no
discussion shall be permitted regarding offers by others.
As provided in the request for proposals, prior to any negotiations, discussion
may be conducted with any offerors submitting a proposal, which appears to be
eligible for contract award pursuant to the selection criteria as set forth in
the invitation for proposals. All such discussions shall be of the nature of
clarification of offeror’s understanding of specifications, scope of work,
goods or services, offeror’s qualifications, availability of qualified
personnel, proven experience, including referenced clients and the financial
stability and responsibility of the offeror. In conducting any such
discussions, there must be no disclosure of any information derived from
proposals submitted by other competing offerors.
4.7: Negotiations
4.7A: Informal Bids
Negotiation is generally not applicable to informal bids. However, negotiations
may be conducted and in the event that negotiations are unsuccessful in
reaching a price or scope of work or services which would be agreeable, the
Town, at its discretion, may terminate all negotiations with the lowest
offeror, and enter new negotiations with the next lowest offeror; and likewise,
the third and sequential offerors should negotiations not be productive with
the second lowest offeror.
4.7B: Sealed Bids
Generally, sealed bids are not negotiated; but in the event all bids exceed
available funds as certified by the Town’s Comptroller or considered
unreasonable; the Town shall be authorized, in situations where the Town’s best
interest precludes re-solicitation of work, goods, or services of a reduced
scope; to negotiate an adjustment in the bid price, including change in the
requirements, with the low, responsive and responsible bidder, in order to
bring the bid within the amount of available funds.
In the event that negotiations are unsuccessful in reaching a price or scope of
work or services which would be agreeable, the Town, at its discretion, may
terminate all negotiations with the lowest offeror, and enter new negotiations
with the next lowest offeror; and likewise, the third and sequential offerors
should negotiations not be productive with the second lowest offeror.
Should subsequent negotiations be conducted, all negotiations shall be
conducted in like manner as with the first offeror. No changes or reductions in
scope of work or services shall be permitted during negotiations with
sequential offers that was not permitted or offered within the negotiations
with previous responsive offerors.
In conducting negotiations, there must be no disclosure of any information
derived from bids submitted by competing offerors.
4.7C: Sealed Proposals
After evaluation, if in the best interest of the Town, as provided in the
invitation for proposals, negotiations may be conducted with any offerors
submitting a proposal which has been determined by the Town Administrator to be
eligible for contract award. All apparently eligible offerors must be afforded
the opportunity to submit best and final proposals if negotiations with any
other offeror results in material alteration or reduction in the scope of work
or services to the invitation for proposals, and such alteration or reduced
scope of work or services has a cost consequence that may alter the order of
offerors’ price quotations contained in the initial proposal. In conducting
negotiations, there must be no disclosure of any information derived from
proposals submitted by competing offerors.
4.7D: Multi-step Sealed Bidding/Proposals
When it is considered initially impractical by the Town Administrator to
prepare a procurement description complete with specifications to support an
award based on price, a solicitation may be issued requesting the submission of
unpriced offers to be followed by an invitation for bids/proposals limited to
those offerors whose offers have been qualified under the criteria set forth in
the first solicitation.
4.8: Award
Award shall be made to the most responsive, responsible offeror whose response
has been evaluated and determined to meet the requirements and to be in the
best interest of the Town.
Formal bids and proposals shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by
written notice to the most responsive, responsible bidder whose bid meets the
requirements and specifications and any other award criteria as set forth in
the solicitation document, and in the best interest of the Town.
Where bids or proposals have been requested and received other than lump-sum
total, the Town Council may, in the best interest of the Town, award projects
or requirements to the lowest, most responsive offeror, considering the sum
total for each project, goods, or services, or the combined sum total for all
projects, goods, or services.
In all cases, the Town Council shall reserve the right to reject or accept any
or all proposals and to waive any informalities or irregularities in the bids
if it is in the best interest of the Town.
4.8A: Tied Offerors
If two or more offerors are tied in price while otherwise meeting all of the
required conditions, award shall be determined as follows:
   1.   All tied offerors shall be notified of the existing tied conditions;
   2.   All tied offerors shall be provided the opportunity to submit best and
final offers in an effort to break the tie;
   3.   All tied offers shall be given sufficient time considered reasonable
and shall be notified of date and time required to submit best and final offer;
   4.   Best and final offers will be received, opened, and recorded in like
manner of the original opening;
   5.   Offerors failing to submit best and final offers shall be considered
unresponsive;
   6.   Best and final offers shall only be accepted from invited tied
offerors.
As the offers are in the final stage and limited to monetary cost, then no
further discussions or negotiations are to be considered.
4.8B: Award Delay
Should the Town have reasonable cause why a contract cannot or should not be
entered into within the allocated time indicated in the solicitation, the
acceptance time may be extended for all or any projects, goods, or services by
mutual agreement between the Town and the successful offeror(s).
4.9: Policies for Offerors
4.9A: Collusion or Anticompetitive Practices
When collusion or other anticompetitive practices are suspected among other
bidders or offerors, an immediate notice of the relevant facts shall be
transmitted to the Comptroller, the Town Administrator, and the Town Attorney.
4.9B: Responsibility of Offerors
Responsibility of the bidder or offeror shall be ascertained for each contract
solicited by the Town concerning the capacity and capability to meet the terms
of the contracts, and based upon past record of performance for similar
contracts.
A written determination of non-responsibility of a bidder or offeror shall be
made. The unreasonable failure of a bidder or offeror to supply information
promptly in connection with an inquiry with respect to responsibility may be
grounds for a determination of non-responsibility with respect to such offeror.
4.9C: Approved Accounting Systems
The Town may require the selected offeror have:
   1.   An accounting system that permits timely development of all necessary
cost data in the form required by the specific contract type contemplated.
   2.   An adequate accounting system to allocate costs in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.
   3.   An accounting system that retains records which may apply to the
contract, or subcontract, for a period of three years from the date of the
final payment under the prime contract, unless a shorter period is otherwise
authorized in writing.
4.9D: Right to Audit Records
The Town and its authorized representatives shall have the right to audit, to
examine, and to make copies or extracts from all financial and related records
(in whatever form they may be kept, whether written, electronic, or other)
relating to or pertaining to the contract or agreement with the Town kept by or
under the control of the contractor, its employees, agents, assignors,
successors, and subcontractors. Such records shall include, but not be limited
to, accounting records, written policies and procedures; subcontract files
(including proposals of successful and unsuccessful bidders, bid recaps, etc.);
all paid vouchers including those for out-of-pocket expenses; other
reimbursement supported by invoices; ledgers; cancelled checks; deposit slips;
bank statements; journals; original estimates; estimating work sheets; contract
amendments and change order files; back charge logs and supporting
documentation; insurance documents; payroll documents; timesheets; memoranda;
cost of pricing data, testing reports, submittal requirements; records
pertaining to the performance of work; and correspondence.
The contractor shall at any time requested by the Town, whether during or after
completion of the agreement, and at the contractor’s own expense, make such
records available for inspection and audit (including copies and extracts of
records as required) by the Town. Such records shall be made available to the
Town during normal business hours at the contractor's office or place of
business. In the event that no such location is available, then the financial
records, together with the supporting or underlying documents and records,
shall be made available for audit at a time and location that is convenient for
the Town.
Costs of any audits conducted under the authority of this right to audit and
not addressed elsewhere will be borne by the Town unless certain exemption
criteria are met. If the audit identifies overpricing or overcharges (of any
nature) by the contractor to the Town, in excess of one-half one percent (0.5%)
of the total contract billings, the contractor shall reimburse the Town for the
total costs of the audit. If the audit discovers substantive findings related
to fraud, misrepresentation, or non-performance, the Town may recoup the costs
of the audit work from the contractor. Any adjustments and/or payments that
must be made as a result of any such audit or inspection of the contractor's
invoices and/or records shall be made within a reasonable amount of time (not
to exceed 90 days) from the presentation of the Town’s findings to the
contractor.
4.9E: Resolution of Protested Solicitations and Awards
Any actual or prospective bidder, offerors, contractor, or subcontractor who is
aggrieved in connection with the solicitation or award of a contract may
protest in accordance with Town Ordinance, Chapter 22.
SECTION 5: CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTING
The method of construction contracting administration used for a Town
construction project shall be determined to be that method which is most
advantageous to the Town and will result in the most timely, acceptable
quality, economical, and successful completion of the construction project. All
Town construction contracts valued at $50,000 or greater shall be procured
based on the following as set forth in this section.
The Town Administrator, the Comptroller, and the appropriate department head,
or designees, shall make a determination regarding the appropriate method of
construction administration for a particular construction project. Methods
include, but not limited to design-bid-build, design-build, or construction
manager at risk.
5.1: Design-Bid-Build Method of Construction Contracting
Design-bid-build method is where the Town will sequentially award separate
contracts, the first for the architectural and engineering services to design
the project and the second for construction of the project according to the
design. Both contracts are separately solicited and awarded. Architectural and
engineering services are procured using the methods outlined under Professional
Services.
Construction contracting under this method shall be awarded by sealed bidding
pursuant to the procedures as set forth elsewhere in this chapter, with the
following exceptions:
The invitation shall include, but not be limited to, all contractual terms and
conditions applicable to the procurement. Bids shall be accepted
unconditionally without alteration or correction, except as otherwise noted in
this chapter. The invitation for bids shall set forth all requirements of the
bid, including the following, as determined necessary. Where required by the
invitation, all responsive bidders shall include subcontractor information as
specified.
   1.   Any bidder, in response to an invitation for bids, shall set forth in
the bid or offer, the names and the locations of the place of businesses for
each subcontractor, or supplier, who will or is expected to perform work or
render service to the prime contractor to or about construction, and who will
specifically fabricate and install a portion of the work which is expected to
exceed 3% of the prime contractor’s total base bid, or any subcontractor whose
construction elements are deemed vital by the Town for the project and so
listed and specified by the Town within the invitation and the bidding
documents.
   2.   Failure to list subcontractors, or suppliers, when required and
specified by the invitation in accordance with this section may render the
prime contractor’s bid as nonconforming.
   3.   No prime contractor whose bid is acceptable in accordance with this
section shall substitute any person as subcontractor in place of the
subcontractor listed in the original bid, except with the consent of the Town,
for good cause shown. The Town reserves the right to reject any and all
subcontractors for justifiable cause, with a substitute to be agreed-upon by
both parties.
   4.   The Town shall make available to all in attendance, a copy of the
record of the bid tabulation at the public opening of the bids. Like
information shall be provided to those not in attendance at the opening, when
so requested in writing.
5.2: Design-Build Method of Construction
The design-build method is where the Town will enter into a single contract for
design and construction of the construction project. Contracts for design-build
shall be procured by competitive sealed proposals. Each Request for Proposal
(RFP) for design-build shall include: evaluation factors, design
specifications, and a solicitation for proposal development documents. When the
Town Administrator determines that the cost of preparing proposals is high in
view of the size, estimated price, and complexity of the procurement, the Town
may:
   1.   prequalify vendors by issuing a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) in
advance of the RFP, or
   2.   select a short list of responsible vendors prior to discussions and
evaluations, provided the number of proposals will be short-listed is stated in
the RFP and prompt public notice is given to all vendors as to which proposals
have been short-listed, or
   3.   pay stipends to unsuccessful vendors, provided that the amount of such
stipends and terms under which stipends will be paid are stated in the RFP.
Each RFP for design-build shall state the relative importance of the following
evaluation factors:
   •   demonstrated compliance with the design requirements,
   •   vendor qualifications,
   •   financial capacity,
   •   project schedule,
   •   price,
   •   and other factors, if any, as disclosed in the RFP.
5.3: Construction Manager at Risk Method of Construction
The construction manager at risk (CMAR) method is where the Town enters into a
single contract with a construction manager to deliver the construction project
within a Guaranteed Maximum Price (GMP) which is based on the construction
documents and specifications at the time of the GMP plus any reasonably
inferred items or tasks. The CMAR provides professional services and acts as a
consultant to the Town in the design development as well as the construction
phases. The CMAR may provide some of the actual construction of the project
depending on the availability of bidders and subcontractors. In addition to
acting in the Town’s best interest, the CMAR must manage and control
construction costs to not exceed the GMP because contractually any costs
exceeding the GMP that are not change orders are the financial liability of the
CMAR.
Each RFP for CMAR shall include: evaluation factors, design specifications, and
a GMP. When the Town Administrator determines that the cost of preparing
proposals is high in view of the size, estimated price, and complexity of the
procurement, the Town may:
   1.   prequalify vendors by issuing a Request for Qualifications (RFQ) in
advance of the RFP, or
   2.   select a short list of responsible vendors prior to discussions and
evaluations, provided the number of proposals will be short-listed is stated in
the RFP and prompt public notice is given to all vendors as to which proposals
have been short-listed, or
   3.   pay stipends to unsuccessful vendors, provided that the amount of such
stipends and terms under which stipends will be paid are stated in the RFP.
Each RFP for CMAR shall state the relative importance of the following
evaluation factors:
   •   demonstrated compliance with the design requirements,
   •   vendor qualifications,
   •   financial capacity,
   •   project schedule,
   •   price,
   •   and other factors, if any, as disclosed in the RFP.
5.4: Bid Security
The Town may, at its discretion, require bid security deposits as stated in the
invitation for bids on any projects. Construction projects valued at $50,000
and over will be required to hold bid securities. These deposits may take the
form of a certified check, a cashier’s check or bond executed by a surety
company licensed under the laws of South Carolina to execute such bonds. The
bid security shall be in an amount to at least 5% of the amount of the bid.
When the invitation for bids requires security, noncompliance requires that the
bid be rejected. Bid deposits will be returned to the unsuccessful bidders
after an award determination has been made. In the event the successful bidder
shall fail to enter into a contract within the terms of the invitation after
having been notified of the award, the bid security deposit shall, at the
option of the Town, be forfeited to the Town and retained and deposited to the
Town’s account. In such an instance, the Town may renegotiate with the second
lowest, responsive and responsible bidder, or resolicit new bids; whichever is
determined in the best interest of the Town.
5.5: Performance Bonds
When construction contracts are awarded, labor, material, and performance
payment bonds may be required at the option of the Town and in all cases where
the contract price exceeds the sum of $50,000. These bonds, in such instances,
shall be written by an acceptable surety company licensed in South Carolina and
meet the requirements for issuing such bonds in accordance with South Carolina
law.
Bonds shall guarantee the performance by the bidder. The successful bidder
shall provide bonds in accordance with the contract in an amount equal to or
greater than 100% for contracts of $50,000 or greater. All contract bonds shall
be for a period of not less than one year from the date of the final payment.
The Town reserves the right to request bonds for projects under $50,000, if it
is in the best interest of the Town to do so. Such requirement will be
reflected within the bidding documents.
In lieu of corporate surety, material, labor, and performance payment bonds,
the successful bidder may request to post certified funds with the Town in such
amounts as may be agreed upon by the Town Administrator and which funds shall
be held in accordance with the terms as agreed upon between the Town and the
successful bidder. Prior to approval of such request for bond alternate, a
determination in writing must be made as to why the request should be granted,
the overall project risk and the responsibility of the offeror which has
requested such an alternate, or any other factors which may weigh heavily on
granting such an approval.
Every person who has furnished labor or material to the contractor or its
subcontracts for the work specified in the contract, in respect of which a
payment bond is furnished under this section, and who has not been paid in full
before the expiration of a period of 90 days after the day on which the last of
the labor was performed by such person or material was furnished or supplied by
such person for which such claim is made; shall have the right to sue on the
payment bond for the amount, or the balance thereof, unpaid at the time of
institution of such suit, and to prosecute such action for the sum or sums
justly due such person. Any person having a direct contractual relationship
with a subcontractor of the contractor, but no contractual relationship
expressed or implied with the contractor furnishing such payment bond, shall
have a right of action on the payment bond, upon giving written notice to the
contractor within 90 days from the date on which such person did or performed
the last of the labor or furnished or supplied the last of the material upon
which such claim is made, stating with substantial accuracy the amount claimed
and the name of the party to whom the material was furnished or supplied or for
whom the labor was done or performed. Such written notice to the contractor
shall be personally served or served by mailing the same by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, in an envelope addressed to the contractor at
any place the contractor maintains an office or conducts its business.
Every suit instituted upon a payment bond shall be brought in a court of
competent jurisdiction for the county or circuit in which the construction
contract was to be performed, but no such suit shall be commenced after the
expiration of one year after the day on which the last of the labor was
performed or material was supplied by the person bringing suit. The obligee
named in the bond need not be joined as a party in any such suit.
5.6: Retention
Contracts that provide for installment progress payments that are based upon an
estimated percentage of completion, with a percentage of the contract's
proceeds to be retained by the Town pending completion of the contract, the
retained amount of each progress payment or installment shall be as agreed-upon
by negotiation, but not less than 5%. When the work to be performed on a Town
project by multiple prime contractors or by a prime contractor and multiple
subcontractors, the work contracted to be done by each individual contractor or
subcontractor may be considered a separate division of the contract for the
purpose of retention. As each such division of the contract is certified as
having been completed, that portion of the retained funds which is allocable to
the completed division of the contract may be released forthwith to the prime
contractor, who shall, within ten days of its receipt, release to the
subcontractor responsible for the completed work the full amount of any
retention previously withheld by the prime contractor.
SECTION 6: PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
Architectural, engineering, construction management, land surveying, legal,
financial, insurance, audit, banking, certain consulting services and other
professional services shall be procured as provided within this subsection.
Announcements or solicitations for professional services within this section
shall be advertised formally when the services are expected or anticipated to
be $50,000 or greater. Otherwise, informal solicitations are allowed. In either
application, the solicitation shall include, but not limited to, the project
title, the general scope of work, a description of all professional services
required for the project, the submission deadline, how interested firms may
apply for consideration and the evaluation criteria that shall be used for
selection determination.
Submissions of information from interested persons or firms in response to an
invitation shall not be less than ten days after publication of the formal
invitation or the time considered fair and reasonable if the solicitation is
informal.
The Town Administrator and the appropriate department head shall review and
evaluate each response received using the selection criteria as reflected
within the solicitation. The Town Administrator and the appropriate department
head may select and hold interviews with firms or persons who have responded to
the invitation and who are deemed most qualified on the basis of information
available prior to the interviews.
The respondents will be evaluated using the following guidelines:
   •   past performance,
   •   the ability and availability of professional personnel,
   •   willingness to meet Town time and budget requirements,
   •   location as directly related to the complexity of the project, and
especially so if the project is a joint effort being accomplished between Town
staff and the person/firm,
   •   Recent, current and projected workloads of the firms,
   •   Related experience referenced from past or similar projects, and
   •   Any other criteria as deemed appropriate by the evaluation committee.
Based upon these evaluations, the Town Administrator shall recommend to the
Council, if $50,000 or more, the offerors which, in its judgment, are the most
qualified, ranking the offerors in priority order. The selection results may be
made available to all persons or firms who responded when, upon acceptance and
approval by the Council.
The Town may review and evaluate each response received as a result of informal
invitations and may conduct, but are not required to, conduct interviews with
offerors should they determine that further information is needed. Town staff
shall review and evaluate informal responses using the same or similar criteria
and shall rank, in its judgement, the most qualified offerors in priority
order. The selection results may be made available to all persons or firms who
responded when, upon acceptance and approval of the Council, or upon the Town
Administrator’s determination of the most qualified offeror.
SECTION 7: VENDOR ISSUES
Vendors sometimes call on Town departments and divisions. Although they may
offer helpful information, they may also subject Town employees to high-
pressure sales pitches. Town staff can direct vendors to the Comptroller. The
Comptroller will gather information about their products and services and give
them directions on how to register on the Town’s vendor registration program.
Because the Town, like all public agencies buys goods on an open, competitive
basis, employees must not promise any vendor future business. However,
employees may designate a vendor as a recommended source for future procurement
needs with the Comptroller.
Departments wishing to lodge a complaint about a vendor (for poor service,
failure to meet specifications, etc.) should contact the Town Administrator.
The Town Administrator will attempt to resolve the problem with the vendor and
will add the complaint to the vendor’s performance history file. Documentation
of vendor performance issues is extremely important. Without it, the Town will
not be able to disqualify vendors.
7.1: Resolution of Contract Controversies
This section applies to controversies between the Town and a contractor and
which arises under, or by virtue of, a contract between them. This includes,
without limitation, controversies based upon breach of contract, mistake,
misrepresentation, or other causes for contract modifications or rescission.
The Town Administrator, or authorized designee, is authorized to settle and
resolve controversies, as described in this section whereby the contract amount
or the amount of the controversy shall not exceed 5% of the total project cost,
or an aggregate of up to $49,999.99, whichever is greater. Any contract
controversy above this amount shall be referred to the Council.
Either the Town Administrator or the Council, as applicable, shall schedule and
meet with the contractor to receive and review comments, which thereafter shall
issue a decision to be placed in writing within 15 business days of the
meeting. The decision shall state the reasons for the action taken and inform
the contractor of other rights which may be available. A copy of the decision
shall be sent via certified mail or otherwise hand-delivered, email, or fax,
immediately to the contractor.
A contractor, having received the notice of decision, may appeal in writing to
the Mayor, who shall then convene the full Council at a time and date
established by the Mayor to receive and review the comments of the contractor.
The Mayor shall issue the decision of Council, in writing, within 15 business
days of the Council hearing. The decision shall state the reason for the action
taken. A decision rendered shall be final and conclusive unless fraudulent. The
appeal decision of the Mayor and Town Council is the final administrative
review and the decision of the Town, and such decision can be appealed to the
Circuit Courts of the State.
7.2: Violations of Law
If prior to award it is determined that a solicitation or proposed award of a
contract is in violation of the law, then the solicitation or proposed award
shall be:
   1.   Canceled or revised by addenda if prior to the closing acceptance date
of the solicitation.
   2.   If after the closing acceptance date of the solicitation but prior to
award, the pending contract agreement shall be modified to comply with the law.
Should it be determined that such a modification would have a cost impact, the
Town shall have the right to:
      a.   Accept the cost impact if considered fair and reasonable,
      b.   Negotiate with the offeror,
      c.   Open negotiations with other offerors, or
      d.   Reject all offerors in their entirety.
If after an award it is determined that a solicitation or award of a contract
is/was in violation of the law and the person or persons has/have not acted
fraudulently or in bad faith, the Town may:
   1.   Modify the contract agreement by an appropriate change order agreeable
to both parties to comply with the law; or
   2.   The Town may terminate the contract and the person awarded the contract
shall be compensated for the actual expenses reasonably incurred under the
contract, plus a reasonable profit for cost incurred prior to the termination.
If after an award it is determined that a solicitation or award of a contract
is/was in violation of the law and the person or persons has/have acted
fraudulently or in bad faith, the Town may:
   1.   Declare the contract null and void; or
   2.   At its discretion, take any other actions which are appropriate and in
the best interests of the Town.
7.3: Authority to Debar or Suspend
The suspension and debarment process protects the Town from fraud, waste, and
abuse by using tools to avoid doing business with non-responsible contractors
and vendors. This section applies to a debarment for cause from consideration
for award of contracts, goods, or services, or a suspension from such
consideration during an investigation where there is probable cause for such
debarment. Additionally, if Federal or State monies are being utilized for the
procurement, the Town will ensure that potential vendors are not listed on the
Federal debarment and suspension list before awarding contracts.
The Town Administrator, after reasonable notice of debarment to the person or
firm involved and reasonable opportunity for that person or firm to be heard,
and having consulted with the Council and Town Attorney, shall have the
authority to:
   •   disbar the person or firm for cause from consideration for award of
contracts, goods, or services; provided that doing so is in the best interest
of the Town. The debarment shall be for a period as determined by the Town
Administrator, but not more than two years.
   •   Suspend the person or firm for cause from consideration for award of
contracts, goods, or services; provided that doing so is in the best interest
of the Town. The suspension shall be for a period as determined by the Town
Administrator, but not more than 12 months.
The causes for debarment or suspension include:
   •   Conviction for commission of a criminal offense as an incident to
obtaining or attempting to obtain a public or private contract or subcontract,
or in the performance of such contract or subcontract;
   •   Conviction under State or Federal statutes of embezzlement, theft,
forgery, bribery, falsification, or destruction of records, receiving stolen
property or any other offense indicating a lack of business integrity or
business honesty which currently, seriously, and directly affects
responsibility as a Town contractor, vendor, or supplier.
   •   Conviction under State or Federal antitrust statutes arising out of the
submission of bids, quotes, offers, contracts, or proposals;
   •   Violation of contract, bid, proposal or quotation provisions, as set
forth below, of a character which is regarded by the Town Administrator to be
so serious as to justify debarment action. This would include, deliberate
failure without good cause to perform in accordance with the specifications or
within the time limit provided in the contract, bid, proposal, offer, or
quotation; or a recent record of failure to perform or of unsatisfactory
performance in accordance with the terms of one or more contracts, proposals,
offers, bids or quotations;
   •   Any other causes the Town Administrator determines to be so serious and
compelling as to affect responsibility as a Town contractor, supplier or
vendor, including debarment by another governmental entity for cause;
   •   For violation of the ethical standards set forth in the South Carolina
State Ethics Act.
A contractor, supplier, or vendor shall not be considered for suspension or
disbarment if the failure to perform or unsatisfactory performance were caused
by acts beyond the control of the contractor, supplier, or vendor.
With the advice and consent of the Council, the Town Administrator shall issue
a written decision within 30 days to debar or suspend. The decision shall be
final and conclusive. The decision shall state the reason of the action taken
and inform the debarred or suspended person, company, or corporation involved
of their rights to a final appeal. This notice shall be sent by certified mail,
hand-delivered, or by email.
SECTION 8: TYPES OF CONTRACTS
8.1: Term
Subject to the limitations of this chapter, any type of contract which promotes
the best interests of the Town may be used, with the exception of cost-plus-a-
percentage-of-cost contract which is prohibited. A cost reimbursement, or a
cost reimbursement-plus-a-fixed-fee, may be used when it is determined that
such a contract would be less costly to the Town than any other type, or that
it is impracticable to obtain the supplies, services, or construction required
except under such a contract.
The Town’s best interest shall be served by contracts originated by using
competitive prices obtained by: itemized unit measurement with cost, itemized
project description breakdown with costs itemized, and lump sum project cost.
8.2: Multi-Term
Multiterm contracts are for products, goods, and/or services of such nature
that an ongoing annual requirement exists. Where and when such conditions
exist, multiterm contracts should be used as much as possible to be in the best
interests of the Town, as described below.
   1.   Multiterm contracts for supplies and services may be entered into for
specified periods of time, not to exceed five years, provided the terms of the
contract and the conditions for renewal or extension, if any, are included and
so specified in the invitation, and that funds are provided and available for
the initial term.
   2.   As specified within the invitation, multiterm contracts may be firm
fixed pricing for one or more years. Contracts limited to annual, first-year
pricing may be extended or renewed for the second and subsequent years, when
prices, having been evaluated, are determined, in writing, to be fair and
reasonable to the Town. Validity or justification shall be requested from and
provided by the supplier in writing, addressing any requests which are
considered unreasonable.
   3.   Multiterm contracts shall not cause undue hardship on either party.
Either party may submit in writing a request for reevaluation of the contract,
in whole or in part, due to extreme verifiable conditions or circumstances.
   4.   All multiterm contracts shall contain a “municipality” termination
clause, whereby all such type contracts may be terminated by the Town, and at
no cost to the Town, should fund sufficient to support continuation of
performance not be appropriated or otherwise made available for subsequent
fiscal period.
   5.   Whereas, some multiterm contracts may be established upon estimated
needs and/or usage, the contract liability shall be limited to actual products,
goods, or services received and accepted by the Town. Contract liability shall
not be predicated on any estimated or minimum requirements.
   6.   Multiterm contracts may be extended on a case-by-case basis for when in
the best interest of the Town. The Town may require continued performance of
any contract within the limits and at the rates specified in the contract. The
option provision may be exercised more than once.
8.3: Contract Clauses
All contracts for supplies, services, and construction shall include provisions
necessary to define the responsibilities and rights of the parties to the
contract. At the direction of the Town Council, the Town Administrator, or
authorized designee, may issue clauses appropriate for supply, service, or
construction contracts addressing at least the following subjects:
   •   The unilateral right of the Town to order written changes in the work
within the scope of the contract;
   •   The unilateral right of the Town to order, in writing, temporary
stoppage of the work or delaying performance that does not alter the scope of
the contract;
   •   Variations occurring between estimated quantities of work in a contract
and actual quantities;
   •   Defective pricing;
   •   Liquidated damages;
   •   Specified excuses for delay or nonperformance;
   •   Termination of the contract for default;
   •   Termination of the contract, in whole or in part, for the convenience of
the Town;
   •   Suspension of work on a construction project ordered by the Town;
   •   Site conditions differing from those indicated in the contract, or
ordinarily encountered except that differing site condition clauses need not be
included in a contract;
   •   When the contract is negotiated;
      •   When the contract provides the site or design; or
      •   When the parties have otherwise agreed with respect to the risk of
differing site conditions.
   •   Hazardous materials;
   •   Drug-free work place;
   •   Affirmative action.
The Town may establish standard contract clauses for use in Town contracts.
8.4: Price Adjustments
A contractor shall be required to submit cost or pricing data if any adjustment
in the contract price is desired. Adjustments in price resulting from the use
of contract clauses shall be computed in one or more of the following means:
   •   By agreement on a fixed-price adjustment before commencement of the
pertinent performance or as soon thereafter as practicable;
   •   By unit prices specified in the contract or subsequently agreed upon;
   •   By the cost attributable to the events or situations under such clauses
with adjustment of profit or fee, all as specified in the contract or
subsequently agreed upon;
   •   In such other manner as the contracting parties may mutually agree; or,
   •   In the absence of agreement by the parties, by unilateral determination
by the Town of the reasonable costs allocable, either directly or indirectly,
to the events or situations under such clauses as accounted for in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and adjustment of profit or fee,
as appropriate, and subject to the provisions of legal and contractual
remedies.
SECTION 9: MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSAL OF TOWN PROPERTY OTHER THAN REAL PROPERTY
The sale, lease, or disposal of surplus supplies, inventories, and other Town
properties, other than real properties, shall be by in-house auction, outside
auction, formal or informal bidding process, online auction services, broker
services, or other appropriate competitive methods designated herein or
otherwise as authorized by the Town Administrator. The sale, lease or
disposition of real properties rests within the authority of full Council.
9.1: Salvageable Personal Property
The Town Administrator, or authorized designee, shall be responsible for all
disposals of surplus or antiquated, but salvageable material, such as, but not
limited to, furniture, computer equipment, automobiles, automobile and
equipment parts, trucks, tractors, lawn mowers, scrap, and the like. Sales
shall be awarded to the highest bidder in these processes. Funds will be turned
into the Comptroller, deposited, and recorded in the Town's General Ledger,
unless otherwise directed by the Comptroller per Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles.
9.2: Non-Salvageable Personal Property
When items or articles are broken beyond repair, and it is determined that a
salvage value is nonexistent, or the proceeds from the sale of such items would
not offset the cost incurred to sell, then such items are articles may be
disposed of with the best method(s) that serves the best interest of the Town,
as determined by the Town Administrator, or designee. When it is determined
that community’s interest shall be best served by making donations of either
surplus, antiquated or salvageable personal property to another agency,
nonprofit entity or worthy individual or group, the Town Administrator, or
authorized designee, may authorize such transfers of personal property whose
value is determined to be $10,000 or less.
Receipt of monetary contributions whose value is $10,000 or less may be
accepted upon authorization of the Town Administrator, or authorized designee.
The authorization of transfers or receipt of monetary contributions whose value
is greater than $10,000 must be authorized by Town Council, upon a
recommendation forwarded from the appropriate committee. Disbursement of
monetary contributions to another agency, nonprofit entity or worthy individual
or group, must be authorized by Town Council, usually considered as part of the
annual or midyear budget process.
9.3: Seized Assets and Unclaimed Properties
All seized assets and unclaimed properties, including but not limited to,
vehicles, bicycles, jewelry and other miscellaneous items, shall be disposed of
pursuant to one of the following procedures:
   1.   The Town shall place the property within the regular operating
inventory of the Town for use by the Town, subject to approval by the Chief of
Police.
   2.   Disposal of this property shall be performed in the same manner as
previously designated elsewhere herein.
   3.   The property or proceeds received from the disposal of this property
shall be donated to a recognized nonprofit organization in an effort to promote
community relations and goodwill. Proceeds, inventories and other properties,
if not donated, shall be deposited into the Town’s General Fund.

construct water service lines to accommodate service to other adjacent
properties along the same service line, at the property owner’s cost and
expense, subject to reimbursement from other adjacent property owners as
provided in division (F) below.
   (F)   If the town requires a property owner to construct water lines to

property owner submits an application to the town for water or sewer service.
The pro rata cost of construction shall be determined by Town Council by
dividing the final cost of constructing the water line extension by the number
of buildable lots in which water service has been provided pursuant to division
(E) above. To the extent sewer service is also extended pursuant to §
51.006, the construction of the sewer and water line extensions may be
performed under the same construction contract. Assessment of a monthly water
basic facility charge shall not relieve any property owner from the obligation
to pay the pro rata cost of construction as provided herein.

§ 50.09 METER DEPOSIT.
   The Town Council by resolution shall establish and may revise from time to
time meter deposits, which will be required of all water users, such deposit to
be paid at the time the contract for water service is made; provided, that this
requirement for a deposit may be waived where the contract for water service is
with the property owner and where the property owner, in writing, assumes
responsibility for payment of all amounts due for water service furnished such
property.
(Prior Code, § 20-9) (Ord. passed 11-2-1969)
§ 50.10 ESTABLISHMENT AND REVISION OF SERVICE CHARGES AND HYDRANT CHARGES.
   The Town Council by resolution shall establish and may from time to time

§ 50.11 BILLING DATE FOR WATER SERVICE CHARGES; WHEN BILLS PAYABLE;
DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE FOR FAILURE TO PAY BILL; CHARGE FOR RESTORATION OF
SERVICE.
   (A)   Meters will be read each month of the year. Bills for water shall be
rendered by the first day of each month and said bills shall be payable when
rendered at the office of the Town Council, and shall become past due after the
fifteenth day of the month in which they were rendered. No further notice or
billing shall be required. Under no circumstances shall a partial payment of a
water bill be accepted.
   (B)   If a bill is not paid by the fifteenth of the month following
rendition, a $10 service charge is added to the bill. If the bill is not paid
by the first of the month following rendition, water service will be
discontinued and if restored during normal working hours, is due along with the
$10 service charge and a $15 reconnection fee. The after-hours (hours other
than between 7:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., Monday through Friday) reconnection fee

by 2:00 p.m. the following business day. If these charges are not satisfied
within this time frame, water service will be disconnected a second time and an
additional $60 will be added to the bill. If the total charges are not
satisfied by 2:00 p.m. the following business day, the customer shall be mailed
a registered or certified letter indicating meter removal and all payments and
fees associated with the reinstallation along with all past due bills and an
additional $100 reinstallation shall be charged. The Town Council by resolution
shall establish and from time to time may revise “turn on” fees and meter
reinstallation fees, which shall be charged in addition to the regular bill and
mailing charges, before service is restored.
(Prior Code, § 20-11) (Ord. passed 3-19-1996; Ord. passed 7-15-2008)
§ 50.12 CONTRACTING PARTY RESPONSIBLE FOR WATER BEYOND METER.
   (A)   The town’s contract for water service provides for service of water at
the point where the property owner’s line is attached to the town’s meter.
   (B)   Since the operation and condition of the property owners’ water lines
on private property are beyond the observation and control of the town, the
Town Council shall not be responsible for water used, lost or wasted after
passing through the meter, nor will the town assume the responsibility for
billing or collecting from tenants who have not made the required deposit or
signed a water contract with the town.
   (C)   Since the town is purchasing its water from an outside source, the
town shall not be required to make any adjustments to a bill when the water
bill and/or sewer bill has been substantially increased due to any excessive
water used by the contract owner/property owner when the water has passed
through the meter and was subsequently lost or wasted.
   (D)   The town, in its sole discretion, may adjust the sewer bill but not
the water bill by charging the customer the average monthly sewer bill charge
of the previous six months on the account, provided the customer can
satisfactorily prove to the town personnel that:
      (1)   There was an undetected leak;
      (2)   Said excessive water usage did not enter a sanitary sewer; and
      (3)   That a reasonable inspection of property would not have discovered
said leak.
   (E)   Additionally, an adjustment in the sewer bill will only be made once
every three years for a customer and such adjustment would only cover two
consecutive months.
   (F)   No adjustments in the water and/or sewer bill will be made for any
leaks in any irrigation systems, pool systems or docks.
(Prior Code, § 20-12) (Ord. passed 11-2-1969; Ord. passed 3-19-1996; Ord.

§ 50.13 POOL FILLING.
   One pool filling per year in accordance with the following:
   (A)   No pool filling permit shall be allowed if an irrigation meter or dock
only meter is present;
   (B)   Customer must apply at Town Hall, pay the fee, and sign liability
waiver. Water Department personnel will inspect pool within three business days
of the date of permit application. Inspection of pool will consist of verifying
that pool is empty and verifying pool dimensions and that pool drainage does
not enter sanitary sewer;
   (C)   With permit approval, users will be required to pay for the water used
to fill the pool and will not be assessed for sewer treatment. The dimensions
of the pool (length x width x average depth) submitted on permit will be used
to calculate the volume of water for the sewer adjustment; and
   (D)   If no pool filling permit is obtained, sewer treatment charges will
not be adjusted and be required to be assessed in accordance with normal
billing procedures.

DROUGHT RESPONSE
§ 50.25 DECLARATION OF POLICY.
   To achieve the greatest public benefit from domestic water use, sanitation
and fire protection, and to provide water for other purposes in an equitable
manner, the Town Council adopts the following concerning the delivery and
consumption of water.
(Prior Code, § 20-14)
§ 50.26 GOAL OF POLICY.
   (A)   The objective of this drought response subchapter is to establish
authority, ordinance and procedure by which the town will take the proper
actions to manage water demand during a drought-related shortage. The
subchapter satisfies the requirements of the Drought Response Act of 2000,
being S.C. Code §§ 49-23-10 et seq., and has the goal of achieving the greatest
public benefit from limited supplies of water needed for domestic water use,
sanitation, and fire protection and allocating water for other purposes in an
equitable manner.
   (B)   This subchapter outlines the actions to be taken for the conservation
of water supplied by the town. These actions are directed both towards an
overall reduction in water usage and the optimization of supply.
   (C)   To satisfy these goals, the town hereby adopts the following
regulations and restrictions on the delivery and consumption of water. This
subchapter is hereby declared necessary for the protection of public health,
safety and welfare and shall take effect upon its adoption by the town.
   (D)   If it becomes necessary to conserve water in its service area due to
drought, the town is authorized to issue a proclamation (a “proclamation”) that
existing conditions prevent fulfillment of the usual water use demands. The
proclamation is an attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent
that water-use for human consumption, sanitation, fire protection and other
essential needs becomes endangered.
   (E)   Immediately upon issuance of such a proclamation, regulations and
restrictions set forth under this subchapter shall become effective and remain
in effect until the water supply shortage has ended and the proclamation
rescinded. The drought water usage rates, as set in the latest water and sewer
rates and fee schedule, shall be in effect during this time.
   (F)   Water uses that are regulated or prohibited under this subchapter are
considered to be non-essential and continuation of such uses during times of
water supply shortages is deemed to constitute a waste of water, subjecting the
offender(s) to penalties.

   (A)   The owner of all houses, buildings or properties used for human
occupancy, employment, commercial, recreation or other similar purposes is
hereby required, at his or her expense, to install suitable toilet facilities
therein, and to be connected to the public sewer system of the town. It shall
be unlawful for any person to discharge to or be connected to the public sewer
system of the town for domestic, industrial, commercial or other purposes
without having previously contracted for such service. All privately held
parcels shall pay a monthly sewer basic facility charge whether connected or
not, unless the public sewer system is not available at a location on or
adjacent to the parcel.
   (B)   Notwithstanding anything else in this chapter, the town shall have no
obligation to pay for and extend the public sewer system of the town to
undeveloped lots that do not currently have such sewer lines adjacent to them.
Any such extension shall require an agreement between the town and the
requesting property owner as to payment of the cost of the extension in
addition to the town’s approval of the specifications for construction as well
as the final installation.
   (C)   As part of an agreement for the property owner to extend sewer lines
to an undeveloped lot that does not currently have adjacent sewer lines, the
town reserves the right to require such property owner to construct sewer lines
to accommodate service to other adjacent properties along the same service
line, at the property owner’s cost and expense, subject to reimbursement from
other adjacent property owners as provided in division (D) below.
   (D)   If the town requires a property owner to construct sewer lines to
accommodate sewer service to adjacent parcels, the town shall require the owner
of each such adjacent parcel to compensate the constructing property owner for
a pro rata cost of construction of the sewer line at the time the adjoining
property owner submits an application to the town for water or sewer service.
The pro rata cost of construction shall be determined by Town Council by
dividing the final cost of constructing the sewer line extension by the number
of buildable lots in which sewer service has been provided pursuant to division
(C) above. To the extent water service is also extended pursuant to §
50.01, the construction of the sewer and water line extensions may be performed
under the same construction contract. Assessment of a monthly sewer basic
facility charge shall not relieve any property owner from the obligation to pay
the pro rata cost of construction as provided herein.

by the owner of that portion of the lot zoned commercial at the owner’s sole
expense; and
         (c)   Construct water and sewer lines within said easements at the
owner’s sole expense and the owner shall maintain repair or replace said sewer
and water lines as required by the town’s Water and Sewer Department, at the
owner’s sole expense; and the town’s Water and Sewer Department shall provide
the specifications of the water and sewer lines and the owner shall obtain the
approval of the town’s Water and Sewer Department prior to subdividing or
obtaining a building permit or, with the approval of the town, to provide to

   (A)   No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged the following
described substances, materials, waters or wastes if it appears likely, in the
opinion of the Town Council, that such wastes can harm either the sewers,
sewage treatment process or equipment, have an adverse effect on the receiving
stream or can otherwise endanger life, limb or public property or constitute a
nuisance. In forming its opinion as to the acceptability of these wastes, the
Town Council shall give consideration to such factors as the quantities of
subject wastes in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of sewers, nature of the sewage treatment process, capacity of the
sewage treatment plant, degree of treatability of wastes in the sewage
treatment plant and other pertinent factors.
   (B)   The substances prohibited are:
      (1)   Any liquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150°F or 65°C;
      (2)   Any water or waste containing fats, wax, grease or oils, whether
emulsified or not, in excess of 100 mg/l or containing substances which may
solidify or become viscous at temperatures between 32°F and 150°F or 0°C and
65°C;

sewage at the sewage treatment works exceeds the limits established by the Town
Council for such materials;
      (6)   Any waters or wastes containing phenols or other odor-producing
substances in such concentrations as exceeds limits which may be established by
the Town Council as necessary, after treatment of the composite sewage, to meet
the requirements of the state, federal or other public agencies having
jurisdiction over such discharge into the receiving waters;
      (7)   Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such shelf-life or
concentrations as may exceed limits established by the Town Council in
compliance with applicable state of federal regulations;
      (8)   Any waters or wastes having a pH in excess of 9.5;
      (9)   Materials which exert or cause:
         (a)   Unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids (such as, but
not limited to, Fullers earth, lime slurries, and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate);
         (b)   Excessive discoloration (such as, but not limited to, dye wastes
and vegetable tanning solutions);
         (c)   Unusual BOD, chemical oxygen demand or chlorine requirements in
such quantities as to constitute a significant load on the sewage treatment
works; and
         (d)   Unusual volume of flow or concentration of wastes which exceeds
for more than 15 minutes more than five times the average 24-hour concentration
or flow during normal operation.
      (10)   Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to
treatment or reduction by the sewage treatment processes employed, or are
amenable to treatment only to such degree that the sewage treatment plant
effluent cannot meet the requirements of other agencies having jurisdiction
over discharge to the receiving waters.

§ 51.048 AUTHORITY OF TOWN COUNCIL TO REJECT OR REQUIRE PRETREATMENT OF WASTES.
   (A)   If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be
discharged into the public sewers which waters contain the substances or
possess the characteristics enumerated in §§
51.050 or
51.051, and which, in the judgment of the Town Council, may have deleterious
effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or receiving waters, or
which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the

suitable samples taken at such control manhole.
      (2)   In the event that no special manhole has been required, the control
manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public
sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected.
   (B)   (1)   Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the
existence of hazards of life, limb and property. The particular analysis
involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of premises
is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
      (2)   Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pHs are determined
from periodic grab samples.

benefit, or advantage, in whole or in part within the town limits is required
to pay an annual license tax for the privilege of doing business and obtain a
business license as herein provided.
(Prior Code, § 10-1) (Ord. passed 11-17-1980; Ord. passed 12-15-1992; Ord.

Statutory reference:

§ 110.02 DEFINITIONS.
    For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply

in with the object of gain, benefit or advantage, either directly or
indirectly.
   CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION. An organization that is determined by the Internal

   CLASSIFICATION. The division of businesses by NAICS codes subject to the
same license rate as determined by a calculated index of ability to pay based

   GROSS INCOME. The gross receipts or gross revenue of a business, received or
accrued, for one calendar or fiscal year collected or to be collected from
business done within the town. If the licensee has a domicile within the town,
business done within the town shall include all gross receipts or revenue
received or accrued by such licensee. If the licensee does not have a domicile
within the town, business done within the town shall include only gross
receipts or revenue received or accrued within the town. In all cases, if the
licensee pays a business license tax to another county or municipality, then
the licensee’s gross income for the purpose of computing the tax within the
town must be reduced by the amount of revenues or receipts taxed in the other
county or municipality and fully reported to the town. GROSS INCOME for
business license tax purposes shall not include taxes collected for a
governmental entity, escrow funds, or funds that are the property of a third

in gross income. The gross receipts or gross revenues for business license
purposes may be verified by inspection of returns and reports filed with the
Internal Revenue Service, the South Carolina Department of Revenue, the South
Carolina Department of Insurance, or other government agencies. In calculating
gross income for certain businesses, the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   Gross income for agents shall be calculated on gross commissions
received or retained, unless otherwise specified. If commissions are divided
with other brokers or agents, then only the amount retained by the broker or
agent is considered gross income.
      (2)   Except as specifically required by S.C. Code § 38-7-20, gross
income for insurance companies shall be calculated on gross premiums written.
      (3)   Gross income for manufacturers of goods or materials with a
location in the town shall be calculated on the lesser of (i) gross revenues or
receipts received or accrued from business done at the location, (ii) the
amount of income allocated and apportioned to that location by the business for
purposes of the business’s state income tax return, or (iii) the amount of
expenses attributable to the location as a cost center of the business.
Licensees reporting gross income under this provision shall have the burden to
establish the amount and method of calculation by satisfactory records and
proof. Manufacturers include those taxpayers reporting a manufacturing
principal business activity code on their federal income tax returns.

§ 110.03 PURPOSE AND DURATION.
    The business license required by this chapter is for the purpose of
providing such regulation as may be required by the business subject thereto
and for the purpose of raising revenue for the General Fund through a privilege
tax. The license year ending on December 31, 2021, shall be extended until
April 30, 2022. Thereafter, the license periods shall be established as
follows. Except as set forth below for business licenses issued to contractors
with respect to specific construction projects, each yearly license shall be
issued for the 12-month period of May 1 to April 30. A business license issued
for a construction contract may, at the request of the licensee, be stated to
expire at the completion of the construction project; provided, any such
business license may require that the licensee file, by each April 30 during
the continuation of the construction project, a statement of compliance,
including but not limited to a revised estimate of the value of the contract.
If any revised estimate of the final value of such project exceeds the amount
for which the business license was issued, the licensee shall be required to
pay a license fee at the then-prevailing rate on the excess amount. The
provisions of this chapter and the rates herein shall remain in effect from

(Prior Code, § 10-3) (Ord. passed 11-17-1980; Ord. passed 12-15-1992; Ord.

§ 110.04 BUSINESS LICENSE TAX.
   (A)   The required business license tax shall be paid for each business
subject hereto according to the applicable rate classification on or before the
due date of April 30 in each year, except for those businesses in Rate Class 8
for which a different due date is specified. Late payments shall be subject to
penalties as set forth in §
110.99, except that admitted insurance companies may pay before June 1 without
penalty.
   (B)   A separate license shall be required for each place of business and
for each classification or business conducted at one place. If gross income
cannot be separated for classifications at one location, the business license
tax shall be computed on the combined gross income for the classification
requiring the highest rate. The business license tax must be computed based on
the licensee’s gross income for the calendar year preceding the due date, for
the licensee’s 12-month fiscal year preceding the due date, or on a 12-month
projected income based on the monthly average for a business in operation for
less than one year. The business license tax for a new business must be
computed on the estimated probable gross income for the balance of the license
year. A business license related to construction contract projects may be
issued on a per-project basis, at the option of the taxpayer. No refund shall
be made for a business that is discontinued.
   (C)   A licensee that submits a payment greater than the amount owed may
request a refund. To be considered, a refund request must be submitted in
writing to the town before the June 1 immediately following the April 30 on
which the payment was due and must be supported by adequate documentation
supporting the refund request. The town shall approve or deny the refund
request, and if approved shall issue the refund to the business, within 30 days
after receipt of the request.

§ 110.05 REGISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (A)    The owner, agent, or legal representative of every business subject
to this chapter, whether listed in the classification index or not, shall
register the business and make application for a business license on or before
the due date of each year; provided, a new business shall be required to have a
business license prior to operation within the town, and an annexed business
shall be required to have a business license within 30 days of the annexation.
A license for a bar (NAICS 722410) must be issued in the name of the individual
who has been issued the corresponding state alcohol, beer, or wine permit or
license and will have actual control and management of the business.
   (B)   Application shall be on the then-current standard business license
application as established and provided by the Director of the South Carolina
Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office and shall be accompanied by all information
about the applicant, the licensee, and the business deemed appropriate to carry
out the purpose of this chapter by the license official. Applicants may be
required to submit copies of portions of state and federal income tax returns
reflecting gross receipts and gross revenue figures.
   (C)   The applicant shall certify under oath that the information given in
the application is true, that the gross income is accurately reported (or
estimated for a new business) without any unauthorized deductions, and that all
assessments, personal property taxes on business property, and other monies due
and payable to the town have been paid.
   (D)   The town shall allow application, reporting, calculation, and payment
of business license taxes through the business license tax portal hosted and
managed by the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, subject to the
availability and capability thereof. Any limitations in portal availability or
capability do not relieve the applicant or licensee from existing business
license or business license tax obligations.
(Prior Code, § 10-5) (Ord. passed 11-17-1980; Ord. passed 12-15-1992; Ord.
2021-18, passed 12-21-2021)
§ 110.06 DEDUCTIONS, EXEMPTIONS, AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS.
   (A)   No deductions from gross income shall be made except income earned
outside of the town on which a license tax is paid by the business to some
other municipality or county and fully reported to the town, taxes collected
for a governmental entity, or income which cannot be included for computation
of the tax pursuant to state or federal law. Properly apportioned income from
business in interstate commerce shall be included in the calculation of gross
income and is not exempted. The applicant shall have the burden to establish
the right to exempt income by satisfactory records and proof.
   (B)   No person shall be exempt from the requirements of the chapter by
reason of the lack of an established place of business within the town, unless
exempted by state or federal law. The license official shall determine the
appropriate classification for each business in accordance with the latest
issue of NAICS. No person shall be exempt from this chapter by reason of the
payment of any other tax, unless exempted by state law, and no person shall be
relieved of liability for payment of any other tax or fee by reason of
application of this chapter.
   (C)   Wholesalers are exempt from business license taxes unless they
maintain warehouses or distribution establishments within the town. A wholesale
transaction involves a sale to an individual who will resell the goods and
includes delivery of the goods to the reseller. It does not include a sale of
goods to a user or consumer.
   (D)   A charitable organization shall be exempt from the business license
tax on its gross income unless it is deemed a business subject to a business
license tax on all or part of its gross income as provided in this section. A
charitable organization, or any affiliate of a charitable organization, that
reports income from for-profit activities or unrelated business income for
federal income tax purposes to the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed a
business subject to a business license tax on the part of its gross income from
such for-profit activities or unrelated business income.
   (E)   A charitable organization shall be deemed a business subject to a
business license tax on its total gross income if (1) any net proceeds of
operation, after necessary expenses of operation, inure to the benefit of any
individual or any entity that is not itself a charitable organization as
defined in this chapter, or (2) any net proceeds of operation, after necessary
expenses of operation, are used for a purpose other than a charitable purpose
as defined in this chapter. Excess benefits or compensation in any form beyond
fair market value to a sponsor, organizer, officer, director, trustee, or
person with ultimate control of the organization shall not be deemed a
necessary expense of operation.

§ 110.07 FALSE APPLICATION UNLAWFUL.

license tax and late penalties in addition to other penalties provided herein.
Each day of failure to pay the proper amount of business license tax shall
constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   The license official shall have the authority to make inspections and
conduct audits of businesses to ensure compliance with the chapter. Financial
information obtained by inspections and audits shall not be deemed public
records, and the license official shall not release the amount of business

written permission of the licensee, except as authorized by this chapter, state
or federal law, or proper judicial order. Statistics compiled by
classifications are public records.

penalties as provided herein.
   (B)   The license official shall establish a uniform local procedure
consistent with S.C. Code § 6-1-410 for hearing an application for adjustment
of assessment and issuing a notice of final assessment; provided that for

business licenses issued to businesses subject to business license taxes under
Article 20, Chapter 9, Title 58, and Chapters 7 and 45, Title 38, of the South
Carolina Code, the town, by separate ordinance, may establish a different

notices that business license taxes are due. If notices are not mailed, there

Failure to receive notice shall not constitute a defense to prosecution for
failure to pay the tax due or grounds for waiver of penalties.

Following the hearing, the Council by majority vote of its members present, or

CLASS 8 RATES
Each NAICS number designates a separate subclassification. The businesses in
this section are treated as separate and individual subclasses due to
provisions of state law, regulatory requirements, service burdens, tax
equalization considerations, and other factors that are deemed sufficient to
require individually determined rates. In accordance with state law, the
Municipality also may provide for reasonable subclassifications for rates,
described by an NAICS sector, subsector, or industry, that are based on
particularized considerations as needed for economic stimulus or for the
enhanced or disproportionate demands on municipal services or infrastructure.
Non-resident rates do not apply except where indicated.

date. An amended report shall be filed for each new job and the appropriate
additional license fee per $1,000 of the contract amount shall be paid prior to
commencement of new work. Only one base tax shall be paid in a license year.
Licensees holding a per-job license shall file, by each April 30 during the
continuation of the construction project, a statement of compliance, including
but not limited to a revised estimate of the value of the contract. If any
revised estimate of the final value of such project exceeds the amount for
which the business license was issued, the licensee shall be required to pay a
license fee at the then-prevailing rate on the excess amount.

§ 131.02 INITIAL REVIEW OF BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (A)   Notice. Upon the adoption of this chapter and the certification of the
town by the FCC, the town shall immediately notify all cable operator in the
town by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the town intends to
regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated
equipment as authorized by the Cable Act of 1992, being 47 C.F.R. 76.
   (B)   Cable operator response. Within 30 days of receiving notice from the
town, the cable operator shall file with the town its current rates for basic
service tier and associated equipment and any supporting material concerning
the reasonableness of its rates.
   (C)   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the Town Council is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are
within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable
benchmark, the Town Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable
operator filed its basic cable rates with the town.
      (2)   If the Town Council takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its basic rates with the town, the proposed rates will
continue in effect.
   (D)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the Town Council is unable to determine whether the rates in
issue are within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the Town
Council shall, within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic
cable rates with the town and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         (a)   Ninety days if the Town Council needs more time to ensure that a
rate is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard; or
         (b)   One hundred and fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
      (2)   If the Town Council has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-
day period, the Town Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts
are paid.
   (E)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the Town Council shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (F)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may submit the objection in writing any time
before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made
part of the record, the objector must provide the Town Clerk with the
objector’s name and address.
   (G)   Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC’s reasonable rate
standard, the Town Council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis
in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the Town
Council’s findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as
follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator’s rates
will be capped at that level;
      (2)   If the basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates shall be
the greater of the cable operator’s per channel rate on September 30, 1992,
reduced by 10%, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and any
change in the number occurring between September 30, 1992 and the initial date
of regulation; or
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator’s per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rates above the FCC’s reasonable rate standard. The Town Council will
review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-
service review. The Town Council may approve initial basic rates above
benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below the
cable operator’s September 30, 1992 rates minus 10%, will prescribe the cable
operator’s new rates.
   (I)   Decision by formal resolution. After completion of its review of the
cable operator’s proposed rates, the Town Council shall adopt its decision by
formal resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
      (1)   If the proposal is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard or is
justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the Town Council shall approve the
initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
      (2)   If the proposal is not within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the Town Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
   (J)   Rollbacks and refunds. If the Town Council determines that the initial
basic cable rates are submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or the
cable operator’s cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the Town
Council may order the rates reduced in accordance with division (G) or (H)
above, as applicable. In addition, the Town Council may order the cable
operator to pay subscribers refunds of the excessive portion of the rates with
interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue
Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September
1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Town Council’s decision
resolution.
   (K)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates proposed
by cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there were
objectives made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolution must
state the reasons for the decision and the Town Council must give the public
notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement once in a
newspaper of general circulation in the town.
   (L)   Appeal. The Town Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal regulations.
(Prior Code, § 14-26)
§ 131.03 REVIEW OR REQUEST FOR INCREASE IN BASIC CABLE RATES.
   (A)   Notice. A cable operator in the town who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the town and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the cable operator
desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often
than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of the
initial basic cable rates.
   (B)   Expelled determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the Town Council is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator’s rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC’s reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the
Town Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the town.
      (2)   If the Town Council takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the town, the proposed rates will go
into effect.
   (C)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the Town Council is unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the Town
Council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         (a)   Ninety days if the Town Council needs more time to ensure that
the requested increase is within the FCC’s reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         (b)   Ten days if the cable operator has submitted a cost-of-service
showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If the Town Council has not made a decision within the 90- or 150-
day period, the Town Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf
the amounts are paid.
   (D)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, the Town Council shall hold at least one
public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (E)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may submit the objection in writing any time before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the Town Clerk with the objector’s
name and address.
   (F)   Delayed determination. If the Town Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if the Town Council after issues a decision disapproving any
portion of the increase.
   (G)   Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC’s price cap, the Town Council
shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the
standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the Town Council’s findings, the
basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates; or
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the Town Council shall disapprove the proposed rate
increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
the Town Council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for
cost-of-service review. The Town Council may approve a rate increase above the
price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of-service determination resting in rate below the price cap or below the cable
operator’s then current rate will prescribe the cable operator’s new rate.
   (I)   Decision. The Town Council’s decision concerning the requested rate
increase shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by
a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made
by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person in writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.
   (J)   Refunds.
      (1)   The Town Council may order refunds of subscribers’ rate payments
with interest if:
         (a)   The Town Council was unable to make a decision within the
extended time period as described in division (C) above;
         (b)   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         (c)   The Town Council determines that the rate increase as submitted
exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify
the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the Town Council
disapproves any portion of the rate increase.
      (2)   The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the Town Council’s decision
resolution.
   (K)   Appeal. The Town Council’s decision concerning rates for the basic
service tier or associated equipment may be appealed to the FCC in accordance
with applicable federal regulations.
(Prior Code, § 14-26)
§ 131.04 CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION.
   (A)   Requirements. The town may require:
      (1)   In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rate
standard, the Town Council may require the cable operator to produce
information in addition to that submitted, including proprietary information,
if needed, to make a rate determination. In these cases, a cable operator may
request the information be kept confidential in accordance with this section;
or
      (2)   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, the Town Council may request additional information only in
order to document that the cable operator’s rates are in accord with the
standard.
   (B)   Request for confidentiality.
      (1)   A cable operator submitting information to the Town Council may
request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for
public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of
the information and all copies of the information to which it applies.
      (2)   If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be
physically separate from any information to which the request does not apply.
If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request
applies shall be identified.
      (3)   Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for
withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons
are based.
      (4)   Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this
division (B) shall not be considered.
   (C)   Town Council action. Requests which comply with the requirements of
division (B) above will be acted upon by the Town Council. The Town Council
will grant the request if the cable operator presents, by a preponderance of
the evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal
regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public
file in lieu of the information withheld from the public inspection. If the
request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the Town Council denies
the request, the Town Council shall take one of the following actions:
      (1)   If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any
direction from the town, the cable operator may request that the town return
the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the town will comply with
this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so requires
will the information be made available for public inspection; or
      (2)   If the information was required to be submitted by the Town
Council, the information will be made available for public inspection.
   (D)   Appeal. If the town denies the request for confidentially, the cable
operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days
of the Town Council’s decision, and the release of the information will be
stayed pending review.
(Prior Code, § 14-26)
§ 131.05 AUTOMATIC RATE ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the
cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic
service tier annually with the final GNP-PI index.
   (B)   Other external costs.
      (1)   The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its
rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost
factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceed the
GNP-PI. The factors include retransmission’s consent fees, programming cost,
state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service,
and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a
franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without
regard to its relation to the GNP-PI.
      (2)   For all categories of external costs other than retransmission’s
consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external
costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the
date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February
28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be
adjusted for costs of retransmission’s consent fees or changes in those fees
incurred before October 6, 1994.
   (C)   Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the town at
least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment
items. The town shall review the increase to determine whether the time or
items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the town makes no objection within
30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect.
(Prior Code, § 14-26)
§ 131.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Refunds. The town may order the cable operator to refund to
subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following
circumstances:
      (1)   A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be
in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment;
or
      (2)   The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order
issued by the town.
   (B)   Fines. If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or
refund order, the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of $500 for each
day the cable operator fails to comply.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The state legislature has delegated the responsibility to local governmental
units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Town Council does ordain as
follows.
(Prior Code, § 5-63)
§ 153.02 FINDING OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary pubic
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Prior Code, § 5-64)
§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases
in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   (D)   Control filing, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Prior Code, § 5-65)
§ 153.04 OBJECTIVES.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in floodplains;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas; and
   (G)   To ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in
a flood area.
(Prior Code, § 5-66)

   START OF CONSTRUCTION (FOR OTHER THAN NEW CONSTRUCTION OR SUBSTANTIAL
IMPROVEMENTS UNDER THE COASTAL BARRIER RESOURCES ACT (PUB. LAW 97-348, BEING 16
U.S.C. §§ 3501 ET SEQ.)). Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date.
The actual START means the first placement of permanent construction of a
building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slab
or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond
the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filing; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For a
substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a
manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank or other human-made facilities
or infrastructures.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. 
      (1)   Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration or
improvements to a building, taking place during a three-year period, in which
the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the building.
The market value of the building should be:
         (a)   The appraised value of the building prior to the start of the
initial repair or improvement; or
         (b)   In the case of damage, the value of the building prior to the
damage occurring.
      (2)   This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. For the purposes of
this definition, SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT is considered to occur when the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of
the building. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement
of a building required to comply with existing health, sanitary or safety code
specifications which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official and
which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions.
   SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS OR SUBDIVISIONS.
Where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets,
utilities and pads equals or exceed 50% of the value of the streets, utilities
and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

(Prior Code, § 5-73)
§ 153.12 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the town or by any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

altered or relocated as result of proposed development.
      (2)   Construction stage.
         (a)   Provide a floor elevation or flood-proofing certification after
the lowest floor is completed, or instances where the building is subject to
the regulations applicable to coastal high hazard areas, after placement of the
horizontal structural members of the lowest floor. Upon placement of the lowest
floor, or flood-proofing by whatever construction means, or upon placement of
the horizontal structural members of the lowest floor, whichever is applicable,
it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the Zoning Administrator
a certification of the elevation of the lowest floor, flood-proofed elevation,
or the elevation of the lowest portion of the horizontal structural members of
the lowest floor, whichever is applicable, as built, in relation to mean sea
level. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same.
When flood-proofing is utilized for a particular building, said certification
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer
or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of
the certification shall be at the permit holder’s risk. The Zoning
Administrator shall review the floor elevation survey data submitted.
Deficiencies detected by such review shall be corrected by the permit holder
immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed.
Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required
hereby shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
         (b)   At the end of construction and prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy an as-built elevation certificate and/or flood
proofing certificate, an as-built design certificate and an as-built breakaway
wall certificate must be provided. Said certification shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor and/or professional
engineer and certified by same. When flood-proofing is utilized for a
particular building, said certification shall be prepared by or under the
direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by
same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at
the permit holder’s risk. The Administrator shall review the floor elevation
survey data and all design certificates submitted. Deficiencies detected shall
be corrected immediately by the owner or contractor prior to occupancy of the
structure.
         (c)   Also prior to occupancy of a dwelling unit a non-conversion
agreement must be signed, notarized and submitted to the Administrator for
recording with the deed to the property. This agreement will allow yearly
inspection of the area below base flood for compliance with the Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance of the town
            1.   V-Zone certification. When a structure is located in Zones V,
VE, or VI-30, certification shall be provided from a registered professional
engineer or architect, separate from submitted plans, that new construction and
substantial improvement meets the criteria for the coastal high hazard areas.
            2.   A-Zone certification. When a structure is located in Zones A,
AE, or AO, certification shall be provided from a registered professional
engineer or architect, separate from submitted plans, that new construction and
substantial improvement meets the criteria for the coastal high hazard areas.

officer, department, board or bureau of the municipality may appeal such
decision to a court of record, as provided in S.C. Code § 5-23-150.
   (D)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures (see definition) upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
   (E)   In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity of the facility to a waterfront location, in the case
of a functionally dependent facility;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding
or erosion damage, for the proposed use;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;

substantial improvement.
(Prior Code, § 5-80) (Ord. passed 1-21-1992; Ord. 2020-18, passed 11-17-2020;
Ord. 2021-01, passed 1-19-2021)
§ 153.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data have
been provided, as set forth in §§
153.07 or
153.27(K), the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement
of any structure (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated not lower than one foot above the minimum base flood
elevation requirement. Historical structures individually listed on the town
Historical Resources List as a Traditional Island Resource or a Landmark
Structure that has not been substantially improved after December 1977 is
exempt from the one-foot freeboard requirement.
      (1)   In A, AE, or AO Zones an enclosed storage area not to exceed 200
square feet in area is allowed below the base flood elevation, provided the
walls forming the enclosure is certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect as breakaway construction and contain vents to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces as described in this division (A) and divisions (B)
and (C) below.
      (2)   All other space below the regulatory flood elevation shall be open
lattice or mesh screening. Open lattice may incorporate a lightweight
transparent material on the inside of the lattice panel provided the walls
forming the enclosure is certified by a registered professional engineer or
architect as breakaway construction and contain vents to equalize hydrostatic
flood forces as described in division (C) below. A non-conversion agreement
must be signed, notarized, recorded with the deed to the property and submitted
to the Administrator. This agreement will allow yearly inspection of the area
below base flood for compliance with the Flood Damage Prevention Ordinance of
the town.
   (B)   Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential building (or
manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no
lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A
Zones may be flood-proofed in lieu of being elevated, provided that all areas
of the building below the required elevation are water-tight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and use structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or
architect shall certify that the standards of this division (B) are satisfied.
Such certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in §
153.27(I).
   (C)   Elevated buildings. New construction of elevated buildings shall meet
the requirements as set forth in division (A) above. Substantial improvements
of elevated buildings that include existing fully enclosed areas formed by
foundation and other exterior walls below the base flood elevation shall be
designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry
and exit of floodwater to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls.
      (1)   Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet the following minimum
criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not
less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade; and
         (c)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in
both directions.
      (2)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow
for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and
      (3)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned
or finished into separate rooms.
   (D)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO Zones).Located within the
areas of special flood hazard established in this chapter, are areas designated
as shallow flooding. The following provisions shall apply within such areas.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to at least as high as the
depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above the
highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall
be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade; and
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-
residential structures shall:
         (a)   Have the lowest floor elevated to at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above the highest
adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be
elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade.
         (b)   Be completely flood-proofed together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities to or above that level so that any space below that level
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as stated
in this chapter.
   (E)   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles.
      (1)   All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on
individual lots or parcels, must meet all the requirements for new
construction, including elevation and anchoring.
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than the base flood elevation, or the manufactured home chassis is supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least an equivalent
strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above grade.
         (b)   The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the
adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral
movement.
         (c)   When existing manufactured home has incurred “substantial
damage” as the result of a flood, any manufactured home placed or substantially
improved must meet the standards of divisions (D)(2)(a) and (D)(2)(c) below.
      (2)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
         (a)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices and has no permanently attached structures); or
         (b)   The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new
construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of this division
(D)(2) or division (D)(1) above.
   (F)   Coastal high hazard areas (V Zones). Located within the areas of
special flood hazard established in §
153.07, are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas. These areas have
special flood hazards associated with wave wash, therefore, the following
provisions shall apply.
      (1)   All buildings shall be located landward of the reach of the mean
high tide.
      (2)   All buildings shall be elevated so that the bottom of the lowest
supporting horizontal member (excluding pilings or columns) is located no lower
than the base flood elevation level. An enclosed storage area not to exceed 200
square feet in area is allowed below the base flood elevation, provided the
walls forming the enclosure are certified by a registered professional engineer
or architect as breakaway construction and contain vents to equalize
hydrostatic flood forces as described in division (C) above. Further enclosure
consisting of open lattice work or decorative screening may be permitted for
aesthetic purposes only and must be designed to wash away in the event of
abnormal wave action and in accordance with division (E)(8) below.
      (3)   All buildings or structures shall be securely anchored on pilings
or columns.
      (4)   All pile and column foundations and structures attached thereto
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement due to the
effect of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components. Water loading values shall equal or exceed the base flood. Wind
loading values shall be in accordance with the most current edition of
International Building Code.
      (5)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with
the provisions contained in divisions (E)(2), (E)(3) and (E)(4) above.
      (6)   There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted
fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic
purposes, provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, (thereby rendering
the building free from obstruction) prior to generating excessive loading
forces, ramping effects or wave deflection. The Zoning Administrator shall
approve design plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill only after the applicant
has provided a analysis by an engineer, architect and/or soil scientist, which
demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered:
         (a)   Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency
for excessive natural compaction;
         (b)   Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to
adjacent properties; and
         (c)   Slope of fill will not cause wave run-off or ramping.
      (7)   There shall be no alteration of sand dunes which would increase
potential flood damage.
      (8)   In addition to the enclosed storage area mentioned in division (E)
(2) above, open lattice work or mesh screening shall be allowed below the base
flood elevation, provided they are not part of the structural support of the
building and are designed to breakaway under abnormally high tides or wave
action without damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they
are to be used, and provided the following design specifications are met:
         (a)   No additional solid walls shall be allowed; and
         (b)   Material shall consist of lattice or mesh screening only.
      (9)   If aesthetic lattice work or screening is utilized, such enclosed
space shall not be designed to be used for human habitation, but shall be
designed to be used only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited
storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises.
      (10)   Prior to construction, plans for any buildings that will have
lattice work or decorative screening must be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator for approval.
      (11)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a
structure shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor except with
lattice work or decorative screening, as provided for in divisions (E)(8) and
(E)(9) above.
      (12)   Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes),
except in an existing manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A
replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision, provided the anchoring standards of
division (E)(5) above and the elevation standards of division (E)(2) above are
met.
      (13)   All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
         (a)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices and has no permanently attached structures); or
         (b)   The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for new
construction, including anchoring and elevation requirements of divisions (D)
(1) or (D)(2) above.

§ 155.010 PETITION FOR RELIEF.
   (A)   The petition must be accompanied with a $25 fee that will be used to
partially defray the costs incurred in connection with the administration of
petitions filed pursuant to this section.
   (B)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear the petition to determine if
the annual stormwater management utility fee does not apportion the fee with
approximate equality, based upon a reasonable basis of classification and with
due regard to the benefits conferred by providing stormwater management
services to the utility customer and the requirements of public health, safety
or welfare. The determination of the annual fee by the Board of Zoning Appeals
is entitled to a presumption of correctness, and the petitioner has the burden
of rebutting the presumption of correctness.
   (C)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall render a written decision on each
petition that is heard, and such written decision shall be issued within 20
calendar days from the day the Board heard the petition. The decision of the

(Prior Code, § 25-12) (Ord. 2007, passed 9-18-2007)
UTILITY FEE
§ 155.025 STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY FEE; CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY.
   (A)   Classification. For purposes of determining the fee, all real property
in the town is classified as follows:
      (1)   Single-family residential;
      (2)   Vacant; or
      (3)   Commercial.
   (B)   Base rate. The base rate shall be $72 annually. In no case shall a
Utility customer be billed a fee for less than one-half the base rate.
   (C)   Equivalent residential unit (ERU). One commonly accepted rate unit for
stormwater utilities is the Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU). This is a
descriptive value based on the land classification type and the amount of
impervious surface. The ERU is used to relate a rate charged for a typical
residential property and this becomes the common denominator by which
Commercial properties are evaluated. The ERU for the county has been determined
to be 3,000 square feet.
   (D)   Annual fees. Annual fees for all property shall be as follows.
      (1)   Single-family residential property. Single-family residential
property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times one equivalent
residential unit (ERU), regardless of the size of the parcel or improvements
(impervious area).
      (2)   Vacant property. Vacant property shall be charged a fee equal to
the base rate times one-half equivalent residential unit (ERU), regardless of
the size of the parcel.
      (3)   Commercial property. Commercial property shall be charged the base
rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total
impervious area of the property, as determined by the Director of Public Works
or an authorized designee, by one ERU (3,000 square feet). The numerical factor
will be rounded to the nearest tenth of a unit. The minimum fee for any
commercial property shall be the base rate times one-half ERU. Those commercial
properties with impervious area greater than one-half ERU (1,500 square feet)
and less than one (3,000 square feet) shall be charged the base rate times one
ERU.
(Prior Code, § 25-13) (Ord. 2007, passed 9-18-2007; Ord. 2016-05, passed 8-1-
2016)
§ 155.026 DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY FEE.
   (A)   Computation of stormwater management utility fee.
      (1)   Determine base rate to assign ERU;
      (2)   Determine the impervious area on the property;
      (3)   Calculate the numerical factor for the property in question by
dividing the impervious area by one ERU (3,000 square feet); and
      (4)   Calculate the annual stormwater management utility fee by
multiplying the numerical factor by the base rate, if the factor is greater
than one.
   (B)   Example calculation. Calculation of monthly fee for a one and one-half
acre commercial property with a determined impervious area of 32,500 square
feet.
      (1)   One ERU = 3,000 square feet.
      (2)   Property impervious area = 32,500 square feet.
      (3)   ERUs for example property = 32,500 square feet of impervious/one
ERU of 3,000 square feet = 10.8 ERUs
      (4)   Utility fee = ERUs x Base Rate (10.8 ERUs x Example Base Rate of
$72 = $777.60/year.
   (C) Classification of property.
      (1)   The classification of real property and the identification of the
utility customer for the purpose of determining fees shall be determined from
the records of the County Tax Assessor’s. The utility customer or person
charged the fee is based on the classification of the real property as of
January 1 of the year of billing and each year subsequently thereafter.
      (2)   Where the tax records are incomplete or ambiguous, a physical
inspection of the real property shall be made to determine the use of the
property. Upon development of the county’s database and review of the real
properties on a case-by-case basis, the classifications from the records of the
County Tax Assessor’s do not preclude an adjustment to the data that the county
uses to determine the fee.
(Prior Code, § 25-14) (Ord. 2007, passed 9-18-2007; Ord. 2016-05, passed 8-1-
2016)
§ 155.027 ADJUSTMENT OF UTILITY FEE.
   (A)   In cases where the Utility customer disputes the fee based on the
actual impervious area of the real property in which he or she has interest, a
notice of objection may be filed with the Chief Building Inspector as outlined
in §
155.009, written notice of objection; provided, however, that Town Council many
delegate the Chief Building Inspector’s responsibilities hereunder to the
county or its duly authorized representatives pursuant to an inter-governmental
agreement providing for same.
   (B)   Where an adjustment of the fee is warranted, the Chief Building
Inspector shall recalculate and re-determine the fee using equivalent ERUs that
is based on the total impervious area of the real property at issue.

fee will be reviewed, evaluated and amended as necessary in order to address
the town’s stormwater program needs/deficiencies and small municipal separate
storm sewer system (SMS4) general permit requirements.
(Prior Code, § 25-16) (Ord. 2007, passed 9-18-2007; Ord. 2016-05, passed 8-1-
2016)
§ 155.029 BILLING OF STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY FEE; LATE CHARGES.
   (A)   The fee shall not be prorated. No refunds of the fee shall be made
except as set forth in this chapter. The fee shall be billed annually and
mailed to each owner of record of real property, based on the classification of
the property, to the owner of record of the real property as of January 1 of
each year subsequently thereafter. For non-payment of all or any part of the
utility fee, the monetary penalty shall be the same penalty set forth in S.C.
Code § 12-45-180.
   (B)   If any fee shall remain 60 days after the due date, the county may
issue a lien upon the parcel for the stormwater utility fee, penalties and
costs of collection, and shall proceed to collect in the same manner as
prescribed by law for the collection of other fees and taxes. The town may
delegate collection of the fees, including any required legal action, to the
county or its representatives pursuant to an inter-governmental agreement
providing for same.

delay by the Holder, its successors or assigns, in acting to enforce any
restriction or exercise any rights under this Deed Restriction.

ORDINANCE TO AMEND CHAPTER 21 OF THE ZONING ORDINANCES FOR THE TOWN OF
SULLIVAN’S ISLAND
WHEREAS, Chapter 21 of the Town of Sullivan’s Island Ordinance which is cited
as “The Zoning Ordinance” was originally enacted in 1977; and
WHEREAS, the Town of Sullivan’s Island has, from time to time, amended certain
sections of The Zoning Ordinance; and
WHEREAS, the Town of Sullivan’s Island was mindful to make comprehensive
revisions to The Zoning Ordinance and sought plans and procedures whereby
professional zoning consultation, citizen input and Town staff would come

and
WHEREAS, the Town of Sullivan’s Island retained the services of Cooper
Consulting, Inc. who are known as Planning and Zoning experts; and
WHEREAS, Cooper Consulting, Inc. held three (3) public workshops whereby
citizen input was invited and accepted and after reviewing the existing Zoning
Ordinances together with the citizens input at public meetings and further
citizen and Town staff input by way of written and verbal communications,
Cooper Consulting, Inc. produced a proposed draft of a comprehensive amendment
to the Town of Sullivan’s Island Zoning Ordinances; and
WHEREAS, upon receipt of the proposed draft, the Town Council directed the
Planning Commission to hold public hearings and to make further review and
recommendations; and
WHEREAS, the Planning Commission held numerous public hearings and after review
it rendered its recommendations to the Town Council; and
WHEREAS, the Town Council for the Town of Sullivan’s Island has reviewed the
proposed draft by Cooper Consulting, Inc. and the proposed recommendations and
revisions of the Planning Commission and now are mindful of adopting the
following comprehensive revisions to the Town Zoning Ordinance and are of the
opinion that the following comprehensive amendments are in the best interest of
the Town.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE MAYOR AND TOWN COUNCIL IN MEETING DULY
ASSEMBLED,
   that Chapter 21 The Ordinances for the Town of Sullivan’s Island be amended
to read as follows:
ARTICLE I: IN GENERAL
Sec. 21-1.   Authority, enactment and intent.
   A.   Intent.    In pursuance of authority conferred by the South Carolina
Code, Title 6, Chapter 29 and in accordance with the Town of Sullivan’s
Island’s Comprehensive Plan, the Town Council of Sullivan’s Island, South
Carolina, does ordain and enact into law this Zoning Ordinance to:
      (1)   Prevent the overcrowding of land;
      (2)   Protect the low-density and residential character of the Island;
      (3)   Ensure that the mass and scale of new development is compatible
with the Island’s existing character, neighborhoods and historical buildings;
      (4)   Lessen congestion in the streets;
      (5)   Secure safety from fire, panic, and other dangers;
      (6)   Promote public health and general welfare;
      (7)   Promote adequate light and air;
      (8)   Promote the protection of the Island’s historical character and
natural environment;
      (9)   Avoid undue concentration of population;
      (10)   Protect scenic areas; to facilitate the adequate provisions of
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public requirements;
and,
      (11)   Protect areas subject to periodic flooding against development
   B.   Relationship to comprehensive plan. It is intended that the Zoning
Ordinance implement the Town’s Comprehensive Plan, as amended and periodically
updated, including all supplements and attachments.
   C.   Conformity with zoning ordinance. No building, structure, or premises
shall be used, and no building, structure, or part thereof shall be erected,
moved, remodeled, extended, enlarged, or altered, except in conformity with
this Ordinance. In addition, no other activity, including land clearing or tree
removal, regulated by this Ordinance shall be authorized unless in conformity
with this Ordinance.
   D.   Original zoning ordinance. Prior to 1977, Sullivan’s Island was
entirely owned by the State of South Carolina with the exception of the
military reservation. In 1977, with the transfer of property into private
ownership, the South Carolina’s General Assembly provided for the creation of a
Zoning Ordinance that set forth zoning districts that insured the Island would
be predominantly single family residential with a small amount of supportive
office and commercial. The Zoning Ordinance set forth a plan whereby the lots
would be one-half (1/2) acre and there would be only one single family dwelling
on each lot. The zoning plan confined the office and commercial area generally
to either side of Middle Street between Station 22 1/2 and Station 20 1/2.
   E.   Revision to zoning ordinance.
      Since 1977, the Zoning Ordinance of Sullivan’s Island has undergone a
substantial number of intermediate revisions. However, in 2002, in response to
residents’ growing concerns over the increasing amount of residential
construction that was incompatible in scale and mass with existing Island
development, Sullivan’s Island took decisive steps to fully update the Zoning
Ordinance.
      The Zoning Ordinance of Sullivan’s Island is herein revised based on a
substantial process of public involvement during 2002 - 2004. As a part of the
Ordinance’s revision, the public was asked to craft a vision statement that
captured the essence of Sullivan’s Island. The following is the vision
statement:
      A comfortable home at the beach, safe and friendly, where individuality
and diversity are celebrated, neighborhoods are respected, island resources are
appreciated, history is intertwined, and families and neighbors seek to thrive.
      These revisions limit the mass and scale of new development: provide
incentives for retaining the Island’s historical homes; encourage architecture
and landscaping that respects the Island’s history and climate; and provide a
commitment to resource conservation.
Sec. 21-2. Short title.
   This Ordinance shall be known and may be cited as the “Zoning Ordinance.”
Sec. 21-3. General rules of construction.
   A.   Construction of language, meanings and intent. All provisions, terms,

or implication between the text and any heading, drawing, table or figure, the
text will control.
   C.   Computations of time and advertisement. The time within which an act is
to be completed will be computed by including the first day and excluding the
last day. If the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, that day
shall be excluded. In the computation of time for public hearing notice, the
day of the advertisement will be counted and the day of the hearing will be
excluded.

   E.   Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring the
department head or officer of the Town to perform an act or duty, that
provision will be construed as authorizing department head or officer to
delegate the responsibility to subordinates.
   F.   Technical and non-technical terms. Words and phrases will be construed
according to the common and approved usage of the language, but technical words
and phrases that may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law
will be construed and understood according to such meaning.

a driveway.
Sec. 21-16. Water and air pollution.
   All uses shall comply with the requirements of the Charleston County Health
Department, regarding the protection of waterways from pollution by waste
materials and the protection of the atmosphere from pollution by dust, smoke,
or other waste materials.
Sec. 21-17. Stormwater management.
   (A)   No lot shall be built upon, graded or filled without the Building
Official’s or Zoning Administrator’s prior approval of a stormwater management
plan. The stormwater management plan and construction specifications must be

Sec. 21-18. Reserved.
ARTICLE III: RS-SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT
Sec. 21-19. Intent, application and split zoned lots of RS-Single Family
District.
   A. Intent. It is the intent of the RS-Single Family Residential District to
be developed and reserved for low-density residential purposes built in a
manner that is respectful of the Island’s building mass and scale, historic
structures, and compatible with neighborhood character. The regulations that
apply within this district are designed to encourage the formation and
continuance of a stable, healthy, environment for one single family, primarily
owner-occupied dwelling per lot with each lot having an area of at least one-
half (1/2) acre and to discourage any encroachment by commercial, or other uses
capable of adversely affecting the residential character of the district. (3-
20-12)
   B. Application of zoning and design standards and design guidelines. Unless
otherwise specifically identified as a Design Standard or Design Guideline, all
of the standards under this Article shall be considered as Zoning Standards.
   C. Split zoned lots within the CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay Districts that are not
subdivided. (3/20/12) In an effort to have the property owner(s) self-police
the extent and intensity of the commercial use where it is located on the same
lot as a structure used for residential purpose, the following conditions will
attach if the owner(s) elect to locate a commercial use as described in Sec.
2l-50 on the same lot that a structure for residential purpose is also located:
      (1)   The lot shall remain in single ownership; more specifically,
regardless of the type of ownership every owner, member, partner, shareholder,
or unit owner must have the same percentage of ownership in the structure(s)
where a commercial use is located as in the structures(s) where a residential
use is located;
      (2)   Every owner, member, partner, shareholder or unit owner must have
the same amount of control over the use in the structure(s) where any
commercial use is located as over any structure(s) where a residential use is
located;
      (3)   These conditions shall be placed on any building permit for a
commercial structure or alteration of a structure to accommodate a commercial
use and shall be placed on any business license for a commercial use; and
      (4)   Furthermore, these conditions shall become covenants running with
the property and shall be placed on the real estate title to the property by
the owner of the lot by recording deed restrictions for the benefit of the Town
of Sullivan’s Island on the owner(s) title and recording the same in the RMC
Office for Charleston County, before a building permit or business license is
issued.
   D. Design Review Board authority with respect to single family residential
structures on CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay District lots. (3/20/12) None of the
allowances described in Article III for modifications to zoning or design
standards by the Design Review Board shall be permitted for single family
residential structures on CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay District lots except as provided
in Sections 21-49. Approval by the Design Review Board on the basis of
neighborhood compatibility shall be required for any building permit for a
single family residential structure on CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay District lots as
defined and described in Sec. 21-19 (C). (6-19-07) (3/20/12)
Sec. 21-20. Permitted, conditional, special exceptions and prohibited uses.

         (a)   Documentation that since August 1, 1977, both dwellings have
been continually occupied by a family member or under a long-term rental
agreement;
         (b)   If one or both buildings remain unoccupied or not rented for a
period of more than one (1) year, then the right to occupy one of the two
buildings shall be terminated; and,
         (c)   If rented, a current rental agreement must be on file with the
Town.
      (5)   Electrical and water meters:
         (a)   Only one electrical and/or water meter shall be allowed per
residentially zoned lot.
         (b)   An owner shall be permitted to maintain additional meters if the
additional meters were lawfully installed on a legally authorized dwelling for
which a Certificate of Occupancy was duly issued at the time of the original
ratification of the Zoning Ordinance in 1977; provided, such additional meter's
use has not been discontinued as evidenced by a lack of use for a period of at
least one (1) year. In the event any additional meter is removed, no additional
electrical and/or water meter shall be reinstalled in place thereof.
      (6)   Attached additions that do not share heated space with the
principal dwelling provided
         (a)   No kitchen facilities are allowed, and
         (b)   Deed restrictions are placed on the property prohibiting rental
as a separate dwelling, and
         (c)   Any attached addition with an established connection to the
principal building, shall be located under one roof and retain a permanent
floor constructed above grade. The length to width ratio of the proposed
connection may not exceed a two to one (2:1) dimension ratio, with a minimum
width of four (4) feet, a maximum length of twenty (20) feet, and shall be
visually and architecturally integrated with the existing principal building;
said structures, as conditional uses, being reviewed and aesthetically approved
by the Design Review Board. (9/17/2013)
   C.   Special exceptions in the RS-District.
      (1)   Definition and approval.
         (a)   A use permitted in a zoning district that possesses
characteristics that require certain controls in order to ensure compatibility
with other uses in the district within which they are proposed for location and
therefore shall be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
         (b)   In addition to requiring the approval of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, special exceptions in the RS-Single Family District are subject to
specific conditions that are enumerated by type of use.
      (2)   Historic structure used as accessory dwelling unit. As an incentive
to preserve historic structures and avoid their demolition, a second dwelling
may be constructed on the same lot as an historic structure, and the historic
structure may be used as an accessory dwelling, when all of the following
conditions are met:
         (a)   Prior use shall have been used as a dwelling; and
         (b)   The size of the historic structure is less than twelve hundred
(1200) square feet of heated space at the time of its designation as historic
and is listed as an historic property as described in Section
21-94 Historic Property Designation Criteria; provided, however, that a
structure reduced to less than 1200 square feet of heated space after its
designation as historic may qualify for special exception approval for an
additional dwelling on the same lot, but only if the Design Review Board review
determines and specifies in findings, that: (5-15-07)
            a.   Special circumstances justify such reduction in square feet
based on the criteria listed in Section
21-94D. (1-8); and (5-15-07)
            b.   The portions removed from the historic property were added
less than fifty (50) years ago and/or obscured an earlier feature of the
historic house which contributed substantially to the most important elements
of its historic character, definition and integrity. Examples of the latter
instance include the removal of an enclosure of a porch when the open porch had
been characteristic of a particular type of Island structure, or removal of an
addition which covered a distinctive feature of the structure that is shared by
neighboring structures. (5-15-07)
            These provisions shall supersede any inconsistent provisions
contained in other portions of Chapter 21 relating to the use of historic
structures as accessory dwellings, including but not limited to Section
21-140. (5-15-07)
         (c)   In the event the historic structure does not meet current FEMA
elevation requirements, the Design Review Board finds that bringing it into
compliance would significantly impair the historic and architectural character
of the structure; and
         (d)   In the event the historic structure meets current FEMA
elevations requirements, the Design Review Board finds that there is no
feasible design solution for an addition to the historic structure that would
not significantly impair the historic and architectural character of the
structure; and
         (e)   No separate utility service meters shall be permitted; and
         (f)   The Design Review Board must find that the height, scale, mass
and placement of the second structure are appropriate to and compatible with
the lot on which it is sited, the character of the historic structure and
surrounding neighborhood. When necessary to achieve such appropriateness and
compatibility, the Design Review Board may impose stricter limits on height,
setback, size and coverage than those of the zoning standards; and
         (g)   Permission to build a second structure and to use the historic
structure as an accessory dwelling is approved as a special exception by the
Board of Zoning Appeals; and
         (h)   The following conditions as covenants running with the property
shall be placed on the real estate title to the property by the owner of the
lot by recording deed restrictions for the benefit of the Town of Sullivan's
Island on the owner(s) title and recording the same in the RMC office for
Charleston County before a building permit is issued:
            (i)   The lot shall remain in single ownership; more specifically,
regardless of the type of ownership every owner, member, partner, shareholder,
or unit owner, must have the same percentage of ownership in the historic
structure as in any additional structure(s); and
            (ii)   Every owner, member, partner, shareholder or unit owner must
have the same amount of control over the use of the historic structure as over
any additional structure(s); and
         (i)   If the historic structure used as an accessory dwelling is
damaged or destroyed, by natural disaster, civil strife or uncontrollable
accident, by more than fifty percent (50%) of its assessed value based on the
most recent property assessment, the structure may be repaired in accordance
with its preexisting footprint, square footage, setbacks, and lot coverage. The
Zoning Administrator shall rely on all credible information provided by the
owner and/or available from the Town, to establish the damaged or destroyed
structure's pre-existing condition and lot location. A Certificate of Zoning
Compliance and a Building Permit shall be obtained within twelve (12) months of
the date of occurrence of such damage, and once issued, construction shall be
diligently pursued and completed within two (2) years from the date of the
occurrence of such damage. If FEMA regulations require the structure's
foundation to be elevated over fifty percent (50%) above its original
elevation, the Design Review Board shall determine whether or not the
reconstruction shall be required to meet the current Zoning Ordinance's Setback
requirements.
(Ord. 2018-07, passed 11-20-2018) (2-20-24)
         (j)   The historic structure used as an accessory dwelling may be used
as a long-term rental, but only so long as the principal structure is occupied
by an owner of the property as primary residence and a current business license
is held on the same property. Primary residence is defined as a dwelling where
the owner or owners reside on a permanent basis and are assessed at the four
percent (4%) assessment rate on their ad valorem property tax.
      (3)   Religious institution:
         (a)   Limited to one building per lot;
         (b)   Housed in a permanent building;
         (c)   Located on a lot not less than one-half (1/2) acre in area;
         (d)   Provides off-street location for picking-up and dropping-off
adults and children;
         (e)   Provides adequate off-street parking, in accordance with Article
XVI; and,
         (f)   Meets the Setback and lot coverage standards of the RS District.
      (4)   Public utility substation:
         (a)   Shall be fenced or enclosed to provide adequate safety with a
plan approved by the Design Review Board;
         (b)   Does not provide office, operational functions or storage of
vehicles or equipment beyond the required utility equipment to provide service
at that location;
         (c)   Meets the Setback and lot coverage standards of the RS District.
      (5)   Conservation Easement Uses as defined in Section
21-203 Definitions.
         (a)   Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to recognize that all
properties on Sullivan's Island are part of a dynamic and ever-changing barrier
island environment, vulnerable to erosion and catastrophic flooding events.
Whereas all Island properties in close proximity to marshes, beaches and
waterways are predisposed to erosion, loss of critical dune vegetation and
structural damage during large storm events, the Town recognizes a need to
develop innovative methods to incentivize the protection of open space,
preserve view-shed corridors, and reduce the intensity of residential land
uses. (11-17-15)
         (b)   Applicability. As an incentive to preserving environmentally
sensitive properties zoned for residential purposes (RS District), property
owners (grantor) may establish certain recreational uses and structures as part
of a permanent conservation easement. These non-residential uses must include
retaining or protecting natural or open-space values of real property, assuring
its availability for noncommercial agricultural, forestall, recreational, or
open-space use, protecting natural resources, maintaining or enhancing air or
water quality, or preserving the historical, architectural or archeological
aspects of real property. The Board of Zoning Appeals may authorize a
conservation easement structure or use upon a finding that establishment of the
use or structure will not be of a substantial detriment to an adjacent property
or to the public good, and the granting of the use or structure will not harm
the character of the district. (11-17-15)
         (c)   General Conditions.
            i.   Prior to issuance of a building permit the property owner must
remove any previously constructed structures, driveways, recreational
structures (pools, courts, sheds, etc.), pervious or impervious surfaces, and
utilities associated with any previous residential or commercial development.
(11-17-15)
            ii.   Use of the property for commercial or rental activity is
expressly prohibited. (11-17-15)
            iii.   The use of the property shall be limited to owners and
guests, not to exceed twenty-four (24) individuals at any given time. (11-17-
15)
         (d)   Structures.
            i.   Size. One open-air structure (gazebo, cabana, pergola, arbor,
or other open-air structure) not exceeding in square footage, five (5) percent
of the parcel's total upland area, or two hundred fifty (250) square feet,
whichever is less. A potential increase of two (2) percent will be allowed to
the structure's square footage, with a 450 square foot maximum, if an existing
residential structure has been removed from the parcel. (11-17-15)
            ii.   Height. Structure may not exceed a maximum height of ten (10)
feet from the natural grade as measured from the center point of the proposed
structure to the highest point of the roof. Height may be extended to thirteen
(13) feet where the majority pitch of the structure's roof is 4/12 or more. An
increase in height may be allowed if the roof’s lowest horizontal structural
member must be constructed above the Base Flood Elevation (BFE), however, under
no circumstances may roof height exceed 3 feet over BFE. (11-17-15)
            iii.   Storage. The structure may contain no more than thirty (30)
percent of the total allowed square footage as enclosed area designated for
storage space. Enclosed area may include one shower stall and must be
constructed with breakaway walls and designed in accordance with FEMA National
Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulations and the Town of Sullivan's Island
Flood Prevention Ordinance. (11-17-15)
            iv.   No rooftop seating or use will be permitted. (11-17-15)
            v.   Structure may not contain sewer facilities or portable sewage
collection or disposal devices. Following the removal of any existing sewer
facilities, all the requirements of Town Code of Ordinance Chapters 50 and 51
shall be met (Water and Sewer Utility Regulations.) (11-17-15)
            vi.   Lighting. There shall be no exterior site or structural
lighting. Interior lighting shall be designed and arranged to prevent glare on
adjoining properties, adjacent Recreation and Conservation Area Districts, or
any other area of the beach or marsh. (11-17-15)
            vii.   Building setback. Fifteen (15) foot setbacks are required
from all property lines and must meet the approval of the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control and Ocean and Coastal Resource
Management (DHEC-OCRM) agencies prior to submitting an application for Special
Exception consideration. The Board of Zoning Appeals may adjust the setback
requirement in instances where severe erosion, historic structures, natural
topography, or trees and vegetation poses an unnecessary hardship for meeting
the required fifteen (15) foot setback. (11-17-15)
         (e)   Parking.
            i.   A maximum of two vehicles will be permitted on the subject
property. (11-17-15)
            ii.   All parking surfaces must remain in its natural state or turf
grass. No additional impervious or engineered surfaces will be permitted. (11-
17-15)
            iii.   No temporary outdoor storage of vehicles, recreational
vehicles, boats, camping facilities, temporary event structures, machinery, or
beach equipment shall be permitted except during the daytime use of the
property. (11-17-15)
         (f)   Open Storage. No permanent outdoor storage permitted. Outdoor
storage is defined as the keeping within an unroofed and unenclosed area any
foods, material, merchandise, or vehicles. (11-17-15)
         (g)   Neighborhood Compatibility. The Design Review Board must review
all proposed conservation easement structures to ensure design compatibility
with the surrounding neighborhood and ensure an environmentally sensitive, low
scale design, which maximizes public view corridors. No structure height,
square footage, or massing increases will be permitted by the Design Review
Board. (11-17-15)
         (h)   Legal Instrument for Permanent Protection. The instrument of
permanent protection shall be a permanent conservation easement recorded by the
Charleston County Register of Mesne Conveyance Office (RMC), concurrent with
the issuance of a Town of Sullivan's Island Building Permit and land
disturbance permit: (11-17-15)
            i.   A land trust or similar conservation-oriented non-profit
organization (grantee) with legal authority to accept such easements. The
organization shall be bona fide and in perpetual existence and the conveyance
instruments shall contain an appropriate provision for retransfer in the event
the organization becomes unable to carry out its functions, and; (11-17-15)
            ii.   The Town shall receive a copy of the Annual Conservation
Easement Inspection Report, and; (11-17-15)
            iii.   The Town of Sullivan's Island shall reserve a third-party
right of enforcement in the conservation easement agreement. (11-17-15)

be twenty-five (25) feet.
      (2)   Corner lot. The required Front Yard Setback for a Corner Lot shall
be fifteen (15) feet from that portion of the lot running parallel to the side
of the Principal Building. If the Principal Building is sited in a manner that
neither side runs parallel to the lot line, then the Principal Building shall
be set back from both lot lines the required twenty-five (25) feet.
      (3)   Shallow lot.
         (a)   A shallow lot is a lot with less depth than width as measured at
the building line.
         (b)   The required Front Yard Setback may be reduced by one-third (1/
3) foot for each foot by which the lot depth is less than eighty (80) feet
rounded up or down to the nearest whole foot; provided, however, the Front Yard

of increased height above twenty (20) feet as measured at the Front Yard
Setback.
         (b)   Explanation.
            a.   This requirement creates a Front Yard Setback “building
envelope” within which the Principal Building’s front facade shall fit.
            b.   The additional front setback line shall be measured as a
straight line from the Front Lot Line to the required setback line, then
turning at a 90 degree angle and extended twenty (20) feet vertically, and then

      (5)   Principal building front facade.
         (a)   Purpose.
            a.   The overall width and depth of a Principal Building has a
substantial impact on the Principal Building’s mass and scale and how well the
Principal Building blends with existing development of the island.
         (b)   Definitions.
            a.   Primary Front Facade. The largest front facing surface of the
Principal Building that is parallel or nearly parallel to the front yard street

to meet the side yard Setbacks). All other front facing facades shall be set
back at least eight (8) feet from the Principal Building’s Primary Front
Facade.
            b.   A Principal Building having a porch or porches with a depth of
eight (8) feet extending across forty percent (40%) of the Principal Building’s
Primary Front Facade 1st floor shall be exempt from meeting the requirement of
(a) above.
      (6)   Principal building constructed adjacent to post-FEMA elevated
Principal Buildings.
         (a)   If the foundations of the Principal Buildings on either side of
a proposed Principal Building are elevated to meet FEMA’s current flood
standards, the proposed Principal Building is permitted to have the same Front
Yard Setback as the Principal Building having the greater Front Yard Setback,
but in no case shall the Front Yard Setback of the Principal Building be less
than fifteen (15) feet.
         (b)   If the proposed Principal Building is located on a corner lot,
the Principal Buildings sharing a common side lot line with the corner lot

constructed or placed on lots bordering the RC-1 District:
         (a)   Thirty (30) foot Setback from the lot line bordering the RC-
1 District boundary line or the RC-1 District boundary line established as of
the date a Certificate of Zoning Compliance and a Building Permit are issued,
whichever is further landward.
         (b)   No structure greater than four and one-half (4 l/2) feet tall
shall be constructed or moved on a lot so that the seaward most point of the
structure is further from the centerline of the right-of-way forming the
landward boundary of the Lot and running generally parallel with the ocean
shoreline than the greatest distance between the centerline of said right-of-
way to the most seaward point of any other dwelling on the block on which the
Lot is located.
         (c)   Any Certificate of Zoning Compliance and Building Permit issued
for construction governed by this section shall be valid for twelve (12)
months. If construction has not commenced within said twelve (12) months, new
applications for a Certificate of Zoning Compliance in accordance with ARTICLE
XIX. Sec. 21-185 and a Building Permit shall be submitted accompanied by a plat
showing the RC-1 boundary line and all lot line distances as of the date the
application is submitted.
   E.   Setbacks from RC-2 District.
      (1)   The following Setback requirements shall apply to structures
constructed or placed on lots bordering the RC-2 District:
         (a)   Thirty (30) foot Setback from the lot line bordering the RC-
2 Zoning District boundary line or the South Carolina Department of Health and
Environmental Control, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (SCHEC
OCRM) “Critical Area Line” established as of the date the Certificate of Zoning
Compliance and the Building Permit are issued, whichever is further landward
from the RC-2 Zoning District.
         (b)   No structure greater than four and one-half (4 ½) feet shall be
constructed or moved on a lot so that any portion of the structure closest to
the Rear Lot Line is further from the center of the right-of-way forming the
landward boundary of the Lot and running generally parallel with the marshlands
then the greatest distance between the center of the said right-of-way to the
furthest point of any dwelling on the block on which the lot is located.
         (c)   Any Certificate of Zoning Compliance and Building Permit issued
for construction governed by this section shall be valid for twelve (12)
months, and if construction has not commenced within said twelve (12) months,
new applications for a Certificate of Zoning Compliance in accordance with
ARTICLE XIX. Sec. 21-185 and a Building Permit shall be submitted and
accompanied by a plat showing the “Critical Area Line” and all lot line
distances as of the date the application is submitted.
Sec. 21-24. Building height.
   A.   No Principal Building shall be erected, altered or moved so as to
exceed thirty-eight (38) feet in overall height.
   B.   Building height shall be measured in a straight line from the highest
point of the Principal Building, excepting any chimney but including any other
vertical improvement, to the natural ground elevation at the center point of
the Building.
   C.   Elevated Lot: In no case shall the highest point of a Principal
Building be higher than forty (40) feet above the crown of the street nearest
to the center of the foundation.
      (1)   Example: Foundation grade is three (3) feet above street crown;
maximum Principal Building height = 37 feet.
   D.   Religious institutions: The height of sixty feet (60’) shall apply to
spires, belfries, cupolas and domes not intended for human occupancy located on
the Principal Building.
   E.   The Design Review Board may consider any reduction of the principal
building height below the maximum of thirty-eight feet (38) in its assessment
of overall neighborhood compatibility.
   F.   Notwithstanding any of the requirements in
Sec. 21-24 A-C above, single family residential structures on lots within the
CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay Districts may be permitted only if the principal building
height will not exceed 80% of the maximum height otherwise permitted in
Sec. 21-24 A-C; provided however that buildings in such Overlay Districts may
be eligible for bonuses as set forth in Section
21-49 E and F. (3/20/12)
Sec. 21-25. Principal building coverage area.
   A.   Definitions.
      (1)   Principal Building Coverage Area. The Lot Area covered by the
Principal Building measured vertically downward from the Principal Building's
exterior walls to the ground (also known as the building footprint area), but
excludes areas covered only by:
         (a)   accessory structures not readily useable as living space;
         (b)   exterior porches and decks; and,
         (c)   exterior stairs.
      (2)   Principal Building. A building or buildings in which the principal
use of the lot is conducted. The term also specifically applies to multiple
dwellings located on the same lot, including an historic structure used as an
accessory dwelling unit. (5-15-07)
   B.   Permitted principal building coverage area.
      (1)   Lot Area equal, to or greater than fifteen thousand (15,000) square
feet:
         (a)   Principal Building Coverage Area shall be no greater than
fifteen percent (15%) of the Lot Area.
         (b)   Example (18,000 sf Lot Area): 18,000 sf lot x 15% = 2700 sf
Principal Building Coverage Area permitted (15% of Lot Area).
      (2)   Lot Area less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet:
         (a)   Principal Building Coverage Area shall be no greater than
fifteen percent (15%) times Lot Area plus fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet
minus the Lot Area times five percent (5%).
         (b)   Example (12,000 sf Lot Area): (15% x 12,000 sf) + [(15,000 sf -
12,000 sf) x 5%] = 1950 sf Principal Building Coverage Area permitted (16.3% of
Lot Area).
      (3)   Examples. 1/2 acre Lot 21,780 sf= 3267 sf Coverage (15%).
         (a)   1/3 acre Lot 14,505 sf- 2176 sf Coverage (15%).
         (b)   1-4 acre Lot 10,890 sf - 1634 sf Coverage (20%).

   C.   Design Review Board.
      (1)   The Design Review Board may increase by no more than twenty percent
(20%) the maximum permitted Principal Building Coverage Area if this or other
modifications achieve greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in
ARTICLE XII. (5-15-07) (2-20-24)
      (2)   In cases of interpretation of Enclosed Principal Building Coverage
Area, the Design Review Board shall determine what portion of the Enclosed
Principal Building Coverage Area shall be included or excluded in the
calculations.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 2-20-2024)
Sec. 21-26. Impervious coverage area.
   A.   Definitions.
      (1)   Impervious Coverage Area. That portion of the Lot Area covered by
an impervious surface.
      (2)   Impervious Surface: Any material or structure through which water
cannot be absorbed or passed, including but not limited to roofed structures,
compacted soil or stone, pavement consisting of asphalt, concrete, oil and
stone, tar, or asphalt. Impervious surfaces also include building foundations,
porches, decks, patios, sidewalks, play courts (tennis, basketball, etc.),
pools, and other improvements that impede the absorption of water. Grassed or
mulched areas are not considered impervious materials.
      (3)   Pervious Surface: Any material through which water can be easily
absorbed or passed, at a minimum infiltration rate of 2.0 inches per hour, such
as, but not limited to, grass and uncompacted gravel, shell and crushed stone.
(1/20/09)
   B.   Permitted impervious coverage area.
      (1)   Lot Area equal to or greater than fifteen thousand (15,000) square
feet:
         (a)   Impervious Coverage shall be no greater than thirty percent
(30%) of the Lot Area.
         (b)   Example (18,000 sf Lot Area): 18,000 sf lot x 30% = 5400 sf
Impervious Coverage permitted (30%).
      (2)   Lot Area less than fifteen thousand (15,000) square feet:
         (a)   Impervious Coverage shall be no greater than (30% times Lot
Area) plus [(15,000 sf minus the Lot Area) times 5 percent).
         (b)   Example (12,000 sf Lot Area): (30% x 12,000 sf) + [(15,000 sf -
12,000 sf) x 5%] = 3750 sf Impervious Coverage permitted (31.3%).
      (3)   Garage exception to impervious coverage area. Where the finished
first floor elevation in compliance with ARTICLE III. Sec. 21-31 (Foundation
Height), limits the finished first floor elevation to six and a half (6.5) feet
or less, an accessory garage shall be permitted in accordance with ARTICLE XV.
Sec. 21-138 (Accessory Structures) without penalty toward the impervious
surface coverage limits. In this case, the area beneath the dwelling shall not
be used for parking of vehicles or equipment of any type.
      (4)   Examples:
         (a)   1/2 acre Lot 21,780 sf = 6534 sf Impervious Coverage (30%).
         (b)   1/3 acre Lot 14,505 sf = 4352 sf Impervious Coverage (30%).
         (c)   1/4 acre Lot 10890 sf = 3267 sf Impervious Coverage (33.3%).

      (5)   At least fifty percent (50%) of the Lot Area shall remain naturally
vegetated or landscaped with grass and/or other vegetation.
   C.   Design Review Board.
      (1)   The Design Review Board may increase by no more than 25% the
maximum permitted Impervious Coverage if the increased impervious coverage
consists solely of materials such as grass pavers are employed that allow
vegetative materials such as grass to permeate the surface giving the
appearance of grassed areas.
      (2)   In cases of interpretation of Impervious Coverage, the Design
Review Board shall determine what portion of the Impervious Coverage area shall
be included or excluded in the calculations.
Sec. 21-27. Principal building square footage.
   A.   Purpose and definition.
      (1)   Purpose: The overall size of a Principal Building in relation to
lot size affects the impact of the Principal Building's scale and mass on
adjacent buildings and the Island as a whole. Improving the relationship
between lot size and the Principal Building by limiting the Principal
Building's maximum size promotes greater compatibility of new construction with
existing development and contributes to overall neighborhood compatibility.
      (2)   Principal Building Square Footage: The entire square footage of the
Principal Building or Buildings measured from the outside of the exterior
walls, specifically including more than one dwelling on the same lot and
historic structures used as accessory dwelling units, but not including (5-15-
07) (12-17-13)
         (a)   interior space not readily useable as living space (attic used
only for storage or parking area beneath dwelling);
         (b)   structures that are not used as living space;
         (c)   exterior porches and decks; and,
         (d)   exterior stairs.
   B.   Permitted principal building square footage.
      (1)   Lot Area of five thousand (5,000) square feet or less: Principal
Building Square Footage limited to twenty four hundred (2400) square feet.
      (2)   Lot Area exceeding five thousand (5,000) square feet: maximum
Principal Building Square Footage of twenty four hundred (2400) square feet may
be increased 10 sf for every additional 100 square feet of Lot Area.
      (3)   Equation: [(Lot Area - 5000 sf) / 100 sf] x (10) + 2400 = Principal
Building Square Footage.
Examples:
         (a)   1/2 acre Lot 21,780 sf= 4078 Principal Building Square Footage.
         (b)   1/3 acre Lot 14,505 sf= 3351 Principal Building Square Footage.
         (c)   1/4 acre Lot 10890 sf= 2989 Principal Building Square Footage.
         (d)   Lot 5,000 sf= 2400 Principal Building Square Footage.
      (4)   The maximum permitted Principal Building Square Footage is fifty
six hundred (5600) square feet for any newly constructed single-family home.
Existing buildings shall be exempt from the 5600 square foot requirement and
able to utilize their total principal building square footage for single-family
use. (12-17-13)
   C.   Design Review Board.
      (1)   The Design Review Board may increase by no more than fifteen
percent (15%) and not to exceed five hundred (500) square feet added to the
maximum permitted Principal Building Square Footage if this or other
modifications achieve greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in
ARTICLE XII except:
         (i)   In cases of the special exception, Section
21-20C.(2), allowing a second residential structure on a lot with the historic
structure used as an accessory dwelling unit, wherein the Design Review Board
may permit increases in the Principal Building Square Footage by no more than
twenty-five percent (25%), or
         (ii)   In cases where the subject property has been designated
historic, per Section
21-94, wherein the Design Review Board may permit increases in the Principal
Building Square Footage by no more than twenty percent (20%). (5-15-07) (2-20-
24)
      (2)   However, in no case shall any Principal Building Square Footage
exceed 5,600 square feet or, when applicable, the principal square footage
permitted in
Sec. 21-27B.(4). (5-15-07) (12-17-13)
   D.   Notwithstanding any of the requirements in Sec.
Sec. 21-27A.-C. above, single family residential structures in the CCOD 1
District may be permitted only if the principal building coverage area shall
not exceed 80% of the maximum principal building square footage otherwise
permitted in Sec.
Sec. 21-27A.-C. The Design Review Board shall not have the authority to
increase the principal building square footage as set forth in
Sec. 21-27C. for single family residential structures on CCOD 1 or 2 Overlay
District lots; provided, however, the Design Review Board may exercise the
discretion described in
Sec. 21-49. (6/19/07) (3/20/12)
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 2-20-2024)
Sec. 21-28. Third story.
   A.   The Enclosed Portion of any third Story of any Principal Building shall
be no greater than four hundred (400) square feet and shall only have fifty
percent (50%) of its wall area projecting outside the roof area as measured
from the outside of the wall studs.
   B.   The Design Review Board may grant up to a fifteen percent (15%)
modification in this Zoning Standard if the modification or other modifications
achieve greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in Article XII.
Sec. 21-29. Reserved.
Sec. 21-30. Orientation of Principal Building
   A.   Purpose. Principal Buildings with street oriented “front doors”
contribute to the sense of “neighborliness” of the Island; having a consistent
front yard orientation, reduces the possibility of accessory structures being
located inconsistent with the pattern of development.
   B.   Design standards.
      (1)   The Principal Building’s Primary Facade (front door) shall be
oriented toward a public street, excluding Principal Buildings on lots adjacent
to the ocean or marsh.
      (2)   Double Frontage Lots: the Principal Building’s Primary Facade shall
be oriented toward the ocean unless the Principal Building is replacing one
oriented otherwise.
      (3)   Corner lots: the Principal Building’s Primary Facade shall be
oriented toward the ocean or marsh, unless the Principal Building is replacing
one oriented otherwise.
   C.   Design Review Board. In determining orientation of the Principal
Building, the Design Review Board may modify this Design Standard to achieve
greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in ARTICLE XII.
Sec. 21-31. Foundation height.
   A.   Purpose. The first-floor height of new Principal Buildings are
regulated by FEMA's base flood elevation (BFE) and the town's local freeboard
requirements to minimize flood risk and protect against storm surge. However,
the overall foundation height should be limited to ensure Neighborhood
Compatibility with historic structures and non-elevated homes located
throughout the town.
   B.   Design standards.
      (1)   The bottom elevation of the Principal Building's lowest horizontal
structural member shall be no more than eight (8) feet above finished grade.
      (2)   The finished floor shall be no more than nine (9) feet four (4)
inches above finished grade.
      (3)   If the base flood elevation (BFE) conflicts with the maximum height
limitations noted above in Sections
21-31B.(1)-(2), the lowest horizontal structural member shall be no higher than
the design flood elevation (DFE) with a finished floor elevation (FFE) no
higher than two (2) feet above DFE elevation.
      (4)   The standards outlined in B.(1)-(3) do not apply to designated
historic buildings. Designated historic building must comply with the standards
set forth in Section
21-44.
(Ord. 2020-17, passed 11-17-2020) (2-20-24)
   C.   Design Review Board. The Design Review Board may grant up to a one foot
(1') modification in this Design Standard if the modification or other
modifications achieve greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in
ARTICLE XII.
   D.   CCOD Lots. (3/20/12) Structures located on lots within the CCOD Overlay
Districts shall not have their foundation heights set by reference to
Sec. 21-31, but rather shall be governed by the foundation height requirements
set forth specifically within the Overlay ordinance. See
Sec. 21-49. (3/20/12)
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 2-20-2024)
Sec. 21-32. Foundation enclosure.
   A.   Purpose. The treatment of a Principal Building’s foundation has a large
impact on the mass and scale of the structure. Foundations more open by design
diminish a structure’s mass.
   B.   Design standards.
      (1)   A Principal Building’s foundation exceeding three (3) feet in
height shall be enclosed by open lattice or slats having a minimum of one half
(1/2) inch between lattice or slats.
      (2)   Solid enclosure materials such as brick or stucco may only be used
as building materials for supporting the foundation and are limited to four (4)
feet in width and depth and occurring no more often than every eight (8) feet
on the exterior portions of the foundation.
   C.   Design Review Board. The Design Review Board may grant a modification
in this Design Standard if this or other modifications achieve greater
Neighborhood Compatibility as described in ARTICLE XII, except where National
Flood Insurance Program regulations prohibit.
Sec. 21-33. Deleted
Sec. 21-34. Site lighting.
   A.   Purpose. Highly illuminated structures on lots are not compatible with
the character of Sullivan’s Island and encroach upon the enjoyment of the night
skies and beaches.
   B.   Design standards
      (1)   A Principal Building’s exterior site lighting shall be arranged to
prevent glare on adjoining properties, in the public right-of-way, on the
Recreation and Conservation Area District, or any other area of the beach or
marsh.
      (2)   A Principal Building’s exterior site lighting shall be designed and
arranged to prevent the light source (lens and bulb) from being visible from
adjoining properties, in the public right-of-way, on the Recreation and
Conservation Area District, or any other area of the beach or marsh.
      (3)   Exterior site lighting plans shall indicate appropriate provisions
have been made to prevent “sky and neighborhood glow.”
      (4)   High pressure sodium lamps or other lamps producing unnatural color
shall be prohibited.
The following sections 21-35 through 21-32 are Design Guidelines.
Sec. 21-35. Massing ratio.
   A.   Purpose. Architecturally, there is an ideal ratio between a rectangle’s
width and its length; this aspect ratio is 5:3. As it relates to a Principal
Building, a building having a front width of fifty (50) feet would ideally have
a depth of thirty (30) feet or vice versa.
   B.   Design guideline.
      (1)   A Principal Building’s building aspect ratio of 5:3 (width to
length or vice versa) should be considered for new construction, including
additions.
   C.   Design Review Board. This is a Design Guideline not binding on the
applicant. The Design Review Board may encourage the use of this guideline for
achieving greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in Article XII.
Sec. 21-36. Eave height.
   A.   Purpose. A Principal Building’s front eave height increases the impact
of the building’s mass. As a Principal Building increases in foundation
elevation and the addition of stories, the corresponding increase in the height
of the front roof eave or parapet increases, thus creating a larger, more
massive building.
   B.   Design guideline.
      (1)   The height of the Primary Front Facade’s eaves or parapets should
not exceed thirteen (13) feet above the FEMA base flood elevation or ground
elevation whichever is greater.
      (2)   Alternative: If the Primary Front Facade has a eight (8) foot deep
porch having an eave or parapet across at least sixty percent (60%) of the
Primary Front Facade, and the porch’s eave or parapet is elevated no more than
ten (10) feet above the FEMA base flood elevation, then the height of the
Primary Front Facade’s other eaves or parapets may exceed the recommended
thirteen (13) foot height limit for that portion of the Primary Facade fronted
by the porch.
   C.   Design Review Board. This is a Design Guideline not binding on the
applicant. The Design Review Board may encourage the use of this guideline for
achieving greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in Article XII.
Sec. 21-37. Porches and decks.
   A.   Purpose. Porches are an integral part of the architecture of Sullivan’s
Island and should be strongly encouraged. However, decks are not a part of the
historical Island’s character
   B.   Design guidelines.
      (1)   At least forty percent (40%) of the Principal Building’s primary
front facade on the 1st floor should be devoted to porches having a minimum
depth of eight (8) feet.
      (2)   Square footage of porches and decks should not exceed forty percent
(40%) of Principal Building’s enclosed square footage.
      (3)   Use of decks in the front yard of the Principal Building should be
avoided.
      (4)   Decks should be limited to a maximum of twenty (20) feet in any
direction (except ground level pool decking).
      (5)   Decks should be avoided on the 1st floor Front Facade.
   C.   Design Review Board. This is a Design Guideline not binding on the
applicant. The Design Review Board may encourage the use of this guideline for
achieving greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in Article XII.
Sec. 21-38. Roof shape.
   A.   Purpose. Roof shape has an impact on how compatible a new structure is
with Principal Buildings on Sullivan’s Island; traditionally, roof shapes on
the island are fairly simple and most Principal Buildings have one (1) roof
that covers a majority of the building.
   B.   Design guideline.
      (1)   The Principal Building should have a primary roof covering at least
fifty percent (50%) of the Principal Building’s footprint.
      (2)   Complex-sloping roofs (multiple valleys) should be avoided.
      (3)   Roof slopes should not exceed forty-five (45) degrees.
      (4)   Roofs sloping less than fifteen (15) degrees are considered flat
roofs and should be concealed behind a raised parapet at least as high as the
peak of the roof.
   C.   Design Review Board. This is a Design Guideline not binding on the
applicant. The Design Review Board may encourage the use of this guideline for
achieving greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in Article XII.
Sec. 21-39. Roof decks and roof gazebos.
   A.   Purpose. Roof decks and roof gazebos increase a Principal Building’s
mass and scale and are often an incompatible design feature.
   B.   Design guideline.
      (1)   Roof decks and roof gazebos should be designed to be an integral
part of roof structure in order to diminish their impact.
   C.   Design Review Board. This is a Design Guideline not binding on the
applicant. The Design Review Board may encourage the use of this guideline for
achieving greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in Article XII.
Sec. 21-40. Front-oriented stairs.
   A.   Purpose. Principal Buildings with visible access from the front yard to
the Principal Building’s “front door” are more compatible with the Island
architecture.
   B.   Design guideline.
      (1)   A Principal Building should have stairs that provide access
directly from the Principal Building’s front facade to the front yard; other
exterior stairs should be on the side or rear of Principal Building.
   C.   Design Review Board. This is a Design Guideline not binding on the
applicant. The Design Review Board may encourage the use of this guideline for
achieving greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in Article XII.
Sec. 21-41. Landscaping.
   A.   Purpose. A significant contribution to the informality of Sullivan’s
Island is the manner in which landscape materials are used. Highly stylized
plantings and plantings used to create a strong sense of lot privacy are not
approaches that work well with the Island’s open and informal landscape
character.
   B.   Design guideline.
      (1)   Landscaping should be arranged to allow visual access through the
site by using grasses, low shrubs, and high-canopy trees.
      (2)   Use of native species and other traditional ornamental species is
encouraged.
      (3)   Front yard berms should be avoided.
   C.   Design Review Board. This is a Design Guideline not binding on the
applicant. The Design Review Board may encourage the use of this guideline for
achieving greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in Article XII.
Sec. 21-42. Driveways.
   A.   Purpose. The impact of drives and parking can be considerable in a
residential district particularly if the front yard area is developed as the
primary location for access and parking.
   B.   Design guidelines.
      (1)   Double Frontage or Corner Lots should provide vehicle access via
the rear or side of the Principal Building unless these access points are along
heavily traveled streets.
      (2)   Excessive paved parking areas, particularly within the Front Yard
should be avoided.
   C.   Design Review Board. This is a Design Guideline not binding on the
applicant. The Design Review Board may encourage the use of this guideline for
achieving greater Neighborhood Compatibility as described in Article XII.
Sec. 21-43. Preservation of historic properties.
   A.   Purpose. Sullivan's Island has a rich architectural and cultural
history as reflected in the Historic Sites Survey, 2003 that inventoried over
three hundred (300) Principal Buildings that are part of the Island's
historical roots. Increases in land values and more restrictive buildable area
standards have increased the rate at which many of these historically
significant or contributing structures have been demolished.
   B.   Exceptions to standards. If efforts are made to retain a Principal
Building because it is an historically significant or contributing building (an
historic property as described in
Sec. 21-94. Historic property designation criteria) that is compatible with
existing development, the Design Review Board may:
      (1)   Exempt the Principal Building's pre-existing nonconforming Setbacks
in order to permit additions in keeping with the Principal Building's historic
character; and,
      (2)   Permit the Principal Building to be used as accessory dwelling unit
only specified in previous section
21-20C., occupied by persons meeting the Zoning Ordinance's definition of
"family." (2-20-24)
   C.   Design Review Board. The Design Review Board shall make case-by-case
determinations to decide to what extent the above exemptions shall be granted
if the Principal Building is listed as an historic property as described in
Sec. 21-94. Historic property designation.
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 2-20-2024)
Sec. 21-44. Elevating historic buildings.
   A.   Purpose. To preserve the character of designated historic properties
and surrounding neighborhoods, an integrated design approach shall be taken
when elevating Sullivan's Island Landmarks and Traditional Island Resources.
   B.   Design Standards. Any proposed elevation or site relocation of an
historic structure shall carefully consider site conditions (site elevations
and topography), parcel access, typology of architecture, building composition
and scale, and its context with adjoining historic properties while employing
the following standards:
      (1)   Height: To minimize the height of elevating historic structures,
the finished floor elevation (FFE) shall exceed no more than three (3) feet
above finished grade.
      (2)   Composition and Scale: To maintain an historic building's visual
character and design compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood, an
elevation design plan shall be submitted to illustrate the composition and
scale of the building's principal architectural features are being maintained
and will remain proportional to the elevated foundation.
      (3)   Perspective and Orientation: Any proposed elevation or relocation
should maintain the building's historic perspective from the principal right-
of-way. All historic architectural elements should be maintained after
elevation or relocation.
      (4)   Scale Minimization and Architectural Screening: Appropriate
measures should be introduced into the site design to reduce or eliminate
negative visual effects from the elevation of a historic structure. These
elements include fencing, landscaping (foundation plantings), stair
configuration and any other site considerations noted by the Design Review
Board.
   C.   Design Review Board. Design Review Board may on a case-by-case basis,
increase the height of a historic structure by up to two (2) feet above the
standard set forth in Section 21-44 B. (1) and make other determinations of the
above design criteria to achieve greater neighborhood compatibility and to
achieve the goals and standards of the Historic Preservation Overlay District
(Article XI).

ARTICLE IV: CC-COMMUNITY COMMERCIAL DISTRICT
Sec. 21-47. Change of district name. 
   The CC-Community Commercial District (CC-District) was formerly known as the
“OC-GC General Commercial and Office Commercial District.” This change in name
neither affects the zoning boundary lines of the zoning district nor uses
previously permitted or prohibited.
Sec. 21-48. Purpose and application of CC-Community Commercial District and
CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay Districts. (3/20/12)
   A.   Purpose. It is the intent that the CC-Community Commercial District
(and portions of the associated overlay zones CCOD 1 and CCOD 2) shall be
developed and reserved for commercial business and office use for the benefit
of Sullivan’s Island residents, and to encourage well-regulated residential
land use. The regulations that apply within the district are designed to
encourage the formation and continuance of a compatible and economically
healthy environment for commercial and professional office uses that benefit
from being located in close proximity to one another. It is also the intent to
provide opportunities for residential uses to be developed at appropriate
locations within the CC-District and CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay Districts under
circumstances which will assure compatibility of neighboring commercial and
residential activities. (3/20/12)
   B.   Application of zoning and design standards and design guidelines.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specifically identified as a Design Standard or
Design Guideline, all of the standards under this Article shall be considered
as Zoning Standards.
      (2)   Within the CC District and CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay Districts, all
plans for new construction or for renovations which will change the exterior
appearance must be reviewed in advance by the Design Review Board for
neighborhood compatibility. (3/20/12)
Sec. 21-49. CC, CCOD 1 and CCOD 2. (Entire Section revised 3/20/12)
   A.   Generally. Sullivan’s Island contains lots that are, or previously
were, split zoned lots. These are located generally between Station 20 1/2 and
Station 22 1/2 that have frontage on Middle Street and I’on Avenue and Middle
Street and Jasper Boulevard. These lots are shown in Exhibit 1.1 at the end of
this section, and shall be divided into Districts and Overlay Districts to be
known as CC, CCOD 1 and CCOD 2. In instances of unsubdivided lots within the CC
District, and CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay Districts, the underlying (RS/CC) zoning
boundary line bisecting split zoned lots and shall be retained and observed
absent specific amendment by Council. (Please refer to the Official Zoning Map
for exact demarcation of zoning district boundaries). In instances where lots
are subdivided the subdivision shall occur along the pre-existing (RS/CC)
zoning boundary. In instances in which specific CCOD 1 or CCOD 2 overlay rules
conflict with the underlying base zoning (RS or CC) requirements or the general
zoning, site planning, and use regulations set forth elsewhere within this
code, then the more specific CCOD 1 and CCOD 2 Overlay provisions shall control
for such parcels. In all other instances the more general underlying base
zoning and ordinances of the Town of Sullivan’s Island shall apply.
   B.   Boundaries.
      1.   CC - The CC area may generally be described as consisting of those
lots between Station 20 1/2 and Station 22 1/2 that have frontage on Middle
Street and Ton Avenue and Middle Street and Jasper Boulevard. Some portions of
the CC area are further divided into the CCOD 1 and CCOD 2 Overlay Districts
for regulatory purposes. Town to provide revised description of CC district

the Official Zoning Map. See Exh. 1.1. Absent specific zoning amendment by
Council, each of the parcels resulting from subdivision shall retain the
respective underlying (RS or CC) base zoning designation previously associated
with the particular land area while split-zoned, subject of course to any
Overlay District modifications.
      3.   Subdivisions in the CCOD 1 and 2 Overlay Districts accomplished in
accordance with this subsection above are permitted without regard to the
minimum lot requirements specified in Sections 21-12(A)(1), 21-12(A)(3) and 21-
21. Lots subdivided in this manner shall be considered conforming lots of
record, but may not be further subdivided. Subdivision of lots in this fashion
must, however, meet all other requirements of Section 21-12 as well as all
requirements of Section 21-51 regarding utility easements and meters.
      4.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Sec. 21-19(C), in the event that
split-zoned lots are subdivided in accordance with the provisions of Section
21-49, the commercial and residential lots so created may be owned by different
owners.

ARTICLE V: RC-1 & RC-2 RECREATION AND CONSERVATION AREA DISTRICTS
Sec. 21-67. Findings and intent of RC Area Districts.
   A.   RC Area Districts’ findings of fact. The Town Council of the Town of
Sullivan’s Island finds the following:
      (1)   The RC Areas greatly contribute to the health, safety and welfare
of the residents of Sullivan’s Island and that they provide Island residents as
well as visitors, with countless hours of pleasurable activity and rest and
relaxation, which is important to the goal of public health, safety and
welfare;
      (2)   The boundaries of the RC Areas are constantly shifting over
unpredictable periods of time, in that they are composed of sand dunes and
vegetation that ceaselessly change, and that these areas are prone to flooding,
and, therefore, not suitable to development for any purpose;
      (3)   The Town of Sullivan’s Island originated as a health resort for all
the people of the State of South Carolina, and that the RC Areas are vital to
the purpose, and useful for that purpose only so long as they remain in a
natural, undeveloped condition subject to the changing tides;
      (4)   The RC Areas, left in their natural state, provide protection to
adjoining landowners and their property from the hazards of high tides and
floods caused by hurricanes, tropical storms and seasonal tides;
      (5)   The construction of the Santee-Cooper Diversion Canal and
subsequent changes in the volume of water flowing through Charleston Harbor may
cause further changes of an unknown nature upon the shoreline of Sullivan’s
Island, all of which the Town Council find to be a threat to all of the
residents and property owners of the Town; and,
      (6)   The RC Area are of a particular beauty in its natural state so as
to provide aesthetic value necessary to the public health, safety and welfare
of Island residents and visitors, and in keeping with the historic uses of
Sullivan’s Island.
   B.   Intent and uses in RC Area Districts. The RC Areas shall be preserved
in their natural state, except for the trimming, pruning and cutting of bushes
and trees as provided in herein, as areas of recreation and conservation for
the purpose of protecting the ecology, the adjoining property, and the
environment, and enhancing and protecting the safety and welfare of the Town
and its residents. Further, any activity shall be prohibited in these areas

ARTICLE XI: HP HISTORIC PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT
Sec. 21-90. Statement of purpose and findings.
   A.   The HP Historic Preservation Overlay District is designed to protect
properties that have been determined architecturally, archaeologically,
culturally or historically significant to the Town of Sullivan’s Island, South
Carolina. The Town Council finds that the historic, architectural, cultural,
and aesthetic features of the Town represent valuable resources of the Town.
Therefore, it is hereby declared that the purpose of this Article to be known
as the HP Historic Preservation Overlay District shall be as follows:
      (1)   To promote the designation of historic properties, landmarks, and
contributing structures and the creation of historic overlay districts for the
educational, cultural, economic and general welfare of the public;
      (2)   To preserve, protect and enhance those structures and area that
reflect outstanding elements of the Town’s cultural, architectural, historic or
other heritage;
      (3)   To promote the Island’s outstanding historic or architectural
structures by providing civic pride on the history and accomplishment of the
past;
      (4)   To promote the sound and orderly preservation of historic areas as
a whole, and of the individual properties therein for the education, pleasure
and enrichment of all citizens; and
      (5)   To enhance property values within historic areas.
   B.   It is the Town of Sullivan’s Island desire that by encouraging a
general harmony of style, form, proportion and material between buildings of
historic design and those of contemporary design, the Town’s historic buildings
and historic area will continue to be a distinctive aspect of the Town of
Sullivan’s Island and will serve as visible reminders of its significant
historical and cultural heritage and that of the State of South Carolina.
Sec. 21-91. HP Overlay District applicability.
   The HP Historic Preservation Overlay District is intended to be an overlay
zoning district, and the regulations imposed by such district shall be in
addition to the regulations of the underlying zoning district applicable to the
subject Lot or area. All provisions of this Article, including the definitions
contained therein shall be applicable to this district.
Sec. 21-92. Role of design review board.

and protection of historic and architecturally valuable districts and
neighborhoods by means of restriction and conditions governing the right to
erect, demolish, remove in whole or in part, or alter the exterior appearance
of all buildings or structures within the areas, may provide for appointment of
a board to oversee these responsibilities.

   The creation of a HP Overlay District shall have the following effects:
   A.   The regulations of the HP Overlay District shall be applicable to all

avoidance of the removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features,
spaces, and spatial relationships that characterize a property;

         (e)   Preserving distinctive materials, features, finishes, and
construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a
property;

or where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive
feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color, texture, and,
where possible, materials;
         (g)   Utilizing the gentlest means of chemical or physical treatments;
         (h)   Protecting and preserving the archeological resources in place,
and if disturbing, mitigation measures will be undertaken;
         (i)   Not destroying historic materials, features, and spatial
relationships that characterize the property; differentiating the new work from
the old and making it compatible with the historic materials, features, size,
scale, and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and
its environment; and,
         (j)   Undertaking new construction in such a manner that, if removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and
its environment would be unimpaired.

lot and is used for purposes customarily incidental to the main or principal
use or building and located on the same lot. Its purpose is for the enhanced
utilization of the principal use of the property but would not exist
independent of the principal use.
   An accessory use or structure is permitted on a property in conjunction with
a principal use. The size of accessory structures should bear a relation to the
size of the principal structure. Proper location of accessory structures is
important to their impact on adjacent homes and businesses.
Sec. 21-137. Accessory uses/structures permitted/restricted.
   A.   Permitted accessory uses/structures:
      (1)   Deck or patio;
      (2)   Fence;

zoning district on Sullivan’s Island, subject to restrictions provided herein.
      (2)   No accessory use and/or structure shall be permitted without the
existence of a permitted Principal Building or use on the same lot; provided
however notwithstanding the definition of the term “accessory use or structure”
contained in Section 21-203, fences are expressly allowed on lots without the
existence of a permitted Principal Building or use on the same lot. (08-15-06)
Conservation easement uses and structures may only be permitted as a principal
use (without the existence of a Principal Building) by special exception from
the Board of Zoning Appeals and through the establishment of a conservation

Sec. 21-138. Accessory structures.
   A.   Accessory structures shall
      (1)   Be located a minimum of twenty (20) feet to the rear of the
principal building's primary front facade; provided, however, that for lots

allowed in the yard area abutting the RC District or in the yard area abutting
the street. (11-20-07)
      (2)   (a)   Not exceed the greater of twenty-five percent (25%) of the

   B.   Types of Accessory Structures. For the purpose of applying the zoning
standards provided in (A) above, only the following structures are considered
an Accessory Structure: Cabana, garage, gazebo, greenhouse of personal use,

having a roof. (11-20-07)
(Ord. 2023-07, passed 2-20-2024)
Sec. 21-139. Fence regulations.
   Intent: A significant contribution to the informality of Sullivan’s Island
is the manner in which fences are used. Tall privacy fences that obstruct views
to create a strong sense of lot privacy are incompatible with the Island’s
informal character.
   A.   Defining a fence. A fence is any created unroofed barrier that blocks
or impedes the flow of people or animals; a fence may be a wall or other
structure that prohibits physical or visual access across a lot, but does not
include vegetation.
   B.   All fences.
      (1)   No fence shall exceed five (5) feet in height in any district
except as provided for in the CC-Community Commercial District.
      (2)   All fences shall be constructed of wood or metal or manufactured
materials that appear to be wood, or wood/wire materials; chain-link fences are
prohibited. New fence products may be allowed, subject to approval by the
Design Review Board. (12-18-12)
      (2)   All fences shall be at least twenty-five percent (25%) open across
the entire plane of the fence.
      (3)   Fences may employ the use of pillars or short runs of solid areas
as an entry feature; however, the total length of these features shall not
exceed sixteen (16) feet.
      (4)   Fences located forward of the Principal Building shall be limited
to four (4) feet in height.
      (5)   Fences located to the side of a Principal Building shall be limited
to four (4) feet in height if within ten (10) feet of a street right-of-way or
public access to the beach.
      (6)   Fences located to the side or rear of a Principal Building, if not
within ten (10) feet of a street right-of-way or public access to the beach,
shall be limited to five (5) feet in height.
   C.   Fences adjacent to RC-Districts.
      (1)   No fence shall be located in the RC-1 or RC-2 Districts.
      (2)   No fence shall be located along the boundary adjoining the RC-1 or
RC-2 Districts that exceeds five (5) feet in height.
   D.   Fences in the CC-Community Commercial Districts. Solid fences not
exceeding eight (8) feet in height may be located along any lot line boundary
dividing the CC-Community Commercial and the RS-Residential District.
   E.   Fences around pools. All fences surrounding pools shall be four (4)
feet in height, and be in compliance with all other applicable ordinances and
regulations of the Town of Sullivan’s Island.
   F.   Visibility standards. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to
modify the requirements of visibility at street intersections as specified
within ARTICLE II. Sec. 21-14 of this Ordinance.
   G.   Nonconforming status of existing fences. Any fence existing as of the
ratification of this Zoning Ordinance that does not conform to the fence
standards contained herein shall be considered a legal, Nonconforming
Structure. If such fence is destroyed and/or damaged beyond fifty percent (50%)
of its value (including falling into a state of disrepair due to lack of
maintenance), such fence shall be replaced in a manner that conforms to the
standards of this Zoning Ordinance.
Sec. 21-140. Historic structures.
   A.   Historic structures as accessory dwelling units in the RS-Residential
District. (5-15-07)
      Historic structures are permitted as an accessory dwelling in the RS-
Residential District subject to the following conditions: As an incentive to
preserve historic structures and avoid their demolition, a second dwelling may
be constructed on the same lot as an historic structure, and the historic
structure may be used as an accessory dwelling, when all of the following
conditions are met:
      1.   Prior use shall have been used as a dwelling; and
      2.   The size of the historic structure is less than twelve hundred
(1200) square feet of heated space at the time of its designation as historic
and is listed as an historic property as described in Section
21-94 Historic Property Designation Criteria; provided, however, that a
structure reduced to less than 1200 square feet of heated space after its
designation as historic may qualify for special exception approval for an
additional dwelling on the same lot, but only if the Design Review Board review
determines and specifies in findings, that: (5-15-07)
         a.   Special circumstances justify such reduction in square feet based
on the criteria listed in Section
21-94D.(1)-(8); and (5-15-07)
         b.   The portions to be removed from the historic property were added
less than 50 years ago and/or obscured an earlier feature of the historic house
which contributed substantially to the most important elements of its historic
character, definition and integrity. Examples of the latter instance include
the removal of an enclosure of a porch when the open porch has been
characteristic of a particular type of Island structure, or removal of an
addition which covered a distinctive feature of the structure that is shared by
neighboring structures. (5-15-07)
      3.   In the event the historic structure does not meet current FEMA
elevation requirements, the Design Review Board finds that bringing it into
compliance would significantly impair the historic and architectural character
of the structure; and
      4.   In the event the historic structure meets current FEMA elevations
requirements, the Design Review Board finds that there is no feasible design
solution for an addition to the historic structure that would not significantly
impair the historic and architectural character of the structure; and
      5.   No separate utility service meters shall be permitted; and
      6.   The Design Review Board must find that the height, scale, mass and
placement of the second structure are appropriate to and compatible with the
lot on which it is sited, the character of the historic structure and
surrounding neighborhood. When necessary to achieve such appropriateness and
compatibility, the Design Review Board may impose stricter limits on height,
setback, size and coverage than those of the zoning standards; and
      7.   Permission to build a second structure and to use the historic
structure as an accessory dwelling is approved as a special exception by the
Board of Zoning Appeals; and
      8.   The following conditions as covenants running with the property
shall be placed on the real estate title to the property by the owner of the
lot by recording deed restrictions for the benefit of the Town of Sullivan's
Island on the owner(s) title and recording the same in the RMC office for
Charleston County before a building permit is issued:
         (i)   The lot shall remain in single ownership; more specifically,
regardless of the type of ownership every owner, member, partner, shareholder,
or unit owner, must have the same percentage of ownership in the historic
structure as in any additional structure(s); and
         (ii)   Every owner, member, partner, shareholder or unit owner must
have the same amount of control over the use of the historic structure as over
any additional structure(s); and
      9.   If the historic structure used as an accessory dwelling is damaged
or destroyed, by natural disaster, civil strife or uncontrollable accident, by
more than fifty percent (50%) of its assessed value based on the most recent
property assessment, the structure may be repaired in accordance with its pre-
existing footprint, square footage, setbacks, and lot coverage. The Zoning
Administrator shall rely on all credible information provided by the owner and/
or available from the Town, to establish the damaged or destroyed structure's
pre-existing condition and lot location. A Certificate of Zoning Compliance and
a Building Permit shall be obtained within twelve (12) months of the date of
occurrence of such damage, and once issued, construction shall be diligently
pursued and completed within two (2) years from the date of the occurrence of
such damage. If FEMA regulations require the structure's foundation to be
elevated over fifty percent (50%) above its original elevation, the Design
Review Board shall determine whether or not the reconstruction shall be
required to meet the current Zoning Ordinance's Setback requirements. (2-20-24)
(Ord. 2018-07, passed 11-20-2018)
      10.   The historic structure used as an accessory dwelling may be used as
a long-term rental, but only so long as the principal structure is occupied by
an owner of the property as primary residence and a current business license is
held on the same property. Primary residence is defined as a dwelling where the
owner or owners reside on a permanent basis and are assessed at the four
percent (4%) assessment rate on their ad valorem property tax.
   B.   This accessory use shall be permitted if approved as a Special
Exception in the RS-Residential District under ARTICLE III.
Sec. 21-20C. and upon the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.

ARTICLE XVI: NONCONFORMITIES
Sec. 21-149. General.
   A.   Scope. The regulations of this Article govern “nonconformities” which
are uses, structures, lots, signs and other situations that came into existence
legally but that do not conform to one or more requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance. These are referred to in this Zoning Ordinance as “nonconformities.”
   B.   Authority to Continue. Increase Prohibited. Any nonconformity that came
into existence lawfully and continues to be a lawful use at the time of
adoption of this Ordinance or that becomes nonconforming upon the adoption of
any amendment to this Zoning Ordinance may be continued in accordance with the
provisions of this Article. The extent, degree, size, and frequency of any
nonconformity shall not be increased in any manner.
   C.   Intent. The regulations of this Article are intended to:
      (1)   Recognize the interests of landowners in continuing to use their
property;
      (2)   Promote reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings; and
      (3)   Prohibit the expansion of nonconformities.
   D.   Reserved.
   E.   Determination of nonconformity status. The burden of proving that
nonconformity existed prior to the adoption of this Ordinance or subsequent
amendments rests with the subject landowner.
   F.   Repairs and maintenance. 
      (1)   Incidental repairs and normal maintenance necessary to keep a
Nonconforming Structure in sound condition are permitted unless such repairs
are otherwise expressly prohibited by this Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   Nothing in this Article will be construed to prevent Structures
from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe condition, in
accordance with an official order of a public official.
   G.   Change of tenancy or ownership. Nonconformity status runs with the land
and is not affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management.
   H.   Historic buildings. Buildings designated as historic through the
process set forth in the HP Historic Preservation Overlay District, ARTICLE XI
shall be considered conforming to this Ordinance as hereinafter provided. This
conforming status shall only apply to height, setback, yard, area and other
dimensional requirements as found by the Design Review Board to be of historic
significance in the designation process. Such finding shall supersede any
conflicting standard set forth in the zoning district in which the building is
located and shall be applied to the building and the site in making future
determinations of conformity as to the existing building or any changes
consistent with an approved Certificate of Appropriateness (see Historic
Preservation Overlay District, Article XI). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, alteration or removal of architectural features and/or
historic fabric considered instrumental in the original designation by the
Design Review Board may, at the option of the Design Review Board, result in
the loss of historic designation and conforming status.

   C.   Moving. A Nonconforming Use shall not be moved in whole or in part to
another location on the lot unless the movement or relocation eliminates or
decreases the extent of nonconformity. When moving or elevating a nonconforming
use to meet FEMA compliance, said moving does not constitute an increasing in
the degree of nonconformity, however, it will still require compliance with
Sections 21-149 and 21-150.
   D.   Damage or destruction of a nonconforming use.
      (1)   When a building or structure containing a Nonconforming Use is
damaged by intent or by neglect, not caused by natural disaster, civil strife

status shall be lost and any subsequent use of the property shall comply with
the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
   F.   Two or more Principal Buildings on one lot. In the event that two or
more Principal Buildings occupy a single lot, said occupancy shall constitute a
nonconforming use. The use of one of the Principal Buildings shall be
conforming and the other(s) shall be nonconforming:
      (1)   If a request to improve the property is received, or a request for
a zoning statement is received, the following procedure will be used. The use
of the Principal Building with the greatest livable square footage, including
porches, shall be a conforming use and the other Principal Building a
nonconforming use.
      (2)   The designation of conforming and nonconforming use of the
Principal Buildings shall be recorded on the Certificate of Occupancy, or a
zoning statement issued by the Zoning Administrator which is to be maintained
on file in the Town Hall.

      (1)   Structural alterations, including enlargements, are permitted if
the structural alteration does not increase the extent of nonconformity.
      (2)   When a structure is nonconforming because it encroaches into a
required Side or Rear Yard Setback, this provision shall be interpreted as
allowing other portions of the structure to be expanded out to the extent of
the existing encroachment provided the expansion does not exceed the height of
the existing structure and does not extend the linear distance of the
encroachment by more than fifty percent (50%) of the existing nonconforming
structure. No greater encroachment into a required setback shall be permitted.
      (3)   When a structure is nonconforming because it encroaches into a
required Front Yard Setback, this provision shall be interpreted as prohibiting
other portions of the structure from being expanded out to the extent of the
existing encroachment.
   C.   Moving. A Nonconforming Structure may be moved in whole or in part to
another location only if the movement or relocation decreases or eliminates the
nonconformity. When moving or elevating a nonconforming structure to meet FEMA
compliance, said moving does not constitute an increasing in the degree of the
nonconformity, however, said moving will still require conformance with
Sections
21-149 through
21-151.
   D.   Damage or destruction of a nonconforming structure.
      (1)   When a Nonconforming Structure is damaged or destroyed by natural

footage, setbacks, and lot coverage. The Zoning Administrator shall rely on all
credible information provided by the owner and/or available from the Town, to
establish the damaged or destroyed structure’s pre-existing condition and lot
location. A Certificate of Zoning Compliance and a Building Permit shall be
obtained within twelve (12) months of the date of occurrence of such damage,
and once issued, construction shall be diligently pursued and completed within
two (2)) years from the date of the occurrence of such damage. If FEMA
regulations require the structure’s foundation to be elevated over fifty
percent (50%) above its original elevation, the Design Review Board shall
determine whether or not the reconstruction shall be required to meet the
current Zoning Ordinance’s Setback requirements.
      (2)   When a Nonconforming Structure is damaged by intent or by neglect,
by more than fifty percent (50%) of its assessed value based on the most recent
property assessment, the structure shall be restored in conformity with the
Zoning Ordinance in effect at the time a building permit is issued.
      (3)   When a Nonconforming Structure is damaged by less than fifty
percent (50%) of its assessed value based on the most recent property
assessment, the structure may be reconstructed in accordance with its
preexisting footprint, height, square footage, setbacks, and lot coverage. The
Zoning Administrator shall rely on all credible information provided by the
owner and/or available from the Town, to establish the damaged structure’s pre-
existing condition and lot location. A Certificate of Zoning Compliance and a
Building Permit shall be obtained within twelve (12) months of the date of
occurrence of such damage, and once issued, construction shall be diligently
pursued and completed within two (2) years from the date of the occurrence of
such damage. If FEMA regulations require the structure’s foundation to be
elevated over fifty percent (50%) above its original elevation, the Design
Review Board shall determine whether or not the reconstruction shall be
required to meet the current Zoning Ordinance’s Setback requirements.
   E.   Abandonment of a nonconforming structure.

detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and the granting of the
variance will not harm the character of the district.
