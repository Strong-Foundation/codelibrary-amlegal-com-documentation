CHARTER
Editor's note:
   In 1975, the South Carolina Legislature enacted into law Act 283, which has
become known as the Home Rule Act. The Act revised Article VIII (Local
Government) of the South Carolina Constitution.
   The municipalities of this state were required to adopt by ordinance one of
three prescribed forms of local government: the Mayor-Council form, the Council
form, or the Council-Manager form. The form adopted was required to be ". . .
the form most nearly corresponding to the form in effect in the particular
municipality on March 1, 1974, as determined by the municipal governing body."
(S.C. Code 5-5-10) The Town Council adopted the Council-Manager form of
government. Statutory authority for this form of government is found at S.C.
Code Title 5, Chapter 13.
   On November 25, 1978, the Secretary of State issued a Certificate of
Incorporation to the Town of Kingstree, with all the "privileges, powers and
immunities, and subject to the limitations prescribed in Act No. 283 of 1975."
The Certificate of Incorporation supersedes all charters formerly issued. A
copy of the Certificate is available for public inspection at town offices
during regular town business hours.
   Prior to the 1978 Certificate of Incorporation, the Town of Kingstree was
granted a charter under Act No. 4865 of 1866, and also issued a charter on
September 27, 1905.

The town shall be responsible for the printing, distributing, monitoring and
auditing of the ordinance summons to be used by the town.
   (B)   The uniform ordinance summons may not be used to perform a custodial
arrest. The uniform ordinance summons may not be used to enforce any municipal
ordinance which regulates the use of motor vehicles on the public roads of the
State of South Carolina.
   (C)   (1)   The summons must cite only one violation per summons and must
contain at least the following information:
         (a)   Name and address of person or entity charged;
         (b)   Name and title of issuing officer;
         (c)   Time, date and location of the hearing;
         (d)   A description of the ordinance the person or entity is charged

   (D)   Service of a uniform ordinance summons vests the town’s smunicipal
court with jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the charge for which the uniform
ordinance summons was issued and served.
   (E)   Any municipal law enforcement officer or code enforcement officer who
serves a uniform ordinance summons must allow the person served to proceed
without first having to post bond or to appear before a magistrate or municipal
judge. Acceptance of a uniform ordinance summons constitutes a person's
recognizance to comply with the terms of the summons. Any person who fails to
appear before the municipal court as required by a uniform ordinance summons,
without first having posted such bond as may be required or without having been
granted a continuance by the municipal court, is guilty of a misdemeanor and,
upon conviction must be fined not more than $200 nor imprisoned for more than
30 days. The town police officer processing an arrest made pursuant to this
section must furnish such information to the state law enforcement division as
is required by S.C. Code Title 23, Chapter 3 as amended.
   (F)   The attached form is hereby adopted as the town’s uniform ordinance
summons.
   (G)   The municipal court shall maintain a record of all cases heard which
are charged on an ordinance summons.
   (H)   This section shall not prohibit the town from enforcing ordinances by
any means otherwise authorized by law.
(Ord. 2014-08, passed 8-18-14)
§ 10.99 GENERAL PENALTY.

order promulgated by any agency or officer thereof under authority duly vested
in him or it, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or misdemeanor, or the doing of any act is required, where no specific

provisions of this code, ordinance, resolution, rule, regulation or order shall
be punished by a fine not exceeding $500 or by imprisonment for a period not
exceeding 30 days, or both; provided, however, that no penalty shall exceed the
penalty provided by state law for similar offenses. Each day any violation of
this code or any ordinance, rule or regulation shall continue shall constitute
a separate offense.

determining the normal six-month average.
   (C)   A water user may have no more than one adjustment, to no more than one
bill, on an account during any 12-month period.
   (D)   Adjustments made to any account by the town due to a billing error by
the town, are not considered as an individual adjustment. More than one
adjustment may be considered if it is found to be an unusual occurrence and is
found to warrant an adjustment and is approved by the Town Manager.
   (E)   A "leak" is defined as the loss of water due to broken or burst water
lines/pipes, an improperly functioning toilet fixture or a damaged valve on a
hot water heater. Outside spigots left on will not be considered a leak and,
therefore, no adjustment will be made on that account. The responsibility of
the town for leak repairs ends at the discharge point of the water meter. Any
leaks and repairs thereof beyond the discharge point of the water meter are the
responsibility of the customer. All water passing through the meter is the
responsibility of the customer.
   (F)   Customers requesting such adjustments must have had a valid leak and
show proof of repair.
   (G)   The customer's bill will be adjusted down to the average of the water
and sewer charges on the high bill and the previous two bills. Trash and any
other fees will not be included in the adjustment and will be due as presented
on each bill.

or corporation shall be subject to said penalty until such offender shall have

§ 54.001 PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for users of the publicly
owned treatment works for the town and enables the town to comply with all
applicable state and federal laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United
States Code [U.S.C.] § 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment Regulations
(Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations [CFR] Part 403). The objectives of
this chapter are:
      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned
treatment works that will interfere with its operation;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the publicly owned
treatment works that will pass through the publicly owned treatment works,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with
the publicly owned treatment works;
      (3)   To protect both publicly owned treatment works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the publicly owned treatment works;
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the publicly owned treatment works;
and
      (6)   To enable the town to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other federal or state laws to which the publicly owned treatment works is
subject.
   (B)    This chapter shall apply to all users of the publicly owned treatment
works. The chapter authorizes the issuance of individual wastewater discharge
permits; the issuance of general permits for wastewater discharge; provides for
monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes administrative
review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the setting of
fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the program
established herein.

constructed at a site at which no other source is located; or
         (b)   The building, structure, facility, or installation totally
replaces the process or production equipment that causes the discharge of
pollutants at an existing source; or
         (c)   The production or wastewater generating processes of the
building, structure, facility, or installation are substantially independent of
an existing source at the same site. In determining whether these are
substantially independent, factors such as the extent to which the new facility
is integrated with the existing plant, and the extent to which the new facility
is engaged in the same general type of activity as the existing source, should
be considered.

of facilities or equipment which are intended to be used in its operation
within a reasonable time. Options to purchase or contracts which can be
terminated or modified without substantial loss, and contracts for feasibility,
engineering, and design studies do not constitute a contractual obligation
under this division.
   NONCONTACT COOLING WATER. Water used for cooling that does not come into
direct contact with any raw material, intermediate product, waste product, or
finished product.
   PASS THROUGH. A discharge which exits the POTW into waters of the United
States in quantities or concentrations which, alone or in conjunction with a
discharge or discharges from other sources, is a cause of a violation of any
requirement of the town's NPDES permit, including an increase in the magnitude
or duration of a violation.
   PERSON. Any individual, partnership, copartnership, firm, company,
corporation, association, joint stock company, trust, estate, governmental

   PRETREATMENT. The reduction of the amount of pollutants, the elimination of
pollutants, or the alteration of the nature of pollutant properties in
wastewater prior to, or in lieu of, introducing such pollutants into the POTW.
This reduction or alteration can be obtained by physical, chemical, or
biological processes; by process changes; or by other means, except by diluting
the concentration of the pollutants unless allowed by an applicable
pretreatment standard.

prohibitions against the discharge of certain substances; these prohibitions
appear in §
54.010.
   PUBLICLY OWNED TREATMENT WORKS or POTW. A treatment works, as defined by §
212 of the Act (33 U.S.C. section 1292), which is owned by the town. This
definition includes any devices or systems used in the collection, storage,
treatment, recycling, and reclamation of sewage or industrial wastes of a
liquid nature and any conveyances, which convey wastewater to a treatment
plant.
   SEPTIC TANK WASTE. Any sewage from holding tanks such as vessels, chemical
toilets, campers, trailers, and septic tanks.
   SEWAGE. Human excrement and gray water (household showers, dishwashing
operations, etc.).
   SIGNIFICANT INDUSTRIAL USER (SIU).
      Except as provided in divisions (3) and (4) of this definition, a

wastewater to the POTW (excluding sanitary, noncontact cooling and boiler
blowdown wastewater);
         (b)   Contributes a process wastestream which makes up 5% or more of
the average dry weather hydraulic or organic capacity of the POTW treatment
plant; or
         (c)   Is designated as such by the town on the basis that it has a
reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW's operation or for
violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
      (3)   The town may determine that an industrial user subject to
categorical pretreatment standards is a non-significant categorical industrial
user rather than a significant industrial user on a finding that the industrial
user never discharges more than 100 gallons per day (gpd) of total categorical
wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and boiler blowdown
wastewater, unless specifically included in the pretreatment standard) and the
following conditions are met:
         (a)   The industrial user, prior to town's finding, has consistently
complied with all applicable categorical pretreatment standards and
requirements;
         (b)   The industrial user annually submits the certification statement
required in §

wastewater.
      (4)   Upon a finding that a user meeting the criteria in division (2) of
this part has no reasonable potential for adversely affecting the POTW’s
operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement, the town
may at any time, on its own initiative or in response to a petition received
from an industrial user, and in accordance with procedures in 40 CFR 403-8(f)
(6), determine that such user should not be considered a significant industrial
user.
   SLUG LOAD or SLUG DISCHARGE. Any discharge at a flow rate or concentration,
which could cause a violation of the prohibited discharge standards in §
54.010. A slug discharge is any discharge of a non-routine, episodic nature,

GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS
§ 54.010 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   (A)   General prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through
or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW
whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any
other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
   (B)   Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:

§ 54.011 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Users must comply with the categorical pretreatment standards found at
40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471.
   (B)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Manager may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with
divisions (F) and (G).
   (C)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Manager may
convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed either as mass of
pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes of
calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual industrial users.
   (D)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Manager shall
impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e).
   (E)   A CIU may obtain a net/gross adjustment to a categorical pretreatment
standard in accordance with the following divisions of this division (E).
      (1)   Categorical pretreatment standards may be adjusted to reflect the
presence of pollutants in the industrial user's intake water in accordance with
this section. Any industrial user wishing to obtain credit for intake
pollutants must make application to the town. Upon request of the industrial
user, the applicable standard will be calculated on a "net" basis (i.e.,
adjusted to reflect credit for pollutants in the intake water) if the
requirements of division (2) of this division are met.
      (2)   Criteria.
         (a)   Either:
            1.   The applicable categorical pretreatment standards contained in
40 CFR Subchapter N specifically provide that they shall be applied on a net
basis; or
            2.   The industrial user demonstrates that the control system it
proposes or uses to meet applicable categorical pretreatment standards would,
if properly installed and operated, meet the standards in the absence of
pollutants in the intake waters.
         (b)   Credit for generic pollutants such as biochemical oxygen demand
(BOD), total suspended solids (TSS), and oil and grease should not be granted
unless the industrial user demonstrates that the constituents of the generic
measure in the user's effluent are substantially similar to the constituents of
the generic measure in the intake water or unless appropriate additional limits
are placed on process water pollutants either at the outfall or elsewhere.
         (c)   Credit shall be granted only to the extent necessary to meet the
applicable categorical pretreatment standard(s), up to a maximum value equal to
the influent value. Additional monitoring may be necessary to determine
eligibility for credits and compliance with standard(s) adjusted under this
section.
         (d)   Credit shall be granted only if the user demonstrates that the
intake water is drawn from the same body of water as that into which the POTW
discharges. The town may waive this requirement if it finds that no
environmental degradation will result.
   (F)   When a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the town convert
the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Manager.
The town may establish equivalent mass limits only if the industrial user meets
all the conditions set forth in divisions (l)(a) through (l)(e) below.
      (1)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
         (a)   Employ, or demonstrate that it will employ, water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its individual wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility's
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility's long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         (d)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         (e)   Have consistently complied with all applicable categorical
pretreatment standards during the period prior to the industrial user's request
for equivalent mass limits.
      (2)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         (a)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         (b)   Continue to record the facility's flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         (c)   Continue to record the facility's production rates and notify
the Manager whenever production rates are expected to vary by more than 20%
from its baseline production rates determined in division (G)(l)(c) of this
section. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Manager will
reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (d)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to division (F)(l)(a) of
this section so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      (3)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Manager:
         (a)   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable categorical pretreatment standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         (b)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (c)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
individual wastewater discharge permit terms if the industrial user's actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to §
54.015. The industrial user must also be in compliance with §
54.132 regarding the prohibition of bypass.
   (G)   The Manager may convert the mass limits of the categorical
pretreatment standards of 40 CFR Parts 414, 419, and 455 to concentration
limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to individual
industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Manager.
   (H)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
categorical standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
   (I)   Many categorical pretreatment standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
   (J)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall
notify the Manager within two business days after the user has a reasonable
basis to know that the production level will significantly change within the
next calendar month. Any user not notifying the Manager of such anticipated
change will be required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit
that were based on the original estimate of the long term average production
rate.

54.075.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.068 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
[Note: All SIUs are required to submit periodic compliance reports even if they
have been designated a non-significant categorical industrial user under
division (C) of this section.]
   (A)   Except as specified in division (C) of this section, all significant
industrial users must, at a frequency determined by the Manager submit no less
than twice per year (June and December) reports indicating the nature,
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment
standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the
reporting period. In cases where the pretreatment standard requires compliance
with a best management practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the
user must submit documentation required by the Manager or the pretreatment
standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
   (B)   The town may authorize an industrial user subject to a categorical
pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a
categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user, [see 40 CFR 403.12(e)(2)]. This
authorization is subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater;
      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit. See §
54.034(A)(8);
      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility's
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes;
      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with §
54.004, and include the certification statement in §
54.077(A) (40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)(ii));
      (5)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 13
6 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis;
      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Manager must be included
as a condition in the user's permit. The reasons supporting the waiver and any
information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Manager for three years after expiration of the waiver;
      (7)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user's
permit by the Manager, the industrial user must certify on each report with the
statement in §
54.077(C), that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream
due to activities of the industrial user;
      (8)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user's operations,
the user must immediately: comply with the monitoring requirements of division
(A) of this section, or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by
the Manager, and notify the Manager; and
      (9)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in categorical pretreatment standards, except as
otherwise specified in the categorical pretreatment standard.
   (C)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
54.077(A).
   (D)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (E)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Manager, using the procedures prescribed in §
54.075, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.069 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Each user must notify the Manager of any significant changes to the
user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of
its wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
   (B)   The Manager may require the user to submit such information as may be
deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of
a wastewater discharge permit application under §
54.034.
   (C)   The Manager may issue an individual wastewater discharge permit under
§
54.056 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
54.053 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.070 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the Manager of the incident. This notification shall include the
location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known,
and corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Manager, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s)
of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage, or other liability which might be incurred as a result
of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or
property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties,
or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) of this section. Employers shall ensure
that all employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of
the emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Manager
immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the potential for a slug
discharge.

§ 54.072 NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify
the Manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall
also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the Manager within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation.
Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the town performs sampling
at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the town performs sampling
at the user between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the
time when the user or the town receives the results of this sampling, or if the
town has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.073 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments
thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques
for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136
sampling and analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in
question, sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated
analytical methods or any other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the Manager or other parties approved by EPA.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.074 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
   (B)   Except as indicated in divisions (C) and (D) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Manager. Where time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the town, the samples must be representative of the
discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in 40
CFR Part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected
during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for
cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the
laboratory or in the field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the
samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite samples for other
parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as documented in approved
EPA methodologies may be authorized by the town, as appropriate. In addition,
grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
   (C)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (D)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §§
54.065 and
54.067 (40 CFR 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be used
for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities for which historical sampling data are available, the Manager may
authorize a lower minimum. For the reports required by §
54.068 (40 CFR 403.12(e) and 403.12(h)), the industrial user is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

§ 54.078 NOTIFICATION OF HAZARDOUS WASTE DISCHARGE.
   (A)   Each industrial user shall notify the Manager of the POTW, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste
authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance, which, if
otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such
notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40
CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch, or other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall
also contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the industrial user. An identification of the
hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place within 180 days of the effective date of this
division (A). Industrial users who commence discharging after the effective
date of this division (A) shall provide the notification no later than 180 days
after the discharge of the listed or characteristic hazardous waste. Any
notification under this division (A) needs to be submitted only once for each
hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must
be submitted under 40 CFR 403.12(j). The notification requirement in this
section does not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring
requirements of 40 CFR 403.12(b), (d), and (e).
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of the division (A) above
during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of
hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of non-
acute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute
hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a
one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the industrial user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the
POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days
of the effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under division (A) above, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.

§ 54.098 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing
that the user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does
not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related
appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may
contain other requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement,
nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation,
including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be
a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.099 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or
that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the Manager may issue an
order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and
directing the user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.100 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge
permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, the Manager may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $2,000.
Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of
monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed
for each day during the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 1.5% of the unpaid balance, and interest
shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5% per month. A lien against the user's
property shall be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within 30 days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
Manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The Manager may add the costs of preparing administrative
enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12; Ord. 2025-01, passed 3-17-25)
§ 54.101 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal
notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Manager
may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity
to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or
which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
   (B)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Manager may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Manager may allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Manager
that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings
in §
54.102 are initiated against the user.
   (C)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Manager prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under §§
54.097 or §
54.102.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.102 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   (A)   In addition to the provisions in §
54.055, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
      (1)   Violation of individual wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose
of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
54.010 through
54.015.
   (B)   Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its
discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
54.097 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Manager shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 54.110 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the Manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,

order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Manager may petition the South Carolina Circuit Court -3rd Circuit through the
Town's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
individual wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by
this chapter on activities of the user. The Manager may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user.

case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall
accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
   (B)   The Manager may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and
other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and
monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred by the town.
   (C)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other factor
as justice requires.

user has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 54.130 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with categorical
pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused by
operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section, are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Manager
within 24-hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided
orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.131 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
54.010(A) of this chapter or the specific prohibitions in §
54.010(B)(3) through (17) of this chapter if it can prove that it did not know,
or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with
discharges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and
that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the town was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 4--12)
§ 54.132 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section the following terms and phrases shall
have the meanings hereinafter designated:
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   Bypass notifications.
      (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Manager, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Manager of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24-hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The Manager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24-hours.
   (D)   Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Manager may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Manager may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Manager determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

      (1)   A person who erects, establishes, continues, maintains, uses, owns,

responsible for the conduct of the residents, invitees or guests that generate,
enable or contribute to the requirement of frequent or intensive law
enforcement action. When conduct is identified by law enforcement as
generating, enabling or contributing to the disproportionate need for frequent
or intensive law enforcement action, notice shall be provided to the owner,
lessee or renter. Such notice shall identify with particularity the conduct
that is generating, enabling or contributing to the frequency and intensity of

conflicts with buildings and infrastructure, to improve tree structure, form,
and health, and to remove dead, diseased, dying and otherwise objectionable
branches over two inches in diameter. Tree pruning shall be done in accordance
with current professional standards (ANSI A300). The following clearances shall
be maintained through routine pruning:
         (a)   Seven feet above sidewalks and walkways;
         (b)   Twelve feet above residential streets; and
         (c)   Sixteen feet above major thoroughfares

wood chips, pine straw, or other good quality organic mulch during the
establishment period-the first three years after planting. Mulch shall be
applied in an even layer, three to four inches deep, out to the dripline of the
tree. All trees shall be mulched where practical, as far out towards the
dripline as possible. Mulch shall be kept at least six inches away from the
tree trunk to avoid creating favorable conditions for insect, disease, or
rodent infestation.
   (C)   Fertilization. Fertilization may be done where and when a soil or
foliar test indicates a nutrient deficiency. Fertilization shall be done
according to current professional standards (ANSI A300).
   (D)   Watering. Watering shall be done for all newly planted trees during
the months of May through October at least once per week during periods of
drought or low rainfall, up to an amount of one inch of water per week.
   (E)   Pest control. When public trees are found to have insect or disease
infestations that pose a major threat to surrounding trees, they shall be
effectively treated or removed by the town. Spraying of insecticides,
fungicides, or herbicides shall be done only for the control of specific
insects, diseases, or weeds with the proper materials in the necessary strength
and applied at the proper time to obtain the desired control. General spraying
for insect, disease, and weed control shall be discouraged. Any pesticide
application shall be performed or supervised by personnel with a current SC

will result in severe disfigurement of the tree or crown reduction below 50%;
      (6)   The tree is in a restricted growing space, is in conflict with the
surrounding hardscape or infrastructure, and the conflict cannot be resolved;
and
      (7)   Tree is in conflict with overhead utility lines and proper pruning
cannot adequately reduce the conflict without severely disfiguring the tree.
   (D)   Replacement of trees removed. All trees removed on public property
shall be replaced within one year after removal. If the site where the tree was
removed is not suitable for replanting, a tree shall be planted in a suitable
location as close as possible to the removal location. If there is no suitable
location close to the removal location, then a tree shall be planted in a
planned planting location in the vicinity.
   (E)   Stump removal. All stumps of street and park trees shall be removed to
a depth of eight inches below the surface of the ground so that the top of the
stump shall not project above the surface of the ground. Sod, grass seed, or
other satisfactory ground cover shall be placed and maintained on the site of
the removed or ground stump. Stumps shall not be ground in cemeteries. The Tree
Board may preserve stumps with historic significance.
   (F)   Private commercial trees.  The town shall have the right to remove or
cause to be removed trees on private commercial property that are at a high

surrounding trees, or are otherwise nuisances that threaten the health and
safety of the public.
   (G)   Written notice. Owners of premises (commercial property) where a
nuisance tree is located shall be served a written notice from the Zoning
Administrator either in person or by registered mail that action must be taken
to abate the nuisance within 30 days. If after 30 days the nuisance has not
been abated, the town shall have the right to remove the tree or cause the tree
to be removed, and charge the property owner with the cost of removal and all
other associated costs.
(Ord. 2014-01, passed 3-17-14)
§ 95.17 DAMAGE TO PUBLIC TREES.
   (A)   No person shall damage, destroy, remove, or otherwise harm a tree
located on public property without a tree removal permit or the written consent
of the Zoning Administrator. The town shall require compensation for the damage
or destruction of a public tree equal to the appraised value of the tree prior
to the damage or the cost of repair to the tree by an approved arborist.
   (B)   Appraised tree value.  The appraised value of a tree shall be
calculated by a certified arborist based on the current edition of the Guide
for Plant Appraisal developed by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers

manufacturing principal business activity code on their federal income tax
returns.

Code.
   LICENSEE. The business, the person applying for the license on behalf of the

§ 110.03 PURPOSE AND DURATION.
   The business license required by this chapter is for the purpose of
providing such regulation as may be required for the business subject thereto
and for the purpose of raising revenue for the general fund through a privilege
tax. Except as set forth below for business licenses issued to contractors with
respect to specific construction projects, each yearly license shall be issued
for the 12-month period of May 1 to April 30. A business license issued for a
construction contract may, at the request of the licensee, be stated to expire
at the completion of the construction project; provided, any such business
license may require that the licensee file, by each April 30 during the
continuation of the construction project, a statement of compliance, including
but not limited to a revised estimate of the value of the contract. If any
revised estimate of the final value of such project exceeds the amount for
which the business license was issued, the licensee shall be required to pay a
license fee at the then-prevailing rate on the excess amount. The provisions of
this chapter and the rates herein shall remain in effect from year to year as
amended by the Council.

2021-07, passed 1-14-22)
§ 110.04 BUSINESS LICENSE TAX; REFUND.
   (A)   The required business license tax shall be paid for each business
subject hereto according to the applicable rate classification on or before the
due date of the April 30 in each year, except for those businesses in Rate
Class 8 for which a different due date is specified. Late payments shall be
subject to penalties as set forth in §
110.12, except that admitted insurance companies may pay before June 1 without
penalty.
   (B)   A separate license shall be required for each place of business and
for each classification or business conducted at one place. If gross income
cannot be separated for classifications at one location, the business license
tax shall be computed on the combined gross income for the classification
requiring the highest rate. The business license tax must be computed based on
the licensee’s gross income for the calendar year preceding the due date, for
the licensee’s 12-month fiscal year preceding the due date, or on a 12-month
projected income based on the monthly average for a business in operation for
less than one year. The business license tax for a new business must be
computed on the estimated probable gross income for the balance of the license
year. A business license related to construction contract projects may be
issued on a per project basis, at the option of the taxpayer. No refund shall
be made for a business that is discontinued.
   (C)   A licensee that submits a payment greater than the amount owed may
request a refund. To be considered, a refund request must be submitted in
writing to the municipality before the June 1 immediately following the April
30 on which the payment was due and must be supported by adequate documentation
supporting the refund request. The municipality shall approve or deny the
refund request, and if approved shall issue the refund to the business, within
30 days after receipt of the request.

§ 110.05 REGISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   The owner, agent, or legal representative of every business subject to
this chapter, whether listed in the classification index or not, shall register
the business and make application for a business license on or before the due
date of each year; provided, a new business shall be required to have a
business license prior to operation within the municipality, and an annexed
business shall be required to have a business license within 30 days of the
annexation. A license for a bar (NAICS 722410) must be issued in the name of
the individual who has been issued the corresponding state alcohol, beer, or
wine permit or license and will have actual control and management of the
business.
   (B)   Application shall be on the then-current standard business license
application as established and provided by the Director of the South Carolina
Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office and shall be accompanied by all information
about the applicant, the licensee, and the business deemed appropriate to carry
out the purpose of this chapter by the license official. Applicants may be
required to submit copies of portions of state and federal income tax returns
reflecting gross receipts and gross revenue figures.
   (C)   The applicant shall certify under oath that the information given in
the application is true, that the gross income is accurately reported (or
estimated for a new business) without any unauthorized deductions, and that all
assessments, personal property taxes on business property, and other monies due
and payable to the municipality have been paid.
   (D)   The Municipality shall allow application, reporting, calculation, and
payment of business license taxes through the business license tax portal
hosted and managed by the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office,
subject to the availability and capability thereof. Any limitations in portal
availability or capability do not relieve the applicant or licensee from
existing business license or business license tax obligations.

§ 110.06 DEDUCTIONS; EXEMPTIONS; CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS.
   (A)   No deductions from gross income shall be made except income earned
outside of the municipality on which a license tax is paid by the business to
some other municipality or county and fully reported to the municipality, taxes
collected for a governmental entity, or income which cannot be included for
computation of the tax pursuant to state or federal law. Properly apportioned
income from business in interstate commerce shall be included in the
calculation of gross income and is not exempted. The applicant shall have the
burden to establish the right to exempt income by satisfactory records and
proof.
   (B)   No person shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter by
reason of the lack of an established place of business within the municipality,
unless exempted by state or federal law. The license official shall determine
the appropriate classification for each business in accordance with the latest
issue of NAICS. No person shall be exempt from this chapter by reason of the
payment of any other tax, unless exempted by state law, and no person shall be
relieved of liability for payment of any other tax or fee by reason of
application of this chapter.
   (C)   Wholesalers are exempt from business license taxes unless they
maintain warehouses or distribution establishments within the municipality. A
wholesale transaction involves a sale to an individual who will resell the
goods and includes delivery of the goods to the reseller. It does not include a
sale of goods to a user or consumer.
   (D)   A charitable organization shall be exempt from the business license
tax on its gross income unless it is deemed a business subject to a business
license tax on all or part of its gross income as provided in this section. A
charitable organization, or any affiliate of a charitable organization, that
reports income from for-profit activities or unrelated business income for
federal income tax purposes to the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed a
business subject to a business license tax on the part of its gross income from
such for-profit activities or unrelated business income.
   (E)   A charitable organization shall be deemed a business subject to a
business license tax on its total gross income if (1) any net proceeds of
operation, after necessary expenses of operation, inure to the benefit of any
individual or any entity that is not itself a charitable organization as
defined in this chapter, or (2) any net proceeds of operation, after necessary
expenses of operation, are used for a purpose other than a charitable purpose
as defined in this chapter. Excess benefits or compensation in any form beyond
fair market value to a sponsor, organizer, officer, director, trustee, or
person with ultimate control of the organization shall not be deemed a
necessary expense of operation.

§ 110.07 FALSE APPLICATION UNLAWFUL.
   It shall be unlawful for any person subject to the provisions of this
chapter to make a false application for a business license or to give or file,
or direct the giving or filing of, any false information with respect to the
license or tax required by this chapter.

§ 110.08 DISPLAY AND TRANSFER.
   (A)   All persons shall display the license issued to them on the original
form provided by the license official in a conspicuous place in the business
establishment at the address shown on the license. A transient or non-resident
shall carry the license upon his or her person or in a vehicle used in the
business readily available for inspection by any authorized agent of the
municipality.
   (B)   A change of address must be reported to the license official within
ten days after removal of the business to a new location and the license will
be valid at the new address upon written notification by the license official
and compliance with zoning and building codes. Failure to obtain the approval
of the license official for a change of address shall invalidate the license
and subject the licensee to prosecution for doing business without a license. A
business license shall not be transferable, and a transfer of controlling
interest shall be considered a termination of the old business and the
establishment of a new business requiring a new business license, based on old
business income.
(Ord. 2004-05, passed 7-19-04; Am. Ord. 2021-07, passed 1-14-22)
§ 110.09 ADMINISTRATION OF CHAPTER.
   The license official shall administer the provisions of this chapter,
collect business license taxes, issue licenses, make or initiate investigations
and audits to ensure compliance, initiate denial or suspension and revocation
procedures, report violations to the municipal attorney, assist in prosecution
of violators, produce forms, undertake reasonable procedures relating to the
administration of this chapter, and perform such other duties as may be duly
assigned.

§ 110.10 INSPECTION AND AUDITS.
   (A)   For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, the
license official or other authorized agent of the municipality is empowered to
enter upon the premises of any person subject to this chapter to make
inspections and to examine and audit books and records. It shall be unlawful
for any such person to fail or refuse to make available the necessary books and
records. In the event an audit or inspection reveals that the licensee has
filed false information, the costs of the audit shall be added to the correct
business license tax and late penalties in addition to other penalties provided
herein. Each day of failure to pay the proper amount of business license tax
shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   The license official shall have the authority to make inspections and
conduct audits of businesses to ensure compliance with this chapter. Financial
information obtained by inspections and audits shall not be deemed public
records, and the license official shall not release the amount of business
license taxes paid or the reported gross income of any person by name without
written permission of the licensee, except as authorized by this chapter, state
or federal law, or proper judicial order. Statistics compiled by
classifications are public records.

   (A)   Assessments, payments under protest, and appeals of assessment shall
be allowed and conducted by the municipality pursuant to the provisions of S.C.
Code § 6-1-410, as amended. In preparing an assessment, the license official
may examine such records of the business or any other available records as may
be appropriate and conduct such investigations and statistical surveys as the
license official may deem appropriate to assess a business license tax and
penalties as provided herein.
   (B)   The license official shall establish a uniform local procedure
consistent with S.C. Code § 6-1-410 for hearing an application for adjustment
of assessment and issuing a notice of final assessment; provided that for
particular types of business licenses, including without limitation for
business licenses issued to businesses subject to business license taxes under
Article 20, Chapter 9, Title 58, and Chapters 7 and 45, Title 38, of the South
Carolina Code, the municipality, by separate ordinance, may establish a
different procedure and may delegate one or more rights, duties, and functions
hereunder to the Municipal Association of South Carolina.

§ 110.12 DELINQUENT LICENSE FEES; PARTIAL PAYMENT.
   (A)   For non-payment of all or any part of the correct business license
tax, the license official shall impose and collect a late penalty of 5% of the
unpaid tax for each month or portion thereof after the due date until paid.
Penalties shall not be waived. If any business license tax remains unpaid for
60 days after its due date, the license official shall report it to the
municipal attorney for appropriate legal action.
   (B)   Partial payment may be accepted by the license official to toll
imposition of penalties on the portion paid; provided, however, no business
license shall be issued or renewed until the full amount of the tax due, with
penalties, has been paid.

§ 110.13 NOTICES.
   The license official may, but shall not be required to, mail written notices
that business license taxes are due. If notices are not mailed, there shall be
published a notice of the due date in a newspaper of general circulation within
the municipality three times prior to the due date in each year. Failure to
receive notice shall not constitute a defense to prosecution for failure to pay
the tax due or grounds for waiver of penalties.

engage in the unlawful sale of merchandise or prohibited goods on the business
premises and has not taken remedial measures necessary to correct such
activity; or
      (7)   The license for the business or for a similar business of the

   When the license official determines:
      (1)   A license has been mistakenly or improperly issued or issued
contrary to law;
      (2)   A licensee has breached any condition upon which the license was

      (6)   A licensee is delinquent in the payment to the municipality of any
tax or fee,
the license official may give written notice to the licensee or the person in
control of the business within the municipality by personal service or mail
that the license is suspended pending a single hearing before Council or its
designee for the purpose of determining whether the suspension should be upheld
and the license should be revoked.

provisions of state law, regulatory requirements, service burdens, tax
equalization considerations and other factors that are deemed to be sufficient
to require individually determined rates. In accordance with state law, the
municipality also may provide for reasonable subclassifications for rates,
described by an NAICS sector, subsector, or industry, that are based on
particularized considerations as needed for economic stimulus or for the
enhanced or disproportionate demands on municipal services of infrastructure.

inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.

§ 151.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health,
minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that
uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the
floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are
restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of
natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are
involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading,
dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion.
Additionally, this chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood
barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood
hazards to other lands.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health,
to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a flood area. The provisions of this chapter are intended to minimize damage
to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and
prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management
objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly
flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding.
   (C)   Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform
vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of
peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge,
prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations,
recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best
served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the
natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water
bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains,
especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful
planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs.

§ 151.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the town or by any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

potential for meeting the “Historic” structure criteria of the DOI. In order
for these structures to meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be
demonstrated and evidenced that the South Carolina Department of Archives and
History has individually determined that the structure or district meets DOI
historic structure criteria.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). Applies to all new and renewed flood
insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable
the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and
control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the
payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with State or community
floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a
building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood
damage potential. Such an area must be of flood resistant or breakaway

such as sea oats hold sand in place.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within 1 80 days of the permit
date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of
slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any  wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
building.

cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of “substantial improvement”.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.  
      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions or,
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
      (2)   Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the
improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated
with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be
utilized to determine whether SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT will occur.
   SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. Where
the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets,
utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the streets, utilities
and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced.

151.33(J), the application for a development permit within the flood hazard
area shall show:
         (a)   The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest
floor of all new and substantially improved structures; and
         (b)   If the structure will be floodproofed in accordance with the
non-residential construction requirements of §
151.41(B) the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure
will be floodproofed.
      (3)   Where base flood elevation data is not provided as set forth in §
151.04 or §
151.33(J), then the provisions in the standards for streams without estimated
base flood elevations and floodways of §
151.42 must be met.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourse. Where any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development, the application for a
development permit shall include a description of the extent of watercourse
alteration or relocation, an engineering study to demonstrate that the flood-
carrying capacity of the altered or relocated watercourse is maintained and a
map showing the location of the proposed watercourse alteration or relocation.

      (1)   Floodproofing certification.  When a structure is floodproofed, the
applicant shall provide certification from a registered, professional engineer
or architect that the non-residential, floodproofed structure meets the
floodproofing criteria in the non-residential construction requirements of §§
151.41(B) and
151.44(B).
      (2)   Certification during construction. A lowest floor elevation or
floodproofing certification is required after the lowest floor is completed. As
soon as possible after completion of the lowest floor and before any further
vertical construction commences, or floodproofing by whatever construction
means, whichever is applicable, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to
submit to the local Floodplain Administrator a certification of the elevation
of the lowest floor, or floodproofed elevation, whichever is applicable, as
built, in relation to mean sea level. Said certification shall be prepared by
or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or professional
engineer and certified by it. Any work done prior to submission of the
certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local Floodplain
Administrator shall review the floor elevation survey data submitted. The
permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted
to proceed shall correct deficiencies detected by such review. Failure to
submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be
cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.
      (3)   V-Zone certification. When a structure is located in Zones V, VE,
or VI-30, certification shall be provided from a registered professional
engineer or architect, separate from submitted plans, that new construction and
substantial improvement meets the criteria for the coastal high hazard areas
outlined in Article IV.F.5.

maintained to show that maintenance has been provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
maintained. This maintenance must consist of a comprehensive program of
periodic inspections, and routine channel clearing and dredging, or other
related functions. The assurance shall consist of a description of maintenance
activities, frequency of performance, and the local official responsible for
maintenance performance. Records shall be kept on file for FEMA inspection.
      (3)   If the proposed project will modify the configuration of the
watercourse and/or floodway or change the base flood elevations for which a
detailed Flood Insurance Study has been developed, §
151.41(G) shall apply.
      (4)   Within 60 days of completion of an alteration of a watercourse,
referenced in the certification requirements of §
151.32(B)(4), the applicant shall submit as-built certification, by a
registered professional engineer, to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

      (2)   Obtain the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to
which the new or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in
accordance with the floodproofing certification outlined in §
151.32(B)(1).
      (3)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect in
accordance with the non-residential construction requirements outlined in §
151.41(B).
      (4)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with
the provisions contained in the coastal high hazard area requirements outlined
in Article IV.F.5.
   (H)   Map interpretation. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation.
   (I)   Prevailing authority. Where a map boundary showing an area of special
flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations for flood
protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table,
etc.) shall prevail. The correct information should be submitted to FEMA as per
the map maintenance activity requirements outlined in §
151.41(G)(2).
   (J)   Use of best available data. When base flood elevation data and
floodway data has not been provided in accordance with §
151.04, obtain, review, and reasonably utilize best available base flood
elevation data and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other
source, including data developed pursuant to §
151.42(A), in order to administer the provisions of this chapter. Data from
preliminary, draft, and final Flood Insurance Studies constitutes best
available data from a federal, state, or other source, which must be developed
using hydraulic models meeting the minimum requirement of NFIP approved model.
If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5
and 67.6, the data does not have to be used.
   (K)   Special flood hazard area/topographic boundaries conflict. When the
exact location of boundaries of the areas special flood hazards conflict with
the current, natural topography information at the site; the site information
takes precedence when the lowest adjacent grade is at or above the BFE, the
property owner may apply and be approved for a Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
by FEMA. The local Floodplain Administrator in the permit file will maintain a
copy of the Letter of Map Amendment issued from FEMA.
   (L)   On-site inspections. Make on-site inspections of projects in
accordance with the administrative procedures outlined in §
151.34(A).
   (M)   Administrative notices. Serve notices of violations, issue stop-work
orders, revoke permits and take corrective actions in accordance with the
administrative procedures in §
151.34.
   (N)   Records maintenance. Maintain all records pertaining to the
administration of this chapter and make these records available for public
inspection.
   (O)   Annexations and detachments. Notify the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources Land, Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator for
the National Flood Insurance Program within six months, of any annexations or
detachments that include special flood hazard areas.
   (P)   Federally funded development. All federally funded development must
comply with all applicable Executive Orders. Evidence of compliance with the
executive order must be submitted as part of the permit review process.
   (Q)   Substantial damage determination. Perform an assessment of damage from
any origin to the structure to determine the percent damage, which is based on
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   (R)   Substantial improvement determinations.  
      (1)   Perform an assessment of permit applications for improvements or
repairs (to include percent damage) to be made to a building or structure that
equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction. Cost of work counted for determining if and when substantial
improvement to a structure occurs shall be cumulative for a period of five
years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all
costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first
permit, shall be utilized to determine whether “substantial improvement” will
occur.
      (2)   The market values shall be determined by one of the following
methods:
         (a)   The current assessed building value as determined by the
county's assessor's office or the value of an appraisal performed by a licensed
appraiser at the expense of the owner within the past six months.
         (b)   One or more certified appraisals from a registered professional
licensed appraiser in accordance with the laws of South Carolina. The appraisal
shall indicate actual replacement value of the building or structure in its
pre-improvement condition, less the cost of site improvements and depreciation
for functionality and obsolescence.
         (c)   Real estate purchase contract within six months prior to the
date of the application for a permit.
         (d)   Computed actual cash value. This value is based on the average
cost of construction per square foot less the depreciation value.

§ 151.34 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit
progresses, the local Floodplain Administrator shall make as many inspections
of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according
to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In
exercising this power, the Floodplain Administrator has a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection
or other enforcement action.
   (B)   Stop-work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being
constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this chapter,
the Floodplain Administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The
stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work.
The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific
reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be
resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor.
   (C)   Revocation of permits. The local Floodplain Administrator may revoke
and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder
in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for
any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or
specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state
or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing
the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or
local law may also be revoked.
   (D)   Periodic inspections. The local Floodplain Administrator and each
member of his/her inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation
of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial
jurisdiction of the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of
inspection or other enforcement action. Inspections may be made during
construction and post construction to ensure continued compliance with the
NFIP.
   (E)   Violations to be corrected. When the local Floodplain Administrator
finds violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his/her duty
to notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property
he/she owns.
   (F)   Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of
a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
Floodplain Administrator shall give him/her written notice, by certified or
registered mail to his/her last known address or by personal service, that:
      (1)   The building or property is in violation of this chapter;
      (2)   A hearing will be held before the local Floodplain Administrator at
a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the
notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by
counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
      (3)   Following the hearing, the local Floodplain Administrator may issue
such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
appears appropriate.
   (G)   Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of this chapter, he/she shall make an
order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation
within such period, not more than 180 days the Floodplain Administrator may
prescribe; provided that where the Floodplain Administrator finds that there is
imminent danger to life or other property, he/she may order that corrective
action be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible.
   (H)   Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice
of appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the Clerk within ten
days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the
order of the Floodplain Administrator shall be final. The local governing body
shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and
affirm, or revoke the order.
   (I)   Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal
has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body
following an appeal, he/she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
punished in the discretion of the court.
   (J)   Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared
in violation of this chapter and after all other penalties are exhausted to
achieve compliance with this chapter then the local Floodplain Administrator
shall notify the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to initiate a
Section 1316 of the National Flood insurance Act of 1968 action against the
structure upon the finding that the violator refuses to bring the violation
into compliance with the chapter. Once a violation has been remedied the local
Floodplain Administrator shall notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that the
Section 1316 be rescinded.
   (K)   The following documents are incorporated by reference and may be used

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 151.40 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   Development may not occur in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) where
alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved.
Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures
cannot be located out of the SFHA and that encroachments onto the SFHA are
minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are
required:
   (A)   Reasonably safe from flooding. Review all permit applications to
determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
   (B)   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure.
   (C)   Flood resistant materials and equipment.  All new construction and
substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials
and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in accordance with Technical
Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, available from the
Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (D)   Minimize flood damage. All new construction and substantial
improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages.
   (E)   Critical development. All new construction and substantial
improvements that meet the definition of critical development shall be elevated
to the 500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical
flood elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data
exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known
historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year flood elevation data.
   (F)   Utilities.  Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air
conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall
be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of the base flood plus one foot.
   (G)   Water supply systems. All new and replacement water supply systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
system.
   (H)   Sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters. On-site waste
disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them
or contamination from them during flooding.
   (I)   Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either
located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent floatation and
lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (J)   Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure that is in compliance
with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the requirements of “new
construction” as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM development
and structures.
   (K)   Non-conforming buildings or uses.  Non-conforming buildings or uses,
including historic structures, may not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless
such enlargement or reconstruction is accomplished in conformance with the
provisions of this chapter.
   (L)   Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the
specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in § 151.41, as well as
any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not justification for issuing a
variance or otherwise waiving these requirements. Also, the cost of
improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs
of the improvements for calculating substantial improvement.
(Ord. 2012-06, passed 10-15-12; Am. Ord. 2022-03, passed 7-18-22)
§ 151.41 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard (Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30) unless
otherwise specified where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set
forth in §
151.04 or §
151.33(J), the following provisions are required:
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. No
basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated
buildings requirements in §
151.31(D).
   (B)   Non-residential construction.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall
have the lowest floor elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the
base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated
buildings requirements in §
151.41(D). No basements are permitted. Structures located in A-zones may be
floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the structure
below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of
buoyancy.
      (2)   A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division are satisfied. Such certifications shall be
provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification
requirements in §
151.32(B)(1). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural
structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in §
151.54 of this chapter. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of §
151.54 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other
applicable provisions of this chapter. Structures that are floodproofed are
required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The
local Floodplain Administrator must approve the maintenance plan and receive
notification of the annual exercise.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on
sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as the result of a
flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of
the manufactured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood
elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (2)   Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not
subject to the provisions for residential construction in division (C)(1) above
of this section must be elevated so that either:
         (a)   The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated no lower
than one foot above the base flood elevation, or
         (b)   The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers
or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less
than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement
or in accordance with Section 40-29 of the South Carolina Manufactured Housing
Board Regulations and SC Regulations Sec. 79-42, whichever is more restrictive.
      (3)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within areas of special flood
hazard. This plan shall be filed with and approved by the local Floodplain
Administrator and the local emergency manager.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited
storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding
shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters.
      (1)   Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the
following minimum criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area.
         (b)   The bottom of each opening must be no more than one foot above
the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening.
         (c)   Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood
elevation (BFE) plus freeboard can be counted towards the required net open
area. If the Lowest Adjacent Grade (LAG) is between the BFE and the freeboard,
openings are still required until a LOMA has been approved.
         (d)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
         (e)   Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the
grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade
outside the building on at least one side of the building.
      (2)   Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in
the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for
debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet
per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be
considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized.
      (3)   Enclosures below lowest floor.
         (a)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
         (b)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall be unfinished
or finished with flood resistant material and not partitioned into separate
rooms, must be void of utilities except for essential lighting as required for
safety, and cannot be temperature controlled. A ground fault interrupt breaker
may be installed below the required lowest floor elevation specified in the
specific standards outlined in divisions (A), (B) and (C) above of this
section.
         (c)   All construction materials below the required lowest floor
elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in divisions (A), (B),
(C) and (D) of this section should be of flood resistant materials.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
151.04, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and
potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall
apply within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any impact of the flood levels during
the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data shall
be presented to the local Floodplain Administrator, or
         (b)   A Conditional Letter of Map revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision must be obtained upon completion of the
proposed development.
      (2)   If division (E)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this subchapter (§§
151.40 through
151.44).
      (3)   A replacement manufactured home may be allowed provided the
anchoring and the elevation standards of division (C) above of this section and
the encroachment standards of division (E)(1) above may apply except when the
replacement manufactured home is the same size as the existing.
      (4)   Permissible uses within floodways may include general farming,
pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary,
game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also,
lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding
trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or
fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact
certification. The uses listed in this division are permissible only if and to
the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or
changes to the floodway configuration.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles.
      (1)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is:
         (a)   On wheels or jacking system,
         (b)   Attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and
security devices; and
         (c)   Has no permanently attached additions.
      (2)   Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be:
         (a)   On site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
         (c)   Meet the development permit and certification requirements of §
151.32, general standards outlined in §
151.40, and manufactured homes standards in divisions (C) and (D) above of this
section.
   (G)   Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures
that flood maps, studies and other data identified in §
151.04 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data. The following map maintenance
activities are identified and shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         (a)   For all development proposals that impact floodway/floodplain
delineations or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that a Letter
of Map Revision reflecting the impacts be submitted to FEMA as soon as
practicable, but no later than six months from the end of construction of the
impact. These development proposals include but not limited to:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including stream restoration and
the placement of culverts;
            4.   Subdivision or large-scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
151.42(A); and
            5.   Any development that will alter the boundaries of the area of
special flood hazard.
         (b)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical
data, required in accordance with this division (G), prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall also be the responsibility of the applicant.
         (c)   The Local Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional
Letter of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit
for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; or
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         (d)   The Local Floodplain Administrator may require a Conditional
Letter of Map Revision for any development that they want the impacts to be
evaluated prior to issuance of a permit.
         (e)   Floodplain development permits issued by the local Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to this division (G).
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the local jurisdiction
and may be submitted at any time.
   (H)   Accessory structures. Detached accessory structures used only for
parking of vehicles and storage are permitted at grade if:
      (1)   In special flood hazard areas other than coastal high hazard areas

building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
   (I)   Swimming pool utility equipment rooms. If the building cannot be built
at or above the BFE, because of functionality of the equipment then a structure
to house the utilities for the pool may be built below the BFE with the
following provisions:
      (1)   Meet the requirements for accessory structures in division (H)
above of this section.
      (2)   The utilities must be anchored to prevent flotation and shall be
designed to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components
during conditions of the base flood.
   (J)   Elevators.
      (1)   Install a float switch system or another system that provides the
same level of safety necessary for all elevators where there is a potential for
the elevator cab to descend below the BFE during a flood per FEMA's Technical

      (2)   All equipment that may have to be installed below the BFE such as
counter weight roller guides, compensation cable and pulleys, and oil buffers
for traction elevators and the jack assembly for a hydraulic elevator must be
constructed using flood-resistant materials where possible per FEMA's Technical
Bulletin 4 Elevator Installation for Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard
Areas.
   (K)   Fill. An applicant shall demonstrate that fill is the only alternative
to raising the building to meet the residential and non-residential
construction requirements of divisions (A) or (B) above of this section, and
that the amount of fill used will not affect the flood storage capacity or
adversely affect adjacent properties. The following provisions shall apply to
all fill placed in the special flood hazard area:
      (1)   Fill may not be placed in the floodway unless it is in accordance
with the requirements in division (E)(1) above of this section.
      (2)   Fill may not be placed in tidal or non-tidal wetlands without the
required state and federal permits.
      (3)   Fill must consist of soil and rock materials only. A registered

      (1)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall
be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage and are subject to all
applicable standards in these regulations.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall
have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development shall
have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirement to submit technical data
to FEMA in division (G) above of this section when a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis is completed that generates base flood elevations.

§ 151.42 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS AND
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard (Zones A and V) established
in §
151.04, are small streams where no base flood data has been provided and where
no floodways have been identified. The following provisions apply within such
areas.
   (A)   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data
are not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analysis that generates base flood elevations for all subdivision
proposals and other proposed developments containing at least 50 lots or five
acres, whichever is less.
   (B)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and new development shall be permitted within 100 feet of the
stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (C)   If division (A) above is satisfied and base flood elevation data is
available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements
within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance
provisions of this subchapter and shall be elevated or floodproofed in
accordance with elevations established in accordance with this chapter.
   (D)   Data from preliminary, and draft flood insurance studies constitutes
best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical Bulletin 1-
98 Use of Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Data as Available Data. If an appeal is
pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and 67.6, the
data does not have to be used.
   (E)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal,
state, or other source one of the following methods must be used to determine a
BFE in Approximate Zone A Areas:
      (1)   Contour interpolation.
         (a)   Superimpose approximate Zone A boundaries onto a topographic map
and estimate a BFE.
         (b)   Add one-half of the contour interval of the topographic map that
is used to the BFE.
      (2)   Data extrapolation. A BFE can be determined if a site within 500
feet upstream of the project site has a full detailed study for which a 100-
year profile has been computed, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope
characteristics are relatively similar to the downstream reaches. No hydraulic
structures shall be present.
      (3)   Hydrologic and hydraulic calculations. Perform hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations to determine BFEs using FEMA approved methods and
software.
      (4)   A Zone model. A BFE can be pulled from the model and applied if
determined that the BFE is useable.

but no floodway is identified for a special flood hazard area on the FIRM or in
the FIS.
   (A)   No encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless certification with
supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the community.

   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
151.04, are areas designated as shallow flooding. The following provisions
shall apply within such areas.
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements of residential
structures shall have the lowest floor elevated to at least as high as the
depth number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above the
highest adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall
be elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade.
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential
structures shall:
      (1)   Have the lowest floor elevated to at least as high as the depth
number specified on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, in feet, above the highest
adjacent grade. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor shall be
elevated at least three feet above the highest adjacent grade; or
      (2)   Be completely flood-proofed together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities to or above that level so that any space below that level
is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and
with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. Certification is required as stated
in §
151.32.
   (C)   All structures on slopes must have drainage paths around them to guide
water away from the structures.

(Ord. 2002-12, passed 8-19-02)
§ 154.08 JURISDICTION OF THE BOARD OF ARCHITECTURAL REVIEW.
   The jurisdiction of the Board, in general, is the town limits. The
jurisdiction of the Board for the recommendation of properties to be designated

(Ord. 2002-12, passed 8-19-02)
§ 154.09 NOMINATIONS TO THE NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES.
   The Board may conduct first review and evaluation of all proposed
nominations for the National Register of Historic Places for properties that
are within its jurisdiction, prior to consideration by the State Board of
Review. The Board may send their recommendations to the State Historic
Preservation Office for consideration at the meeting of the State Board of
Review. The Board shall not nominate properties directly to the National
Register; only the State Board of Review shall have this final review authority
unless expressly authorized by federal statute.
(Ord. 2002-12, passed 8-19-02)
§ 154.10 CERTIFICATION OF APPROPRIATENESS.
   (A)   Certificate. A Certificate of Appropriateness is required before a
building permit can be issued for the demolition, new construction, exterior
alteration, modification or addition to a designated historic property. Any
building permit not issued in conformity with this chapter shall be considered
void. Application for a Certificate of Appropriateness must be signed by the
owner or his authorized representative and the form must be signed by the
Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the Board stating its approval, denial, or
approval with conditions and the reasons for the decision.
   (B)   Required procedure. An application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be obtained from the town, and when completed, filed with
the appropriate administrative official as designated by the Board.
   (C)    Time limits . Applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall
be considered by the Board at its next regular meeting, provided they have been
filed at least seven calendar days before the regularly scheduled meeting of
Board. If the Board fails to take action upon any application within 45 days
after the complete application is received, the application shall be considered
approved, except in cases where the Board has postponed an application to
demolish a structure under the provisions contained in this chapter.
   (D)   Board action on application. The Board shall review the application,
using the design guidelines appearing in §
154.11 to make findings of fact to decide whether or not the applicant's plans
are appropriate. The decision of the Board, along with the reasons for each
decision, will be recorded in the minutes and will be available upon request as
a public reference for preservation procedures.
   (E)   Contents of application. The Board shall, in its rules of procedure,
require data as are reasonable and necessary to determine the nature of the
application. An application shall not be considered complete until all the
required data have been submitted.
   (F)   Notification of affected property owners. Prior to the issuance of an
approval or denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Board shall inform
the owners of any property likely to be materially affected by the application,
and shall give the applicant and such owners an opportunity to be heard.
   (G)    Submission of a new application . If the Board determines that a
Certificate of Appropriateness should be denied, a new application affecting
the same property may be submitted only if substantial change is made in the
plans for the proposed work.
   (H)   Maintenance, repair, and interior projects. Nothing in this document
shall be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance or repair or any
exterior architectural feature of structures designated as historic when that
repair does not involve a change in design, material, color, or outer
appearance of the structure. The Board shall not consider the interior
arrangements or alterations to the interior of a building unless the interior
of a public building or the public space of a private building is specifically
described and designated as historic. The Board may authorize a staff member to
approve minor projects involving repairs and ordinary maintenance that do not
alter design, materials, color or the outer appearance of a structure or
interior projects not subject to design review.
   (I)   Fines and penalties. The system of fines applied by the town in §
150.99 will apply to this chapter.
   (J)   Substantial hardship.
      (1)   In the event a Certificate of Appropriateness is denied, the
property owner may apply for a exemption based on the substantial hardship of
maintaining the property according to the design guidelines for historic
properties. Substantial hardship is to be considered by the Commission where
one or more of the following unusual and compelling circumstances exists:
         (a)   The property cannot reasonably be maintained in the manner
dictated by this chapter;
         (b)   There are no other reasonable means of saving the property from
deterioration, or collapse; or
         (c)   The property is owned by a nonprofit organization and it is not
feasible financially or physically to achieve the charitable purposes of the
organization while maintaining the property appropriately.
      (2)   The owner may be required to submit documents to show that he
cannot comply with the design guidelines and earn a reasonable rate of return
on his investment in the property. Information required may include:
         (a)   Costs of the proposed development with and without modification
needed to comply with the design guidelines as determined by the Board,
         (b)   Structural report and/or a feasibility report;
         (c)   Market value of the property in its present condition and after
completion of the proposed project;
         (d)   Cost of the property, date purchased, relationship, if any,
between seller and buyer, terms of financing;
         (e)   For the past two years, annual gross income from the property
with operating and maintenance expenses, depreciation, and annual cash flow
before and after debt service during that time; and
         (f)   Other information considered necessary by the Board to
determined whether or not the property may yield a reasonable return.
   (K)   Demolition. If the Board denies, or postpones for 180 days, a request
to demolish a historic building, the Board shall work closely with the owner to
find an appropriate use for the property, to help find a buyer or to obtain
funding for rehabilitation, including low interest loans and grants. The Board
shall inform the community concerning the threat to the building, its value as
part of the fabric and the community and, through publicity and contacts with
civic groups, seek to provide assistance in preserving the property.
(Ord. 2002-12, passed 8-19-02)
§ 154.11 DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Intent. It is the intent of this chapter to ensure, insofar as
possible, that properties designated as historic shall be in harmony with the
architectural and historic character of the town. In granting a Certificate of
Appropriateness, the Board shall take into account the architectural and
historic significance of the structure under consideration and the exterior
form and appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that
structure as well as the effect of such change or additions upon other
structures in the vicinity.
   (B)   The Secretary of the Interior's standards for rehabilitation.
      (1)   When considering an application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness for new construction, alteration, repair, or restoration, the
Commission shall use the Secretary of the Interior's standards for
rehabilitation as guidelines in making its decisions. In addition, the Board
may adopt more specific guidelines for local historic districts and local
historic buildings. These guidelines serve as the basis for determining the
approval, approval with modifications, or denial of an application.
      (2)   The Secretary's standards for rehabilitation are:
         (a)   A property will be used as it was historically or be given a new
use that requires minimal change to its distinctive materials, features,
spaces, and spatial relationships;
         (b)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of distinctive materials or alteration of features,
spaces and spatial relationships that characterize a property will be avoided;
         (c)   Each property will be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical
development, such as adding conjectural features or elements from other
buildings, will not be undertaken;
         (d)   Changes to a property that have acquired historic significance
in their own right will be retained and preserved;
         (e)   Distinctive materials, features, finishes, and construction
techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a property will be
preserved;
         (f)   Deteriorated historic features will be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature will match the old in design, color,
texture, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features will
be substantiated by documentary and physical evidence.
         (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, if appropriate, will be
undertaken using the gentlest means possible. Treatments that cause damage to
historic materials will not be used.
         (h)   Archeological resources will be protected and preserved in
place. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures will be
undertaken.
         (i)   New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction
will not destroy historic materials, features, and spatial relationships that
characterize the property. The new work will be differentiated from the old and
will be compatible with the historic materials, features, size, scale, and
proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the property and its
environment.
         (j)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction will be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
(Ord. 2002-12, passed 8-19-02)
§ 154.12 APPEALS.
   Any person may appeal a decision of the Board to the Courts of South
Carolina pursuant to S.C. §§ 6-29-900 et seq.
