PREFACE
   This Code is a codification of the ordinances of Richland County, South
Carolina, of a general and permanent nature. As expressed in the Adopting
Ordinance, the Code supersedes all such ordinances not included therein or
recognized as continuing in force by reference thereto.
   The chapters of the Code are arranged in alphabetical order and the sections
within each chapter are catchlined to facilitate usage. Footnotes which tie
related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant provisions of
the state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and
setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this
volume. The source of each section is indicated by the history note appearing
in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that
the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the
Code. By use of the Comparative Table also appearing in the back of the volume,
any ordinance included herein can be readily found in the Code.
Numbering System
   The numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state
and local government codes. Each section number consists of two component parts
separated by a dash, the figure before the dash representing the chapter number
and the figure after the dash indicating the position of the section within the
chapter. Thus, the first section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-1 and the twelfth
section of chapter 14 is 14-12. Under this system, each section is identified
with its chapter, and, at the same time, new sections or even whole chapters
can be inserted in their proper places, simply by using the decimal system for
amendments. By way of illustration: If new material consisting of three
sections that would logically come between sections
3-3 and 3-4 is desired to be added, such new sections would be numbered 3-3.1,
3-3.2 and 3-3.3, respectively. New chapters may be included in the same manner.
If the new materials is to be included between chapters 3 and 4 it will be
designated as chapter 3.5. Care should be taken that the alphabetical
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. New articles
and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles,
may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case
of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject,
the next successive number being assigned to the article or division.
Index
   The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item
has been placed under several headings, some of the headings being couched in
lay phraseology, others in legal terminology and still others in language
generally used by government officials and employees. There are numerous cross
references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user
to the particular item in which he is interested.

shall vote whether or not to give the building property, facility, or structure
such name or label as it deems to be in the best interest of the community as a
whole and of its citizens, and one which reflects the community's history,
geography, leaders, and/or culture.
   (c)   The addition of the name or label should be incorporated at the outset
of construction when appropriate, or added when it is financially feasible to
do so, such as the regularly scheduled re-painting of a building or replacement
sign.
   (d)   Specific labeling shall be submitted by staff and approved by county
council concurrently with the above process.

be insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, he shall report to the council
without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any remedial

The council shall then take further action as it deems necessary to prevent or
minimize any deficit and for that purpose it may by ordinance reduce one or
more appropriations.
   (e)   Transfer of appropriations. At any time during the fiscal year, the
county administrator may transfer part or all of any unencumbered appropriation

all of any unencumbered appropriation balance from one department, office or
agency to another.
   (f)   Adoption of the general fund budget. The council shall, in no event,
adopt a general fund budget in which the total of expenditures exceeds
available revenues. If, for any reason, the council fails to adopt the general
fund budget, the general fund appropriation ordinance and such ordinances
providing for additional revenues as may be necessary to put the budget in

and an estimate of any such balance shall be included in the school budgets of
the ensuing year as an estimated receipt.
   (i)   Certification of funds; penalties for violation. No payment shall be
made and no obligation incurred by or on behalf of the county except in
accordance with an appropriation duly made; provided that the council shall
have the power to authorize and direct the making of contracts for the
expenditure of funds not appropriated in any budget for the then current fiscal
year, in which event the council shall appropriate the funds in the budget or
budgets for the next fiscal year or years for the performance of the contracts.
No payment shall be made from or obligation incurred against any allotment or
appropriation unless the director of finance and budget shall first certify
that there is a sufficient unexpended and unencumbered balance in such
allotment or appropriation to meet the same; provided that, nothing herein
shall be taken to prevent the advance authorization of expenditures from a
contingency fund. Every expenditure or obligation authorized or incurred in
violation of the provisions of this section shall be void. Every payment made
in violation of the provisions of this section shall be deemed illegal and
every official who shall knowingly receive such payment of any part thereof
shall be jointly and severally liable to the county for the full amount so paid
or received. If any elected official, member of a board, or commission, or
employee of the county shall knowingly incur any obligation or shall authorize
or make any expenditure in violation of the provisions of this section or
knowingly take part therein, such action shall be cause for his removal.

If, at any time during the fiscal year, the county administrator shall
ascertain that the revenue cash receipts of the general fund for the year, plus
any cash surplus available from the preceding year, will be less than the total
appropriations to be met from such receipts, he shall reconsider the work
programs and allotments of the departments, boards, commissions, offices and
agencies, and, subject to the laws of the state relating to obligatory
expenditures for any purpose, revise the allotments so as to forestall the
incurring of a deficit; provided, however, that, there shall be no reduction in

(Ord. No. 1825-89, § I, 1-17-89; Ord. No. 2184-92, § I, 3-18-92)
Sec. 2-591. Expenditure of funds from penny sales tax.
   (a)   When Richland County (the "county") is engaged in a purchase involving
only the expenditure of funds raised from the penny sales tax referendum passed
November 6, 2012, the county council may, upon a vote of the majority of its
members, exempt any specific procurement which county council determines is of
great county wide significance, from the purchasing procedures of Article X,
Division 2, Competitive Purchasing Policy, §§
2-600 (Procurement of professional services) and
2-601 (Competitive sealed proposals). For purposes of this section,
"determination" means county council's majority vote that a specific
procurement is of such great county wide significance that it is exempt from
the provisions of §§
2-600 or
2-601. For purposes of this section "director of procurement" means the
director of procurement or any employee of the Richland County department of
procurement designated by the director of procurement, in consultation with the
county administrator, to handle a solicitation under this section. Any
solicitation so exempted as being of great county wide significance shall
follow the procurement procedure set forth in this section. Any solicitation
procured pursuant to this section is not subject to any other provision of
Article X, Division 2, Competitive Purchasing Policy unless specifically stated
to the contrary herein.
   (b)   For a specific procurement involving professional services which would
otherwise be subject to the provisions of §
2-600, requests for qualifications, for which county council has made a
determination, the procurement shall proceed as set forth below:
      (1)   The director of procurement, in conjunction with any county
employee(s) appointed by the county administrator, shall be responsible for
developing a request for qualifications and shall prepare a government project
cost estimate for use in negotiations, which cost estimation shall remain
confidential until after negotiation and award of a contract. A "request for
qualification" is a written or published solicitation for submittals for the
provision of professional services such as architectural, landscaping or
engineering services, where the contract award is based upon the qualifications
of the offeror for the specific project and cost is not an award criterion. The
request for qualifications must contain, at a minimum, a description of the
scope of the work being requested, the deadline for submission of information,
how prospective offerors may apply for consideration and must require
information on prospective offerors qualifications, experience, and ability to
perform the requirements of the contract.
      (2)   The county administrator shall establish a short-list evaluation
committee (the "committee") of three (3) or more individuals whom he determines
to be qualified to make an informed recommendation to county council as to
offerors qualified to work on the proposed project.
      (3)   The director of procurement, in conjunction with the county
employee(s) appointed by the county administrator, shall prepare a request for
qualifications, which shall include evaluation criteria, developed by the
director of procurement, in conjunction with any county employee(s) appointed
by the county administrator, as they determine appropriate for the specific
project. There are no restrictions on the kind or number of evaluation factors
that may be used, as long as they are stated in the request for qualifications
and relate to the purpose of the procurement. The evaluation criteria shall be
listed in the solicitation in relative order of importance, but the
solicitation shall not publicly list the numerical weighting of each factor.
The request for qualifications shall be submitted to county council for its
approval prior to publication.
      (4)   The notice of the request for qualifications will be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county and in the South Carolina
Materials Management, South Carolina Business Opportunity publication, which
notice shall include, but not be limited to, the project title, the general
scope of work, a description of all professional services required for that
project, the submission deadline, and how and to whom interested offerors may
submit qualifications for consideration.
      (5)   Offerors shall submit qualification information as required in the
request for qualifications.
      (6)   Qualification submittals shall be opened publicly in the presence
of one (1) or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the request
for qualifications. Only the names of the offering offerors shall be disclosed
at the qualification submittal opening. Contents of the qualification
submittals shall remain confidential and shall not be disclosed during the
negotiation process. Qualification submittals shall be open for public
inspection after contract award, except that proprietary or confidential
information in any qualification submittal that is clearly marked
"confidential" by the offering offeror shall not be disclosed except as
provided in the request for qualifications and allowed by the South Carolina
Freedom of Information Act, S.C. Code 1976, § 30-4-10 and S.C. Code 1976, § 11-
35-410, "Public access to procurement information."
      (7)   Prior to sending the qualifications submittals to the committee,
the director of procurement shall make an initial evaluation to determine
whether the offeror is responsive and responsible, as such terms are defined in
the county ordinance, Chapter 2, Administration, Article X, Purchasing,
Division 1, §
2-590. During its evaluation process, the committee shall bring any issues
regarding the responsiveness or responsibility of any offeror to the attention
of the director of procurement. The director of procurement, in his sole
discretion, shall have the right to waive any minor irregularities or
informalities of a qualifications submittal from the material requirements of
the request for qualifications. A minor informality or irregularity is one
which is merely a matter of form or is some immaterial variation from the exact
requirements of the request for qualifications having no effect or merely a
trivial or negligible effect on total price, quality, quantity, or performance
of the contract, and the correction or waiver of which would not be prejudicial
to other offerors. The director of procurement shall either give the offeror an
opportunity to cure any deficiency resulting from a minor informality or
irregularity in the request for qualifications or waive any such deficiency
when it is to the advantage of the county. If the director of procurement
determines to allow an offeror to cure the deficiency resulting from a minor
informality or irregularity, the offeror shall have five (5) business days from
the date the director of procurement notifies the offeror of any such
deficiency to cure the deficiency. The director of procurement's notification
and offeror's response to the notification shall be in writing. If the offeror
fails to cure the deficiency within the five (5) day notification period,
within the sole discretion of the director of procurement, the offeror will be
rejected and the submittal will not be forwarded to the committee. If the
director of procurement determines to waive such deficiency, it shall be in
writing. If a qualification submittal is incomplete with regards to the
material requirements of the request for qualifications or the offeror is found
to be non-responsive or non-responsible, the offeror will be rejected and the
submittal will not be forwarded to the committee.
      (8)   The committee may conduct discussions, in conjunction with the
director of procurement, with each of the offerors submitting responses to the
request for qualifications which responses appear eligible for contract award
(based upon the evaluation factors) for the purpose of clarification to assure
full understanding of and responsiveness to the requirements of the request for
qualifications. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with
respect to clarification and any opportunity for discussion and revision of
qualifications.
      (9)   The committee may conduct interviews with offerors submitting
responses to the request for qualifications as it deems appropriate.
      (10)   Based upon the evaluation criteria, the committee shall select not
more than eight (8) offerors, as directed by county council in its
determination, which, in the committee's judgment, are the offerors whose
qualification package, including the discussions and interviews, if any, are
the most qualified offerors to be forwarded to county council for consideration
of award of the specific project. The committee shall develop a written short-
list report regarding the most qualified offerors, listing the offerors in
alphabetical order. No non-responsive, non-responsible or non-qualified
qualification submittals shall be included in the written short-listed report
to county council.
      (11)   When the committee has completed its written short-list report,
the director of procurement shall forward the report and a copy of each of the
short-listed offerors' qualification submittals to members of county council.
      (12)   Upon receipt of the committee's written short-list report and the
short-listed offerors' qualification submittals, county council, in its sole
discretion, may conduct interviews with each of the short-listed offerors to
seek clarification regarding the offerors' qualification submittals or
additional information from the offerors regarding their respective approach to
the specific project.
      (13)   When county council determines, in its sole discretion, that it
has sufficient information to make its award decision, county council shall
decide which of the offeror's or offerors' qualification submittal or
submittals, if county council intends to select more than one offeror with whom
to contract, is or are in the best interests of the citizens of the county as a
whole. County council's award decision shall be by majority vote with the first
offeror receiving a majority of votes being ranked number one. Once the first
ranked offeror has been identified, county council shall vote to identify the
second ranked offeror by a majority vote. This process shall be repeated until
all of the short-listed offerors have been ranked. In its sole discretion,
county council may award the contract to a single offeror or to multiple
offerors, not to exceed five (5) offerors, as is set forth in the request for
qualifications. When awarding to multiple offerors, the offerors to whom the
contracts are awarded shall be determined by majority vote of county council
voting for up to five (5) offerors.
      (14)   The director of procurement shall request a cost proposal from the
top ranked offeror. Upon receipt of the cost proposal, in its sole discretion,
county council may direct the director of procurement to proceed in any of the
manners indicated below, except in no case may confidential information derived
from qualification submittals and negotiations submitted by competing offerors
be disclosed:
         a.   When awarding to a single offeror, negotiate with the highest
ranking offeror on price, on matters affecting the scope of the contract, so
long as the changes are within the general scope of the request for proposals,
or on both. If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated with the highest
ranking offeror, negotiations may be conducted, in the sole discretion of
county council, with the second, and then the third, and so on, ranked offerors
to the level of ranking determined by the county council, in its sole
discretion;
         b.   When awarding a contract to multiple offerors, set the terms of
the contract and give each of the offerors ranked in the top five (5) an
opportunity to agree to meet the terms of the contract;
         c.   When awarding a contract to a single offeror, during the
negotiation process, as outlined in item (a) above, if the director of
procurement is unsuccessful in the first round of negotiations, county council
may reopen negotiations with any offeror with whom the director of procurement
had previously negotiated; or
         d.   Whether awarding to a single offeror or to multiple offerors, the
director of procurement, as directed by county council, may make changes within
the general scope of the request for qualifications and may provide all of the
short-listed offerors an opportunity to submit their best and final offers.
   (c)   For a specific procurement involving professional services that would
otherwise be subject to the provisions of Section
2-601, requests for proposals, for which county council has made a
determination, the procurement shall proceed as set forth below:
      (1)   The director of procurement, in conjunction with any county
employee(s) appointed by the county administrator, shall prepare the request
for proposals for the specific project. A "request for proposal" is a written
or published solicitation for proposals to provide goods, services, or
construction as described therein. Evaluation factors upon which the proposals
will be evaluated by the committee (hereinafter defined) for purposes of making
a written report to county council shall be stated in the request for
proposals. Price may or may not be one of the evaluation factors but it shall
not be the sole basis for evaluation and award of the contract. The pricing in
proposals shall remain confidential until after negotiation and award of a
contract except as provided in the request for proposals and allowed by the
South Carolina Freedom of Information Act, S.C. Code 1976, § 30-4-10 and S.C.
Code 1976, § 11-35-410, "Public access to procurement information." The request
for proposals shall be submitted to county council for its approval prior to
publication.
      (2)   The notice of the request for proposals will be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county and in the South Carolina
Materials Management, South Carolina Business Opportunity publication, which
notice shall include, but not be limited to, the project title, the general
scope of work, if applicable, a description of the goods, services, or
construction to be provided for that project, the submission deadline, and how
and to whom interested offerors may submit proposals.
      (3)   Proposals shall be opened publicly in the presence of one (1) or
more witnesses at the time and place designated in the request for proposals.
Only the names of the offerors shall be disclosed at the proposal opening.
Contents of the proposals shall not be disclosed during the negotiation
process. Proposals shall be open for public inspection after contract award,
except that proprietary or confidential information in any proposal that is
clearly marked "confidential" by the offering vendor shall not be disclosed
except as provided in the request for proposals and allowed by the South
Carolina Freedom of Information Act, S.C. Code 1976, §§ 30-4-10 and S.C. Code
1976, § 11-35-410, "Public access to procurement information."
      (4)   The request for proposals shall list the evaluation factors
including price, if it is an evaluation factor, in relative order of
importance, but shall not publically list the numerical weighting of each
factor. There are no restrictions on the kind or number of evaluation factors
that may be used, as long as they are stated in the request for proposals and
relate to the purpose of the procurement.
      (5)   The county administrator shall establish a short-list evaluation
committee (the "committee") of three (3) or more individuals whom he determines
to be qualified to make an informed recommendation to county council as to
offerors qualified to work on the proposed project.
      (6)   Prior to sending the proposals to the committee, the director of
procurement shall make an initial evaluation to determine whether the offeror
is responsive and responsible, as each is defined in county ordinance, Chapter
2, Administration, Article X, Purchasing, Division 1, §
2-590. During its evaluation process, the committee shall bring any issues
regarding the responsiveness or responsibility of any offeror to the attention
of the director of procurement. The director of procurement, in his sole
discretion, shall have the right to waive any minor irregularities or
informalities of a proposal from the material requirements of the request for
proposal. A minor informality or irregularity is one which is merely a matter
of form or is some immaterial variation from the exact requirements of the
request for proposals having no effect or merely a trivial or negligible effect
on total price, quality, quantity, or performance of the contract, and the
correction or waiver of which would not be prejudicial to other offerors. The
director of procurement shall either give the offeror an opportunity to cure
any deficiency resulting from a minor informality or irregularity in the
request for proposals or waive any such deficiency when it is to the advantage
of the county. If the director of procurement determines to allow an offeror to
cure the deficiency resulting from a minor informality or irregularity, the
offeror shall have five (5) business days from the date the director of
procurement notifies the offeror of any such deficiency to cure the deficiency.
The director of procurement's notification and offeror's response to the
notification shall be in writing. If the offeror fails to cure the deficiency
within the five (5) day notification period, within the sole discretion of the
director of procurement, the offeror will be rejected and the submittal will
not be forwarded to the committee. If the director of procurement determines to
waive such deficiency, it shall be in writing. If a proposal is incomplete with
regards to the material requirements of the request for proposals or the
offeror is found to be non-responsible or non-responsive, the offeror will be
rejected, and the proposal will not be forwarded to the committee.
      (7)   The committee may conduct discussions, in conjunction with the
director of procurement, with each of the offerors submitting responses to the
request for proposals, which response appears eligible for contract award
(based upon the evaluation factors) for the purpose of clarification to assure
full understanding of and responsiveness to the requirements of the request for
proposals. Offerors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to
clarification and any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals.
      (8)   The committee may conduct interviews with offerors submitting
responses to the request for proposals as it deems appropriate.
      (9)   Based upon the evaluation criteria, the committee shall select not
more than eight (8) offerors, as directed by county council in its
determination, which, in the committee's judgment, are the offerors whose
proposals, including the discussions and interviews, if any, are most
advantageous to the county. The committee shall then develop a written short-
list report regarding the offerors whose proposals are most advantageous to the
county, listing the offerors in alphabetical order. No non-responsive, non-
responsible, or non-qualified offeror shall be included in the written short-
list report to county council.
      (10)   When the committee has completed its written short-list report,
the director of procurement shall forward the report and the short-listed
offerors' proposals to members of county council.
      (11)   Upon receipt of the committee's short-list report and the copies
of the short-listed offerors' proposals, county council, in its sole
discretion, may conduct interviews with each of the short-listed offerors to
seek clarification regarding the proposals or additional information from the
offerors regarding their approaches to the specific project.
      (12)   When county council determines, in its sole discretion, that it
has sufficient information to make its award decision, county council shall
decide which of the offeror's or offerors' qualification submittal or
submittals, if county council intends to select more than one (1) offeror with
whom to contract, is or are in the best interests of the citizens of the county
as a whole. County council's award decision shall be by majority vote with the
first offeror receiving a majority of votes being ranked number one. Once the
first ranked offeror has been identified, county council shall vote to identify
the second ranked offeror by a majority vote. This process shall be repeated
until all of the short-listed offerors have been ranked. In its sole
discretion, county council may award the contract to a single offerors or to
multiple offerors, not to exceed five offerors, as is set forth in the request
for proposals. When awarding to multiple offerors, the offerors to whom the
contracts are awarded shall be determined by majority vote of county council
voting for up to five (5) offerors.
      (13)   Whether price was an evaluation factor or not, the county council
in its sole discretion may direct the director of procurement to proceed in any
of the manners indicated below, except that in no case may confidential
information derived from proposals and negotiations submitted by competing
offerors be disclosed:
         a.   When awarding a contract to a single offeror, negotiate with the
highest ranking offeror on price, on matters affecting the scope of the
contract, so long as the changes are within the general scope of the request
for proposals, or on both. If a satisfactory contract cannot be negotiated with
the highest ranking offeror, negotiations may be conducted, in the sole
discretion of county council, with the second, and then the third, and so on,
ranked offerors to the level of ranking determined by the county council in its
sole discretion;
         b.   When awarding a contract to multiple offerors, set the terms of
the contract and give each of the offerors ranked in the top five (5) an
opportunity to agree to meet the terms of the contract;
         c.   When awarding a contract to a single offeror, during the
negotiation process as outlined in item (a) above, if the director of
procurement is unsuccessful in the first round of negotiations, county council
may direct the director of procurement to reopen negotiations with any offeror
with whom it had previously negotiated; or
         d.   Whether awarding to a single offeror or to multiple offerors, the
director of procurement, as directed by county council, may make changes within
the general scope of the request for proposals and may provide all of the
short-listed offerors an opportunity to submit their best and final offers.
   (d)   The county council reserves the right to reject any solicitation, in
whole or in part, issued pursuant to this section and may reject, in whole or
in part, any or all qualifications or proposals submitted pursuant to this
section.
   (e)   Once the county council makes a determination pursuant to section (a)
of the section, offerors and anyone acting on behalf of offerors are prohibited
from contacting, by any means of communication, any county elected official,
county employee other than the director of procurement, or a consultant
advising the county regarding the solicitation about the solicitation or any
portion of the solicitation. If an offeror or anyone acting on behalf of the
offeror contacts a county elected official, county employee or consultant
advising the county on the solicitation, the county elected official, employee,
or consultant shall immediately notify the director of procurement and the
county attorney regarding the name of the individual making the contact, the
name of the offeror on whose behalf the contact was made and the nature of the
contact. Any offeror who contacts a county elected official, a county employee
other than the director of procurement, or a consultant advising the county on
the solicitation regarding the solicitation will not be eligible for award of
the contract and may be subject to suspension or debarment proceedings.
   (f)   Any procurement conducted pursuant to the provisions of this section
is exempt from all other requirements of Article X, Division 2, Competitive
Purchasing Policy, including but not limited to, the protest provisions
therein.
   (g)   The provisions of the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act and
S.C. Code 1976, § 11-35-410 of the South Carolina Consolidated Procurement Code
are applicable to any solicitation undertaken pursuant to this section.

Sec. 2-592. Prohibited contracts.
   (a)   The county and its agencies, as defined in section
2-590 of this article, are prohibited from entering into any contract, lease or
agreement resulting in pecuniary gain for an employee or officer of the county,
or an employee, officer or member of any county agency, as defined in section
2-590 supra. In addition, the county shall be prohibited from entering into a
contract, lease or agreement resulting in pecuniary gain for a member of the
family of an employee or officer of the county or a member of the family of an
employee, officer or member of any county agency, as defined in section
2-590 supra. "Family member" shall be defined as being within the third degree
of consanguinity or affinity.
   (b)   If a contract, lease or agreement has been negotiated through a
process of public notice and competitive bidding, or through a request for
proposals, the existence and degree of the familial relationship has been
disclosed in writing in the original bid or proposal, and it appears that the
award of such contract, lease or agreement would be in the best interest of the
county, the prohibitions set forth in subsection (a) hereinabove may be waived
by a majority vote of county council. Such majority vote is satisfaction that
county council accepts such contract, lease, or agreement by a majority vote,
if it is shown on the record that such familial relationship exists.

Sec. 2-593. Contract authority.
   Purchases in the amount of thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00) or less may
be approved by the county administrator. Purchases in excess of thirty thousand
dollars ($30,000.00) shall be reviewed and approved by the county council prior
to acceptance. The county administrator shall have the authority to approve
change orders in an amount not to exceed ten (10) percent of the original
contract price; provided, however, that any change order in excess of ten
thousand dollars ($10,000.00) shall be reviewed and approved by the county
council. This section shall apply to any contract for goods or services and
shall repeal any other stated contract dollar limitation. Provided, however
that the county administrator shall have the authority to approve contracts in
any amount up to and including one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) when
said contract is for a road-related construction project.

Secs. 2-594--2-597. Reserved.
DIVISION 2. COMPETITIVE PURCHASING POLICY
Sec. 2-598. General provisions.
   (a)   All public purchases shall be made in a manner which provides for the
greatest economy for the taxpayer, the fairest selection of vendor, and the
prevention of conflicts of interest. Towards this end, it shall be the policy
of the county that, whenever practical, leases, goods, and services required by
county agencies shall be procured through a competitive purchasing policy which
may be achieved through competitive bidding or through requests for proposals;
provided, however, contracts that are specifically approved by a county
ordinance are exempt from the provisions of this Article.
   Professional services shall be procured as set forth in section
2-600 of this Code, unless otherwise prohibited by law.
   The method of contracting known as "design/build" wherein the successful
vendor shall perform a "turnkey" project to include all architectural,
engineering, construction and other services necessary to provide a complete
facility, is expressly authorized. The contractor shall identify the architects
and engineers he proposes to use in his bid or proposal and shall coordinate
all activities of said architects, engineers, designers, subcontractors,
suppliers and others involved in the project to provide a completed facility
meeting contract requirements, and shall insure compliance with all other
applicable county, state or federal laws. When the "design/build" concept is
utilized through competitive bidding or requests for proposal, then the
requirements that architectural and engineering services be procured under
section
2-600 of this division shall be waived.
   The "design/build" method of contracting shall only be employed when the
county council determines that the utilization of such method is in the best
interest of the county.
   (b)   In case of tie or identical offers, preference shall be given to
businesses and persons located within the county boundaries. In case of tie or
identical offers involving two (2) or more businesses and persons located
within the county, boundaries shall be resolved based on:
      (1)   Completion/delivery period.
      (2)   Previous performance record.

Sec. 2-599. Placement and operation of vending machines, food services, pay
telephones, facsimile machines, copier or other service machines on county
property.
   (a)   Generally. Subject to any exceptions allowed in this article, all
vending machines, food service machines, or other such service machines to be
placed and operated in any building or on any property owned or occupied by any
department or agency of the county shall be secured through a process of
competitive bidding or requests for proposals, pursuant to the definition or
"vendors list" in section
2-590 and pursuant to section
2-598 of this article.
   (b)   Installation commission basis. Unless specifically excepted by
council, no vending machine, pay telephone or other service machine shall be
purchased by the county. All concessions shall be placed and operated on an
installation/commission basis.
   (c)   Disposition of commission. All commissions earned from any concession
on county property shall be deposited with the county treasurer through the
finance department, to be credited to the general fund.
   (d)   Applicability. This section shall apply to all property owned or
leased by the county, including but not limited to the administration complex,
courthouse, law enforcement center, public works center, environmental solid
waste disposal site, health department, or any other property occupied by any
county department or agency.
   (e)   Exemptions. This section shall not apply to any concession granted to
a blind person or to the state commission for the blind pursuant to the
provisions of South Carolina Code of Laws, 1976, section 1-1-520 and 43-25-70.
The county administrator may grant manual concessions to any handicapped person
in preference to any other person submitting a bid or proposal under the
purchasing regulations. This section shall not apply to concessions operated on
property leased by the county to any other person, firm, corporation or agency.
(Ord. No. 1825-89, § I, 1-17-89)
Sec. 2-600. Procurement of professional services.
   No officer, board, commission, committee or agency in the county receiving
any county funds or appointed in whole or in part by the council may procure
professional services or agree to pay for professional services out of public
funds without first obtaining the approval of the council. Provided, that, in
cases where the amount of outside fees to be paid for said services exceeds
thirty thousand dollars ($30,000.00), the approval of the county council shall
be obtained subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   The director of procurement shall be responsible for developing a
description of the proposed project.
      (2)   The director of procurement shall prepare a government project cost
estimate for use in negotiations.
      (3)   The county administrator shall establish a selection committee of
three (3) or more individuals whom he determines to be qualified to make an
informed recommendation as to the most competent firm for the proposed project.
The committee shall determine if services are available from sole source or on
an at-large basis.
      (4)   If sole source is justified and concurrence is received from
council, negotiations shall be initiated with the selected firm.
      (5)   If the selection committee recommends a procurement on an at-large
basis, it shall prepare a formal invitation to firms for submission of
information to be approved by council. The invitation shall be published in a
general circulation newspaper and include, but not be limited to, the project
title, the general scope of work, a description of all professional services
required for that project, the submission deadline, and how interested firms
may apply for consideration.
      (6)   Firms shall submit information of qualifications and experience,
previous related projects and proposed staff.
      (7)   The selection committee shall evaluate each submitting firm in view
of:
         a.   Past performance;
         b.   Ability of professional personnel proposed for the project;
         c.   Location;
         d.   Recent, current and project work loads of the firm; and
         e.   Related experience on similar projects.
   Based upon these evaluations, the selection committee shall select the two
(2) or three (3) firms which, in its judgment, are the most qualified, ranking
in priority order.
      (8)   The selection committee shall submit its written report ranking the
recommended firms to the county council or designated committee for its
evaluation and approval. When it is determined by the council that the ranking
report is final, written notification of the election and order of preference
shall be immediately sent to all of those who responded to the selection
committee's invitation to submit information.
      (9)   The council, or its designee shall negotiate a contract for
services with the most qualified firm at a compensation which is fair and
reasonable to the county. Should the council or its designee be unable to
negotiate a satisfactory contract with this firm, negotiations shall be
formally terminated. Negotiations shall commence in the same manner with the
second and then the third most qualified until a satisfactory contract has been
negotiated. If no agreement is reached with one (1) of the two (2) additional
firms, negotiations shall then be held with the remaining firms, in order of
their competence and qualifications, in the same manner until an agreement is
reached.
      (10)   Engineering firms interested in providing professional services to
Richland County shall submit their qualifications, together with a list of the
types of work for which they would like to be considered, to the county
procurement office. Thereafter, the procurement office shall compile and
maintain an up-to-date list of such firms. A firm may up-date its
qualifications whenever it deems such action necessary.
      (11)   Whenever engineering services are required for a particular
project, a scope of services shall be prepared and advertised for a period of
fifteen (15) days. Any firm which is interested in providing the service shall
submit a letter stating that it wishes to be considered on the basis of its
qualifications on file in the procurement office.
      (12)   A selection committee, established in the same manner as provided
herein for the procurement of all other professional services, shall meet and
select the three most qualified firms, in order of preference, in accordance
with the criteria established in (7) above.
      (13)   Thereafter, the selection committee shall begin negotiations with
the first choice. If a fee acceptable to both parties can be negotiated, a
contract with that firm shall be submitted to the county council. If such a fee
is not negotiated, the committee shall thereafter commence negotiations with
the next choice until an acceptable fee is negotiated.
      (14)   The contract shall thereafter be submitted to the county council
through the normal procedures utilized at the time of submission. If the
council rejects the contract, the committee shall thereafter commence
negotiations with the next choice.

Sec. 2-601. Competitive sealed proposals.
   Competitive sealed proposals and requests for proposals may be used in the
procurement of goods, services, and construction in the manner provided for
herein.
      (1)   Conditions for use. When the county administrator determines that
the use of competitive sealed bidding in procurement of particular goods,
services, or construction is either not practicable or not advantageous to the
county, it shall instruct the director of procurement or such other persons or
entities as designated by the county council to utilize the competitive sealed
proposals procedure established herein to contract for and procure the
particular goods, services or construction required by the county.
      (2)   Request for proposals. Proposals shall be solicited from at least
three (3) qualified sources, when such sources are reasonably available,
through requests for proposal. A "request for proposals" is a written or
published solicitation for proposals to provide goods, services, or
construction, as described therein. Evaluation factors upon which the proposals
will be evaluated for award of the contract shall be stated in the request for
proposals. Price shall be one of the evaluation factors but it shall not be the
sole basis for award of the contract.
      (3)   Public notice. Public notice of the request for proposals shall be
given at a reasonable time prior to the date set forth therein for the receipt
of proposals. Such notice may include utilization of the vendors list or
publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
      (4)   Receipt of proposals. Proposals shall be opened publicly in the
presence of one (1) or more witnesses at the time and place designated in the
request for proposals. Only the names of the offering vendors shall be
disclosed at the proposal opening. Contents of the proposals shall not be
disclosed during the negotiation process. Proposals shall be open for public
inspection after contract award, except that proprietary or confidential
information in any proposal that is clearly marked "confidential" by the
offering vendor shall not be disclosed without written consent of the offering
vendor.
      (5)   Evaluation factors. The request for proposals shall state the
relative importance of price and of each other evaluation factor but shall not
require numerical weightings of each factor. The evaluation factors shall be
examined with respect to each proposal in determining which proposal is most
advantageous to the county. There are no restrictions on the kind or number of
evaluation factors that may be used, as long as they are stated in the request
for proposals and relate to the purpose of the procurement.
      (6)   Discussions with responsive and responsible offering vendors and
revisions to proposals. Discussions may be conducted with any vendors
submitting a proposal that appears eligible for contract award (based upon the
evaluation factors) for the purpose of clarification to assure full
understanding of and responsiveness to the requirements of the request for
proposals. A contract may be negotiated after an unsuccessful request for
proposal at any time before an award is made provided that:
         a.   Each offering vendor who submitted a proposal under the original
solicitation is notified and given reasonable opportunity to negotiate;
         b.   The negotiated price must be within the limits of available funds
as determined by the county council or its designee.
   Offering vendors shall be accorded fair and equal treatment with respect to
any opportunity for discussion and revision of proposals. Revisions in
proposals may be permitted after their submission and prior to contract award
for the purpose of obtaining best and final offers. In conducting negotiations,
there must be no disclosure of any information derived from proposals submitted
by competing offering vendors.
      (7)   Award. Subject to any exceptions found in this article, the award
shall be made to the responsive and responsible offering vendor whose proposal
is determined to be the most advantageous to the county, taking into
consideration price and the other evaluation factors set forth in the request
for proposals. If the county council or its designee should determine that none
of the proposals is advantageous to the county, the county shall have the
absolute right to reject any and all proposals. The contract file shall contain
the basis on which the award is made and be sufficient to satisfy external
audit.

92, § IV, 3-18-92)
§ 2-602 Local vendor preference.
   (a)   Richland County shall apply a local vendor preference (LVP) to all
solicitations, subject to the exclusions herein provided. If a solicitation
specifies the LVP applies to that procurement, the applicability of the
preference to that procurement is conclusively determined by the solicitation.
   (b)   When evaluating pricing for purposes of making an award determination,
the procurement officer shall decrease by five (5%) percent the price of any
bid when the bidder qualifies for the local vendor preference (LVP).
      (1)   A bidder is not qualified for the LVP unless the bidder makes an
affirmative request for the preference as required in the solicitation.
         a.   By submitting a bid and requesting that the LVP be applied to
that bid, a bidder certifies that its bid qualifies for the preference for that
procurement.
         b.   If a bidder is requesting the LVP, the bidder, upon request of
the procurement officer, must provide documentation that establishes the
bidder's qualifications for the preference. Bidder's failure to provide this
information promptly is grounds to deny the preference.
      (2)   Improperly requesting the LVP may result in the bid being deemed
non-responsive, non-responsible and disqualified.
      (3)   If two (2) or more bidders are tied after the application of the
preference, the tie must be resolved by the flip of a coin by the Richland
County procurement director (or his/her designee) and witnessed by the
procurement officer who conducted the solicitation. All bidders who responded
to the solicitation must be invited to attend.
   (c)   A vendor or bidder qualifies for the local vendor preference if it:
      (1)   Maintains an office in Richland County. For the purposes of this
section only, an office is defined as a non-mobile place for the regular
transaction of business or performance of a particular service which has been
operated as such by the bidder or vendor for at least one (1) year before the
bid opening; and
      (2)   Has a valid Richland County business license which was issued at
least twelve (12) months prior to the bid opening date; and
      (3)   Provides proof of payment of all applicable Richland County taxes
and fees, including but not limited to, business license fees, business
personal property taxes, and real property taxes.
      (4)   The submitted bid meets all other requirements of responsiveness
and responsibility as defined in this article.
   (d)   The LVP shall not apply to:
      (1)   An award or bid when the total dollar value of the bid is less than
ten thousand ($10,000) dollars;
      (2)   A single unit of an item with a price in excess of twenty-five
thousand ($25,000) dollars or a single award with a total potential value in
excess of two hundred thousand ($200,000) dollars; or
      (3)   An acquisition of motor vehicles as defined in S.C. Code 1976, §
56-15-10 in the South Carolina Consolidated Procurement Code.

Sec. 2-608. Invitation to bid.
   When this procedure is utilized and the estimated cost exceeds fifteen
thousand dollars ($15,000.00), an award based upon an invitation to bid shall
be made according to prescribed procedures from the lowest responsive and
responsible vendor after due notice inviting bids.
   (a)   Notice inviting bids. The director of procurement shall invite bids
through the following methods:
      (1)   Advertisement on a form prescribed by the Richland County
procurement regulations in a newspaper of general circulation in the county,
giving a brief description of the things to be purchased, the time and place
where bids will be opened, and a location or telephone number where bid blanks
and complete specifications may be secured;
      (2)   Posting on a bulletin board at the county courthouse or office of
procurement all the above information, including complete specifications; and
      (3)   Written invitations to bid mailed to all appropriate vendors
included in the vendors list (numbering at least three (3)). The notice
inviting bids shall set forth in detail all requirements and conditions which
will be considered in awarding the contract.
   (b)   Submission of bids. All bids shall be on an official bid form provided
by the office of procurement and shall be sealed and mailed or otherwise
delivered to the director of procurement by the time specified in the
invitation to bid. Late bids shall not be considered unless the delay was
caused by improper handling by county employees. All bids shall be accompanied
by a statement of noncollusion from the vendor.
   (c)   Bid surety. The director of procurement may at his discretion require
a certified or cashier's check or bond as surety; provided, however, that, such
requirement shall be publicized in the invitation to bid and shall apply
equally to all vendors for a given purchase.
   (d)   Opening of bids. All bids shall be opened publicly and tabulated. Such
tabulation shall be available for public inspection during normal business
hours for at least thirty (30) days after the opening of bids.
   (e)   Award of contract. Subject to any exceptions found elsewhere in this
article, all contracts shall be awarded to the lowest responsive and
responsible vendor whose bid complies materially with the specifications
publicized. The director of procurement may, however, refuse all bids and
readvertise for bids, if the public interest would be served thereby; provided,
however, that, if the director of procurement shall refuse all bids, he shall
submit to the county administrator a written explanation of the reasons
therefor.
   (f)   The bids. Before opening of bids, the director of procurement shall
specify a method for awarding contracts if the lowest responsive and
responsible bids are identical in material detail. Such method shall be
approved by the director of procurement but shall otherwise remain confidential
pending the opening of bids. Such method shall be designed to discourage
collusion and restrictions on competition; provided, however, that, if time and
the public interest permit, the director of procurement may readvertise for
bids instead of deciding among identical bids. If the director of procurement
does not suspect that the bids are a result of collusion, he may award the
contract to the firm located, or to the vendor offering goods produced, in the
county.
   (g)   Forfeiture of bid surety. If the successful vendor does not enter into
a contract within ten (10) days after mailing of notice of award of contract,
he shall forfeit any surety which accompanied his bid, unless the county is
responsible for the delay. He shall also be held liable for any cost in excess
of his bid price which the county incurs in purchasing the goods or services
elsewhere.

Sec. 2-609. Contracts, purchases and sales--Open market procedure.
   Subject to any exceptions allowed elsewhere in this article, when an
invitation to bid is utilized for the purchases of supplies, materials,
equipment or contractual services and the estimated costs exceed fifteen
hundred dollars ($1,500.00) but does not exceed fifteen thousand dollars
($15,000.00), the director of procurement shall comply with the procedures
described in section
2-608 of this article except in the following respects: The director of
procurement shall not be required to advertise publicly to invite bids.
Instead, the director of procurement shall invite all appropriate vendors
included in the vendors list (numbering at least three (3)), to submit written
bids; provided, however, that, the director of procurement, may, at his
discretion, require formal notice when such procedure is in the public
interest.

Sec. 2-610. Same--Solicitation of quotations.
   Subject to any exceptions allowed elsewhere in this article, when an
invitation to bid is utilized for the purchase of supplies, materials,
equipment, or contractual services and the estimated cost exceeds five hundred
dollars ($500.00) but does not exceed fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500.00), the
director of procurement can make solicitations of quotations by telephone. The
director of procurement shall contact vendors on the vendors list (numbering at
least three (3)), and purchase the required goods or services from the lowest
responsive and responsible vendor. The procedure described in sections
2-608 and 2-609 shall not be required; provided, however, that, the director of
procurement may require that vendors submit written bids when such procedure is
in the public interest.

Sec. 2-611. Same--Purchases through central state purchasing office.
   As an alternative to the procedures described elsewhere in this article, the
director of procurement may purchase any supplies, materials, equipment or
contractual services through the central state purchasing office of the
division of general services; provided, however, that, any such purchases
estimated to cost in excess of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) shall be
approved by the county administrator.

Sec. 2-612. Same--Purchase negotiations.
   (a)   Generally. In case of emergencies, or when lack of price or product
competition renders the purposes of competitive procurement ineffective, the
director of procurement may purchase supplies, materials, equipment, or
contractual services through negotiation with the vendor.
   (b)   Approval required. Purchase by negotiation shall be made only upon the
approval of the director of procurement when such purchases are estimated to
cost in excess of fifteen hundred dollars ($1,500.00) and only upon the
approval of the county administrator when such purchases are estimated to cost
in excess of fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00).
   (c)   When permissible. Purchase by negotiation shall be made only when one
(1) of the following conditions occurs:
      (1)   Items are obtained from only one (1) source, and there are not
acceptable equivalents;
      (2)   Bids or proposals are received, but prices are unreasonable;
      (3)   Emergencies exist. Emergencies shall be deemed to exist when a
breakdown in machinery or in an essential service occurs, or when unforseen
circumstances arise, including delays by contractors, delays in transportation,
or unanticipated volume of work. In such cases, awards can be made without
notice of intent as required in paragraph (e) of this section;
      (4)   A contract already exists on a family of items that must be
compatible;
      (5)   Repair and replacement parts of accessories peculiar to specialized
equipment are needed;

invitation or request for proposal;
      (10)   a.   A contract for residential solid waste collection may be

received by County staff that was investigated and found to be inaccurate in

at curbside in a timely manner.
            3.   "Service Report Card" means a monthly compilation of all
service-related complaints received by County staff that were investigated
regarding performance by a Curbside Collection Contractor regarding the
performance of the service for which they are engaged.
            4.   "Valid complaint" means a service-related complaint received
by County staff that was investigated and found to be accurate in fact
regarding a Curbside Collection Contractor in the performance of the service
for which they are engaged. Correction of the complaint before close of
business on the designated collection day negates its occurrence.
   (d)   Records. Written records shall be maintained for a period of three (3)
years of all negotiated bids and proposals. Such records shall include the name
of the vendor, the amount of purchase, the equipment or supplies purchased and
a justification for the negotiated bid or proposal.

DIVISION 7. SMALL BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROCUREMENT REQUIREMENTS
Sec. 2-639. General provisions.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this division is to provide a race- and
gender-neutral procurement tool for the county to use in its efforts to ensure
that all segments of its local business community have a reasonable and
significant opportunity to participate in county contracts for construction,
architectural and engineering services, professional services, non-professional
services, and commodities. The small local business enterprise ("SLBE") Program
also furthers the county's public interest to foster effective broad-based
competition from all segments of the vendor community, including, but not
limited to, minority business enterprises, small business enterprises, and
local business enterprises. This policy is, in part, intended to further the
county's compelling interest in ensuring that it is neither an active nor
passive participant in private sector marketplace discrimination, and in
promoting equal opportunity for all segments of the contracting community to
participate in county contracts. Moreover, the SLBE program provides additional
avenues for the development of new capacity and new sources of competition for
county contracts from the growing pool of small and locally based businesses.
   (b)   Scope and limitations. This SLBE program may be applied by the county
on a contract-by-contract basis to the maximum practicable extent permissible
under federal and state law.
   (c)   Definitions.
      Affirmative procurement initiatives. Refers to any procurement tool to
enhance contracting opportunities for SLBE firms including: bonding/ insurance
waivers, bid incentives, price preferences, sheltered market, mandatory
subcontracting, competitive business development demonstration projects, and
SLBE evaluation preference points in the scoring of proposal evaluations.
      Award. The final selection of a bidder or offeror for a specified prime
contract or subcontract dollar amount. Awards are made by the county to prime
contractors or vendors or by prime contractors or vendors to subcontractors or
sub-vendors, usually pursuant to an open invitation to bid ("ITB") or request
for proposal ("RFP") process. (Contract awards are to be distinguished from
contract payments in that they only reflect the anticipated dollar amounts
instead of actual dollar amounts that are to be paid to a bidder or offeror
under an awarded contract.)
      Bid incentives. Additional inducements or enhancements in the bidding
process that are designed to increase the chances for the selection of SLBE
firms in competition with other firms. These bid incentives may be applied to
all solicitations, contracts, and letter agreements for the purchase of
architectural and engineering services, construction, professional services,
non-professional services, and commodities including change orders and
amendments.
      Centralized bidder registration system ("CBR"). A web-based software
application used by the County of Richland to track and monitor SLBE
availability and utilization (i.e., "spend" or "payments") on county contracts.
      County. Refers to the County of Richland, South Carolina.
      Commercially useful function. An SLBE performs a commercially useful
function when it is responsible for execution of the work of the contract and
is carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing, and
supervising the work involved. To perform a commercially useful function, the
SLBE must also be responsible, with respect to materials and supplies used on
the contract, for negotiating price, determining quantity and quality, ordering
the material, and installing (where applicable) and paying for the material
itself. To determine whether an SLBE is performing a commercially useful
function, an evaluation must be performed of the amount of work subcontracted,
normal industry practices, whether the amount the SLBE firm is to be paid under
the contract is commensurate with the work it is actually performing and the
SLBE credit claimed for its performance of the work, and other relevant
factors. Specifically, an SLBE does not perform a commercially useful function
if its role is limited to that of an extra participant in a transaction,
contract, or project through which funds are passed in order to obtain the
appearance of meaningful and useful SLBE participation, when in similar
transactions in which SLBE firms do not participate, there is no such role
performed.
      Emerging SLBE. An emerging firm that meets all of the qualifications of a
small local business enterprise, and that is less than five (5) years old, but
has no more than five (5) full-time employees and annual gross sales as
averaged over the life of the firm that are less than one million ($1,000,000)
dollars.
      Goal. A non-mandatory annual aspirational percentage goal for SLBE
contract participation is established each year for architectural and
engineering services, construction, professional services, non-professional
services, and commodities contracts. Mandatory percentage goals for SLBE
subcontract participation may be established on a contract- by-contract basis
by either the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity or a goal
setting committee.
      Goal setting committee. A committee established by the director of the
Office of Small Business Opportunity for the county (including a representative
of the procurement department and a representative of the end-user agency) and
chaired by the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity that
establishes SLBE program goals and selects appropriate SLBE affirmative
procurement initiatives to be applied to each contract for the county based
upon industry categories, vendor availability, and project-specific
characteristics. The director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity may
establish as many as five (5) separate goal setting committees (i.e., one (1)
for each industry category).
      Good faith efforts. Documentation of the bidder’s intent to comply with
SLBE program goals and procedures, including, but not limited to the following:
(1) documentation within a bid submission or proposal reflecting the bidder’s
commitment to comply with SLBE program goals as established by the director of
the Office of Small Business Opportunity or a goal setting committee for a
particular contract; or (2) documentation of efforts made towards achieving the
SLBE program goals (e.g., timely advertisements in appropriate trade
publications and publications of wide general circulation; timely posting of
SLBE subcontract opportunities on the county web site; solicitations of bids
from all qualified SLBE firms listed in the county’s SLBE directory of
certified SLBE firms; correspondence from qualified SLBE firms documenting
their unavailability to perform SLBE contracts; documentation of efforts to
subdivide work into smaller quantities for subcontracting purposes to SLBE
firms; documentation of efforts to assist SLBE firms with obtaining financing,
bonding, or insurance required by the bidder; and documentation of
consultations with trade associations and consultants that represent the
interests of small and local businesses in order to identify qualified and
available SLBE subcontractors.)
      Graduation. An SLBE firm permanently graduates from the county's SLBE
program when it meets the criteria for graduation set forth in this policy.
      Independently owned, managed, and operated. Ownership of an SLBE firm
must be direct, independent, and by individuals only. Business firms that are
owned by other businesses or by the principals or owners of other businesses
that cannot themselves qualify under the SLBE eligibility requirements shall
not be eligible to participate in the SLBE program. Moreover, the day-to-day
management of the SLBE firm must be direct and independent of the influence of
any other businesses that cannot themselves qualify under the SLBE eligibility
requirements.
      Industry categories. Procurement groupings for county contracts for
purposes of the administration of affirmative procurement initiatives shall be
inclusive of architectural and engineering, construction, professional
services, and nonprofessional services, and commodities procurements. Industry
categories may also be referred to as "business categories."
      Joint venture. An association of two (2) or more persons or businesses
carrying out a single business enterprise for which purpose they combine their
capital, efforts, skills, knowledge and/or property. Joint ventures must be

      Professional services. Any non-construction and non-architectural and
engineering services that require highly specialized training and/or licensed
credentials to perform, such as legal, accounting, scientific, technical,

the invitation to bid or request for proposal and shall include compliance with
SLBE program requirements.

through race- and gender- neutral means, any disparities in the participation
of minority business enterprises or women business enterprises on county
contracts;
      (2)   Regular evaluation regarding the progress of the program using
accumulated availability and utilization data to determine specific program

provide guidance on the implementation of the rules under this policy;
      (4)   Continuous review and advice of the GSC in administering the policy
and goals herein. The county’s director of the Office of Small Business

procurement director. The procurement director shall also appoint the remaining
members of the GSC from the county’s procurement personnel and other county
departments affected by this program; and
      (5)   Providing accountability and accuracy in setting goals and in
reporting program results through the implementation of a mandatory centralized
bidder registration process capable of identifying with specificity the
universe of firms that are available and interested in bidding on and/or
performing on county contracts, and of providing the means of tracking actual
county bids, contract awards, and prime contract and subcontract payments to
registered bidders on the basis of firm ownership status, commodity or sub-
industry codes, firm location, and firm size. Accordingly, prime contractors
and subcontractors will be required to register and input data into the CBR or
other related forms and systems as a condition of engaging in business with the
county.
   (b)   At a minimum, the procurement director shall:
      (1)   Report to the county administrator and the county council on at
least an annual basis as to the county's progress towards satisfying SLBE
program objectives;
      (2)   Formulate program waivers, improvements and adjustments to the GSC
goal-setting methodology and other program functions;
      (3)   Have substantive input in a contract specification review process
to be undertaken in advance of the issuance of county's RFPs and bid
solicitations to ensure that contract bid specifications are not unnecessarily
restrictive and unduly burdensome to small, local, minority- owned, and other
businesses;
      (4)   Receive and analyze external and internal information including
statistical data and anecdotal testimonies it deems appropriate to effectively
accomplish its duties; and
      (5)   Monitor and support the implementation of the rules under this
program, and where appropriate, make recommendations to the county
administrator for approval of changes to established size standards for SLBE
firms, and provide notice of all approved changes to the county council.
   (c)   At a minimum, each goal setting committee shall:
      (1)   Meet as often as it deems necessary to accomplish its duties but
not less than twice annually;
      (2)   Develop the SLBE goal setting methodology to be implemented by the
director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity on a contract-by-contract

enterprises as adopted and periodically amended in the SLBE schedule of size
standard eligibility requirements;
      Once the gross annual revenues of a business exceed the three (3)-year
average gross annual revenue limits, it should no longer be eligible to benefit
as an SLBE firm and should be permanently graduated from the program. The size
standards in number of employees and annual gross revenue dollars should be
reviewed annually and adjusted periodically to meet changes in market
conditions. Joint ventures must be certified on a bid-by-bid basis. The joint

venture must be certified by the procurement department as an SLBE in order for
the joint venture to receive the benefits of the SLBE program;
      (3)   The firm is a local business enterprise as defined in this division
with a principal place of business or significant employee presence or
significant business presence in Richland County as defined herein;

the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity or designated
procurement department staff shall review all enclosed forms affidavits and
documentation to make a prima facie determination as to whether the applicant
satisfies the SLBE eligibility requirements as set forth in this policy.
Applicants determined ineligible to participate as a SLBE shall receive a
letter from the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity stating
the basis for the denial of eligibility. Applicants determined ineligible shall
not be eligible to submit a new application for one (1) year after the date of
the notice of denial of eligibility.
   (c)   Applicants determined eligible to participate in the SLBE program

affirmative procurement initiatives in the following fiscal year so long as the
firm has not yet satisfied the graduation criteria;
      (4)   An SLBE firm may have its SLBE eligibility permanently revoked by
the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity if it fails to perform
a commercially useful function under a contract, or if it allows its SLBE
status to be fraudulently used for the benefit of a non-SLBE firm or the owners
of a non-SLBE firm so as to provide the non-SLBE firm or firm owners benefits
from affirmative procurement initiatives for which the non-SLBE firm and its
owners would not otherwise be entitled;
      (5)   An emerging SLBE firm shall be permanently graduated from emerging
SLBE status after it has received a cumulative total of two and one-half
million ($2,500,00) dollars of county-funded prime contracts or subcontract
payments in at least five (5) separate contracts since its initial
certification as an emerging SLBE firm;
      (6)   An emerging SLBE firm shall be permanently graduated from emerging
SLBE status once its three (3)-year average annual gross sales exceeds two
million ($2,000,000) dollars; and
      (7)   An emerging SLBE firm shall be temporarily suspended from emerging
SLBE status by the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity for the
balance of any fiscal year after it has received a cumulative total of seven
hundred fifty thousand ($750,000) dollars in payments as a prime contractor
and/or subcontractor for that fiscal year; provided, however, that the emerging
SLBE firm shall be eligible to continue participating in affirmative
procurement initiatives as an SLBE firm for the remainder of the fiscal year,
and may also participate in affirmative procurement initiatives as an emerging
SLBE firm in the following fiscal year so long as the firm has not yet
satisfied the graduation criteria for such status.
   (b)   The director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity shall provide
written notice to the SLBE firm or emerging SLBE firm upon graduation or
suspension from the SLBE program, and such notice shall clearly state the

(Ord. No. 049-13HR, § II, 9-17-13; Ord. No. 058-16HR, § III, 12-6-16)
Sec. 2-644. Affirmative procurement initiatives for enhancing SLBE and emerging
SLBE contract participation.
   (a)   The county in conjunction with the appropriate contract officer and
the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity may utilize the
following affirmative procurement initiatives in promoting the award of county
contracts to SLBEs or emerging SLBEs.
      (1)   Bonding and insurance waiver. The county, at its discretion, may
waive or reduce the bonding, or insurance requirements depending on the type of
contract and whether the county determines that the bonding and or insurance
requirements would deny the SLBE or emerging SLBE an opportunity to perform the
contract which the SLBE or emerging SLBE has shown itself otherwise capable of
performing.
      (2)   Price preferences. The county may award a contract to a SLBE or
emerging SLBE which submits a bid within ten percent (10%) (inclusive) of a low
bid by a non-SLBE. However, this price preference would not apply if the award
to the SLBE would result in a total contract cost that is, on an annual basis,
more than twenty- five thousand ($25,000) dollars higher than the low bid; nor
would it apply on a contract in which the total contract cost would exceed the
county's budgeted price for the contract.
      (3)   Evaluation preferences. The county may reserve up to twenty percent
(20%) of the total points available for evaluation purposes for respondents to
an RFP to firms that are certified as SLBE or emerging SLBE firms, or to joint
ventures that have SLBE and/or emerging SLBE partners:
         a.   For architectural and engineering, professional services, other
services, and design/build or CM at risk contracts that are awarded based on
evaluation criteria, there shall be SLBE or emerging SLBE participation
criterion for all contracts let at predetermined percentage of the total points
awarded. The determination will be made using the suggested model outlined in
the Point Evaluation Table below:
POINT EVALUATION TABLE
10 Points for SLBE Participation 20 Points for SLBE Participation
POINT EVALUATION TABLE
10 Points for SLBE Participation 20 Points for SLBE Participation
> 51% =10 points                 >51% = 20 points
> 45% = 7 points                 > 45% =17 points
> 40% = 6 points                 > 40% =16 points
> 35% = 5 points                 > 35% =14 points
> 30% = 4 points                 > 30% =12 points
> 25% = 3 points                 > 25% =10 points
> 20% = 2 points                 > 20% = 8 points
> 15% = 1 point                  > 15% = 6 points
                                 > 10% = 4 points
 
         Contractors may be evaluated on their SLBE or emerging SLBE
participation by utilizing the following schedule, which is most often used by
architectural and engineering:
 
 
Points Awarded % of Participation Criteria
5.0    51- 1Proposals by registered SLBE owned and/or controlled firms
4.0   36-50 Majority prime with registered SLBE participation
3.0   30-35 Majority prime with registered SLBE participation
2.0   24-29 Majority prime with registered SLBE participation
0   0-23    Less than the goal for registered SLBE participation
 
   (4)   Mandatory subcontracting.
      a.   The goal selection committee may, on a contract-by-contract basis,
at its discretion, require that a predetermined percentage of a specific
contract, up to forty percent (40%), be subcontracted to eligible SLBEs or to
eligible emerging SLBEs, provided however, that if the prime contractor is a
certified SLBE or emerging SLBE, then the prime contractor shall be able to
count the dollar value of the work performed by its own forces towards
satisfaction of the mandatory subcontracting goal for that contract.
      b.   An SLBE or emerging SLBE prime contractor may not subcontract more
than forty-nine percent (49%) of the contract value to a non-SLBE.
      c.   A prospective bidder on a county contract shall submit at the time
of bid SLBE - Form S providing the name of the SLBE or emerging SLBE
subcontractor or subcontractors and describing both the percentage of
subcontracting by the SLBE or emerging SLBE, and the work to be performed by
the SLBE or emerging SLBE. A bidder may request a full or partial waiver of
this mandatory subcontracting requirement from the director of the Office of
Small Business Opportunity for good cause by submitting the SLBE unavailability
certification form to the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity
at the time of bid. Under no circumstances shall a waiver of a mandatory
subcontracting requirement be granted without submission of adequate
documentation of good faith efforts by the bidder and careful review by the
director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity. The director of the
Office of Small Business Opportunity shall base his or her determination on a
waiver request on the following criteria:
         1.   Whether the requestor of the waiver has made good faith efforts
to subcontract with qualified and available SLBEs or emerging SLBEs;
         2.   Whether subcontracting would be inappropriate and/or not provide
a "commercially useful function" under the circumstances of the contract; and
         3.   Whether there are no certified SLBE or emerging SLBE firms that
are qualified and available to provide the goods or services required.
      d.   In the absence of a waiver granted by the director of the Office of
Small Business Opportunity, failure of a prime contractor to commit in its bid
or proposal to satisfying the mandatory SLBE subcontracting goal shall render
its bid or proposal non-responsive.
      e.   In the absence of a waiver granted by the director of the Office of
Small Business Opportunity, failure of a prime contractor to attain a mandatory
subcontracting goal for SLBE participation in the performance of its awarded
contract shall be grounds for termination of existing contracts with the
county, debarment from performing future county contracts, and/or any other
remedies available under the terms of its contract with the county or under the
law.
      f.   A prime contractor is required to notify and obtain written approval
from the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity in advance of any
reduction in subcontract scope, termination, or substitution for a designated
SLBE or emerging SLBE subcontractor. Failure to do so shall constitute a
material breach of its contract with the county.
   (5)   Sheltered market.
      a.   The director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity and the
appropriate county contracting officer may select certain contracts which have
a contract value of five hundred thousand ($500,000) dollars or less for award
to a SLBE or a joint venture with a SLBE through the sheltered market program.
Similarly, the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity and the
appropriate county contracting officer may select certain contracts that have a
value of fifty thousand ($50,000) dollars or less for award to an emerging SLBE
firm through the sheltered market program.
      b.   In determining whether a particular contract is eligible for the
sheltered market program, the county’s contracting officer and director of the
Office of Small Business Opportunity shall consider: whether there are at least
three (3) SLBEs or emerging SLBEs that are available and capable to participate
in the sheltered market program for that contract; the degree of
underutilization of the SLBE and emerging SLBE prime contractors in the
specific industry categories; and the extent to which the county’s SLBE and
emerging SLBE prime contractor utilization goals are being achieved.
      c.   If a responsive and responsible bid or response is not received for
a contract that has been designated for the sheltered market program or the
apparent low bid is determined in the procurement director’s discretion to be
too high in price, the contract shall be removed from the sheltered market
program for purposes of rebidding.
   (6)   Competitive business development demonstration project.
      a.   With the concurrence of the director of the Office of Small Business
Opportunity, the appropriate county contracting officer may reserve certain
contracts for placement into a competitive business development demonstration
project (“CBD demonstration project”) wherein those contracts require the
purchase of goods or services from an industry that routinely has too few
sources of bidders to provide meaningful or sufficient competition for such
county contracts. The purpose for the placement of a contract into the CBD
demonstration project shall be to encourage the development of new capacity
within an industry to competitively bid on the future supply of specialized
goods or services to the county.
      b.   Contracts reserved for CBD demonstration projects shall be subject
to a request for proposals process whereby the selected firm will be required
to be a joint venture between an established firm or experts in that relevant
industry and an SLBE firm. The scope of work for the selected joint venture
shall include teaching a hands-on curriculum to SLBE firms that have expressed
an interest in diversifying into the relevant industry, in addition to
performing the customary functions of the contract. This curriculum shall
include both administrative skills (e.g. cost estimating, bidding, staffing,
project management) and technical skills (e.g., hands-on demonstration of how
to perform necessary tasks in the field) required to qualify for future county
contracts and to successfully compete in the industry.
      c.   The director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity shall be
required to select SLBE candidate firms for participation on such CBD
demonstration projects on the basis of an assessment of their current
capabilities and their likely success in diversifying into the new relevant
industry once given technical assistance, training, and an opportunity to
develop a performance track record in the industry.

Sec. 2-645. SLBE program performance review.
   (a)   The director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity or designee
shall monitor the - implementation of this policy and the progress of this
program. On at least an annual basis, the director of the Office of Small
Business Opportunity or designee shall report to the county administrator and
county council on the progress of achieving the goals established for awards to
certified SLBE and emerging SLBE firms, reporting both dollars awarded and
expended. In addition, the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity
or designee shall report on the progress in achieving the stated program
objectives, including, but not limited to, enhancing competition, establishing
and building new business capacity, and removing barriers to and eliminating
disparities in the utilization of available minority business enterprises and
women business enterprises on county contracts.
   (b)   The county shall periodically review the SLBE program to determine
whether the various contracting procedures used to enhance SLBE contract
participation need to be adjusted or used more or less aggressively in future
years to achieve the stated program objectives. The county council shall
conduct a public hearing at least once every two years in order to solicit
public comments on the program.

Sec. 2-646. Conflicts.
   To the extent language in this division conflicts with other language in
Article X, the language in this division controls only with respect to
contracts wherein the small local business enterprise program is being applied
by the director of the Office of Small Business Opportunity. In all other
respects, prior language in this article shall remain in full force and effect.
(Ord. No. 049-13HR, § II, 9-17-13; Ord. No. 058-16HR, § III, 12-6-16)
DIVISION 8. COMMERCIAL NONDISCRIMINATION ORDINANCE
Sec. 2-647. General provisions.
   (a)   Statement of policy. It is the policy of the county not to enter into
a contract or to be engaged in a business relationship with any business entity
that has discriminated in the solicitation, selection, hiring or commercial
treatment of vendors, suppliers, subcontractors or commercial customers on the
basis of race, color, religion, ancestry or national origin, sex, age, marital
status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or on the basis of disability or
any otherwise unlawful use of characteristics regarding the vendor's,
supplier's or commercial customer's employees or owners; provided that nothing
in this policy shall be construed to prohibit or limit otherwise lawful efforts
to remedy the effects of discrimination that have occurred or are occurring in
the relevant marketplace.
   (b)   Implementation. The small local business enterprise division shall
implement this ordinance by periodically conducting outreach and distributing
educational materials to the county's contracting and vendor community and
related trade associations to advise such contractors, vendors and prospective
offerors of this ordinance and the procedures to be followed in submitting
complaints alleging violations of this ordinance. The director of procurement,
in consultation with the county attorney, shall promulgate regulations and
procedures to establish due process for the filing of complaints pursuant to
this ordinance, as well as for the investigation of complaints, the conduct of
administrative hearings, the issuance of factual determinations, the
establishment of an appeals process, and the establishment and application of
sanctions and other remedies pursuant to this ordinance. In addition, the
county administrator or designee, the director of procurement, and the county
attorney's office shall insure that the following commercial nondiscrimination
clause language is set forth in, and incorporated into, all the county
contracts that result from formally advertised solicitations:
      (1)   Every contract and subcontract shall contain a nondiscrimination
clause that reads as follows:
         As a condition of entering into this agreement, the Contractor
represents and warrants that it will comply with the County's Commercial
Nondiscrimination Ordinance, as described under Section
2-647 of the Richland County Code of Ordinances. As part of such compliance,
the Contractor shall not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion,
ancestry or national origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation,
gender identity, or on the basis of disability or other unlawful forms of
discrimination in the solicitation, selection, hiring or commercial treatment
of subcontractors, vendors, suppliers, or commercial customers, nor shall the
Contractor retaliate against any person for reporting instances of such
discrimination. The Contractor shall provide equal opportunity for
subcontractors, vendors and suppliers to participate in all of its public
sector and private sector subcontracting and supply opportunities, provided
that nothing contained in this clause shall prohibit or limit otherwise lawful
efforts to remedy the effects of marketplace discrimination that have occurred
or are occurring in the County's relevant marketplace. Moreover, the Contractor
affirms that it will cooperate fully with any County inquiries regarding
Contractor's compliance with this Ordinance. The Contractor understands and
agrees that a material violation of this clause shall be considered a material
breach of this agreement and may result in termination of this agreement,
disqualification of the Contractor from participating in County contracts, or
other sanctions. This clause is not enforceable by or for the benefit of, and
creates no obligation to, any third party.
      (2)   All formal solicitations issued for county contracts shall include
the following certification to be completed by the offeror:
         The undersigned Offeror hereby certifies and agrees that the following
information is correct:
         In preparing its response on this project, the Offeror has considered
all proposals submitted from qualified, potential subcontractors and suppliers,
and has not engaged in "discrimination" as defined in the County's Commercial
Nondiscrimination Ordinance, Section
2-647; to wit: discrimination in the solicitation, selection or commercial
treatment of any subcontractor, vendor, supplier or commercial customer on the
basis of race, color, religion, ancestry or national origin, sex, age, marital
status, sexual orientation, gender identity, or on the basis of disability or
other unlawful forms of discrimination. Without limiting the foregoing,
"discrimination" also includes retaliating against any person or other entity
for reporting any incident of "discrimination". Without limiting any other
provision of the solicitation for responses on this project, it is understood
and agreed that, if this certification is false, such false certification will
constitute grounds for the County to reject the response submitted by the
Offeror on this project, and terminate any contract awarded based on the
response. As part of its response, the Offeror shall provide to the County a
list of all instances within the immediate past 4 years where there has been a
final adjudicated determination in a legal or administrative proceeding in the
State of South Carolina that the Offeror discriminated against its
subcontractors, vendors, suppliers or commercial customers, and a description
of the status or resolution of that complaint, including any remedial action
taken. As a condition of submitting a response to the County, the Offeror
agrees to comply with the County's Commercial Nondiscrimination Ordinance,
Section
2-647 of the Richland County Code of Ordinances, and further agrees to fully
cooperate with the County in its inquiries relating to compliance with this
Ordinance.

DIVISION 9. PROMPT PAYMENT REQUIRED
Sec. 2-648. Prompt payment required.
   (a)   Right of county prime contractor and subcontractor to prompt payment.
      (1)   Performance by a prime contractor in accordance with the provisions
of its Richland County contract entitles prime contractor to payment from the
county in a prompt manner. Provided there are no bona fide disputes relating to
the adequacy of performance by the contractor, the county shall pay contractor
no later than thirty (30) days after receipt of a proper invoice from the
contractor that summarizes the services provided or goods delivered to county
by contractor and the cost of same. For each thirty (30)-day interval that
payment from the county is late, contractor shall be entitled to interest
penalty payments from the county equal to five percent (5%) of the late
balance. This late penalty fee payment shall be in addition to the payment of
the undisputed original balance due by the county.
      (2)   Performance by a subcontractor in accordance with the provisions of
its subcontract agreement with county's prime contractor while providing goods
or services on behalf of Richland County entitles subcontractor to payment from
the prime contractor in a prompt manner. Provided there are no bona fide
disputes relating to the adequacy of performance by the subcontractor, the
prime contractor shall pay subcontractor no later than seven (7) days after
prime contractor has received payment from the county for the goods or services
that subcontractor has properly invoiced prime contractor for by summarizing
the goods or services delivered on behalf of the county through the prime
contractor.
         Alternatively, in instances where, through no fault of subcontractor,
prime contractor has not been paid by the county for goods or services rendered
by subcontractor, and more than thirty-seven (37) days have lapsed since prime
contractor received a proper invoice from subcontractor, the prime contractor
shall authorize the county to pay subcontractor's undisputed invoice directly
and to then deduct subcontractor's payment portion from prime contractor's
account receivables due under its contract with the county. For each thirty
(30)-day interval beyond thirty-seven (37) days that payment to subcontractor
is late, subcontractor shall be entitled to an interest penalty fee equal to
five percent (5%) of the late balance. This late penalty fee shall be in
addition to the payment of the undisputed original balance due by the prime
contractor, and shall be payable by either the prime contractor or the county
depending upon which party is responsible for the late payment under these
terms.
      (3)   The county shall place language establishing these prompt payment
terms as described above in (1) and (2) in any county bid solicitation and
resulting contract awarded under county ordinance,
Chapter 2, Administration, Article X, Purchasing, §
2-591 and in each instance wherein the county determines to apply the
provisions of county ordinance,
Chapter 2, Administration, Article X, Purchasing, Division 7 to a solicitation.
In addition, each prime contractor shall be required to include similar prompt
payment flow-down provisions for each tier of subcontractors that perform
services or provide goods on behalf of the county through the prime contractor
or a subcontractor.
      (4)   Any prevailing party that makes a final written demand for payment
and late penalty fees to the responsible party pursuant to this ordinance and
fails to receive payment in full within thirty (30) days, and subsequently
takes legal recourse to enforce these prompt payment provisions, shall also be
entitled to the award of reasonable attorneys' fees by a court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (b)   Grounds on which county, prime contractor, or subcontractor may
withhold application and certification for payment; contract terms unaffected.
      (1)   Nothing in this ordinance prevents the county, the contractor, or a
subcontractor from withholding application and certification for payment
because of the following: unsatisfactory job progress, defective construction
not remedied, disputed work, third party claims filed or reasonable evidence
that claim will be filed, failure of contractor or subcontractor to make timely
payments for labor, equipment, and materials, damage to county, contractor, or
another subcontractor, reasonable evidence that contract or subcontract cannot
be completed for the unpaid balance of the contract or subcontract sum, or a
reasonable amount for retainage.
      (2)   Nothing in this ordinance requires that payments due a contractor
from the county be paid any more frequently than as set forth in the
construction documents, nor shall anything in this ordinance affect the terms
of any agreement between the county and any lender.
   (c)   Failure of contractor or subcontractor to make timely payments. In
addition to the interest on late payments provided in section (a), if any
contractor or subcontractor makes late payments more than three (3) times
during the course of a contract, unless sufficient justification is made to the
county and the county determines not to count the payment as late, the county
can withhold the amount of the late payment due from the contractor to the
subcontractor or to the lower tier subcontractor and make such late payment
directly to the subcontractor or the lower tier subcontractor.

programs to assist citizens with the TNR approach. Facilities, as defined in
this section, means facilities which are not the county's animal care facility,
and are: veterinary hospitals or clinics operated by veterinarians or
facilities operated, owned or maintained by an incorporated humane society or

prior to the conviction to care for the animal and related expenses.

Sec. 6-50. Fees.
   (a)   General. No permit shall be issued until the required fees are paid,

Humanity project.
   (b)   Schedule of fees. Fees for permits, appeals, amendments and other
matters pertaining to this chapter shall be determined by the county council
and set forth in the county’s annual budget ordinance for the current fiscal
year.
   (c)   Demolition of building or structure. A fee shall be paid for
demolition of buildings or structures. No fee shall be paid when the demolition
is being done on a noncommercial basis as a gratuity to the property owner,
provided that said demolition is being done pursuant to the county’s unsafe
building regulations, with the county administrator designated to decide when
such demolition was being done as a gratuity. The provisions of this subsection
shall apply to buildings located in the extreme rural areas of the county only
when a complaint is received and/or when the dwelling presents a health or
safety hazard. For the purposes of this subsection, “extreme rural area” is
defined as those areas zoned as RU under the Richland County Zoning Ordinance,
and/or areas of light or sparse population.
   (d)   Moving of building or structures. A fee shall be paid for a moving
permit as prescribed in the fee schedule for any building or structure. Any
person, firm, corporation or agent who is required to pay a fee as one of the
prerequisites for moving a building or structure shall request escort service
from the sheriff’s department, a the current rate of the sheriff’s special duty
charge, while moving the building or structure over public roads in the
unincorporated area of the county. Proof of coordination or request from the
sheriff’s department for escort service must be presented to the building
official before a building or structure moving permit is issued. Any person who
is required by this subsection to pay a fee as a result of moving a building or
structure, and who shall be issued a moving permit upon payment of such fee
shall be required to present the moving permit when requesting escort services
from the sheriff’s department or upon request of any officer of the sheriff’s
department while the building or structure is in transport. Failure to present
the moving permit will result in the denial of escort services or the denial of
further transport of the building or structure until a moving permit is
secured. A building permit for construction shall also be paid and obtained by
a licensed contractor, with a 120-day completion date from the date of
issuance, prior to the issuance of the moving permit. All buildings or
structures shall be parked so as not to obstruct traffic until a moving permit
is secured. Fees collected shall be deposited in the general fund of the
county. Failure to pay this fee shall result in the denial of escort services
until such time as outstanding bills are paid to the county. Further, no
additional building or structure-moving permits shall be issued until such time
as outstanding bills are paid to the county. Before any person, firm,
corporation or agent causes a structure to be placed on a public road or street
in the unincorporated area of the county during the hours of darkness to be
moved from one location to another, flashing lights shall be installed at five-
foot intervals around the perimeter of the structure. Removal of road signs,
overhead lines, or any items private or public shall be the responsibility of
the moving company for removal and replacement. Any regulations or fees
required to move through any municipality, another county, or within the State
of South Carolina is the responsibility of the moving company.
   (e)   If, in the opinion of the building official, the valuation of the
building, alteration or structure appears to be underestimated on the
application, the permit shall be denied unless the applicant can show detailed
estimated cost to meet the approval of the building official. Permit valuations
shall include total cost, such as plumbing, mechanical equipment and other
systems.
   (f)   Where any construction requiring a permit begun before a permit is
obtained, the permit fee will be doubled. This includes all construction and
apparatus pertaining thereto.

and faithfully observe and perform any provision of its franchise; provided,

periods in the event the franchisee, acting in good faith, experiences delays
by reason of circumstances beyond its control.

company's cable required for service located within the public way or easement
and shall not include length of necessary service drop to the subscriber's home
or premises.
   (b)   No person in the franchisee's service area shall be arbitrarily
refused service; but in recognition of the capital costs involved in unusual

hundred fifty (150) feet, or when a subscriber density exists less than the
density specified hereinabove, or where a customer requests special service,
service may be made available on the basis of costs of materials, labor, and

served by underground utilities, the developer of the subdivision or
development may acquire CATV service for his development under the following
conditions; but otherwise the franchisee shall not be obligated to construct a

substructures, including pedestals, required in accordance with the
franchisee's plans and specifications. In addition to providing plans and
specifications to the developer, the franchisee shall inspect the facilities
required hereunder, and certify to the county prior to final approval of the
subdivision or development that the facilities required herein are properly
installed. The county shall have the right to review and require its approval
of the maps and specifications provided by the franchisee. The cost of that
portion of an extension to a subdivision or development from the franchisee's
existing facilities in excess of two hundred (200) feet outside of the
boundaries of the subdivision or development shall be borne by the developer.

year.
   (c)   The franchisee shall pay the county interest at the legal rate
permissible upon judgment per month for any balance of the franchise fee
payment left unpaid after June thirtieth of any given year. Failure of a
franchisee to pay the fee in full within ninety (90) days after June thirtieth
shall be deemed a default of a material obligation of the franchise. The
franchisee shall pay to the county all costs of collection with respect to fees
in arrears, including but not limited to court costs and reasonable attorney
fees.

over the streets and alleys, and the location of poles, towers, and all other
structures and installations shall be subject to the prior written approval and

   The following words, terms, and phrases, when used in this article shall
have the meaning ascribed herein, except where the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning:
   (1)   Business means a calling, occupation, profession or activity engaged
in with the object of gain, benefit of advantage, either directly or
indirectly. A charitable organization shall be deemed a business unless the

purposes of this article, business does not include a wholesaler who does not
maintain a warehouse or distribution establishment within the County.
   (2)   Charitable organization means a person:
      (a)   determined by the Internal Revenue Service to be a tax exempt
organization pursuant to Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code; or
      (b)   that is or holds itself out to be established for any benevolent,
social welfare, scientific, educational, environmental, philanthropic, humane,
patriotic, public health, civic, or other eleemosynary purpose, or for the
benefit of law enforcement personnel, firefighters, or other persons who
protect the public safety; or
      (c)   that employs a charitable appeal as the basis of solicitation or an
appeal that suggests that there is a charitable purpose to solicitation, or
that solicits or obtains contributions solicited from the public for a
charitable purpose.
   (3)   Charitable purpose means a purpose described in Section 501(c)(3) of
the Internal Revenue Code or a benevolent, social welfare, scientific,
educational, environmental, philanthropic, humane, patriotic, public health,
civic or other eleemosynary objective, including an objective of an
organization of law enforcement personnel, firefighters, or other persons who
protected the public safety if a stated purpose of the solicitations includes a
benefit to a person outside the actual service membership of the organization.
   (4)   Classification means a division of businesses by major groups subject

based on national averages, benefits, equalization of tax burden, relationships

   (5)   Construction Manager means any self-employed individual, firm,
partnership, corporation, or group which supervises or coordinates construction
of any building, highway, sewer, grading, improvement, re-improvement,
structure, or part thereof. Notwithstanding payment of fixed price, commission,

construction contractors for purposes of this article and shall pay a license
fee based upon the total cost of the undertaking supervised or coordinated,
except as otherwise exempted.
   (6)   Contractor means any self-employed individual (not reporting income

excepting income earned outside of the County on which a license tax is paid by
the person or business to some other county or municipality and fully reported
to the County. For a licensee who does not have a domicile in the County,
business done within the County shall include only gross receipts or revenue
received or accrued within the County. In all cases, if the licensee pays a
business license fee to another county or municipality, the taxpayer's gross
income for the purpose of computing the tax within the County must be reduced
by the amount of gross income taxed in the other county or municipality.
         (ii)   Gross income for agents means gross commissions received or

Revenue Service, the South Carolina Department of Revenue, the South Carolina
Department of Insurance, or other governmental agencies.

the materials used, labor or service cost, interest paid, or any other expenses
whatsoever, and without any deductions on account of losses.
   (12)   Insurance company refers to a business which meets the definition
established in South Carolina Code of Laws, § 38-1-20, Definitions; an insurer
defined as "any corporation,... or aggregation of individuals engaging or

(Ord. No. 069-07HR, § I, 7-24-07; Ord. No. 044-08, § I, 7-15-08; Ord. No. 052-
21HR, § I, 11-16-21)
Sec. 16-3. Purpose and Duration.
   (1)   The requirement of a business license is for the purpose of assuring
that a business conducted within unincorporated Richland County complies with
all applicable State and County regulations and requirements in order to
protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the County.
Additionally, the requirement of a business license fee levied by this article
serves to establish an excise tax for the privilege of doing business within
unincorporated Richland County.
   (2)   The license of a licensee who has applied for and received a business
license through December 31, 2021 shall continue until April 30, 2022. Each
license issued thereafter shall be issued for the twelve-month period beginning
May 1 and ending April 30.
   (3)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (2), the county may issue
a business license to a contractor with respect to a specific construction
project which may, at the request of the licensee, expire at the completion of
the construction project.
   (4)   The provisions of this article and the rates set out in this article
shall remain in effect from year to year as amended by the County Council.
(Ord. No. 069-07HR, § I, 7-24-07; Ord. No. 044-08, § I, 7-15-08; Ord. No. 052-
21HR, § I, 11-16-21)
Sec. 16-4. License Fee.
   (1)   The required license fee shall be paid for each business subject to
this article according to the applicable rate classification on or before May 1
of each year and the county may impose a penalty on a licensee who has not paid
by this date. However, an admitted insurance company may pay before June 1
without penalty.
   (2)   A separate license shall be required for each place of business and
for each classification of business conducted at one place. If gross income
cannot be separated for classifications at one location, the license fee shall
be computed on the combined gross income for the classification requiring the
highest rate.
   (3)   A license fee based on gross income shall be computed on the gross
income for the preceding calendar or fiscal year, and on a 12-month projected
income based on the monthly average for a business in operation for less than
one year. The fee for a new business shall be computed on the estimated or
probable gross income stated in the license application for the balance of the
calendar year, or if the estimated or probable gross income is unknown, shall
be computed on the average actual first-year income of all similar businesses,
identified by NAICS codes, and updated prior to renewing for the following
year.
   (4)   Unless otherwise specifically provided, all minimum fees and rates
shall be multiplied by 200 percent for nonresidents and for itinerants having
no fixed principal place of business within the county.
(Ord. No. 069-07HR, § I, 7-24-07; Ord. No. 052-21HR, § I, 11-16-21)
Sec. 16-5. Classification and Rates.
   (1)   The County Council shall, by ordinance, establish and approve a
Business License Fee Schedule upon the adoption of the latest Standardized
Business License Class Schedule as recommended by the Municipal Association of
South Carolina and adopted by the Director of the Revenue and Fiscal Affairs
office by December 31 of every odd year.
   (2)   The sectors of businesses included in each Rate Class are listed with
the United States North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes.
The alphabetical index in the Business License Fee Schedule is a tool for
classification, not a limitation on businesses subject to a license tax. The
License Official shall determine the proper class for a business according to
the applicable NAICS manual or website, whether or not the business is listed
in the alphabetical index. The County may, upon a finding of a rational basis
as explained in its ordinance and by a positive majority vote of the County
Council, provide for additional reasonable subclassifications described by a
NAICS sector, subsector, or industry, based upon particularized considerations
as needed for economic stimulus or the enhanced or disproportionate demands by
a specific business subclassification on the County's services or
infrastructure.
   (3)   (a)   One decal shall be required for each vehicle used by contractor
companies for going to and from job sites to identify their business as being
properly licensed. Decals shall cost no more and no less than the cost to
produce the decal, rounded up to the nearest quarter value.
      (b)   Taxis, limos, and shuttles shall post one taxi or shuttle decal on
each vehicle. Vehicles registered in Richland County shall be charged $115.84
per decal; vehicles not registered in Richland County shall be charged $173.76
per decal.
   (4)   (a)   All rates, including the cost of decals and stickers, shall be
automatically adjusted every three years by July l, to be effective the
following January 1, to account for changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The adjustment shall be made in the following manner: the CPI, using the CPI
calculation used by the County in other contexts, for the previous three years
shall be determined and averaged together. The rates described in the Business
License Fee Schedule shall be increased by the sum of the three-year average
CPI for each of the last three years. (Rates shall be rounded up to the nearest
nickel value; fees for decals and stickers shall be rounded up to the nearest
quarter value.)
      (b)   If County Council increases the rates independent of the automatic
CPI increases, the next CPI increase shall not be calculated until the third
year, by July 1, following the County Council increase.
   (5)   Until the adoption of an updated Business License Class Schedule
pursuant to subsection (1) of this section, the following applies:

Sec. 16-17. Sexually Oriented Businesses.
   (1)   The purpose of this section is to regulate sexually oriented
businesses in order to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the
citizens of Richland County, and to establish reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent or reduce to any extent the deleterious secondary
effects of sexually oriented businesses within the County. The provisions of
this section have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of or reasonable access to any communicative
materials or expression. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this
ordinance to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials
or expression protected by the First amendment of the United States
Constitution, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent or
effect of this ordinance to condone or legitimize the distribution of
exhibition of obscenity.
   (2)   Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses presented in hearings and reports made available to the
Richland County Council, and on the findings, interpretations, and narrowing
constructions incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4,
LLC, 124 S. Ct. 2219 (2003); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535
U.S. 425 (2002); Pap's A.M. v. City of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini
Theatres, All U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Chesapeake B&M, Inc. v.
Harford County, 58 F.3d 1005 (4th Cir. 1995); Giovani Carandola, Ltd. V. Fox,
470 F.3d 1074 (4th Cir. 2006); Centaur v. Richland County, 392 S.E.2d 165 (S.C.
1990); U.S. v. Pendergrass, Petition to Enter a Plea of Guilty and Plea
Agreement on the Charge of Tax Evasion (3:06-00147, M.D. Term. 2007); and other
cases; and on reports of secondary effects occurring in and around sexually
oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona (1979);
Minneapolis, Minnesota (1980); Houston, Texas (1987); Indianapolis, Indiana
(1984); Amarillo, Texas (1977); Garden Grove, California (1991); Los Angeles,
California (1977); Whittier, California (1978); Austin, Texas (1986); Seattle,
Washington (1989); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); El Paso, Texas (1986); New
York City, New York (1994); Dallas, Texas (1997); Newport News, Virginia
(1996); New York Times Square Study (1994); Phoenix, Arizona (1995-1998);
Greensboro, North Carolina (2003); and also from the reports of Sexually
Oriented Businesses: An Insider's View, by David Sherman, presented to the
Michigan House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, January 12, 2000;
Survey of Appraisers Fort Worth & Dallas, Effects of Land Use on Surrounding
Property Values, by Duncan Associates, September 2004; and the Report of the
Attorney General's Working Group on the Regulations of Sexually Oriented
Businesses (June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Richland County Council
finds:
      (a)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are
associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not
limited to, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public
indecency, illicit sexual activity, and sexual assault and exploitation.
      (b)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which the County has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or
abating in the future. This substantial government interest in prevent
secondary effects, which is the County's rationale for this ordinance, exists
independent of any comparative analysis between sexually oriented and non-
sexually oriented businesses in the future as well as sexually oriented
businesses that may locate in the County in the future. The County finds that
the cases and secondary effects documentation relied on in this ordinance are
reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.
   (3)   No license to operate a sexually oriented business shall be issued to,
or in the name of, a corporation, association, or a trade name as such. Any
application for a corporation, association, or trade name shall be made the
officers for its use, and such officers shall identify in the application the
name by which the business will be operated. In addition, such officers in
making an application shall be held to assume all responsibility there under as
individuals, and shall be subject to all the provisions and penalties set forth
herein or in any other article of the Richland County Code of Ordinances.
   (4)   Notwithstanding the pre-application process wherein an applicant must
obtain documentation of compliance with all applicable state and local health,
fire, zoning, and building codes or regulations pursuant to Section
16-6(5) of this ordinance, upon application for a business license by an
applicant identifying the business as a sexually oriented business, the License
Official must circulate a form on which compliance shall be certified by the
officials administering the applicable zoning, fire, building and health
regulations. The applicable and aforementioned officials shall determine
compliance with their respective codes or regulations and inform the License
Official of their determination within thirty days from the earliest date of
receipt of the compliance form by any one of the aforementioned officials. If
the License Official does not receive a particular determination of compliance
from an official administering the aforementioned codes and regulations before
the thirty-day time period expires, that compliance determination not received
by the License Official shall be deemed approved. All other compliance
determination received before the thirty-day time period expires shall be
unaffected by any other compliance determination that fails to meet the thirty-
day time period.

1-8 of this Code of Ordinances.
   (6)   The License Official shall approve or deny an application for a
license for a Sexually Oriented Business within thirty calendar days (30) from
the date of receipt of the application. If the License Official fails to either
approve or deny the application within thirty calendar days, then the
application shall be deemed approved and business activity may begin or
continue immediately, notwithstanding the fact that no license has been issued.
   (7)   In addition to the reasons for denial of a license set forth in
Section 16-15 of this article, the License Official shall deny a business
license to an applicant for a Sexually Oriented Business if the applicant or an
agent of such applicant who has or will have actual authority to control and
manage the business proposed to be operated:
      (a)   is under the age of eighteen;
      (b)   within five years of the date of application, has been convicted or
pled guilty or nolo contendere to any of the following crimes: South Carolina

Sec. 16-18. Revocation of License.
   When the License Official determines that:
   (a)   a license has been mistakenly or improperly issued or issued contrary
to law; or
   (b)   a licensee has breached any condition upon which the license was
issued or has failed to comply with any provision of this article; or
   (c)   a licensee has obtained a license through a fraud, misrepresentation,
or false or misleading statement, evasion or suppression of a material fact in
the license application;
   (d)   has given a bad check or tendered illegal consideration for any
license fee; or
   (e)   the business activity for which a license was obtained has proven to
be a public nuisance as determined by a court of law; or
   (f)   the business has proven to be a public nuisance as determined by a
court of law; the License Official shall give written notice of intent to
revoke to the licensee or the person in control of the business within the
County by personal service or certified mail stating the License Official's
basis for revocation and setting forth a date and time for a hearing before the
Business Service Center Appeals Board for the purpose of determining whether
the license should be revoked. The hearing shall be held within thirty (30)
days from the date of service of the notice. A licensee who received proper
notice yet fails to appear or defend at the revocation hearing waives his or
her right to contest the revocation.
(Ord. No. 069-07HR, § I, 7-24-07; Ord. No. 044-08HR, § V, 7-15-08; Ord. No.
013-19HR, § II, 4-16-19; Ord. No. 052- 21HR, § I, 11-16-21)
Section 16-19. Appeals.
   (1)   Any person aggrieved by the following actions or decisions made by the
License Official may bring an appeal to the Business Service Center Appeals
Board:
      (a)   A final assessment pursuant to Section
16-12;
      (b)   Charge backs or other adjustment to the business license fee as
determined by an audit conducted pursuant to Section
16-11;
      (c)   A revocation or a denial of a business license pursuant to Section
16-15 or Section
16-18;
      (d)   Imposition of a business license penalty; or
      (e)   A decision or determination made by the License Official concerning
the proper classification of a business or the proper calculation of business
license fees. This ground for appeal shall not be construed to authorize
appeals based on objections to the business license fee structure established
by Richland County Council.
   (2)   Those wishing to appeal must first file a written appeal with License
Official for decision by the Business Service Center Appeals Board. The
Business Service Center Appeals Board, or its designee, is authorized to reject
an appeal for failure to comply with the requirements of this subsection. The
following requirements for submission of an appeal must be strictly complied
with:
      (a)   The appeal must be in writing and state the reasons for the appeal.
      (b)   The appeal shall be filed with the License Official within fifteen
(15) business days after the payment of all applicable fees and penalties,
including assessments or chargebacks of an audit, and within twenty (20)
business days after receipt of the License Official's written and certified
mail notification of an assessment, charge backs of an audit, or notice of
denial or revocation.
      (c)   The written notice of appeal must be accompanied by an
administrative fee (which shall be determined by the License Official) that
will be used to partially defray the costs incurred in connection with the
administration of appeals. Payment under protest of all applicable fees and
penalties, and assessment, or audit charge backs shall be a condition precedent
to appeal. The fee will be refunded in the event of final resolution of the
appeal in favor of the appellant.
   (3)   An appeal or a hearing on revocation shall be held by the Appeals
Board within thirty (30) calendar days, or as soon as reasonably possible,
after receipt of a request for appeal or service of notice of suspension or
intent to revoke. The applicant or licensee shall be given written notice as to
the date and time of the meeting. At the meeting, all parties have the right to
be represented by counsel and to present testimony and evidence. The
proceedings shall be recorded and transcribed at the expense of the party so
requesting. The rules of evidence and procedure prescribed by the Board shall
govern the hearing.
   (4)   In the event of an appeal of business license penalties paid, the
Appeals Board may waive a business license penalty paid only if any of the
following circumstances of reasonable cause are proven by the applicant:
      (a)   An unexpected and unavoidable absence of the appellant from South
Carolina, such as being called to active military duty. In the case of a
corporation or other business entity, the absence must have been an individual
having primary authority to pay the business license fee.
      (b)   A delay caused by death or serious, incapacitating illness of the
appellant, the appellant's immediate family, or the appellant's accountant or
other third party professional charged with determining the business fee owed.
In the case of a corporation or other business entity, the death or serious,
incapacitating illness must have been an individual having primary authority to
pay the business license fee.
      (c)   The business license fee was documented as paid on time, but
inadvertently paid to another taxing entity.
      (d)   The delinquency was caused by the unavailability of necessary
records directly related to calculation of business fees, over which the
appellant had no control, which made timely payment impossible. For example,
the required records may have been destroyed by fire, flood, federally-declared
natural disaster, or actions of war or terrorism. Unavailability of records
caused by time or business pressures, employee turnover, or negligence are not
reasonable cause for waiver of business license penalties.
      (e)   The delinquency was the result of clear error on the part of the
License Official or Business Service Center staff in processing or posting
receipt of appellant's payment.
      (f)   Delay or failure caused by good faith reliance on erroneous
guidance provided by the License Official or other staff, so long as complete
and accurate information was given to the Business License Service Center, no
change in the law occurred, and the appellant produces written documentation.
   (5)   The Board shall, by majority vote of members present, render a written
decision based upon findings of fact and the application of the standards
herein which shall be served upon all parties or their representatives within
fifteen (15) calendar days, or as soon as reasonably possible, after the
hearing. The decision of the Board shall be final unless appealed to County
Council within ten (10) calendar days after service of the Board's decision.
County Council shall review the record and without further hearing affirm,
modify, or deny the appeal in the event of an error of fact by the Board. The
decision of Council shall be final unless appealed to a court of competent
jurisdiction within ten (10) calendar days after service of County Council's
decision.

as otherwise provided by law, it shall be unlawful for any official or employee
to divulge or make known in any manner the amount of income or any particulars
set forth or disclosed in any report or return required under this article.

Section 16-22. Criminal and Civil Penalties, Injunctive Relief.
   (a)   Criminal Penalty. Any person violating any provision of this article
shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be subject to
punishment under the general penalty provisions of Section 1-8 of this Code of
Ordinances: that is, shall be subject to a fine of up to $500.00 or
imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days or both. Each day It of
violation shall be considered a separate offense. Punishment for violation
shall not relieve the offender of liability for delinquent fees, penalties, and
costs provided for herein.
   (b)   Civil penalty. For non-payment of all or any part of the business
license fee, the License Official shall levy and collect a penalty of five (5%)
percent of the unpaid fee for each month or portion thereof after the due date
until paid. Penalties shall not be waived exception in accordance with
circumstances of reasonable cause set forth in Section 16-19 of this article as
determined by the Business Service Center Appeals Board.
   (c)   Injunctive Relief. The County may seek injunctive relief in a court of
competent jurisdiction as a means of enforcing the provisions of this article.

Sec. 16-23. Health massage, bodywork therapists, and massage establishments.
   (1)   Authority. This section is adopted pursuant to S.C. Code of Laws
Annotated Section 4-9-25 which confers upon counties the authority to "enact
regulations, resolutions, and ordinances, not inconsistent with the
Constitution and general law of this State, including the exercise of these
powers in relation to health and order in counties or respecting any subject as
appears to them necessary and proper for the security, general welfare, and
convenience of counties or for preserving health, peace, order, and good
government in them." Such "powers of a county must be liberally construed in
favor of the county and the specific mention of particular powers may not be
construed as limiting in any manner the general powers of counties." This
section further is adopted pursuant to S.C. Code of Laws Annotated Section 4-9-
30 which authorizes counties acting through their governing bodies "(14) to
enact ordinances for the implementation and enforcement of the powers granted
in this section and provide penalties for violations thereof not to exceed the
penalty jurisdiction of magistrates' courts."
   (2)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to regulate health massage,
bodywork therapists and massage establishments in order to promote the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Richland County. In adopting
this ordinance, Richland County hereby establishes reasonable and uniform
regulations to prevent or reduce to any extent the deleterious secondary
effects of health massage, bodywork therapists and massage establishments
within the County. The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor
the intent nor effect of restricting or denying access to health massage,
bodywork therapists and massage establishments. Among the deleterious secondary
effects of imminent and growing concern associated with the unlawful operation
of some establishments subject hereto that obtain business licenses under the
guise of legitimate health massage, body therapy or massage establishments are
a) their use as commercial sex operations, 2) prostitution, 3) the potential to
spread disease, 4) lewdness, 5) public indecency, 6) illicit sexual activity,
7) sexual assault and exploitation, and 8) human trafficking. The negative
secondary effects of businesses associated with commercial sexual exploitation
are manifest. See, e.g., City of Littleton v. Z.J Gifts D-4, LLC, 124 S. Ct.
2219 (2003); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535 U.S. 425 (2002);
Pap's A.M v. City of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of Renton v. Playtime
Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini Theatres, All U.S.
50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); California v.
LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Chesapeake B&M, Inc. v. Harford County, 58 F.3d
1005 (4th Cir. 1995); Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Fox, 470 F.3d 1074 (4th Cir.
2006); Centaur v. Richland County, 392 S.E.2d 165 (S.C. 1990); US. v.
Pendergrass, Petition to Enter a Plea of Guilty and Plea Agreement on the
Charge of Tax Evasion (3:06-00147, M.D. Term. 2007); and other cases; and on
reports of secondary effects occurring in and around such businesses,
including, but not limited to, Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Minneapolis, Minnesota
(1980); Houston, Texas (1987); Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); Amarillo, Texas
(1977); Garden Grove, California (1991); Los Angeles, California (1977);
Whittier, California (1978); Austin, Texas (1986); Seattle, Washington (1989);
Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); El Paso, Texas (1986); New York City, New York
(1994); Dallas, Texas (1997); Newport News, Virginia (1996); New York Times
Square Study (1994); Phoenix, Arizona (1995-1998); Greensboro, North Carolina
(2003); Toledo, Ohio (2002); Centralia, Washington 2004; Greensboro, North
Carolina (2003); and also from the reports of "Human Trafficking in illicit
Massage Businesses," by Polaris (January 2018), which reports that in 2017,
"The United Nations estimates that more than 40 million people in the world
today are living in some form of modem slavery," and that "Illicit massage
businesses (IMBs) that front for commercial sex operations have been ubiquitous
in the American landscape for decades, with an estimate of more than 9,000
operating today."
   (3)   Findings. Based on this breadth of case law, research and data
regarding negative secondary effects of commercial sex and related operations,
the Richland County Council finds:
      (a)   Illicit massage establishments, as a category of commercial uses,
are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but
not limited to their use as commercial sex operations, for prostitution, to
spread disease, lewdness, public indecency, illicit sexual activity, sexual
assault and exploitation, and human trafficking.
      (b)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm
which the County has a substantial government interest in preventing or
abating. Additionally, the County's interest in regulating illicit massage
businesses extends to future secondary effects that could occur in the County
related to such establishments as well as future such businesses that may
locate in the County. The County finds that the cases and secondary effects
documentation relied on in this ordinance are reasonably believed to be
relevant to said secondary effects.
   (4)   Exemptions. This section shall not apply to physicians, surgeons,
chiropractors, osteopaths, physical therapists or podiatrists duly licensed to
practice in the State of South Carolina, registered or licensed nurses,

institution or professional sports team and whose work is limited to athletic

   (11)   Employment of persons found guilty of criminal sexual offenses. It
shall be unlawful for any person operating a bodywork, health massage or

(Ord. No. 2124-91, § I, 7-24-91)
Sec. 18-6. Smoking of tobacco products.
   (a)   Findings. As an incident to the adoption of this Section, the County
Council (“County Council”) of the County of Richland, South Carolina (the
“County”) makes the following findings:
      (1)   Secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in
the United States, killing 53,000 Americans prematurely each year; and
      (2)   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, National Toxicology Program’s Report on carcinogens,
National Cancer Institute, and the International Agency for Research and cancer
have all reported that secondhand smoke is a group A human carcinogen, a cancer
causing substance, of which there is no safe level of exposure; and
      (3)   The health consequences of involuntary smoking have been reported
by the U.S. Surgeon General to be a cause of disease, including lung cancer, in
healthy non-smokers; and
      (4)   The U.S. Surgeon General has concluded that a simple separation of
smokers and non-smokers within the same airspace does not eliminate the
exposure of non-smokers; and
      (5)   Numerous medical and scientific studies show substantial levels of
exposure to secondhand smoke among the United States population, and over the
past two decades, the health hazards resulting from exposure to secondhand
smoke have been increasingly recognized; and
      (6)   Secondhand smoke increases the risk of developing breast cancer in
younger, pre-menopausal women; and when inhaled by pregnant women, secondhand
smoke increases the risk for low-weight babies, pre-term delivery, and Sudden
Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS); and
      (7)   Exposure to secondhand smoke by children leads to decreased lung
function, asthma, pneumonia, ear infections, bronchitis and even sudden infant
death syndrome; and
      (8)   Studies of hospital admissions for acute myocardial infarction in
Helena, Montana and Pueblo, Colorado before, during, and after a local law
eliminating smoking in workplaces and public places was in effect, has
determined that laws to enforce smoke-free workplaces and public places may be
associated with a reduction in morbidity from heart disease; and
      (9)   Workplaces have been shown to be locations of significant exposure
to secondhand tobacco smoke by employees working in the unincorporated areas of
Richland County; and
      (10)   There are laws, ordinances, and regulations in place that protect
workers from other environmental hazards, including Class A carcinogens,
asbestos, arsenic and benzene, but none which regulate exposure to secondhand
smoke; and
      (11)   The South Carolina General Assembly at Section 44-95-10 et seq.
(the “Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990") imposed certain limitations on smoking.
For example, it limited smoking in Government Buildings (the definition of
which includes County-owned buildings) except where the owner of such building
shall designate smoking areas.
      County Council has now determined that additional regulation of smoking
in areas beyond those addressed in the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990 is
appropriate in furtherance of its duty to protect the health of its citizens
and employees in the workplace and therefore enacts this Section.
   (b)   Intent. County Council finds that it is in the best interest of the
people of the unincorporated areas of the County to protect nonsmokers from
involuntary exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace. Therefore, County
Council declares that the purpose of this act is: 1) to preserve and improve
the health, comfort, and environment of the people of the unincorporated areas
of the County by limiting exposure to secondhand smoke in the workplace; and 2)
to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air, and to
recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over the
desire to smoke.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
See. 21-1. Purpose.
   The purpose of this article is to define the mission, responsibilities and
limitations of the department of public works with regard to maintenance and
construction of road and drainage infrastructure in the unincorporated portion
of the county and areas located in other jurisdictions the county provides
public works services to through an intergovernmental agreement pursuant to
S.C. Const. Article VIII, Section 13, and S.C. Code of Laws Ann. Sections 4-9-

other instrument that purports to convey any property interest to Richland
County other than fee simple ownership, Richland County shall not maintain any
roads, roadways, alleyways, streets, highways, bridges, stormwater or drainage
systems, ponds, detention ponds, dams, fields, open spaces, green spaces,
developed or undeveloped property, or any other system or infrastructure in any
area that has been annexed into the limits of any municipality or any other
jurisdiction that has the power to annex property unless such maintenance is
performed pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement as provided for
hereinabove.
(Ord. No. 005-03HR, § I, 1-21-03; Ord. No. 043-18HR, § II, 9-18-18)
Sec. 21-3. Definitions.
   The following definitions apply to words and terms used in this article. All
other words shall have their customary meanings:
   (a)   "C" Construction Program. A state program by which state gasoline tax
revenues are shared with counties for transportation and road construction
activities. The funds involved are commonly referred to as "C" funds and they
are used at the discretion of a County Transportation Committee (CTC) appointed
by the county's Legislative Delegation pursuant to section 12-28-2740 of the
S.C Code of Laws.
   (b)   County. Richland County, South Carolina, its county council or its
administrative staff acting on its behalf.
   (c)   County road maintenance system. All those public highways, streets and
roads, paved and unpaved, that have been dedicated for public use and accepted
by the county as prescribed in this chapter and which have not been accepted
for maintenance by any other public entity.
   (d)   Driveway. Any paved or unpaved way located on a single parcel of
property and intended for vehicular access from a highway, street or road to
one or more residences located on that parcel.
   (e)   Easement. A grant to the general public, a corporation, a specific
person or persons or a publicentity of the right to use a strip or parcel of
land for a specific purpose. Fee simple title to the land remains with the
grantor.
   (f)   Easement and right-of-way deed. A legal document by which an easement
or right-of-way, as defined herein, is granted by a property owner to the
county. This document is executed by the property owner (grantor) and the
County and recorded in the office of the Richland County Register of Deeds so
that the easement or right-of-way becomes a permanent part of the public record
and binds the grantor's successors in title to its provisions.
   (g)   Highway, street or road. The terms "highway', "street", and "road", as
used herein, shall be general terms denoting a public way for the purpose of
vehicular travel. The terms shall refer to the entire area within the right-of-
way to include roadways, pedestrian facilities, bridges, tunnels, viaducts,
drainage structures and all other facilities commonly considered component
parts of highways, streets or roads. These terms are used interchangeably
herein.
   (h)   Prescriptive easement. An easement acquired for a specific purpose by
long continued enjoyment or usage of property for that purpose. To a certain
extent, it resembles title by adverse possession but differs to the extent that
the adverse user acquires only an easement and not title. To create an easement
by "prescription", the use must have been open, continuous, exclusive and under
claim of right for the statutory period, which in the state is twenty (20)
years.
   (i)   Private road. As it is used in this article, a private road refers to
a road that is not maintained by any public entity such as the County, the
South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) or a municipality.
Depending upon the granting of easements and accepted use, private roads may be
used by those other than the property owners.
   (j)   Public road. A public road refers to a road that is maintained by a
public entity. This would include all roads in the county road maintenance
system. In this case, the public is clearly entitled to use the road.
   (k)   Through road. A road that connects two (2) different paved roads.
   (l)   Quit-claim deed. A deed of conveyance that is intended to pass any
title, interest or claim which the grantor may have in the premises, but not
professing that such title is valid, nor containing any warranty or covenants
for title.
   (m)   Right-of-way. A strip or parcel of land occupied or intended for
occupancy by a street, road, railroad or other special use. Fee simple title
may or may not be granted to the agency or entity acquiring the right-of-way,
but the property is dedicated exclusively for the intended use and is platted
separately and distinct from the adjoining lots or parcels.
   (n)   Alternative maintenance paving. A county paving program by which
qualifying light duty/low volume unpaved public roads may be paved using non-
standard paving or treatment methods.
   (o)   Light duty/low volume unpaved road. Unpaved roads with average daily
traffic limited at 400 vehicles per day.

043-14HR, § I, 7-29-14)
Sec. 21-4. Drainage on private property.
   (a)   Drainage improvements and/or maintenance will be undertaken by county
forces on private property only:
      (1)   When the drainage system involved has been designed, approved and
constructed in accordance with the county's Stormwater Management, Erosion and
Sediment Control Regulations (§§
26-202,
26-203) and accepted by the county, or
      (2)   When there is a clear and substantial public interest served in
doing so and drainage easements are granted to the county on all of the
property involved. Improvements and/or maintenance with an estimated material
cost in the amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000) or less may be approved by
the county administrator. Drainage improvements and/or maintenance in excess
five thousand dollars ($5,000) in material costs shall be reviewed and approved
by the county council. For the purpose of this section, a public interest is
defined as:
         a.   The correction of a serious health hazard or environmental

constructed by the county.
         d.   The maintenance of the structural integrity of the existing
drainage infrastructure of the county.

individual lots or inundates a public road.Note: Correction of minor ditch
erosion problems on private property will not be considered a substantial
public interest.
         f.   However, correction of minor ditch erosion problems on private
property will not be considered a substantial public interest.
      (3)   Emergency maintenance and/or improvements of private drainage
facilities, including natural resources (such as streams), may be undertaken
when the following conditions exist and the requirements of Subsection (a) (2),
above, cannot be met:

designated by county or state officials, affecting a single residence and
beyond the ability of an individual property owner to resolve.
         b.   Improvements and/or maintenance that eliminate flooding of less
than four (4) residences and/or businesses.
         c.   Improvements and/or maintenance of an existing drainage facility,
failure of which may result in property damage to downstream properties or
potential loss of life.
         d.   The provision of emergency maintenance will not create a
maintenance responsibility for Richland County. A temporary right-of-entry will
be required of the property owner, covering only the time which the emergency
maintenance is performed.
         Improvements and/or maintenance with an estimated material cost in the
amount of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or less may be approved by the
county administrator. Drainage improvements and/or maintenance in excess of
five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) in material costs shall be reviewed and
approved by County Council.
   (b)   Easements or temporary rights-of- way must be obtained for any
existing or proposed drainage facilities on private property before any work is
performed thereon by county forces. Easements for maintenance of drainage
facilities constructed without the county's approval of plans or inspections
will not be accepted unless the property owners execute a hold harmless
agreement and release the county from all claims resulting from deficiencies of
the facilities.
   (c)   Except where the county has accepted an easement for maintenance of
drainage facilities on private property as provided herein, maintenance is the
responsibility of the property owner.

system.
   (b)   For purposes of ascertaining dedication by usage or by maintenance by
the county, all unpaved roads which have been used by the public and/or
maintained by the county for a period of twenty (20) years or more shall be
deemed dedicated and shall be maintained by the department of public works.
   (c)   The county will claim a prescriptive easement for all unpaved roads
deemed to be dedicated as public roads by usage. Such easements will be
considered as comprising the land actually maintained by the county as part of

   (d)   All unpaved roads which have been marked in either red or green on the
map presented to the county council on March 5, 1975, shall be brought within a
systematic identification process as soon as practicable and maintained by

an interest charge equal to that paid by the county for bonds issued to fund
construction. The total costs plus interest of the improvements shall be
allocated between the property owners by each lot being assessed an equal share
of the costs and interest. Any unpaved road deeded to the county under these
provisions may be eligible for "C" fund improvements.
   (i)   The county engineer and his staff shall periodically update the
existing county road map and shall add such unpaved roads which are not
presently shown thereon and attempt to determine the ownership of such unpaved
roads.

the agreement of those property owners served by such roadway, may consent to
accept a roadway with special conditions as to any particular non-conforming
aspects with regard to county road standards. Only those streets located in

associated with providing all quality control/quality assurance testing and
inspections required during construction of new roads and the associated
drainage systems to ensure compliance with the applicable design and

Sec. 21-20. Road paving program.
   (a)   Road construction and paving projects administered by the county and
funded from public funds shall be accomplished in accordance with a consistent,
systematic program established and administered by the Director of
Transportation, in conjunction with and with the support of the Director of
Public Works, or his/her designee. Such program shall have the following basic
characteristics:
   (1)   Only county maintained roads with recorded Easement and Right-of-Way
Deeds will be paved utilizing public funds,
   (2)   All county maintained dirt roads are eligible for paving, and
   (3)   Paving will be accomplished in priority order at a rate permitted by
availability of funding.
   (b)   The county engineer, or his/her designee, will acquire and maintain
the following data on all roads proposed for paving:
   (1)   Name;
   (2)   County road number;
   (3)   Map location code;
   (4)   Beginning and ending points;
   (5)   Length in miles and hundredths of a mile; and
   (6)   Council district.
   (c)   In addition, the following data pertaining to the roads priority for
paving will be obtained and recorded for each road:
   (1)   Number of homes accessed from the road;
   (2)   Number of businesses accessed from the road;
   (3)   Number of churches accessed from the road;
   (4)   Maintenance difficulty factor; and
   (5)   “Through road” factor.
   For the purpose of determining the number of homes, business and churches
accessed from a road, only those on parcels with no existing paved road
frontage will be counted except when the distance from the paved road to the
building exceeds 1,320 feet.
   (d)   Roads will be prioritized in accordance with the following procedure:
      A road’s priority for paving will be established by the lowest cost per
occupant, church, or business. Lowest cost per occupant (P) is calculated by
the formula:
      P   =    Cost
            H+B+C+T
      Where:
      H   =    Number of points accredited for homes.
   One point is accredited for each home accessed from the road. This will
include mobile homes as well as permanent homes. It should be noted that the
number of homes on a road is an indicator of the number of people using it as
well as the importance of the road as a possible school bus route.
      B   =   Number of points accredited for businesses.
   Two points are accredited for each business accessed from the road. To be
eligible for these points, a business must occupy a building separate from any
residence and rely on the road for either customer traffic or routine use by
company vehicles.
      C   =   Number of points accredited for churches.
   Two points are accredited for each church accessed from the road.
      T   =   Through road factor. If the road is a through road, two points
are accredited to T. If the road is not a through road, zero points are
accredited to T.
      L   =   Length of the road in miles and hundredths.
      Cost =   Estimated Cost ($800,000 per mile x L).
   (e)   A road’s paving may be given top priority provided that all costs
incurred by the county to pave it are paid by its adjacent property owners.
Such costs may be included as an assessment on the tax bill of the property
owners, to be paid over no more than a fifteen (15) year period with an
interest charge equal to that paid by the county for bonds issued to fund
construction. The county council may elect to have the total costs, plus
interest, of the improvements allocated between the property owners either by a
front footage assessment ratio, or by each lot being assessed an equal share of
the costs and interest, Establishment of this assessment shall require approval
of eighty percent (80%) of the property owners.
   (f)   Highways, streets or roads constructed or paved under the county’s
jurisdiction and maintained by the county shall meet the design and
construction standards contained in section 21-6, above.
   (g)   The Director of Transportation or his/her designee, in conjunction
with and with the support of the county engineer, or his/her designee, shall,
establish appropriate alternate design and construction standards for low
volume rural roads as a means of ensuring maximum cost effectiveness of road
paving funds.
   (h)   Road paving funds will be distributed by county council district based
on that district’s portion of total county dirt road mileage. Pro rata fund
distribution will be calculated as follows:
      District dirt road paving funds = Total dirt road paving funds x district
dirt road mileage
                               Total dirt road mileage
   Mileage refers to dirt road mileage in the county road maintenance system
(i.e. public dirt roads that are routinely maintained by county public works
forces). Roads will be selected for paving based on distribution/availability
of funds and priority within that council district, as determined by the
uniform road rating system contained in this section.
   (i)   The Alternative Maintenance Paving Program shall consist of two
categories, Pave-In-Place and Alternative Surface Treatment, which are defined
as follows:
   (1)   The Pave-In-Place Program shall allow for the placement of hot mix
asphalt on low volume/light duty dirt roads that meet the following criteria:
      a)   The road must be within a publicly dedicated right-of-way of a
minimum width of 50 feet. A right-of-way width of no less than 30 feet may be
considered if in the judgment of the Director of Public Works a safe roadway
with adequate drainage may be constructed.
      b)   The road base may be reinforced by the use of Portland cement
stabilization of the in-place materials or other stabilization products
determined by the Director of Public Works to be equal or better.
      c)   The road to be improved shall not interconnect existing streets or
serve developable vacant land that would result in the potential of exceeding
400 vehicles per day. The road shall not serve existing businesses or vacant
land zoned for business uses that would generate traffic exceeding 400 vehicles
per day or truck traffic exceeding 24 vehicles per day.
      d)   Roads improved under this section may conform to AASHTO Guidelines
for Geometric Design of Very Low-Volume Local Roads (2001) for horizontal and
vertical alignment if determined by the Director of Public Works to be
appropriate for the local situation.
      e)   Roadway bases reinforced by the above method shall be overlaid with
1 Vi inches of hot mix asphalt surface course. The paved surface width shall be
no less than 22 feet A pavement width of no less than 18 feet may be considered
if in the judgment of the Director of Public Works a safe roadway with adequate
drainage may be constructed.
   (2)   Alternative Surface Treatment allows for the placement of materials
other than asphalt as the travel surface for road ways. Types of Alternative
Surface Treatment may include:
      a)   Triple Treatment Surface Course;
      b)   Rubberized Asphalt;
      c)   Milled Asphalt.
   (3)   Roads in the Alternative Maintenance Paving Program may be improved by
geographical location in lieu of the priority list referenced in the
aforementioned section of this ordinance to reduce mobilization cost. The
decision shall be at the discretion of the Director of Transportation.
   (4)   In order to incorporate community input before roads are paved, notice
shall be sent by the County Transportation Department, by mail to all abutting
property owners whose property would be affected by any such change. A return
receipt from the last known address of all property owners will be required.
Each such owner shall have thirty (30) days to respond. If twenty-five (25%)
percent or more of all such property owners decline said road paving, then the
subject road shall not be paved.
   (j)   Design exceptions for dirt road paved surface widths less than
eighteen (18) feet.
   Design exceptions for paved surface widths less than the minimum eighteen
(18) feet may be considered for dirt roads, as follows:
   (1)   The dirt road must be equal to or less than 1,000 feet in total
length.
   (2)   The road must be classified as low volume by traffic volume per the
County Low Volume Design Manual dated November 2013 which equates to traffic
volumes less than 400 vehicles per day.
   (3)   The road must not be classified as a through road.
   (4)   If a dirt road being considered for paving meets the criteria for
design exception stated in paragraphs (j) (1), (2), and (3), above, then
following steps must be taken before a design exception is approved:
      (a)   The Director of Transportation and the Director of Public Works
shall take a scoping visit and conduct a design field review of the road to
identify conflicts that may preclude installing a minimum paved surface width
of eighteen (18) feet.
      (b)   Staff shall obtain and review crash data for the road by number and
types of crashes, including fatal crash rate.
      (c)   A Design Exception Form shall be completed documenting the proposed
design exception and the justifications therefore.
      (d)   Then, when he/she deems it appropriate, the Director of
Transportation shall make a recommendation for a paved surface width design
exception to the Director of Public Works. The Director of Public Works shall
make the final determination of whether to approve the paved surface width
design exception and shall maintain a record of all approvals and denials.
   (5)   Regardless of the above, in no case shall a paved surface width be
allowed less than fifteen (15) feet.
   (6)   The Director of Transportation shall consider adding traffic calming
measures to dirt road paving projects in conjunction with any approved design
exception for roads that exceed 500 feet in total length.
   (7)   The above design exception shall apply only to paved surface widths of
dirt roads in limited circumstances and shall not allow for exceptions to any
other design, asphalt, drainage, or construction standards.

transportation improvement plan. This would apply to:
      (1)   Connector roads;
      (2)   Intersection improvements;
      (3)   Widening;
      (4)   Turn lanes; and
      (5)   Alignment improvements.
   (b)   Road resurfacing funds, for the resurfacing of existing paved roads,
will be distributed by county council district based on that district's portion
of total county paved road mileage. Pro rata fund distribution will be
calculated as follows:
District paved road paving funds = Total paved road resurfacing funds x
district paved road mileage
                            Total paved road mileage
Mileage refers to paved road mileage in the county road maintenance system
(i.e. public paved roads that are routinely maintained by county public works
forces). Roads will be selected for paving based on distribution/ availability
of funds and priority within that council district, as determined by the
condition analysis as maintained by public works.

Sec. 21-23. Condemnation/ compensation.
   (a)   In general, the county will not compensate property owners for
easements or rights-of-way on public works projects from which they directly
benefit. Exceptions may be made, however, when:
      (1)   Unusual circumstances make payment of a reasonable amount of
compensation more economical than resorting to condemnation;
      (2)   Deadlines for completion of a project preclude the expenditure of
time required for condemnation; or
      (3)   Compensation is awarded through the condemnation process.

   (b)   Excavations in streets.
      (1)   An encroachment permit shall be required for each excavation in a
county road before the work is commenced. Work under such permit shall be
commenced within the time specified on the permit, otherwise the permit shall
become void. All permits shall be kept at the place of excavation while the
work is being done and exhibited whenever called for by any person having the
authority to examine the same. There shall be no more than one-half (½) the
width of any street or alley opened or obstructed at any one time; tunneling
may be allowed, provided that no authorized underground construction shall be
damaged or interfered with. All portions of the street excavated shall be put
in as good condition as before the excavation, was made. The trench or
excavation shall be refilled, thoroughly rammed and puddled within the time
specified on the permit after making the connection or repairs. When an
excavation is made in any paved county road where it is necessary to remove
paving, the person to whom the permit was issued for such excavation shall
leave a written notice with the county department of public works and such
notice shall state that the excavation has been properly filled, tamped, and is
ready for repaving. Whenever any person making any excavations in the street or
alley fails to refill, in the proper manner, as required by this section or
fails to maintain the same for a period of one year, then the county council
shall cause the work to be done and the cost thereof shall be charged against
the bond as heretofore provided in section
6-68 of this code.
      (2)   Where such excavations occur in a state or federal highway,
permission shall be obtained from the state or federal highway department
before any work is commenced.
      (3)   Public protection requirement.
         a.   It is hereby required that for every excavation made on public
property, proper safeguards shall be provided against injury to the public;
barricades shall be provided at five (5) foot distances, and such barricades
shall completely encircle all open excavations or trenches. All barricades, as
required by this section, shall have at least one sign placed thereon in a
conspicuous manner, indicating the name of the person causing such excavation.
When approved, steel plates of sufficient strength may be used to cover
excavation to prevent blocking of street.
         b.   From sunup to sundown there shall be placed, at a distance of not

for such relief as may be available to him under general law.
(Code 1976, § 6-1009)
Sec. 23-2. Publication of notice of certain tax rates.
   Immediately upon the receipt of tax duplicate for the year, the county
treasurer shall cause a notice to be inserted in one newspaper in the county
stating the rate per cent of the levy for state purposes and the rate per cent
for all other purposes on the duplicates for the current fiscal year, and if

for in one of two methods:
      (1)   A lump sum payment between the fifteenth day of September and the
thirty-first day of January after their assessment in each year.
      (2)   In the alternative, the taxpayer may elect to prepay his taxes in
installments by filing an estimate of real property taxes due or to become due
for the forthcoming tax year, based upon the prior year's taxes. In the event
that the taxpayer makes such an election to prepay his taxes in installments,
the taxpayer shall file such estimate on a form to be provided by the office of
the county treasurer and shall make payment on such estimate in four (4)
monthly payments, the first to be due on the first day of October, and each
payment thereafter shall be due on the first day of each succeeding month. Each
payment shall be based upon the estimate as provided above, except for those
who elect to make one payment in January for the total amount for that year. In
the event that a taxpayer elects to file an estimate and pay in installments,
the payment due in January shall be increased or decreased by the difference
between the cumulative total of the four (4) monthly payments and the final tax
bill as determined by the tax notice prepared by the auditor and mailed to the
taxpayer.
      (3)   In making such election to file an estimate and pay on a monthly
basis, the taxpayer acknowledges that he has waived the assessment, levy, and
other steps which generally are taken prior to taxes becoming due and payable.
By such waiver, the taxpayer will specifically acknowledge on the form to be
provided that he is undertaking this action for his convenience and in order to
assist him in making his payments in a prompt and orderly manner, but without
undue burden to himself or without penalty.
      (4)   Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed a waiver by the
taxpayer to make payment under protest, to challenge assessments, or to
otherwise exercise his rights pertaining to assessments, levy, payment,
protest, or other challenges as set forth in the Code of Laws of the State of
South Carolina.
      (5)   In the event the property taxes have not been entered upon the
duplicate, the treasurer shall deposit any collections hereunder into an
interest-bearing escrow account until such time as the property taxes have been
entered upon the duplicate. Once such entry has been accomplished, the
treasurer may allocate such collections in accordance with law, ordinance, and
budget.
   (b)   Personal property. All taxes on personal property in the county shall
be payable between the first day of July and the fifteenth day of September.
   (c)   Penalties for late payment of real property taxes. When any portion of
the taxes for real property taxes shall not be paid on or before the thirty-
first day of January, the penalty added shall be five (5) per cent thereon on
the amount still due to the county; and if such taxes, assessments and
penalties are not paid on or before the fifteenth day of April next thereafter,
an additional penalty of seven (7) per cent of the amount still due shall be
added and the county treasurer shall issue his tax execution for such taxes,
assessments and penalties against the property of the defaulting taxpayer
according to law.
   (d)   Penalties for late payment of personal property taxes. When any
portion of the taxes for personal property taxes shall not be paid on or before
the fifteenth day of September, the penalty added shall be five (5) per cent
thereon; and if such taxes, assessments and penalties are not paid on or before
the fifteenth day of November next thereafter, an additional penalty of seven
(7) per cent thereof shall be added, and the county treasurer shall issue his
tax execution for such taxes, assessments and penalties against the property of
the defaulting taxpayer according to law.
   (e)   Postponement of penalties. The council may postpone the time within
which the penalties provided in this section shall attach. In the event that
any of the aforementioned deadline dates fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or
holiday, such deadline shall be extended to the next working day.
   (f)   Payment by mail. In instances where taxes are paid by mail, no
penalties shall be assessed when the envelope in which the taxes were received
bears the postmark date of the deadline.

property due to the value of the property having been erroneously, improperly
or illegally assessed, the county council shall authorize a refund in the
amount determined to be erroneously, improperly, or illegally assessed.
   (b)   In the event that the refund referred to in paragraph (a) of this
section should be requested and authorized by county council in a year
subsequent to the fiscal year in which the overpayment was made, the county
treasurer shall charge back the amount of the refund, pro rata, to each entity
that received tax monies within the particular tax district for the specified
fiscal year. In so doing, the county treasurer shall reduce, by the total
amount of the refund, monies to be paid to each such entity during the fiscal
year in which the refund is made.
   (c)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 12-43-200(c)(3) of the S.C.
Code of Laws, as amended (and consistent with the provisions of Section 12-54-
85(F) of the S.C. Code of Laws, as amended), if a taxpayer believes that he or
she has overpaid his or her property taxes because the property was eligible
for the legal residence assessment pursuant to Sections 12-43-220(c)(1) and (2)

the County Assessor within three years from the time the return was filed, or

rehabilitation relating to one or more of the following:
      (1)   Improvements located on or within the historic building as

Sec. 23-64. Process.
   (a)   Fee required. There is a fee required for the review of rehabilitation
work during the final certification process. Final certification of the
property will not be given until the fee has been paid in full by the
applicant. Fees shall be made payable to Richland County. The amount of the fee
shall be as follows:
      (1)   For owner-occupied, non-income producing properties, the fee shall
be one hundred and fifty dollars ($150.00).
      (2)   For income-producing or non-owner occupied properties, the fee
shall be three hundred dollars ($300.00).
   (b)   Plan required. Owners of property seeking approval of rehabilitation
work must submit a completed rehabilitation of historic property application
with supporting documentation to the county administrator or his designee prior
to beginning work. Rehabilitation work conducted prior to approval of the
application is done so at the risk of the property owner.
   (c)   Preliminary certification. Upon receipt of the completed application,
the county administrator or his designee shall submit the plan to the reviewing
authority for a recommendation as to whether the project is consistent with the
standards for rehabilitation. Upon receipt of the reviewing authority’s
recommendation, the county administrator or his designee shall notify the owner
in writing. Upon receipt of this determination, the property owner may:
      (1)   If the application is approved, begin rehabilitation;
      (2)   If the application is not approved, he/she may revise such
application in accordance with comments provided by reviewing authority.
   (d)   Substantive changes. Once preliminary certification is granted to an
application, substantive changes must be approved in writing by the county
administrator or his designee. Any substantive changes made to the property
during rehabilitation that are not approved by county administrator or his
designee, upon review and recommendation of the reviewing authority, are
conducted at the risk of the property owner and may disqualify the project from
eligibility during the final certification process.
   (e)   Final certification. Upon completion of the project, the property must
receive final certification in order to be eligible for the special assessment.
The reviewing authority shall inspect completed projects to determine if the
work is consistent with the approval recommended by the reviewing authority and
granted by the county during preliminary certification. The review process for
final certification shall be established by the reviewing authority and may
include a physical inspection of the property. The reviewing authority shall
notify the applicant in writing of its recommendation. If the applicant wishes
to appeal the reviewing authority’s recommendation, the appeal must follow the
reviewing authority’s appeals process. The county administrator or his designee
may grant final certification only if the following conditions have been met:
      (1)   The completed work meets the standards for rehabilitation as
established in this article;
      (2)   Verification is made that the minimum expenditures have been have
been incurred in accordance with the provisions of this article; and
      (3)   Any fee(s) shall be paid in full.
   Upon receiving final certification, the property will be assessed for the
remainder of the special assessment period on the fair market value of the
property at the time the preliminary certification was made or the final
certification was made, whichever occurred earlier.
   (f)   Additional work. For the remainder of the special assessment period
after final certification, the property owner shall notify the county
administrator or his designee of any additional work, other than ordinary
maintenance, prior to the work beginning. The reviewing authority shall review
the work and make a recommendation to the county administrator or his designee
whether the overall project is consistent with the standards for
rehabilitation. The county administrator or his designee shall notify the
property owner in writing if the overall project is consistent with the
standards for rehabilitation. If the additional work is found to be
inconsistent by the reviewing authority, the county administrator or his
designee shall notify the owner in writing within thirty (30) days of its
decision to rescind approval. The property owner may withdraw his/her request
and cancel or revise the proposed additional work.
   (g)   Notification. Upon final certification of a rehabilitated historic
property, the Richland County Assessor, Auditor, and Treasurer shall be
notified by the county administrator or his designee that such property has
been duly certified and is eligible for the special tax assessment.
   (h)   Application. Once the final certification has been granted, the owner
of the property shall make application to the Richland County Auditor for the
special assessment provided for herein. The special assessment shall remain in
effect for the length of the special assessment period, unless the property
shall become decertified under the provisions of this section.
   (i)   Date effective. If an application for preliminary or final
certification is filed by May first or the preliminary or final certification
is approved by August first, the special assessment authorized herein is
effective for that year. Otherwise, it is effective beginning with the
following year. The special assessment only begins in the current or future tax
years as provided for in this section. The special assessment period shall not
exceed twenty (20) years in length, and in no instance may the special
assessment be applied retroactively.
   (j)   Previously certified properties. A property certified to receive the
special property tax assessment under the existing law continues to receive the
special assessment in effect at the time certification was made.
   (k)   Decertification. Once the property has received final certification
and assessed as rehabilitated historic property, it remains so certified and
must be granted the special assessment until the property becomes disqualified
by any one of the following:
      (1)   Written notice from the owner to the Richland County Auditor
requesting removal of the special assessment;
      (2)   Removal of the historic designation by the county council , based
upon noncompliance of the criteria established in Section
26-62(c); or
      (3)   Rescission of the approval of rehabilitation by the county, at the
recommendation of the reviewing authority, because of alterations or renovation
by the owner or the owner’s estate which causes the property to no longer
possess the qualities and features which made it eligible for final
certification. Notification of any change affecting eligibility must be given
immediately to the Richland County Assessor, Auditor, and Treasurer.

council within five (5) business days of receipt of the director's decision.

Sec. 23-73. Violations and penalties.
   (a)   It shall be a violation of this article to:
      (1)   Fail to collect the local hospitality tax as provided in this
article,
      (2)   Fail to remit to the County the Local Hospitality Tax collected,
pursuant to this Article,
      (3)   Knowingly provide false information on the form of return submitted
to the county, or
      (4)   Fail to provide books and records to the county administrator or
other authorized agent of the county for the purpose of an audit upon twenty-
four (24) hours' notice.
   (b)   The penalty for violation of this article shall be five percent (5%)
per month, charged on the original amount of the local hospitality tax due.
Penalties shall not be waived, except if the following circumstances of
reasonable cause are proven by the person. No more than six (6) months of
penalties shall be waived.
      (1)   An unexpected and unavoidable absence of the person from South
Carolina, such as being called to active military duty. In the case of a
corporation or other business entity, the absence must have been an individual
having primary authority to pay the hospitality tax.
      (2)   A delay caused by death or serious, incapacitating illness of the
person, the person's immediate family, or the person's accountant or other
third party professional charged with determining the hospitality tax owed. In
the case of a corporation or other business entity, the death or serious,
incapacitating illness must have been an individual having primary authority to
pay the hospitality tax.
      (3)   The hospitality tax was documented as paid on time, but
inadvertently paid to another taxing entity.
      (4)   The delinquency was caused by the unavailability of necessary
records directly relating to calculation of hospitality taxes, over which the
person had no control, which made timely payment impossible. For example, the
required records may have been destroyed by fire, flood, federally-declared
natural disaster, or actions of war or terrorism. Unavailability of records
caused by time or business pressures, employee turnover, or negligence are not
reasonable cause for waiver of hospitality tax penalties.
      (5)   The delinquency was the result of clear error on the part of the
business service center or treasurer's office staff in processing or posting
receipt of the person's payment(s).
      (6)   Delay or failure caused by good faith reliance on erroneous
guidance provided by the business service center or treasurer's office staff,
so long as complete and accurate information was given to either of these
offices, no change in the law occurred, and the person produces written
documentation.
   (c)   Any person violating the provision of this article shall be deemed
guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be subject to punishment
under the general penalty provision of Section
1-8 of this Code of Ordinances: that is, shall be subject to a fine of up to
five hundred dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment for not more than thirty (30)
days or both. Each day of violation shall be considered a separate offense.
Punishment for violation shall not relieve the offender of liability for
delinquent fees, penalties, and costs provided herein.

enacted by Ord. No. 1024-83 as a new Art. IV, the editor has included what was
Div. 2 of former Art. III as Div. 2 of current Art. III, designating §§ 24-11--
24-15 (former Art. II) as Div. 1 of new Art. III.
DIVISION 1. GENERALLY
Sec. 24-11. Background and policy.
   (a)   The county council, as the governing body of the county, hereby
certifies that water and sewer service is now being provided, funds have been
budgeted for such service, and funds for such services have been applied for;
and that the unincorporated areas of the county constitute a "designated
service area" within the meaning of section 5-7-60 of the South Carolina Code
of Laws, 1976.
   (b)   Pursuant to a 1978 referendum of its citizens, the county council
undertook to plan and implement a county-wide system for providing water and
sewer services under its obligations imposed by home rule (section 4-9-30(5) of
the South Carolina Code of Laws, 1976), and as authorized by section 16 of
Article VIII of the South Carolina Constitution, the county is under an
obligation to furnish the services required or to see that it is furnished in
an orderly and comprehensive plan particularly since portions of the county
have been and are at the present time in desperate need of sewer and water
facilities, and the health, safety and welfare of the county's citizens must be
protected as a part of the county's legal as well as moral obligation.
   (c)   The county further recognizes its obligations as a designated service
area as defined by section 5-7-60 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, 1976, and
therefore enacts this division, pursuant to the county's general police power
as well as the above-referenced authority.

incorporated herein as Appendix B to the ordinance from which this article
originally derives but not reproduced herein.
   (b)   Additional cost for high strength waste. If any person discharges into
the sanitary sewerage system a waste containing BOD concentration or suspended
solids in excess of three hundred (300) milligrams per liter, then such person
shall pay an additional cost according to rates determined by the appropriate
public agency.
   (c)   Unusual or burdensome wastes. If any person discharges into the
sanitary sewerage system a waste which, because of its particular or unusual
character, imposes an unusual burden on the sanitary sewerage system and the
waste treatment facilities, and causes the public agency to incur additional
expenses in the handling (conveying) and treatment of the waste by reasons of
(but not limited to) provision of additional personnel, provision of additional
equipment or structure, increase in operating costs, and decrease in efficiency
of treatment processes required by and resulting from the handling and
treatment of the waste, then such person shall be charged for such additional
expense over and above the other charges set forth hereinabove. The approving

(Ord. No. 1024-83, § 6, 3-15-83)
Sec. 24-92. Conditions for allowing discharge of industrial wastes into public
system.
   It is the desire and intent of the county to cooperate with industry in the
effort to improve quality, prevent impairment of quality, and maintain quality
of streams in the county in accordance with water quality standards established
by the department of health and environmental control of the state for the
various streams and watercourses in the county area. To this end the discharge
of industrial waste into the sanitary sewerage system may be permitted provided
that:
      (1)   Sewerage capacity is available on a basis compatible with the best
overall use of the sewer.
      (2)   The waste being discharged or proposed to be discharged is amenable
to treatment by the processes employed in the waste treatment plants to receive
such waste.
      (3)   The waste being discharged or proposed to be discharged will not
cause damage to the sanitary sewerage system and/or waste treatment facilities,
will not constitute a hazard to humans or animals, nor be capable of creating a
public nuisance.
      (4)   The concentration of substances, compounds, and elements in the
waste being discharged or proposed to be discharged does not exceed the limits
established by the appropriate public agency.
      (5)   Any person now discharging or proposing to discharge waste shall
fully comply with these rules and regulations.
   Applications for permits to discharge industrial waste into the sanitary
sewerage system of the county will be reviewed by the approving authority on
the above basis.
(Ord. No. 1024-83, § 5-1, 3-15-83)
Sec. 24-93. Chemical analysis of waste required.

industrial waste into the sanitary sewerage system shall submit with his
application to the approving authority a complete chemical analysis of the
waste being discharged or proposed to be discharged, including concentrations
of BOD and suspended solids contained therein. Such person shall also submit
pertinent flow data, including rates and duration, and description of his
operations. Should the waste from such person's operations be deemed to be
inadmissible into the sanitary sewerage system because of objectionable
character as defined by these rules and regulations, because of concentration
of elements or substances in excess of the limits established by the approving
authority, or because of flow characteristics incompatible with the best use of
the receiving sewer, the approving authority will not approve the discharge of
such waste into the sanitary sewerage system until such person has employed, at
his own expense, methods and processes of pretreatment as will render the waste
admissible to the sanitary sewerage system in accordance with these rules and
regulations.
   (b)   The approving authority will not specify, suggest, or recommend
equipment, structures, or arrangements comprising the pretreatment processes.
Approval of discharge of industrial waste by any person will be given only on
the basis of performance of pretreatment processes (if pretreatment should be
required). Approval given to any person for discharge of industrial waste,
whether pretreated or not, into the sanitary sewerage system shall in no way
relieve such person of the responsibility of full compliance with these rules
and regulations at all times.

sanitary sewerage system shall be measured by one or more of the following
methods:
      (1)   If the volume of water used by any person in his industrial or
process operations is substantially the same as the volume purchased from the
municipal waterworks system, then the volume of water purchased shall be
considered to be the volume of waste discharged.
      (2)   If, in the establishment of any person discharging industrial waste
into the sanitary sewerage system, a substantial portion of the water purchased
from the municipal waterworks system is used for domestic or commercial
purposes (resulting in "normal waste"), for cooling purposes, or for other
purposes that do not require the discharge of such used water to the sanitary
sewerage system, such person may, at his own expense, install a meter (or
meters) of design approved by the approving authority on the waste line (or
wastes lines) from his industrial and/or process operations. The volume of
waste flow, as measured through the meter or meters shall be considered to be
the volume of waste discharged to the sanitary sewerage system.
      (3)   If any person now discharging or proposing to discharge industrial
waste into the sanitary sewerage system does not secure his entire water supply
requirements from the municipal waterworks system, such person shall, at his
own expense, install a meter (or meters) of design approved by the approving
authority on the waste line (or waste lines) from his industrial and/or process
operations. The volume of waste flow, as measured through the meter (or meters)
shall be considered to be the volume of waste discharged to the sanitary
sewerage system.
(Ord. No. 1024-83, § 5-5, 3-15-83)
Sec. 24-96. Requirement for holding capacity.
   To utilize the capacity of the sanitary sewerage system effectively and to
facilitate operation of the waste treatment facilities it may be desirable that
discharge of industrial waste into the sanitary sewerage system be done at a
uniform rate of flow over a period of twenty-four (24) hours or bulk discharge
at specific periods of time. In order to accomplish this purpose any person now
discharging or proposing to discharge industrial waste into the sanitary
sewerage system shall provide, at his own expense, a holding tank or holding
tanks from which such waste shall be discharged at a specified rate of flow
over a twenty-four-hour period. The above requirement may be waived provided
that:
      (1)   The total daily waste flow from the establishment of such person
does not exceed fifty thousand (50,000) gallons;
      (2)   The maximum rate of discharge from said establishment does not
exceed one hundred (100) GPM; and,
      (3)   In all other respects, the discharge of such waste is in full
compliance with these rules and regulations.
(Ord. No. 1024-83, § 5-3, 3-15-83)
Sec. 24-97. Sampling of industrial waste required.
   (a)   The industrial waste and/or other pollutants being discharged by any
person into the sanitary sewerage system shall be subject to periodic
inspection; and a determination of character and strength of those wastes shall
be made quarterly, or more often as may be deemed necessary, by the approving
authority or his authorized assistants.
   (b)   Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be representative of
the wastes being discharged. The laboratory methods followed in the examination
of those wastes shall be those as set forth in "Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater," latest edition, published by the American
Public Health Association, Inc., copy of which is on file in the office of the
approving authority for inspection by interested persons or parties.
   (c)   The determination of the character, strength, or quantity of the
wastes as made by the approving authority or his authorized assistants shall be
binding as a basis for computation of charges. The person discharging such
wastes may, however, conduct his own sampling and analytical program and submit
to the approving authority the results relating to character, strength, and
quantity of the wastes. In such cases, however, the securing of samples shall
be in accordance with method acceptable to the approving authority; and the
laboratory procedures followed in analyzing the samples shall be specified
hereinabove. Acceptance or rejection of the results thus submitted shall be a
right herein reserved for the approving authority.
(Ord. No. 1024-83, § 8, 3-15-83)
Sec. 24-98. Control manhole.
   (a)   Any person now discharging or proposing to discharge any industrial
waste into the sanitary sewerage system shall construct, at his own expense, a
control manhole on the waste line (or waste lines) from his industrial and/or
process operations for the purpose of facilitating observations, measurements,
and sampling of the industrial waste discharged from such person's
establishment. The control manhole shall be constructed in a suitable and
satisfactory location downstream from any pretreatment facilities, holding
tanks, or other approved works, and ahead of the point of discharge of such
waste into the sanitary sewerage system. The design of the control manhole
shall be in accordance with the requirements of the approving authority. The
control manhole shall be maintained by such person so as to be safe,
accessible, and in proper operating condition at all times.
   (b)   The requirement with respect to construction of a control manhole may
be waived provided that:
      (1)   Total daily waste flow from the establishment of such person does
not exceed fifty thousand (50,000) gallons;
      (2)   The maximum rate of discharge from the establishment does not
exceed one hundred (100) GPM;
      (3)   Access, means, and facilities are provided within such person's
establishment for the purpose of observing, measuring, and sampling the waste
flow from such person's establishment; and,
      (4)   The discharge of all such waste from the establishment is, in all
other respects, in full compliance with these rules and regulations.
(Ord. No. 1024-83, § 5-6, 3-15-83)
Sec. 24-99. Right of entry.
   The approving authority or his duly authorized representative, bearing
proper credentials and identification, shall be permitted to enter upon all
properties for the purpose of inspection, observation, flow measurement,
sampling, and testing of industrial waste and other pollutants, in accordance
with these rules and regulations.
(Ord. No. 1024-83, § 7-1, 3-15-83)
Sec. 24-100. Right to refuse discharge.
   (a)   The approving authority may temporarily exclude from the sanitary
sewerage system any industrial waste or other pollutant, whether pretreated or
not, whenever in the opinion of the approving authority such action is
necessary for the purpose of determining the effects of such waste upon the
sanitary sewerage system and the waste treatment facilities.
   (b)   Any industrial waste or other pollutant may be excluded from the
sanitary sewerage system, whether pretreated or not, whenever in the opinion of
the appropriate public agency such action is necessary to protect the sanitary
sewerage system and the waste treatment facilities or to facilitate the
operation of the sanitary sewerage system and the waste treatment facilities.

24-121 et seq.
ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sec. 24.5-1. Findings of fact concerning the public health in certain
communities.
   (a)   Richland County, South Carolina, is a political subdivision of the
State of South Carolina (the state), and as such possesses all general powers
granted by the constitution and statutes of the state to political
subdivisions, including the power to operate sewer systems and to furnish sewer
service for domestic and industrial use within the county. Pursuant to the
provisions of Section 16 of Article VIII of the South Carolina Constitution, a
referendum was conducted in Richland County on November 7, 1978, which resulted
favorable to the question of whether or not the council should take what
"action is necessary to establish and implement a complete and comprehensive
program designed to provide water and sewer services to the residents of the
County of Richland." In accordance with the authorization provided by such
referendum and pursuant to the provisions of Section 4-9-30(5)(a) of the Code
of Laws of South Carolina, 1976, as amended, the council has authorized and is
presently financing the construction of sewage collection lines in two (2)
areas of the county which were created as special taxing districts pursuant to
said Section 4-9-30(5)(a) and are known as the Ballentine Estates Sewer
District and the Chartwell Sewer District.
   (b)   The population growth pattern in the county has been such that certain
communities have developed which either have an inadequate sewer service system
which fails to meet minimally acceptable public health standards, or have no
sewer system at all. A great many of such communities in the county cannot be
served now or in the foreseeable future by either existing public service
district systems or existing municipal sewer systems.
   (c)   In order to improve the sanitary conditions in these communities to
reasonably acceptable public health standards, the council has determined to
exercise its inherent police powers and to provide sewage treatment and
disposal facilities therefor as provided in accordance with the provisions of
section 24.5-21 of this chapter.

Acts and Joint Resolutions of the General Assembly of the State of South
Carolina for the year 1965, codified as Chapter 15 of Title 6, Code of Laws of
South Carolina, 1976, the county is authorized to contract with other
governmental entities to provide for the collection, disposal and treatment of
sewage, and further, may impose upon those persons receiving sewer service both
sewer service charges and sewer connection charges. The sewer service charge,
authorized thereby, may be sufficient to provide for all or a part of the
operating costs of the sewer facilities, and to provide debt service on bonds
issued to finance the system. The sewer connection charge is intended to
adequately reimburse the county for effecting the connection to the system.
   (b)   Moreover, by virtue of Section 8 of Act No. 212 of the Acts and Joint
Resolutions of the General Assembly of the State of South Carolina for the year
1975, which is codified as Article 15 of Title 44, Code of Laws of South
Carolina, 1976, the county is authorized to acquire, construct, improve,
enlarge, operate and maintain facilities for the collection, treatment and
disposition of sewage. The county also is authorized to place into effect and

ARTICLE II. CREATION OF SPECIAL ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS
Sec. 24.5-21. Conditions for creation.
   Prior to the creation of a district by the council, a study shall be made
under the direction of the county coordinator of utilities and services which
specifically addresses the question of whether or not a system is necessary to
provide or improve sanitary conditions in the proposed district, so that the
benefits therefrom would benefit the property owners thereof in a manner
distinguishable from the general benefit which would be enjoyed by surrounding
areas as a result of the proposed extension to the system. The district shall
not be created unless such findings conclude that the benefits would meet such
criteria. Such findings shall also include the estimated cost of constructing
and installing the necessary sewer lateral and collection lines, appurtenances
and contingencies, and the estimated capital sewer service charges, sewer
connection charges and sewer service charges to be imposed upon those persons
and properties which would receive such benefits.
(Ord. No. 1590-87, § 3.01, 2-17-87)

council determines to issue general obligation bonds in order to finance such
system, the debt service on such bonds shall be paid from special assessments
imposed upon the persons and properties of the district receiving the benefit
therefrom in the form of capital sewer service charges.
(Ord. No. 1590-87, § 3.03, 2-17-87)
Sec. 24.5-24. Consent of or contracts with other governmental entities.
   (a)   Either prior to or after the creation of a district which would lie in
or is partially or totally within either the territory of a special purpose
district or authority existing on March 7, 1973, or the corporate limits of an
incorporated municipality, the county shall either obtain the consent of the
governing body of such entity, or contract with such entity for the most
efficient use of the sewer facilities which are available.
   (b)   Such contracts may provide for the joint ownership of the sewer
facilities or for the ownership of such facilities by any of the contracting
parties, provided that the remaining parties shall be empowered to utilize such
sewer facilities to the extent provided for in any such contract.
   (c)   Such contracts shall be executed on behalf of each contracting party,
after it has been approved by resolution or other action taken by the governing
body thereof. An authorized officer shall sign any such contracts on behalf of
the county.

general obligation bonds by the county, it shall become a part of the
transcript of proceedings incident to the issuance of such bonds and shall be
filed in the manner prescribed by section 11-15-10 of the Code of Laws of South
Carolina, 1976 (as may be now or hereafter amended), and shall also be filed
with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control.

shall be given to all affected property owners notifying them of a public
hearing to be held on the question of creating a district, such notification to
be made by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the county.
Such notice shall notify the property owners of (1) the proposed boundaries of
said district; (2) their right to appear and be heard in person or by counsel
before the council; (3) the time and place of this hearing at which they will
be afforded the opportunity to be heard; (4) the intended benefits to result
from such creation; and (5) an estimated schedule of the nature and quantum of
proposed sewer service charges, sewer connection charges, and capital sewer
service charges required to pay the operational costs of such sewer facilities
and to pay any bonded indebtedness incurred as a result of providing or
extending service within the district. The agenda for such a meeting may
include a reading of the ordinance proposing to create the district.

obligation bonds of the county to finance the extension of the system in order
to provide sewage collection services to the district, such debt to be incurred
pursuant to and within the limitations provided by Section 12 of Article X of
the South Carolina Constitution, the council shall impose upon all persons and
properties in the district and capital sewer service charges which shall be
imposed in the form of assessments as provided in sections
24.5-42 through
24.5-44 hereof and which shall be in an amount designed to provide sufficient
funds to pay the debt service on such bonds.
(Ord. No. 1590-87, § 4.01, 2-17-87)

unpaid sewer service charges and capital sewer service charges in any lawful
manner which methods include the entering into contracts for the collection of
such charges with other political subdivision. In addition, the county shall
participate in and utilize the Setoff Debt Collection Act (S.C. Code §§ 12-56-
10 et seq.) and Government Enterprise Accounts Receivable program (S.C. Code §§
12-4-580 et seq.) for the collection of unpaid water and sewer charges,
including late fees.

Sec. 24.5-43. Sewer service charges and sewer connection charges.
   The council shall place into effect and revise whenever it so wishes or may
be required a schedule of sewer service and sewer connection charges to be
imposed within the district for the use of the connection to the system.
(Ord. No. 1590-87, § 5.02, 2-17-87; Ord. No. 1942-89, § I, 12-5-89; Ord. No.
012-15HR, § IV, 5-5-15)
Sec. 24.5-44. Capital sewer service charges.
   (a)   The council shall place into effect and revise whenever it so wishes
or may be required a schedule of capital sewer service charges which will be
used to retire debt incurred to finance that portion of the system within a
particular district. The capital sewer service charges shall be based on the
estimated cost of the establishment and construction of any sewer lateral
collection lines and any extensions thereof constructed within the district, or
so much of the estimated cost thereof as the council in its discretion deems
appropriate, and shall be assessed upon the lots and parcels of land abutting
directly on such lateral lines or extensions thereof according to the extent of
the respective frontage thereon by an equal rate per foot of such frontage; but
the council may, in its discretion, provide, in the instance of corner lots,
for a charge deemed to be equitable. If part or all of the district is part of
a development plan or zoned for residential use, then such capital sewer
service charges may be levied by the council on a parcel or per unit basis
rather than on a front-foot basis. The capital sewer service charges to be
levied in connection with such installations may be paid in equal installments
covering a period not to exceed twenty (20) years. Such deferred payments shall
be payable annually within the period that county taxes are payable and late
payments shall be penalized to the same extent as in the case of county taxes.
   (b)   In connection with the imposition of such capital sewer service
charges:
   (1)   The council shall provide a general description of the improvements to
be made and the street or parts thereof whereon the work is to be effected and
the estimated cost thereof and the amount of the cost to be assessed upon all
abutting properties and the terms and manner of payment Such description may
incorporate by reference plats and engineering reports and other data on file
in the office of the county coordinator of utilities and services provided that
the place of filing and reasonable hours for inspection by interested persons
are specified in the onlinance imposing the capital sewer service charges.
Within thirty (30) days of the creation of a district, the council shall
prepare in poster form a notice advising of the proposed capital sewer service
charges and generally describing the area to be affected and shall deliver the
notice to the register of mesne conveyances of the county. The register of
mesne conveyances shall prominently display such notice in his office until an
assessment book compiling a list of all residents and property owners of the
district has been prepared by the county auditor and filed with the council.
Failure to provide or post such notice shall not affect the validity of any
such assessment.
   (2)   Immediately after such assessment book has been completed, the council
shall forthwith cause one copy thereof to be deposited in the office of the
register of mesne conveyances for inspection by interested parties, and shall
cause to be published at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in
the county a notice of the completion of the assessment book. This notice shall
set forth a description in general terms of the improvements and the time fixed
for the meeting of the council for a hearing of objections in respect of the
capital sewer service charges. Such meeting shall not be earlier than ten (10)
days from the date of the publication of such notice.
   (3)   As soon as practicable after the completion of the assessment book and
prior to the publication of the notice mentioned in the preceding paragraph
(2), the council shall mail to the owner or owners of each lot or parcel of
land against which a capital sewer service charge is to be levied at his or
their address, if any, appearing on the records of the county auditor, a notice
stating the nature of the improvement, the principal amount of bonds to be
issued in order to finance the improvements, the appropriated amount to be
assessed against the particular property in order to repay the bonds, and the
frontage in feet or charge per parcel upon which the capital sewer service
charge is based, together with the terms and conditions upon which the capital
sewer service charge may be paid. This notice shall also contain a brief
description of the district together with a statement that the amount assessed
shall constitute a lien against the property superior to all other liens except
property taxes. The notice shall also state the time and place fixed for the
meeting of the council mentioned in the preceding paragraph (2) for a hearing
of objections in respect of the capital sewer service charge. Any property
owner who fails to appear at the meeting and shall have failed not later than
three (3) days prior to the date set for such meeting, to file with the council
a written objection to the capital sewer system charges against his property
shall be deemed to have waived all rights to object to such capital sewer
service charges and the notice prescribed herein shall so state.
   (4)   At the time and place specified for the meeting above-mentioned, or at
some other time to which it may adjourn, the council shall hear the objections
of all persons who have filed written notice of objection within the time
prescribed above who may appear and make proof in relation thereto either in
person or by their attorney. The council may thereupon make such corrections in
the assessment book as it may deem proper, confirm the same or set it aside and
provide for a new assessment.
      Immediately upon the confirmation of a capital sewer service charge, the
council shall mail a written notice (the confirmation notice) to all persons
who have filed written objections as hereinabove provided of the amount of the
capital sewer service charge confirmed against his property. Such notice shall
be given to the affected property owners not less than ten (10) days prior to
the effective date of the capital sewer service charge.
      Subsequent to the council’s confirming an assessment book, either as
originally prepared or as thereafter corrected, a copy thereof certified by the
clerk of the council shall forthwith be filed in the office of the register of
mesne conveyances.
   (5)   After the assessment book has been confirmed, a certified copy thereof
shall be delivered to the county treasurer who shall prepare and keep a
separate book or books in connection therewith and who shall proceed to collect
the same in the manner of county taxes and shall remit such collections on or
before April fifteenth of each year upon the direction of the council. Each
year the county auditor shall mail out notices of such capital sewer service
charges at the same time county tax notices are mailed.
   (6)   If any such person is dissatisfied with the amount of the capital
sewer service charge so confirmed, such person shall within ten (10) days after
the mailing of the confirmation notice to him, give written notice to the
council of his intent to appeal the capital sewer service charge to the court
of common pleas for the county, and shall within five (5) days after giving
such notice to the council serve upon the council a statement of facts upon
which he bases his appeal. Any property owner who fails to give the notice of
his objection prescribed by this paragraph, shall be deemed to have waived all
rights to object to the capital sewer service charge and the corifirmation
notice shall so state and shall also advise of the appeal procedure provided by
this paragraph. No such appeal shall delay the construction of the improvements
or affect the validity of the capital sewer service charges confirmed and not
appealed.
   (7)   Subsequent to the confirmation of an assessment book, the council may
correct, cancel or remit any such capital sewer service charge and may remit,
cancel or adjust the interest or penalties of any capital sewer service charge
and is empowered, when in its judgment there is any irregularity, omission,
error or lack of jurisdiction in any of the proceedings relating thereto, to
set aside the capital sewer service charge made by it and thereupon to make a
reassessment
   (c)   In the event the council provides that such capital sewer system
charges may be paid in equal annual installments, then any property owner shall
have the right at any time in his option to prepay in full the capital sewer
service charge against his property by the payment of the balance due plus
interest calculated to the date of prepayment.

   State law reference(s)--Wreckers exempted from motor vehicle carriers law,
S.C. Code 1976, § 58-23-50.
Sec. 25-11. Scope.
   This article shall apply to all wrecker and towing services doing business
in the unincorporated areas of the county.
(Ord. No. 764-81, § I, 1-7-81)
Sec. 25-12. Definitions.
   For the purposes of this article:
   Doing business shall mean providing, operating, or causing to be provided or
operated wrecker and towing services in the unincorporated areas of the county,
regardless of whether the principal place of business is in the unincorporated
area of the county.
   Wrecker and towing services shall mean any person providing to the public
services for the moving or transporting of vehicles.
(Ord. No. 764-81, § I, 1-7-81)
Sec. 25-13. Prohibited from going to scene of an accident unless requested.
   No wrecker, wrecker operator, or agent or employee of a wrecker service
shall proceed to the scene of an accident in the unincorporated area of the
county unless requested to do so by the owner or driver of a vehicle involved
in the accident, or the law enforcement officer in charge at the scene of the
accident.
(Ord. No. 764-81, § II, 1-7-81)
Sec. 25-14. Dispatching procedure.
   In all instances where a vehicle is to be transported or moved:
   (a)   Should the owner or driver of the vehicle involved within the
unincorporated areas of the county request the services of a particular wrecker
service or operator, whether or not such service is on the approved list
hereafter mentioned, the law enforcement officer who is in charge at the scene
of the accident shall so inform his dispatcher, who will thereupon call the
requested wrecker service or operator and ask such service or operator to
proceed to the scene of the accident.
   (b)   If the owner or driver of the vehicle involved expresses no
preference, is unable to express a preference, or has no information as to
available wrecker services, the following procedures shall apply:
      (1)   For the purposes of this article, the county will be divided into
two (2) zones which are hereafter outlined and attached, and incorporated into
this article.
      (2)   All wrecker services doing business within the unincorporated areas
of the county meeting the requirements of this article will be dispatched from
the sheriff's dispatcher's office which will have a list of participating
wrecker services.
      (3)   The wrecker services will be set up on a rotation basis for the
zones. Each zone will have a rotation list of wrecker services and will be
dispatched from the sheriff's office as they are listed. When a wrecker service
is needed, the dispatcher will rotate his list in order so all wrecker services
can participate in their turn. All heavy-duty wreckers will rotate in the same
order as regular wrecker services, and will be zoned as above mentioned. If no
particular wrecker operator or service is requested by the owner or driver, the
dispatcher will refer to the list of wrecker operators for the zone where the
vehicle is located and call the wrecker operator or service which appears next
on his list after the name of the last operator which was called (which in turn
rotates the wrecker services). The law enforcement officers will make no
recommendation to the owner or driver as to their preference of a wrecker
service.

be placed on a list of participating wrecker services which shall be approved
by the county administrator and distributed to the sheriff's department
dispatcher and administered as set forth in section
25-14 of this article.
   (b)   Approval may be withdrawn from an approved wrecker service if at any

thirty (30) days' written notice from the county administrator's office.

   ARTICLE IV. AMENDMENTS AND PROCEDURES
Sec. 26-51. General.
   This article contains the detailed procedures relevant to carrying out the
purposes set forth throughout this chapter. The processes for revising this
chapter and the official zoning map for the county are contained herein.
Additionally, all review and permitting procedures required by this chapter are
also outlined in this article.
   (a)   Permits/approval types. Any development within the jurisdiction of
Richland County may require one or more of the permits and approvals detailed
in this article to ensure that the development is consistent with the goals and
purposes of this chapter and with the public health, safety and general
welfare. Permits and approvals include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
following:
   Land Development Permits (Land Development Compliance Review, Minor Land
Development Review and Major Land Development Review). (Section
26-53).
   Subdivision Review and Approval. (Section
26-54).
   Permitted Uses with Special Requirements. (Section
26-55).
   Special Exceptions. (Section
26-56).
   Variances. (Section
26-57).
   Appeals of Administrative Decisions. (Section
26-58).
   Planned Development Review and Approval. (Section
26-59).
   Certificates of Zoning Compliance. (Section
26-60).
   Review in the FP Floodplain Overlay District. (Section
26-61).
   Sign Permits. (Section
26-62).
   Temporary Use Permits. (Section
26-63).
   Land Disturbance Permits with approved SWPPPs. (Section
26-64).
   Applications for all permits or approvals, unless otherwise specified, may
be made at the Richland County Planning and Development Services Department.
The review procedures described in this article are those required by Richland
County. Other agencies and/or departments may have separate procedures that
must be followed in order to obtain plan approval. Those agencies must be
contacted to obtain information regarding the proper procedure for approval of
plans and construction.
   (b)   Simultaneous processing of applications.  This article intends to
accommodate, where possible, the simultaneous processing of applications for
different permits and approvals that may be required for the same project in
order to make the review process as short as possible. However, some forms of
approval depend upon the applicant having previously received another form of
approval. The applicant should note that each of the permits and approvals set
forth in this section has its own review sequence, and this should be taken
into consideration when planning the development.
   (c)   Application and review fees. Requests for review of various permit and
approval applications required by this article are subject to the payment of
various fees in order to defray the county's administrative costs. The fees for
different types of permits and approvals are kept on file in the Richland
County Planning and Development Services Department and the Richland County
Public Works Department. These fees are determined by the Richland County
Council and are periodically revised by the council.

      (1)   Withdrawal. An applicant may only withdraw an amendment application
(which has been submitted to the Richland County Council with planning
commission recommendation) not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the
scheduled County Council Zoning Public Hearing. Less than fifteen (15) days
before the Zoning Public Hearing, the applicant may only request a withdrawal
by appearing before the County Council at the scheduled zoning public hearing.
A withdrawal shall be considered a termination of the application. Resubmission
shall be processed as a new application and all applicable fees will be
assessed.
      (2)   Major change to a proposed map amendment shall be considered a
withdrawal. A major change to a proposed map amendment application is any
change initiated by the applicant or property owner that would result in a
different zoning district classification than initially requested, or would
result in a significant alteration in the requested zoning district boundary,
or would result in a major amendment to a Planned Development District. Any
major change in a proposed map amendment application, prior to enactment of the
map amendment at third reading by County Council, shall be considered a
withdrawal. A new application shall be submitted and all applicable fees will
be assessed.
      (3)   Reconsideration after denial.
         a.   Waiting period. When an application for a change in land use
classification has been disapproved by the county council, reapplication for
the same change, for the same parcel of land, in whole or in part, shall not be
permitted until twelve (12) months from the date of final determination or
action of the council.
         b.   Waiting period waiver. The waiting period required by this
subsection shall be waived if the planning commission recommends to the county
council that reconsideration be given, after the planning commission has found
that either:
            1.   There has been substantial change in the character of the
area; or
            2.   Evidence of factors or conditions exist (that were not
considered by the planning commission or the county council in previous
deliberations), which might substantially alter the basis upon which the
previous determination was reached.

III, 7-21-09; Ord. No. 028-13HR, § I, 6-18-13)
Sec. 26-53. Land development permits.
   (a)   General. No building or other structure shall be erected, moved, added
to, or structurally altered without a land development permit being issued by
the county. In addition to building or structural change, a land development
permit shall also be required for expansions of existing uses as well as for a
change of use. A land development permit shall not be issued by the planning
department except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter, unless the
planning department receives a written order from the Richland County board of
zoning appeals in the form of an interpretation involving error (Section
26-58) or a special exception (Section
26-56) or variance (Section
26-57). If the permit is denied, reasons for the denial shall be stated. The
planning department shall notify the building and inspections department and
the emergency services department whenever plans are submitted that affect the
"emergency planning zone" (EPZ) of the V.C. Summer Nuclear Plant (which is
located in Fairfield County) that involves an entity that will employ or house
more than one hundred (100) persons in a facility on a regular basis, as in
those instances an evacuation plan must be first submitted to and approved by
the emergency services department prior to the issuance of any building permit
or land development permit.
   (b)   Processes. There are three (3) types of land development permit
processes: land development compliance review, minor land development review,
and major land development review. The type of process to be applied to a
particular development application depends on the nature of the development
proposed.
      (1)   Land development compliance review.
         a.   Applicability. Construction of detached single-family dwelling
units and two-family dwellings on individual lots of record are subject only to
land development compliance review in order to obtain a land development
permit. In addition, changes of use not involving new construction are subject
only to land development compliance review in order to obtain a land
development permit.
         b.   Plan submittal. An application for a land development permit
subject to land development compliance review shall be filed by the owner of
the property or by an authorized agent. All documents/ information required on
the application must be submitted - including the permit fee, as established by
county council.
         c.   Staff review. The planning department shall review the
application and determine if it is complete. If the application is incomplete,
the planning department shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies.
Provided the application is complete, the planning department, for projects not
involving some other form of review, shall approve or deny the approval of the
application within thirty (30) days of receipt. Failure to act within thirty
(30) days, unless extended by mutual agreement, shall be considered to
constitute approval. In most situations, land development compliance review and
the issuance of a land development permit can be handled at the time of
application submittal. A record of all actions will be maintained as a public
record and the applicant must be notified in writing of any actions taken.
         d.   Public notification. No public notification is required for land
development permit issuance subject to land development compliance review.
         e.   Formal review. No formal review is required for land development
permit issuance subject to land development compliance review.
         f.   Variances. Requests for variances, unless otherwise specified,
shall be heard by the board of zoning appeals under the procedures set forth in
Section
26-57 of this chapter.
         g.   Appeals. Appeals of the decisions of the planning department
regarding land development permit applications, which must be filed within
thirty (30) days after actual notice of the decision, shall be heard by the
planning commission under the procedures set forth at Section
26-58 of this chapter. Such appeals shall encompass all issues for appeal. An
appeal from the decision of the planning commission by a person who may have a
substantial interest in the decision must be taken to the circuit court within
thirty (30) days after actual notice of the decision. In the alternative, also
within thirty (30) days, a property owner whose land is the subject of a
decision by the planning commission may appeal by filing a notice of appeal
with the circuit court accompanied by a request for pre-litigation mediation in
accordance with S.C. Code 1976, §§ 6-29-1150 and 6-29-1155.
         h.   Permit validity. In accordance with S.C. Code 1976, §§ 6-29-1510,
et seq., as amended, upon the issuance of a land development permit, the
applicant shall have a vested right for two (2) years from the date of issuance
to undertake and complete the corresponding development of property under the
terms and conditions of the approved site specific development plan. Failure to
complete work within this time shall render the permit void. However, the
applicant may request a one (1) year extension of this time period no later
than thirty (30) days and no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the
expiration of the permit. The request for an extension must be approved unless
otherwise prohibited by an intervening amendment to this chapter, such
amendment having become effective prior to the expiration of the permit.
Likewise, and in the same manner, the applicant may apply for four (4) more one
(1) year extensions. Any change from the approved site specific development
plan that has not first been reviewed and approved by the planning department
shall render the land development permit invalid.
      (2)   Minor land development review.
         a.   Applicability. Minor land developments are those developments
(exclusive of residential or commercial subdivisions) that do not meet the
standards for applicability for "land development compliance review" or "major
land development" review. If a phased project would reach the thresholds for a
major land development within a five (5) year period, then the project shall be
treated as a major land development, regardless of the size of the individual
phases. To be considered a minor land development, the subdividing of property
or the dedication of land to the county for open space or other public purposes
shall not be part of the development. Minor land developments are subject to
the review process outlined in subparagraphs b. through f. below in order to
obtain a land development permit.
         b.   Plan submittal. An application for a land development permit
subject to minor land development review shall be filed by the owner of the
property or by an authorized agent. All documents/ information required on the
application must be submitted - including the permit fee, as established by
county council.
         c.    Staff review. The planning department shall review the
application and determine if it is complete. If the application is incomplete,
the planning department shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies within
ten (10) days of the most recent submission date. Provided the application is
complete, the following shall occur.
            1.   Planning staff review. Plans for development requiring minor
land development review shall be reviewed by the planning department for
compliance with the requirements of this chapter.
            2.   Development review team. As needed, plans for development
requiring minor land development review shall be reviewed by members of the
county's development review team for compliance with the requirements of this
chapter and other applicable county codes. No formal team review shall be
required.
            The planning department shall approve, approve conditionally, or
deny the approval of the application within thirty (30) days of receipt.
Failure to act on an application within thirty (30) days shall be considered to
constitute approval. A record of all actions will be maintained as a public
record and the applicant must be notified of any actions taken.
         d.   Public notification. No public notification is required for land
development permit issuance subject to minor land development review.
         e.   Formal review. No formal review is required for land development
permit issuance subject to minor land development review.
         f.   Variances. Requests for variances, unless otherwise specified,
shall be heard by the board of zoning appeals under the procedures set forth in
Section 26-57 of this chapter. However, requests for variances from the
requirements set forth in Article IX shall be heard by the planning commission.
         g.   Appeals. Appeals of the decisions of the planning department
regarding land development permit applications (subject to minor land
development review), which must be filed within thirty (30) days after actual
notice of the decision, shall be heard by the planning commission under the
procedures set forth in Section
26-58 of this chapter. Such appeals shall encompass all issues for appeal. An
appeal of the decision of the planning commission by a person who may have a
substantial interest in the decision must be taken to the circuit court within
thirty (30) days after actual notice of the decision. In the alternative, also
within thirty (30) days, a property owner whose land is the subject of a
decision by the planning commission may appeal by filing a notice of appeal
with the circuit court, accompanied by a request for pre-litigation mediation
in accordance with S.C. Code 1976, §§ 6-29-1150 and 6-29-1155.
         h.   Permit validity. In accordance with S.C. Code 1976, §§ 6-29-1510,
et seq., as amended, upon the issuance of a land development permit, the
applicant shall have a vested right for two (2) years from the date of issuance
to undertake and complete the corresponding development of property under the
terms and conditions of the approved site specific development plan. Failure to
complete work within this time shall render the permit void. However, the
applicant may request a one (1) year extension of this time period no later
than thirty (30) days and no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the
expiration of the permit. The request for an extension must be approved unless
otherwise prohibited by an intervening amendment to this chapter, such
amendment having become effective prior to the expiration of the permit.
Likewise, and in the same manner, the applicant may apply for four (4) more one
(1) year extensions. Any change from the approved site specific development
plan that has not first been reviewed and approved by the planning department
shall render the land development permit invalid.
      (3)   Major land development review.
         a.   Applicability. Major land developments are those developments,
exclusive of residential or commercial subdivisions, which:
            1.   Involve one hundred thousand (100,000) or more square feet of
nonresidential floor space;
            2.   Involve one hundred and fifty (150) or more multi-family
residential dwelling units, lots or manufactured home spaces in a manufactured
home district; and/or
            3.   Involve the dedication of land to the county for open space or
other public purposes.
            Due to the size of these projects, a more formal review process is
required. This review process is established to ensure the safety of the public
and to assure that adequate services and facilities can be provided for these
developments and to assure that they do not negatively impact the area in which
they are proposed to be located or the county as a whole.
         b.   Plan submittal.
            1.   Filing of application. Applications for land development
permits subject to major land development review shall be filed by the owner of
the property or an authorized agent. All documents/information required on the
application must be submitted, including the permit fee, as established by
county council.
            2.   Preparation of plans. Site plans for developments requiring
major land development review shall be prepared by a registered architect,
engineer, landscape architect, or licensed surveyor.
         c.   Staff review. The planning department shall review the
application and determine if it is complete. If the application is incomplete,
the planning department shall notify the applicant of the deficiencies within
ten (10) days of the most recent submission date. Provided the application is
complete, the following shall occur:
            1.   Scheduling. The schedule for meetings of the development
review team shall be kept and maintained in the office of the planning and
development services department.
            2.   Development review team. The planning department shall
distribute site plans to members of the development review team. The
development review team members shall review the site plans for compliance with
the development regulations of Richland County. Upon review, the development
review team shall determine one of the following:
               [a]   The project is in compliance with the development
regulations of Richland County. If the site plan is approved by the development
review team, the planning department shall notify the applicant and transmit
the site plan to the planning commission for their information.
               [b]   The project is not in compliance with the development
regulations of Richland County. The site plan shall be denied, and the reasons
for denial shall be provided to the applicant. The site plan may be revised to
address the reasons for denial and resubmitted. Revised site plans shall be
administratively reviewed; provided, however, major changes that materially
affect the characteristics of the site plan, as determined by the planning
director, may require an additional DRT review.
               The decision of the DRT will be posted on the first day of the
month outside of the planning department office, on the bulletin board located
in the lobby of the county administration building, and on the county website.
Appeals must be filed to the planning commission within fifteen (15) days of
the posting.
         d.   Public notification. No public notification is required for land
development permit applications.
         e.   Variances. Requests for variances, unless otherwise specified,
shall be heard by the board of zoning appeals under the procedures set forth in
Section
26-57 of this chapter.
         f.   Appeals.
            1.   Appeals shall be made to the planning commission, subject to
the procedures set forth in Section
26-58 and the payment of fees as established by county council.
            2.   Pursuant to the requirements of S.C. Code 1976, § 6-29-1150
(c), any person who may have a substantial interest in the decision of the
planning commission may appeal such decision to the circuit court, provided
that a proper petition is filed with the county clerk of court within thirty
(30) days after receipt of the written notice of the decision by the applicant.
An appeal shall cease all staff review regarding the subject property. However,
a reconsideration request may be heard at the same time as an appeal is
pending. Since an appeal to the circuit court must be based on the factual
record generated during the subdivision review process, it is the applicant's
responsibility to present whatever factual evidence is deemed necessary to
support his/her position. In the alternative, also within thirty (30) days, a
property owner whose land is the subject of a decision by the planning
commission may appeal by filing a notice of appeal with the circuit court
accompanied by a request for pre-litigation mediation in accordance with S.C.
Code 1976, §§ 6-29-1150 and 6-29-1155.
            g.   Permit validity. In accordance with S.C. Code 1976, §§ 6-29-
1510, et seq., as amended, upon the issuance of a land development permit, the
applicant shall have a vested right for two (2) years from the date of issuance
to undertake and complete the corresponding development of property under the
terms and conditions of the approved site specific development plan. Failure to
complete work within this time shall render the permit void. However, the
applicant may request a one (1) year extension of this time period no later
than thirty (30) days and no earlier than sixty (60) days prior to the
expiration of the permit. The request for an extension must be approved unless
otherwise prohibited by an intervening amendment to this chapter, such
amendment having become effective prior to the expiration of the permit.
Likewise, and in the same manner, the applicant may apply for four (4) more one
(1) year extensions. Any change from the approved site specific development
plan that has not first been reviewed and approved by the planning department
shall render the land development permit invalid.

et seq., as amended, no subdivision of land in Richland County may be recorded
without review and approval in accordance with this section. No road, right-of-
way, easement, or other land, shall be accepted, or maintained by the county,
be extended or connected, nor shall any certificate of occupancy be issued by a
department of the county for any building, or other improvements, until the
subdivision, and/or other property division, complies with the requirements of
this section. These review procedures are designed to ensure that the purposes
of various regulations set forth in this section are carried out and that the

licensed surveyor and shall contain a delineation of all flood lines and
floodway boundary lines, as shown on the county's flood insurance rate map as
adopted in Section
26-106 (b).
   (c)   Processes. There are three (3) types of subdivision review processes:
administrative review, minor subdivision review, and major subdivision review.

decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision to the circuit
court, provided that a proper petition is filed with the Richland County Clerk
of Court within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written notice of the
decision by the applicant. An appeal shall cease all staff review regarding the
subject property. However, a reconsideration request may be heard at the same
time as an appeal is pending. Since an appeal to the circuit court must be
based on the factual record generated during the subdivision review process, it
is the applicant’s responsibility to present whatever factual evidence is
deemed necessary to support his/her position. In the alternative, also within
thirty (30) days, a property owner whose land is the subject of a decision by
the planning commission may appeal by filing a notice of appeal with the
circuit court accompanied by a request for pre-litigation mediation in
accordance with Section 6-29-1150 and Section 6-29-1155 of the South Carolina
Code of Laws.
      g.   Recordation/approval validity.
         1.   Recordation. A signed and sealed plat for an approved subdivision
must be recorded by the applicant, within thirty (30) days of approval, with
the Richland County Register of Deeds. The applicant shall provide the planning

         2.   Approval validity. Failure to record a plat within thirty (30)
days shall invalidate the plat approval.
   (2)   Minor subdivision review.
      a.   Applicability. The minor subdivision review process is required for
those divisions of land that do not qualify for administrative subdivision
review, but which consist of less than fifty (50) lots. A minor subdivision
shall not require engineered documents pertaining to design of infrastructure
or the dedication of land to the county for open space or other public purpose.
If a phased project, with fewer than fifty (50) lots in one or more phases,
involves a total of fifty (50) or more lots within five (5) years of the
recording of any prior phase, then the project shall be treated as a major
subdivision, regardless of the size of the individual phases.
      b.   Submittal. An application for minor subdivision review shall be
filed by the owner of the property or by an authorized agent. The application
for minor subdivision approval shall be filed with the planning department on a
form provided by the department. All documents/information required on the
application must be submitted - including the permit fee, as established by
county council.
      c.   Staff review.
         1.   Planning staff review. Plans for minor subdivision developments
shall be reviewed by the planning department for compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
         2.   Development review team. As needed, plans for minor subdivisions
shall be reviewed by members of the county’s development review team for
compliance with the requirements of this chapter and other applicable county
codes. No formal team review shall be required.
         The planning department shall approve or deny the application for a
minor subdivision within thirty (30) days after the submission date of a
completed application. If the department does not provide the applicant with a

any person who has a substantial interest in the decision may appeal such
decision of the county planning commission to the circuit court, provided that
a proper petition is filed with county clerk of court within thirty (30) days
after the applicant receives written notice of the decision. An appeal shall
cease all staff and review agency activity regarding the subject project.
However, a reconsideration request may be heard at the same time an appeal is
pending. Since an appeal to the circuit court must be based on the factual
record generated during the subdivision review process, it is the applicant’s
responsibility to present whatever factual evidence is deemed necessary to
support his/her position. In the alternative, also within thirty (30) days, a
property owner whose land is the subject of a decision by the planning
commission may appeal by filing a notice of appeal with the circuit court

         1.   Recordation. A signed and sealed plat for a minor subdivision
must be recorded by the applicant within one hundred eighty (180) days of
approval, with the county register of deeds. Approval of the plat shall
constitute the final subdivision approval. The applicant shall provide the
planning department with at least one (1) copy of the recorded plat. No
building permits or manufactured home setup permits shall be issued until the
department receives a copy of the recorded plat of the subject property.
         2.   Approval validity. Failure to record a plat within one hundred
eighty (180) days shall invalidate plat approval.
   (3)   Major subdivision review.
      a.   Applicability. The major subdivision review process is required for
all those subdivisions of land in Richland County that do not meet the
requirements for exemption from the subdivision review process (See definition
of “subdivision” in Section
26-22 above) and that do not qualify for administrative or minor subdivision
review (Section
26-54(b) and Section
26-54(b)(2)). Any subdivision that involves the dedication of land to the

subdivision. Any major subdivision with fewer than fifty (50) lots shall not be
required to install sidewalks along roads abutting the development.
      b.   Sketch plan review and approval.
         1.   Plan submittal. An application for major subdivision review shall

regulations of Richland County. If the sketch plan is approved by the
development review team, the planning department shall notify the applicant and
transmit the sketch plan to the planning commission for their information only.
               [2]   The project is not in compliance with the development
regulations of Richland County. The sketch plan shall be denied, and the
reasons for denial shall be provided to the applicant. The sketch plan may be
revised to address the reasons for denial and resubmitted. Revised sketch plans
shall be administratively reviewed; provided, however, major changes that
materially affect the characteristics of the sketch plan, as determined by the
planning director, may require an additional DRT review.
               The decision of the DRT will be posted on the first day of the
month outside of the planning department office, on the bulletin board located

Sec. 26-55. Permitted uses with special requirements.
   (a)   Purpose. Permitted uses with special requirements are uses permitted
by right, provided that the special requirements set forth in Article VI. of
this chapter are met. The special requirements are intended to ensure that the
uses fit the intent of the zoning districts within which they are permitted,
and that the uses are compatible with other developments permitted within the
zoning district. Unless otherwise provided, review and approval of these uses
are handled by the planning department. The department has no discretion to
modify the special requirements.
   (b)   Pre-application procedure. No pre- application conference is required
prior to applying for a land development permit for a permitted use with
special requirements unless required elsewhere in this article. Applicants are
encouraged to call or visit the planning department prior to submitting an
application to determine what information is required for the application.
   (c)   Plan submittal.
      (1)   Filing of application. An application for a permitted use with
special requirements shall be included on a land development permit application
form. Such application shall contain completed information as required on the
application form, and shall be accompanied by plans of the development drawn to
scale. Other information necessary to show that the use or structure complies
with the standards set forth in this chapter shall also be provided.
      (2)   Fees. A permit fee, as established by the Richland County Council,
shall be submitted with the application.
      (3)   Coordination with land development permit review. Review of a
permitted use subject to special requirements takes place as part of the
applicable land development permit review.
   (d)   Staff Review. The planning department shall review the application and
determine if it is complete within fifteen (15) days of its submittal. If the
application is found to be incomplete, the planning department shall notify the
applicant of any deficiencies. Provided the application is complete, the
planning department, for projects not involving some other form of review,
shall review the proposed use and determine if the special requirements for
that use have been met. If the special requirements have been met, the
application shall be approved. Failure to meet all the special requirements
shall result in a denial of a permit for the proposed use. The planning
department shall approve or deny the application for a permitted use with
special requirements in accordance with the time frame set forth for the
applicable land development permit review.
   (e)   Public notification. No public notification is required for permitted
uses with special requirements unless the approval of such a use is part of a
project that requires review as a major development by the planning commission.
   (f)   Formal review. Formal review of a permitted use with special
requirements is required only when a project is reviewed for a land development
permit as a major development.
   (g)   Variances. Unless otherwise specified, variances from the special
requirements are not permitted. Other variances shall be reviewed as set forth
for the applicable land development permit process.
   (h)   Appeals. Appeals of the decisions of the planning department regarding
applications for permitted uses with special requirements shall be heard by the
board of zoning appeals under the procedures established at Section
26-58 of this chapter.
   (i)   Permit validity. Permit validity for permitted uses with special
requirements shall be the same as those required for a land development permit
(Section
26-53 of this chapter).
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-56. Special exceptions.
   (a)   Purpose. Special exceptions are established to provide for the
location of those uses that are generally compatible with other land uses
within a zoning district. However, because of their unique characteristics or
potential impacts on the surrounding neighborhood and the county as a whole,
these uses require individual consideration of their location, design,
configuration, and/or operation at the particular location proposed. Such
individual consideration may also call for the imposition of individualized
conditions in order to ensure that the use is appropriate at a particular
location and to ensure protection of the public health, safety, and general
welfare. Any use identified in this chapter as a special exception in a zoning
district shall not be permitted without the approval of the Richland County
Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with the requirements and procedures set
forth in this section.
   (b)   Pre-application procedure.
      (1)   Conference. Every applicant for a special exception is required to
meet with the planning department in a pre-application conference prior to, or
at the time of, the submittal of a request for approval of a special exception.
The purposes of this conference are to provide additional information regarding
the review process and to assist in the preparation of the application.
      (2)   Neighborhood meeting. Although not required, it is highly
recommended that the applicant of the proposed special exception use meet with
representatives of the neighborhood in which the proposed use will be located.
This meeting will allow the applicant the opportunity to explain the proposed
use and to be informed of the concerns of the neighborhood.
   (c)   Plan submittal.
      (1)   Application. An application for a special exception shall be filed
by the owner of the property or an authorized agent on a form provided by the
planning department. Other information necessary to show that the use or
structure complies with the standards set forth in this chapter shall also be
provided.
      (2)   Fees: An application fee, as established by the Richland County
Council, shall be submitted with the application.
      (3)   Coordination with land development permit review. Completion of the
applicable land development permit review will take place following review of
the special exception by the board of zoning appeals. The ruling of the board
of zoning appeals, including any conditions on approval added by the board of
zoning appeals, shall be incorporated into the project approval by the staff
and/or planning commission.
   (d)   Staff review. The planning department shall review the application and
determine if it is complete within fifteen (15) days of its submittal. If the
application is complete, the planning department shall schedule the matter for
consideration at a public hearing by the board of zoning appeals. The planning
department shall prepare a staff evaluation and recommendation regarding the
submitted special exception application. The schedule for meetings of the board
of zoning appeals and application deadlines for such meetings shall be
maintained in the office of the planning department.
   (e)   Public notification. Notice of the public hearing shall be posted on
the property for which a special exception is sought. Notice shall also be
published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county no less than
fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing on the matter.
   (f)   Formal review.
      (1)   Action by the board of zoning appeals.  Upon receipt of the
application for a special exception from the planning department, the board of
zoning appeals shall hold a public meeting on the proposed special exception.
Any party may appear in person, or be represented by an authorized agent. After
conducting the public hearing, the board of zoning appeals may:
         a.   Approve the proposed special exception;
         b.   Continue the matter to a date certain for additional
consideration; or
         c.   Deny the proposed special exception.
   Any approval or denial of the request must be by a concurring vote of a
majority of those members of the board both present and voting. Such votes must
be permanently filed in the planning department as a public record. The written
decision of the board of zoning appeals must be delivered to the applicant.
      (2)   Standard of review. The board of zoning appeals shall not approve a
special exception unless it finds that the regulations of this chapter have
been met. The conditions set forth in Article VI. of this chapter, which set
forth specific standards for a special exception, shall be binding on the board
of zoning appeals and may not be varied. In addition to the definitive
standards set forth in this chapter, the board of zoning appeals shall consider
the following in reviewing a special exception:
         a.   Traffic impact;
         b.   Vehicle and pedestrian safety;
         c.   Potential impact of noise, lights, fumes, or obstruction of air
flow on adjoining properties;
         d.   Adverse impact of the proposed use on the aesthetic character of
the environs, to include the possible need for screening from view; and
         e.   Orientation and spacing of improvements or buildings.
      (3)   Conditions: In granting a special exception, the board of zoning
appeals may prescribe conditions and safeguards in addition to those spelled
out in this chapter. The board of zoning appeals may also prescribe a time
limit within which the special exception shall be begun or completed, or both.
All conditions placed on the project by the board of zoning appeals shall be
incorporated into such project.
     (g)   Variances. Unless otherwise specified, variances from the specific
standards for a special exception, set forth in Article VI. of this chapter,
are not permitted. Other variances shall be reviewed as set forth for the
applicable land development permit process.
   (h)   Appeals. A person who may have a substantial interest in the decision
of the board of zoning appeals regarding a special exception may appeal from a
decision of the board of zoning appeals to the circuit court, by filing with
the clerk of the court a petition in writing setting forth plainly, fully and
distinctly why the decision is contrary to law. The appeal must be filed within
thirty (30) days after the decision of the board of zoning appeals is mailed.
In the alternative, also within thirty (30) days, a property owner whose land
is the subject of a decision by the board of zoning appeals may appeal by
filing a notice of appeal with the circuit court accompanied by a request for
pre-litigation mediation in accordance with Section 6-29-1150 and Section 6-29-
1155 of the South Carolina Code of Laws.
   All appeals must be taken in accordance with all applicable laws of the
State of South Carolina.
   (i)   Permit validity. Permit validity for special exceptions shall be the
same as those required for the applicable land development permit unless
otherwise stated in the special exception order.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-57. Variances.
   (a)   Purpose. The variance process administered by the board of zoning
appeals is intended to provide limited relief from the requirements of this
chapter. The board of zoning appeals may not grant a variance, the effect of
which would be to allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in a
zoning district, to extend physically a nonconforming use of land, to change
the zoning district boundaries shown on the official zoning map, to permit a
decrease in the minimum lot size, to decrease the minimum lot width, or in any
other manner create a nonconforming lot, or to grant a variance to permit an
increase in density allowing more units on a lot than that permitted under
minimum lot area requirements. The fact that property could be utilized more
profitably, should a variance be granted, may not be considered grounds for a
variance.
   (b)   Pre-application procedure. Before filing an application for a
variance, an applicant must meet with the planning department to discuss the
proposed variance and to become more familiar with the applicable requirements
and approval procedures of the county.
   (c)   Plan submittal.
      (1)   Application. An application for a variance shall be filed by the
owner of the property or an authorized agent on a form provided by the planning
department. Such application shall contain the information required on the
application form, and shall be accompanied by plans of the development drawn to
scale. Other information necessary to show that the use or structure complies
with the standards set forth in this chapter shall also be provided.
      (2)   Fees. An application fee, as established by the Richland County
Council, shall be submitted with the application.
      (3)   Schedule. Once an application is accepted as complete by the
planning department, the application will be scheduled for consideration at a
public hearing by the board of zoning appeals. The schedule for meetings of the
board of zoning appeals shall be maintained in the planning department.
   (d)   Staff review. The planning department shall review the application and
determine if it is complete within fifteen (15) days of its submittal. If the
application is complete, the planning department shall prepare a staff
evaluation and recommendation regarding the submitted variance request.
   (e)   Public notification. Notice of the public hearing on a variance shall
be posted on the property for which a variance is sought. Notice shall also be
published in a newspaper of general circulation within the county no less than
fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing.
   (f)   Formal review.
      (1)   Action by the board of zoning appeals.  Upon receipt of the
application for a variance request from the planning department, the board of
zoning appeals shall hold a public meeting on the proposed variance request.
Any party may appear in person or be represented by an authorized agent. In
considering the application, the board of zoning appeals shall review the
application materials, the staff comments and recommendations, the general
purpose and standards set forth in this chapter, and all testimony and evidence
received at the public hearing. After conducting the public hearing, the board
of zoning appeals may:
         a.   Approve the request;
         b.   Continue the matter for additional consideration; or
         c.   Deny the request.
   Any approval or denial of the request must be by a concurring vote of a
majority of those members of the board of zoning appeals both present and
voting. The decision of the board of zoning appeals shall be accompanied by
written findings that the variance meets or does not meet each of the standards
set forth in subparagraph (2) below. The decision and the written findings
shall be permanently filed in the planning department as a public record. The
written decision of the board of zoning appeals must be delivered to the
applicant.
      (2)   Standard of review. The board of zoning appeals shall not grant a
variance unless and until it makes the following findings:
         a.   That there are extraordinary and exceptional conditions
pertaining to the particular piece of property; and
         b.   That these conditions do not generally apply to other property in
the vicinity; and
         c.   That because of these conditions, the application of this chapter
to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably
restrict the utilization of the property; and
         d.   That the authorization of a variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and the granting of the
variance will not harm the character of the district.
      (3)   Conditions. In granting a variance, the board of zoning appeals may
attach to it such conditions regarding the location, character, or other
features of the proposed building, structure or use as the board of zoning
appeals may consider advisable to protect established property values in the
surrounding area, or to promote the public health, safety, or general welfare.
The board of zoning appeals may also prescribe a time limit within which the
action for which the variance was sought shall be begun or completed, or both.
   (g)   Appeals. A person who may have a substantial interest in any decision
by the board of zoning appeals regarding a variance may appeal from such
decision to the circuit court, by filing with the clerk of the court a petition
in writing setting forth plainly, fully, and distinctly why the decision is
contrary to law. The appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the
decision of the board of zoning appeals is mailed. In the alternative, a
property owner whose land is the subject of a decision of the board of zoning
appeals may file a notice of appeal, also within thirty (30) days, with the
circuit court accompanied by a request for pre-litigation mediation in
accordance with Section 6-29-1150 and Section 6-29-1155 of the South Carolina
Code of Laws.
   All appeals must be taken in accordance with all applicable laws of the
State of South Carolina.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-58. Appeals of administrative decisions.
   (a)   Purpose. The board of zoning appeals shall hear and decide appeals
when it is alleged that there is any error in any order, requirement, decision,
or determination made by an administrative official in the enforcement of this
chapter. Provided, however, the planning commission shall hear and decide
appeals from staff decisions on land development permit applications and
subdivision applications.
   (b)   Appeal submittal.
      (1)   Application. An appeal of an administrative decision may be taken
by any person who may have a substantial interest in the decision; provided,
however, appeals pursuant to Section
26-54(c)(3)d.1. or Section
26-54(c)(3)e.6. above may only be taken by the applicant, a contiguous
landowner, or an adjacent landowner. All appeals must be filed with the
planning department on a form provided by the department, and must contain all
information and plans as required on the application form. Such appeal must
include the specific section of this chapter (or the specific design detail)
from which the appeal is taken and the basis or reason for the appeal. All
appeals must be filed no later than thirty (30) days after the order,
requirement, decision, or determination that is alleged to be in error is made.
      (2)   Fees. An application fee, as established by the Richland County
Council, shall be submitted with the application.
      (3)   Stay of proceedings pending appeal. An appeal stays all proceedings
in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the officer from whom the
appeal is taken, certifies to the board of zoning appeals or planning
commission, as applicable, after notice of appeal is filed with them, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in their opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In that case, proceedings may not be
stayed other than by a restraining order that may be granted by the board or
commission or by a court of competent jurisdiction on application, on notice to
the officer from whom the appeal is taken, and on due cause shown.
   (c)   Staff review. Once an appeal is received by the planning department,
the matter will be scheduled for consideration at a public hearing by the board
of zoning appeals or planning commission, as applicable. The schedule for
meetings of these boards shall be maintained in the planning department. Staff
shall prepare a report detailing the regulations and interpretation behind the
matter being appealed.
     (d)   Public notification. Notice of the public hearing on the appeal
shall be published at least fifteen (15) days prior to the public hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation in the county, as well as due notice given to
the parties in interest.
   (e)   Formal review. Upon receiving the application, the board of zoning
appeals or planning commission (as applicable) shall conduct a public hearing
on the appeal. Any party may appear in person or be represented by an agent.
After conducting the public hearing, the board of zoning appeals or planning
commission (as applicable) shall adopt an order reversing or affirming, wholly
or in part, or modifying the order requirements, decision, or determination in
question. These boards shall have all the powers of the officer from whom the
appeal is taken, and may issue or direct the issuance of a permit. These boards
in the execution of the duties specified herein may subpoena witnesses and in
case of contempt may certify this fact to the circuit court having
jurisdiction. The decision of these boards must be in writing and permanently
filed in the planning department as a public record. All findings of fact and
conclusions of law must be separately stated in final decisions or orders of
these boards, which must be delivered to parties of interest by certified mail.
   (f)   Appeals: A person who may have a substantial interest in the decision
of the board of zoning appeals or planning commission (as applicable) regarding
an appeal of an administrative decision, may appeal from such decision of the
board or commission to the circuit court, by filing with the clerk of the court
a petition in writing setting forth plainly, fully, and distinctly why the
decision is contrary to law. The appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days
after the decision of the board or commission is mailed. In the alternative,
also within thirty (30) days, a property owner whose land is the subject of a
decision by the board or commission may appeal by filing a notice of appeal
with the circuit court accompanied by a request for pre-litigation mediation in
accordance with Section 6-29-1150 and Section 6-29-1155 of the South Carolina
Code of Laws. All appeals must be taken in accordance with all applicable laws

Sec. 26-59. Planned development review/ approval.
   (a)   Purpose. In order to achieve the objectives of the comprehensive plan
of Richland County, and to allow flexibility in development that will result in
the improved design, character and quality of new mixed use developments, and
to preserve natural and scenic features of open spaces, the county may approve
planned development districts (PDDs) as amendments to the official zoning map.
The PDD review process is a two-part procedure that involves the rezoning of
the property to a PDD district (see Section
26-100 of this chapter) and the approval of a master plan for the site. It is
the intent of this procedure that the public interest will be served not only
by consideration of those specific criteria set forth in this chapter, but also
by consideration of the total anticipated effect of the planned development
upon the community at large. The provisions of the planned development district
represent a relaxation of specific site design requirements as applied to other
districts provided for in this chapter. In return for design flexibility, the
applicant for amendment to a PDD district classification shall agree to furnish
information about the proposed development and later abide by certain
conditions and safeguards as may be imposed by the county council in
establishing such districts.
   (b)   Pre-application procedure.
      (1)   Conference. Prior to the submittal of a request for approval of a
planned development district, a PDD applicant is required to meet with the
planning department in a pre-application conference. The purpose of this
conference is to provide clarification and assistance in the preparation and
submission of the plans for approval.
      (2)   Neighborhood meeting. Although not required, it is highly
recommended that the applicant (or his/her agent) of the proposed PDD meet with
representatives of the neighborhood in which the proposed district will be
located. This meeting will allow the applicant the opportunity to explain the
proposed PDD and to be informed of the concerns of the neighborhood.
   (c)   Plan submittal.
      (1)   Filing of application. Each application for a PDD shall consist of
an application for a zoning map amendment (see Section
26-52 of this chapter) and an application for a land development permit (see
Section
26-53 of this chapter) for the proposed development plan. Plans shall be
submitted by the property owner or an authorized agent.
      (2)   Fees. An application fee, as established by the Richland County
Council, shall be submitted with the application.
   (d)   Staff review. The planning department shall review the application and
determine if it is complete within fifteen (15) days of its submittal. If the
application is found to be incomplete, the planning department shall notify the
applicant of any deficiencies. Provided the application is complete, the
planning department shall schedule the matter for consideration by the planning
commission within sixty (60) days of receipt; provided, however, the planning
department may request one thirty (30) day extension, with the consent of the
applicant. The planning department shall prepare a staff recommendation on the
PDD application and the zoning map amendment. The schedule for meetings of the
planning commission and applications shall be maintained in the planning
department.
   (e)   Public notification. Public notification shall be made in conformance
with the requirements set forth in Section
26-52 of this chapter for zoning map amendments.
   (f)   Formal Review:
      (1)   Action by the planning commission.
         a.   Review. All applications for a planned development shall be
submitted to the Richland County Planning Commission for study and
recommendation.
         b.   Recommendation. Within thirty (30) days from the date that any
PDD application is first considered by the planning commission at a scheduled
meeting, unless a longer period of time has been mutually agreed upon between
the county council and the planning commission in a particular case, the
planning commission shall submit its report and recommendation to the Richland
County Council. The recommendation of the planning commission shall be advisory
only and shall not be binding on county council. If the planning commission
does not submit its report within the prescribed time, the county council may
proceed to act on the application without further awaiting the recommendation
of the planning commission.
         c.   Procedures. The planning commission shall follow those procedures
as set forth for a zoning map amendment in Section
26-52 of this chapter and as set forth for land development permit review in
Section
26-53 of this chapter.
      (2)   Action by the county council.
         a.   Public hearing. Following the review and recommendation by the
planning commission, the PDD application shall be presented for review and
consideration by the Richland County Council. A public hearing shall be held in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section
26-52(f) of this chapter.
         b.   Approval. After conducting the public hearing, the county council
may:
            1.   Approve the application to and amend the zoning map; or
            2.   Continue the matter for additional consideration; or
            3.   Deny the application.
      The regulations for PDD Districts (Section
26-102 of this chapter) are minimum requirements and the county council may
impose conditions and safeguards in excess of, or in addition to, the specific
requirements set forth therein. Ability to meet the minimum requirements does
not per se create an indication that an applicant should be entitled to a map
amendment and PDD approval.
   (g)   Appeals. Any person who may have a substantial interest in a PDD
decision made by the county council may appeal from a decision of the council
to the circuit court of Richland County by filing with the clerk of court a
petition in writing setting forth why the decision is contrary to law. The
appeal must be filed within thirty (30) days after the decision of the council
to deny the application or after the council has given third reading approval
to amend the property to a PDD District.
   (h)   Issuance of land development and building permits. The planning
department shall not issue any land development permit, and the building
official shall not issue any building permit for work to commence within any
PDD District, until the property owner, or authorized agent, has:
      (1)   Recorded with the Register of Deeds of Richland County, plats
showing all proposed features of the PDD as approved by the county council, and
submitted a true copy of such plats to the planning department.
      (2)   Completed any necessary agreements with the county so that the
county may become a party to deed restrictions and other such restrictive
covenants related to the planned development (as deemed necessary by the
county) and recorded such agreements with the register of deeds for the county
and submitted a true copy of such agreements to the planning department.
      (3)   Recorded with the Register of Deeds of Richland County all deed
restrictions and/or restrictive covenants as required by the Richland County
Council upon approval of the amendment establishing the PDD, and submitted true
copies of such deed restrictions and/or restrictive covenants to the planning
department.
      (4)   Recorded with the Register of Deeds of Richland County the
descriptive statement, as approved by the Richland County Council, setting
forth and committing the developer to certain design standards, development
phasing schedules, and other pertinent matters, and submitted a true copy of
such descriptive statement to the planning department.
      (5)   Completed the posting of a bond or the giving of other surety that
adequate progress will be made in developing the project.
   (i)   District map. The site development plan as approved by the Richland
County Council in establishing the PDD District shall be the zoning district
map for the PDD and this shall be the basis for issuance of land development
permits and building permits for construction of buildings within the planned
development.
   (j)   Changes to plans. Any change to the boundaries of an established PDD
District shall be accomplished only by following procedures set forth above.
Changes in the approved characteristics or agreements relating to a PDD, but
not involving a change to the boundary thereof, shall be classified as either
major changes or minor changes and shall be approved or disapproved as follows:
      (1)   Major changes. Major changes that materially affect the
characteristics of the planned development, such as changes in location of land
uses, increases in density, or changes in traffic flow, shall follow the same
procedural requirements as for the amendment originally establishing the PDD,
including review by the development review team, planning commission review,
public hearing, and county council determination as set forth above.
      (2)   Minor changes. The revision of any minor characteristic of a
planned development (such as relocation of driveways or revision of floor plans
of specific structures) may be authorized by the planning director. However,
the ability to make minor changes comes only when such authority is granted to
the planning director within the approved and recorded descriptive statement
concerning development of the PDD. If the planning director fails to approve
the request for a minor change, the applicant or other party at interest may
then seek a change by the regular amendment process as outlined for major
changes.
      (3)   Determination of requirements. It shall be the duty of the planning
director to determine whether any specific request shall be considered a major
change or a minor change. The applicant for any change shall have the right to
have any request for change processed as a major change.
      (4)   Recording. The planning department shall not issue a land
development permit or certificate of zoning compliance, and the building
official shall not issue a building permit in connection with any action
related to such changes, until such changes have been duly recorded as for the
original documents. The requirements for recordation are set forth in
subsection (h) above.
   (k)   Permit/approval validity. The descriptive statement as approved by
Richland County Council and duly recorded shall set forth the development for
the project, including phasing of development of nonresidential uses in
relationship to residential use. The county council may require the posting of
a bond with a corporate surety to guarantee that the schedule set forth in the
descriptive statement will be materially adhered to in order to guarantee
construction of roads, utilities, and other facilities and amenities. A bond
may also be used to allow for rectification of improper development
characteristics, such as failure to begin, or failure to complete, or failure
to make adequate progress as agreed to in the descriptive statement. If
performance differs from that set forth in the statement approved by county
council, the council may:
      (1)   Enforce and collect upon such bonds or sureties as described in
this subsection;
      (2)   Change the district classification of the planned development and
thus terminate the right of the applicant to continue development;
      (3)   Initiate action to charge the developers with specific violation of
this chapter subject to the penalties set forth in Article XI. of this chapter;
or
      (4)   Take any appropriate combination of these actions.

 Sec. 26-60. Certificates of zoning compliance.
   (a)   Purpose. It shall be unlawful to use or occupy or permit the use or
occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part thereof, hereafter
created, erected, changed, converted, or wholly or partially altered or
enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate of zoning compliance shall
have been issued by the planning department, or unless a temporary
nonconforming use permit has been issued by the planning department. The
certificate shall state that the building or the proposed use of the building
or land conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   Application. Application for a certificate of zoning compliance may be
made by the owner of the property or by an authorized agent
   (c)   Staff review. Upon receipt of the request for a certificate of zoning
compliance, the planning department shall inspect the project building(s) and
site for compliance with the approved site plan or permit. The certificate
shall be issued only upon finding that the building(s) and site comply with all
applicable requirements, including any additional conditions placed on the
project under the provisions of this chapter.
   (d)   Public notification. No public notification is required for requests
for certificates of zoning compliance.
   (e)   Formal review. No formal review is required.

(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-61. Review in FP Floodplain Overlay District.
   (a)   Purpose. A floodplain development permit is required in conformance
with the provisions of this chapter (particularly Section 26-106) prior to the
commencement of any development activities in the FP Overlay District. The
purpose of this permit is to ensure that compliance with all regulations
concerning floodplain development is achieved.
   (b)   Pre-application procedure. No pre-application conference is required
prior to applying for a floodplain development permit. Applicants are
encouraged to call or visit the county's flood coordinator prior to requesting
a floodplain development permit to determine what information is required for
the application.
   (c)   Plan submittal. Application for a floodplain development permit shall
be made to the flood coordinator on forms furnished by the county or through
the county's electronic permitting system. The scaled plans shall include, but
are not limited to: the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the
project area; existing and proposed structures; and the location of fill and
compensation areas. Specifically the following information is required:
      (1)   A plot plan that shows the 100-year floodplain contour or a
statement that the entire lot is within the floodplain must be provided by the
applicant when the lot is within or appears to be within the floodplain as
mapped by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The plot plan must be
prepared by or under the direct supervision of a South Carolina licensed
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by such
professional. The plot plan must show the floodway, if any, as identified by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   When base flood elevation data is available, plan submittal for a
development permit within the flood hazard area shall show:
         a.   The elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor
of all new and substantially improved structures; and
         b.   If the structure will be flood-proofed in accordance with the
Non-Residential Construction requirements, must include the elevation to which
the structure will be flood-proofed.
      (3)   When base flood elevation data is not available, the provisions in
the standards for streams without estimated base flood elevations and floodways
must be met. (Section 26-106(e)).
      The information submitted for the permit shall be certified by a South
Carolina licensed registered land surveyor, engineer, or architect authorized
by law to certify the required information and plans.
   (d)   Staff review. The county flood coordinator shall review all
applications for a flood development permit and approve or deny such
applications. Approval or denial of a flood development permit shall be based
on all applicable provisions of this chapter and the following relevant
factors:
      (1)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (2)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (3)   The danger that material may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (4)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (5)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (6)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions, including maintenance and repair of roads and bridges and public
utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems; and
      (7)   The relationship of the proposed use to any comprehensive planning
document for that area.
   (e)   Public notification. No public notification is required for floodplain
development permit issuance.
   (f)   Formal review. No formal review is required for floodplain development
permit review.
   (g)   Variances. The variance procedure for floodplain management shall be
reviewed as set forth under Section
26-57 of the County Land Development Code.
      1)   The board of zoning appeals shall not grant a variance unless and
until all the criteria found in Subsection
26-61(g)(2) and the following criteria are met:
         (a)   That there are extraordinary and exceptional conditions
pertaining to the particular piece of property; and
         (b)   That these conditions do not generally apply to other property
in the vicinity; and
         (c)   That because of these conditions, the application of this
chapter to the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or
unreasonably restrict the utilization of the property; and
         (d)   That the authorization of a variance will be of no detriment to
adjacent property or to the public good, the granting of the variance will not
harm the character of the district.
      2)   The following special uses shall be allowed with an approved
variance:
         a)   Historic Structures - A floodplain development permit shall be
issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon the
determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is
the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure. A historic structure is defined as buildings listed in or that are
eligible for listing the National Register of Historical Places, or designated
as historic under an appropriate state or local law.
         b)   Agricultural Structures - A floodplain development permit shall
be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure provided it is used
solely for agricultural purposes.
            In order to minimize flood damages during the base flood and the
threat to public health and safety, the following requirements must be met:
            i.   Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes
as listed below:
               a.   Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used
exclusively for the storage of farm machinery and equipment;
               b.   Steel grain bins and steel frame corncribs;
               c.    General-purpose barns for the temporary feeding of
livestock that are open on at least one side;
            ii.   The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the
case of an existing building that is substantially damaged, with flood-
resistant materials for the exterior and interior building components and
elements below the base flood elevation.
            iii.   The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's
components must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including
hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood
velocities exceed 5 feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert
considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls.
            iv.   The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement
as outlined Section
26-106(d)(2) (b) of this ordinance.
            v.   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be
located a minimum of 2 feet above the base flood elevation (BFE) or be
contained within a watertight, floodproofed enclosure that is capable of
resisting damage during flood conditions.
            vi.   The agricultural structure may not be constructed in the
floodway.
            vii.   Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be
protected. Such protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas
within the building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating
contents, permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base
flood elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents
without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site
out of the floodplain.
         Findings - Findings listed above shall be submitted to the appeal
board, in writing, and included in the application for a variance.
         Conditions - Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the
purposes of this ordinance, the board of zoning appeals may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this ordinance. The following conditions shall apply to all
variances:
            (a)   Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
            (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
            (c)   Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
            (d)   The local floodplain manager shall maintain the records of
all appeal actions and report any special exceptions to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency (FEMA) upon request.
            (e)   Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or
other development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this
ordinance.
            (f)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE)
and the elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk.
Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
   (h)   Appeals. The Richland County Administrator shall hear and decide
appeals from determinations made by the flood coordinator. Any owner who has
received a decision from the coordinator may appeal this decision to the
Richland County Administrator by giving notice of appeal in writing to the
flood coordinator within twenty (20) days following issuance of the decision.
In the absence of an appeal, the order of the flood coordinator shall be final.
The Richland County Administrator shall hear an appeal within a reasonable time
and may affrrm, modify and affirm, or reverse the decision of the coordinator.
Written record of the appeal decision shall be provided by the Richland County
Administrator to the flood coordinator.
   (i)   Permit validity. The effective date of a floodplain development permit
shall be the date as stamped on the permit. Permits shall be valid only when
signed by the flood coordinator. Any floodplain development permit issued shall
become invalid if the authorized work is not commence within twelve (12) months
after the issuance of the permit, or if the authorized work is suspended or
abandoned for a period of twelve (12) months after the time of commencing the
work, unless an extension has been granted in writing by the flood coordinator.
   (j)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of Section
26-106, all provisions shall be considered as minimum requirements, liberally
construed in favor of Richland County, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal
any other powers granted under State law.
26-106 is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where the provisions of Section
26-106 and another provision conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.

   (e)   Public notification. No public notification is required for sign
permit requests.
   (f)   Formal review. No formal review of sign permit applications is
required.
   (g)   Variances. Requests for variances from sign regulations shall be heard
by the board of zoning appeals under the procedures established at Section
26-57 of this chapter.
   (h)   Appeals. Appeals of the decisions of the planning department on any
sign application shall be heard by the board of zoning appeals under the
procedures established at Section
26-58 of this chapter.
   (i)   Permit validity. If actual work for the permitted sign on the site is
not commenced within ninety (90) days from the date of the issuance of a sign
permit, or if substantial work for a permitted sign is suspended for a period
of sixty (60) consecutive days, the permit shall automatically become null and
void. Provided, however, that for signs being erected in conjunction with new
construction, the sign permit shall not become null and void until sixty (60)
days after the certificate of zoning compliance has been issued for the
development. In all cases, the planning department may grant up to a six (6)
month extension of time within which work on a permitted sign must be started
or resumed. All requests for such extensions and approval thereof shall be in
writing.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-63. Temporary use permits.
   (a)   Purpose. To ensure that proposed temporary uses comply with the
requirements of this chapter, no use that is classified as a temporary use in
the zoning district in which it is located shall be placed or established on

26-185 of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-64. Stormwater pollution prevention plans.
   (a)   Purpose. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, a land disturbance
permit shall not be issued for any purpose except in accordance with a SWPPP
that has been approved by the Public Works Department. In addition, prior to
any grading, construction, or land disturbance of any nature, a land
disturbance permit shall be obtained from Richland County. The SWPPP shall
include a plan to control erosion and sedimentation and provide for stormwater
management (See Section 26-202 of this chapter). The purpose of this
requirement is to provide proper management of the quality and quantity of
stormwater runoff in Richland County. The SWPPP must be approved prior to the
issuance of a land development permit, floodplain development permit or
building permit. No land disturbance permit shall be issued until DHEC grants
coverage under the NPDES General Permit for Large and Small Construction
Activities, if applicable. No building permit shall be issued until the
required drainage improvements, as set forth in an approved design plan, are
installed or an acceptable bond is posted in lieu of completion of the
improvements. The approved SWPPP must be maintained at the active construction
site until a Notice of Termination (NOT) is issued. In addition, a copy of the
Notice of Intent (NOI), NPDES General Permit for Large and Small Construction
Activities, and letter from DHEC granting coverage under the NPDES General
Permit for Large and Small Construction activities must be maintained at the
site at all times until a Notice of Termination is issued.
   (b)   Exemptions. The provisions of this section shall not apply to:
      (1)   Land disturbing activities on agricultural land for production of
plants and animals, except that the construction of an agricultural structure
or structures which, singularly or collectively total one or more acres, such
as broiler houses, machine sheds, repair shops and other major buildings and
which require the issuance of a building permit shall require the submittal and
approval of a SWPPP prior to the start of the land disturbing activity.
      (2)   Land disturbing activities undertaken on forest land for the
production and harvesting of timber and timber products.
   (c)   Pre-application procedure. No pre-application conference is required
prior to the submittal of a SWPPP for a Land Disturbance Permit. Applicants are
encouraged to call or visit the county engineer prior to submitting a SWPPP to
determine what information is required for the application for the approval.
   (d)   Plan submittal.
      (1)   Application. Application for approval of a SWPPP shall be made on
forms furnished by the county and shall include all items required on that
application and shall be accompanied by a fee as established by the Richland
County Council. Application may be made by the owner of the property or by an
authorized agent. If any construction or land disturbance activities are to

fourteen (14) or more days, the site must be temporarily stabilized.
         c.   The plans shall contain a description of the predominant soil
types on the site, as described in the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) comprehensive soils classification system.
         d.   When work in a live waterway is performed such as utility or road
crossing, the appropriate BMPs shall be utilized to minimize encroachment,
protect the water quality buffer, control sediment transport and stabilize the
work area to the greatest extent possible during construction.
         e.   Vehicle tracking of sediments from land disturbing activities
onto paved public roads shall be minimized by utilizing the appropriate BMPs.
         f.   Locations of all waters of the U.S. and State (including
wetlands) shall be shown on the plan.
         g.   Locations of all preconstruction stormwater discharge points and
post construction stormwater discharge points shall be shown on the plan.
      (3)   Specific requirements for the permanent stormwater management
portion of the SWPPP approval process include, but are not limited to, the
following items. Richland County may modify the following items for a specific
project or type of project.
         a.   Stormwater management shall be addressed on a watershed basis to
provide a cost-effective water quantity and water quality solution to the
specific watershed problems. This chapter provides general design requirements
that must be adhered to in the absence of designated watershed specific
criteria.
         b.   All hydrologic computations shall be accomplished using a volume
based hydrograph method acceptable to Richland County. The storm duration for
computational purposes for this method shall be the 24-hour rainfall event,
applicable National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) distribution with a
0.1 hour burst duration time increment. The rational and/or modified rational
methods are acceptable for sizing individual culverts or storm drains that are
not part of a pipe network or system and do not have a contributing drainage
area greater than twenty (20) acres. The storm duration for computational
purposes for this method shall be equal to the time of concentration of the
contributing drainage area or a minimum of 0.1 hours, whichever is less.
         c.   Stormwater management requirements for a specific project shall
be based on the entire area to be developed, or if phased, the initial
submittal shall control that area proposed in the initial phase and establish a
procedure for total site control, as shown the approved set of development
plans.
         d.   Water quantity control is an integral component of overall
stormwater management. The following design criteria for flow control are
established for water quantity control purposes:
            1.   Post-development peak discharge rates shall not exceed pre-
development discharge rates for the 2, 10 and 25-year frequency 24-hour
duration storm event. The county may utilize a less frequent storm event (e.g.
50 or 100-year, 24-hour) to address existing or future stormwater quantity or
quality problems.
            2.   Discharge velocities shall be reduced to provide a non-erosive
velocity flow from a structure, channel, or other control measure or the
velocity of the 10-year, 24-hour storm runoff in the receiving waterway prior
to the land disturbing activity, whichever is greater.
            3.   Watersheds, including designated watersheds, which have well
documented water quantity problems, may have more stringent or modified design
criteria as determined by Richland County.
         e.   Water quality control is also an integral component of stormwater
management. The following design criteria are established for water quality
protection:
            1.   When ponds are used for water quality protection, the ponds
shall be designed as both quantity and quality control structures. Sediment
storage volume shall be calculated considering the clean out and maintenance
schedules specified by the designer during the land disturbing activity.
Sediment storage volumes may be predicted by the Universal Soil Loss Equation
or methods acceptable to the county.
            2.   Stormwater runoff that drains to a single outlet from land
disturbing activities which disturb ten (10) acres or more shall be controlled
during the land disturbing activity by a sediment basin where sufficient space
and other factors allow these controls to be used until the final inspection.
The sediment basin shall be designed and constructed to accommodate the
anticipated activity and meet a removal efficiency of eighty percent (80%)
suspended solids or 0.5 ML/L peak settleable solids concentration, whichever is
less. The outfall device or system design shall take into account the total
drainage area flowing through the disturbed area to be served by the basin.
            3.   Other practices may be acceptable to Richland County if they
achieve an equivalent removal efficiency of eighty percent (80%) for suspended
solids or 0.5 ML/L peak settable solids concentration, which ever is less. The
efficiency shall be calculated for disturbed conditions for the 10-year 24-hour
design event.
            4.   Permanent water quality ponds having permanent pool shall be
designed to store and release the first 1/2-inch of runoff from the entire site
or the first one inch of runoff from the impervious area, whichever is greater,
over a twenty-four (24)-hour period.
            5.   Permanent water quality ponds, not having permanent pool,
shall be designed to release the first inch of runoff from the site over a
twenty-four (24)-hour period.
            6.   Permanent infiltration practices, when used, shall be designed
to accept, at a minimum, the first inch of runoff from all impervious areas.
            7.   Water quality buffers and setbacks required to protect
receiving water bodies shall be maintained as required by this chapter.
            8.   Watersheds, including designated watersheds, which have been
documented by Richland County or DHEC as impaired or have established TMDLs,
will have more stringent or modified design criteria as determined by Richland
County.
            9.   For sites with storm water discharges to receiving water that
is listed as impaired in South Carolina's 303(d) List of Impaired Waters the
following requirements apply:
               i.   If a TMDL that is applicable to stormwater construction
discharges has been established and is in effect, the requirements of the NPDES
General Permit for Large and Small Construction Activities must be met.
               ii.   If a TMDL has not been established or is not in effect,
the requirements outlined in Section 3.4 of the NPDES Permit for Large and
Small Construction Activities must be met.
            10.   Untreated storm water runoff from developed areas shall not
be directly discharged to wetlands, as wetland boundaries are defined at the
time of site plan approval.
            11.   Any storm sewers and/or constructed/altered channels that
discharge into a water quality buffer area shall be constructed in such a way
as to dissipate the energy of flow and create even sheet flow into the buffer
area.
         f.   Where ponds are the proposed method of control, the person
responsible for the land disturbing activity shall submit to Richland County,
when required, an analysis of the impacts of stormwater flows downstream in the
watershed for the 10 and 100-year frequency storm event. The analysis shall
include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations necessary to determine the impact
of hydrograph timing modifications of the proposed land disturbing activity,
with and without the pond. The results of the analysis will determine the need
to modify the pond design or to eliminate the pond requirement. Lacking a
clearly defined downstream point of constriction, the downstream impacts shall
be established, with the concurrence of the county.
         g.   Where existing wetlands are intended as a component of an overall
stormwater management system, the approved SWPPP shall not be implemented until
all necessary federal and state permits have been obtained. Copies of the
federal and state permits shall be furnished to Richland County.
         h.   Designs shall be in accordance with standards developed or
approved by the county. The Public Works Department shall maintain the “Storm
Water Design Manual” and the “BMP Manual”, and these guidelines must be
followed.
         i.   Ease of maintenance must be considered as a site design
component. Access to the stormwater management structure must be provided. A
maintenance plan shall be included in the SWPPP.
         j.   A clear statement of defined maintenance responsibility shall be
established during the plan review and approval process. This statement ensures
that structural BMPs will be maintained post-construction. If they are not
being properly maintained, the county has the authority to require maintenance
to be done at the expense of the person responsible for maintenance.
         k.   Infiltration practices have certain limitations on their use on
certain sites. These limitations include the following items:
            1.   Areas draining to these practices must be stabilized and
vegetative filters established prior to runoff entering the system.
Infiltration practices shall not be used if a suspended solids filter system
does not accompany the practice. If vegetation is the intended filter, there
shall be, at least a twenty (20)-foot length of vegetative filter prior to
stormwater runoff entering the infiltration practice.
            2.   The bottom of the infiltration practice shall be at least 0.5
feet above the seasonal high water table, whether perched or regional,
determined by direct piezometer measurements which can be demonstrated to be
representative of the maximum height of the water table on an annual basis
during years of normal precipitation, or by the depth in the soil at which
mottling first occurs.
            3.   The infiltration practice shall be designed to completely
drain of water within seventy-two (72) hours.
            4.   Soils must have adequate permeability to allow water to
infiltrate. Infiltration practices are limited to soils having an infiltration
rate of at least 0.30 inches per hour. Initial consideration will be based on a
review of the appropriate soil survey, and the survey may serve as a basis for
rejection. On-site soil borings and textural classifications must be
accomplished to verify the actual site and seasonal high water table conditions
when infiltration is to be utilized.
            5.   Infiltration practices greater than three (3) feet deep shall
be located at least ten (10) feet from basement walls.
            6.   Infiltration practices designed to handle runoff from
impervious parking areas shall be a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet
from any public or private water supply well.
            7.   The design of an infiltration practice shall provide an
overflow system with measures to provide a non-erosive velocity of flow along
its length and at the outfall.
            8.   The slope of the bottom of the infiltration practice shall not
exceed five percent (5%). Also, the practice shall not be installed in fill
material.
            9.   An infiltration practice shall not be installed on or atop a
slope whose natural angle of incline exceeds twenty percent (20%).
            10.   Clean outs will be provided at a minimum, every one hundred
(100) feet along the infiltration practice to allow for access and maintenance.
         l.   A regional approach to stormwater management is an acceptable
alternative to site-specific requirements and is encouraged.
      (4)   All stormwater management and sediment control practices shall be
designed, constructed, and maintained with consideration for the proper control
of mosquitoes and other vectors. Practices may include, but are not limited to:
         a.   The bottom of retention and detention ponds should be graded and
have a slope not less than 1.0 percent.
         b.   There should be no depressions in a normally dry detention
facility where water might pocket when the water level is receding.
         c.   Normally dry detention systems and swales should be designed to
drain within three (3) days.
         d.   An aquatic weed control program should be utilized in permanently
wet structures to prevent an overgrowth of vegetation in the pond. Manual
harvesting is preferred.
         e.   Fish may be stocked in permanently wet retention and detention
ponds.
      (5)   A SWPPP shall be filed for a residential development and the
buildings constructed within, regardless of the phasing of construction.
         a.   In applying the stormwater management and sediment control
criteria, individual lots in a residential subdivision development shall not be
considered to be separate land disturbing activities and shall not require
individual permits. Instead, the residential subdivision development, as a
whole, shall be considered to be a single land disturbing activity. Hydrologic
parameters that reflect the ultimate subdivision development shall be used in
all engineering calculations.
         b.   If individual lots or sections in a residential subdivision are
being developed by different property owners, all land-disturbing activities
related to the residential subdivision shall be covered by the approved SWPPP
for the residential subdivision. Individual lot owners or developers must sign
a certification of compliance that all activities on that lot will be carried
out in accordance with the approved SWPPP for the residential subdivision.
Failure to provide this certification will result in owners or developers of
individual lots developing a SWPPP meeting the requirements of this chapter.
         c.   Residential subdivisions which were approved prior to the
effective date of these regulations are exempt from these requirements.
Development of new phases of existing subdivisions which were not previously
approved shall comply with the provisions of these regulations.
      (6)   Risk analysis may be used to justify a design storm event other
than prescribed or to show that rate and volume control is detrimental to the
hydrologic response of the basin and therefore, should not be required for a
particular site.
         a.   A complete watershed hydrologic/hydraulic analysis must be done
using a complete model/procedure acceptable to Richland County. The level of
detail of data required is as follows:
            1.   Watershed designation on the 7.5 minute topo map exploded to a
minimum of 1" = 400'.
               i.   Include design and performance data to evaluate the effects
of any structures which affect discharge. Examples may be ponds or lakes, road
crossings acting as attenuation structures, and others which must be taken into
account.
               ii.   Land use data shall be taken from the most recent aerial
photograph and field checked and updated.
               iii.   The water surface profile shall be plotted for the
conditions of pre and post-development for the 10-, and 100-year 24-hour storm.
               iv.   Elevations of any structure potentially damaged by
resultant flow shall also be shown.
         b.   Based on the results of this type of evaluation, the Public Works
Department shall review and evaluate the proposed regulation wavier or change.
      (7)   The Level II SWPPP shall be prepared in accordance with South
Carolina NPDES General Permit for Storm Water Discharges from Large and Small
Construction Activities (SCR 100000). The SWPPP must be prepared, amended when
necessary, certified, and stamped by a qualified individual who is licensed as
follows:
         a.   Registered professional engineers as described in Title 40,
Chapter 22;
         b.   Registered landscape architects as described in Title 40, Chapter
28, Section 10, item (b);
         c.   Tier B land surveyors as described in Title 40, Chapter 22; or
         d.   Federal government employees as described by Title 40, Chapter
22, Section 280(A)(3).
   (h)   Staff review. The county engineer shall review all SWPPPs and approve
or deny such plans. Approval or denial of a SWPPP shall be based on all
applicable provisions of this chapter. SWPPPs shall be reviewed within thirty
(30) days from the date of submittal of the plan. If the county engineer
determines that the size and scope of the proposed plan requires additional
time for adequate review, the review period shall be extended as determined
appropriate by the county engineer, but in no event shall the review period
exceed forty-five (45) days. If at the end of the forty-five (45) day period a
decision has not been reached, the plan shall be deemed approved; however, the
applicant may waive this requirement and consent in writing to the extension of
that period. In the absence of an appeal, the order of the county engineer
shall be final. Approval of plans by the county engineer does not relieve the
applicant’s technical representative from his/her responsibility for the
correctness of the plans or the accuracy of his/her calculations, nor does it
relieve the owner or the applicant from his/her obligation to comply with any
applicable laws. Upon review and approval by Richland County, the approval
letter to issue a land disturbance permit, the NOI and the $125 fee will be
sent to DHEC. DHEC then has seven (7) business days to review the completed
application and issue a letter either granting or denying coverage under the
NPDES General Permit for Storm Water Discharges from Large and Small
Construction Activities (SCR 100000), or requesting additional information. If
DHEC does not send a letter within the designated time period, then coverage
under the above permit may be deemed automatically granted.
   (i)   Public notification. No public notification is required for review of
a SWPPP.
   (j)   Formal review. No formal review is required for SWPPP review.
   (k)   Permit validity. The effective date of a SWPPP shall be the date the
Public Works Department approved the plan. Plans shall be valid only when
signed by the county engineer. Any SWPPP approval issued shall become invalid
if the authorized work is suspended or abandoned for a period of six (6) months
after the time of commencing the work, or if the work is not completed within
two (2) years, unless an extension has been granted in writing by the county
engineer. The applicant is responsible for requesting an extension and setting
forth reasons for the requested extension. No more than four (4) 1-year
extensions shall be granted. An annual plan review fee and inspection fee shall
be paid each time a request is made for an extension. The applicant shall be
responsible with carrying out the proposed work in accordance with the approved
SWPPP. The applicant shall be responsible for notifying the Public Works
Department a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours after the start of construction.
   (l)   Inspections. The SWPPP shall specify the inspection frequency for the
land disturbance activity which must be done in accordance with the NPDES
General Permit for Large and Small Construction Activities. The county engineer
or his/her designee shall periodically inspect the work done under an approved
SWPPP. Any violations will be enforceable as established in this chapter. For
each inspection, an inspection report must be completed. A record of each
inspection and any actions taken must be retained as part of the SWPPP for at
least three (3) years. Inspections must be conducted by an inspector meeting at
least one of the requirements in Section 26-64(g)(7), and at a minimum either:
      (1)   At least once every seven (7) calendar days, or
      (2)   At least once every fourteen (14) calendar days and within twenty-
four (24) hours of the end of a storm event of 0.5 inches or greater.
   (m)   Preconstruction Conference.
      (1)   For non-linear Projects that disturb ten (10) acres or more, the
permittee must conduct a pre-construction conference with each co-permittee,
and contractor who is not a co-permittee, in person at the site prior to the
co-permittee or contractor performing construction related work intended to
disturb soils at the site that may affect the implementation of the SWPPP
unless it is justified in the SWPPP and approved by the county to conduct the
conference off-site. This pre-construction conference can be with all
contractors or the pre-conference may be conducted separately with one or more
contractors present so that all contractors who perform land disturbing
activity are aware of the requirements of the SWPPP before they start
construction.
      (2)   For linear construction of roads or utilities (such as roads built
by SCDOT, utility construction including electrical power lines, gas lines,
sewer lines, and water lines that are not part of a subdivision) neither of
which is part of a subdivision or other type of development, the pre-
construction conference may be conducted off-site unless specifically required
by the county to be conducted on site. The purpose of this conference is to
explain the whole SWPPP to the co-permittees and contractors, and to
specifically go over areas of the SWPPP that are related to the work to be
performed by the co-permittees and the contractors.
   (n)   Monthly reporting requirements. For land disturbance activities
impacting ten (10) acres or more, there is a monthly reporting requirement in
the NPDES General Permit for Large and Small Construction Activities which
requires monthly reports to be submitted to DHEC. Richland County also requires
these monthly reports to be submitted to the Public Works Department for
review. These reports may be submitted electronically.
   (o)   NOT.  The owner/operator of a site may apply for a NOT when seventy
percent (70%) of the site is stabilized. The county has the authority to grant
or deny the request for a NOT at its discretion. Any recurring fees will
continue to be applicable until the NOT is submitted to Richland County and
approved by DHEC. Richland County will forward the request for NOT to DHEC.
   (p)   Supplemental regulations. All applicable provisions of the Standards
for Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction (Sections 72-301, 302, 305,
307, 308, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316) administered by the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control pursuant to the South Carolina
Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Act of 1991 are incorporated by

Sec. 26-102. PDD Planned Development District.
   (a)   Purpose. The PDD District is intended to allow flexibility in
development that will result in improved design, character, and quality of new
mixed-use developments, and that will preserve natural and scenic features of
open spaces. Planned development districts must involve innovation in site
planning for residential, commercial, institutional, and/or industrial
developments within the district. Such developments must be in accordance with
the comprehensive plan for the county, and in doing so, may provide for
variations from the regulations of the county’s zoning districts concerning
use, setbacks, lot size, density, bulk, and other such requirements.
   (b)   Applicability/establishment: The PDD District shall only be
established after a master plan for the planned development proposed for the
site to be rezoned is submitted and approved. The procedures for establishing a
PDD district are set out in Section
26-59 of this chapter. Project planning and design for a PDD shall be performed
by a licensed architect, landscape architect, or registered land surveyor, with
site engineering performed by a registered engineer.
   (c)   Permitted uses, permitted uses with special requirements, and special
exceptions. The uses permitted in a PDD District shall be the permitted uses
set forth in the approved site plan. However, manufactured home parks are not
permitted as part of a PDD District. No special exception actions are required
to establish any specific use in a PDD District. Provided, however, the
planning commission and the county council shall ascertain that the effect and
benefits that are usually derived from safeguards and conditions normally
imposed upon special exception uses will substantially be met by the site plan
and development controls of the proposed planned development.
   (d)    Development standards.
      (1)   Minimum lot area/maximum density:  Minimum area: the minimum area
for the entire Planned Development District shall be two (2) acres. The minimum
lot size within the PDD shall be as established by the general development plan
for the PDD District and any regulations of DHEC. Maximum density: no maximum
density requirement for a Planned Development District. The density shall be as
established by the general development plan for the PDD District and any
regulations of DHEC.
      (2)   Minimum lot width, setback and height standards: Minimum lot width,
setback requirements, and maximum height are not stipulated in this chapter for
PDD Districts. However, the planning commission and county council, in
approving a PDD, shall ascertain that the characteristics of building siting as
shown on the development plan is appropriate as related to structures within
the planned development and otherwise fulfill the intent of this chapter and
the county’s comprehensive plan.
      (3)   Structure size standards: Structure size standards are not
stipulated in this chapter for PDD Districts. However, the planning commission
and the county council, in approving a PDD, shall ascertain whether structure
size proposals as shown on the planned development site plan are appropriate
and whether such structures otherwise fulfill the intent of this chapter and
the county’s comprehensive plan.
      (4)   Landscaping/bufferyard standards:  Landscaping and bufferyards
shall be provided in accordance with Section
26-176 of this chapter.
      (5)   Parking/loading standards: Parking and loading facilities shall be
provided as required by Section

26-174 of this chapter. In areas devoted to residential uses, no parking lots
shall be permitted within any required setback.
      (6)   Sidewalk and pedestrian amenities:  Sidewalks and other pedestrian
amenities shall be provided as required by Section
26-179 of this chapter.
      (7)   Signs: Signs shall be regulated by the requirements of Section
26-180 of this chapter.
      (8)   Recreation/open space standards.
         a.   Purpose. The common open space and park standards contained
herein are established to provide for the reservation of open space in planned
development districts. Preservation of open space and parks in developing areas
serves a variety of purposes, including meeting the recreational needs of
residents, reducing stormwater runoff, and enhancing air quality.
         b.   Minimum amount of park land or open space to be reserved.
Developers must reserve at least ten percent (10%) or the total project area as
park land or open space, which shall be usable, i.e., common areas made
accessible for pedestrian and/or aquatic use.
         c.   Acceptable land for park land or open space reservation:
            1.   Water features. Bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes,
streams, wetlands, and flood plains, may be used to fulfill the open space
requirement.
            2.   Land burdened with easements. Land that is burdened with
easements may be used, provided that the easements do not interfere with the
use of the land for open space and recreation purposes and do not permit future
development.
         d.   Unacceptable land for park or open space reservation. The
following types of land are unacceptable for park or open space reservation:
            1.   Occupied land. Land occupied by roads, drives, parking areas,
or structures, other than those related to recreational structures or parks.
            2.   Land with hazardous materials. Land containing or contaminated
by hazardous materials.
            3.   Narrow areas. Land with a width of less than twenty-five (25)
feet, unless such land is a bicycle or walking trail at least ten (10) feet
wide, or unless such land is a “pocket park” that is no less than ten (10) feet
by ten (10) feet in size, or unless specifically approved by the planning
department.
         e.   Maintenance. Arrangements for the perpetual maintenance of open
space that meet these requirements must be approved by the planning department.
Any conveyance to a homeowner’s association shall be subject to appropriately
recorded and filed restrictive covenants and easements. The covenants and
easements shall prohibit future development of the open space for other than
open space and recreation purposes and shall provide for continued maintenance
of the open space and recreation facilities. Failure to maintain the area
designated for open space shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
      (9)   Design and operation standards: A PDD District shall be located
only on a road capable of accommodating the projected traffic needs of the
proposed development. A traffic impact assessment must accompany the
application for a PDD District.

development that has a distinct village edge, along with amenities that promote
walkability and ties to transit throughout the community.
   (b)   Applicability/establishment: The Town and Country District shall only
be established after a master plan for the neighborhood development proposed
for the site to be rezoned is submitted and approved. The procedures for
establishing a TC district are the same as those set out for a Planned
Development District at Section
26-59 of this chapter. Project planning and design for a TC District shall be
performed by a licensed architect, landscape architect, or registered land
surveyor, with site engineering performed by a registered engineer.
   (c)   Permitted uses, permitted uses with special requirements, and special
exceptions.
      (1)   General. Carefully blended land uses form the essence of Town and
Country Development. Different land uses may abut at any point, subject to the
provisions of this section. All residential, institutional, office, and
commercial uses are allowed in this district, as are all uses permitted in the
LI district.
      (2)   Permitted special exceptions. No special exception actions are
required to establish any specific use in a Town and Country District. Uses and
structures permitted, permitted with special requirements, or allowed by
special exception in the districts indicated in subsection (c)(1) above for any
specific site are permitted outright. Provided, however, the planning
commission and county council shall ascertain that the effect and benefits that
are usually derived from safeguards and conditions normally imposed upon
special exceptions will substantially be met by the site plan and development
controls of the proposed town and country development.
   (d)   Development Standards.
      (1)   Minimum lot area/maximum density:  Minimum lot area: there is no
minimum lot area for the entire Town and Country District. However, the
recommended minimum size shall be forty (40) acres. The minimum lot size within
the Town and Country District shall be as established by the general
development plan for the TC District and any regulations of the DHEC. Maximum
density: no maximum density requirement for a Town and Country District. The
density shall be as established by the general development plan for the TC
District and any regulations of DHEC.
      (2)   Subareas: The TC District shall be divided into the following
subareas:
         a.   Town center. The town center shall consist of a blend of civic,
retail, office and multi-family uses. The size of the town center shall be a
minimum of two percent (2%) of the entire site area.
      b.    Neighborhoods. A neighborhood or series of neighborhoods consisting
of blended multi-family and single-family uses, small-scale retail and workshop
uses, and public outdoor gathering places shall be a part of any town and
country district. It is the intent of this section that all areas within a town
and country neighborhood are within walking distance from edge to center.
         c.   Greenways. Greenway areas that provide a greenway system for the
community, open space for community residents, and natural areas for stormwater
management shall be a part of any town and country development. Greenways may
border or traverse the district.
      (3)   Minimum lot width, structure size, setback and height standards:
There are no minimum lot width, structure size, setback, or maximum height
requirements for TC Districts. However, the planning commission and county
council, in approving a TC District, shall ascertain that the characteristics
of building siting, as shown on the development plan, shall be appropriate as
related to structures within the town and country village, and otherwise
fulfill the intent of this chapter and the comprehensive plan for the county.

the district.
      (5)   Landscaping/bufferyard standards:  Landscaping and bufferyards
shall be provided in accordance with Section
26-176 of this chapter. However, in order to provide a continuous pedestrian
transition for residential neighborhoods and commercial areas, retail land use
categories shall not be separated from residential land use categories by berms
or buffers. Adequate design measures shall be taken to minimize potential use
conflicts. Limited fences and walls may be used when other design methods are
ineffective.
      (6)   Parking/loading standards: Except as otherwise provided in this
section, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required by
Section
26-173 and Section
26-174 of this chapter. However, due to the pedestrian nature of the TC
District, parking requirements for retail, business/service, and institutional
uses may be reduced by twenty- five percent (25%) of any use related parking
standards established in Section
26-173. Additionally, on-road parking shall count toward any minimum parking
requirements.
         a.   On-street parking. On-street parking is required when a
particular land use will generate regular guest or customer parking use.
Occasional on-street parking (such as within a single-family neighborhood) can
be accommodated without additional pavement width or delineation. On-street
parking shall be provided on roads abutting squares, small parks, or other
urban spaces.
         b.   Off-street parking.
            1.   Location. For interior commercial parcels, no less than
seventy-five percent (75%) of the parking spaces shall be located to the rear
of the building being served. Commercial parking fronting on non-pedestrian
oriented major arterials may locate primary parking lots along this frontage.
Where primary parking abuts roads within the interior of the TC District,
screening, a minimum of four (4) feet in height, shall be erected on the
frontage line, where primary parking lots are located. This screening
requirement may be met by the use of berms, walls or densely planted
vegetation, providing for visual obstruction of the parking area from the
abutting road(s). Primary parking lots (over 24 spaces) and parking garages
shall not: [1] abut road intersections, [2] be located adjacent to squares or
parks, or [3] occupy lots that terminate a road vista.
            2.   Connections. Adjacent parking lots shall have vehicular
connections from an alley.
            3.   Small retail and service/business uses. Uses involving a gross
floor area of less than twenty-five hundred (2,500) square feet shall not
require on-site parking, provided that the required parking is available within
a six hundred (600) foot radius of the activity.

recreational needs of residents, reducing stormwater runoff, and enhancing air
quality.
         b.   Minimum amount of park land or open space to be reserved.
Developers must reserve at least ten percent (10%) or the total project area as
park land or open space, which shall be usable, i.e., common areas made
accessible for pedestrian and/or aquatic use.
         c.   Acceptable land for park land or open space reservation:
            1.   Water features. Bodies of water, such as ponds, lakes,
streams, wetlands, and flood plains, may be used to fulfill the open space
requirement.
            2.   Land burdened with easements. Land that is burdened with
easements may be used, provided that the easements do not interfere with the
use of the land for open space and recreation purposes and do not permit future
development.
         d.   Unacceptable land for park or open space reservation. The
following types of land are unacceptable for park or open space reservation:

            2.   Land with hazardous materials. Land containing or contaminated
by hazardous materials.
            3.   Narrow areas. Land with a width of less than twenty-five (25)
feet, unless such land is a bicycle or walking trail at least ten (10) feet
wide, or unless such land is a “pocket park” that is no less than ten (10) feet
by ten (10) feet in size, or unless specifically approved by the planning
department.
         e.   Maintenance. Arrangements for the perpetual maintenance of open
space that meet these requirements must be approved by the planning department.
Any conveyance to a homeowner’s association shall be subject to appropriately
recorded and filed restrictive covenants and easements. The covenants and
easements shall prohibit future development of the open space for other than
open space and recreation purposes and shall provide for continued maintenance
of the open space and recreation facilities. Failure to maintain the area
designated for open space shall constitute a violation of this chapter.
      (10)   Design and operation standards:
         a.   Lots and buildings.
            1.   Frontage. All lots shall include frontage abutting a road,
square, or common open space.
            2.   Entryway. The main entrance of all principal structures shall
open to a road, square, or common open space of at least twenty (20) square
feet in area. Front or side yard porches shall be encouraged on all single-

small- scale retail, service, and office uses. However, larger anchor stores or
uses may be included as part of an overall commercial package if approved at
the time of TC plan review.
         b.   Roads/traffic impacts.
            1.   Roadway design. The road standards for the TC District may be
different from those set forth in Section
26-181 of this chapter, but must be approved by the county engineer during the
TC plan review process. Reduced roadway widths are encouraged for traffic
calming and also due to a comprehensive approach to travel in a TC District
that includes roads and alleys.
            2.   Alleys. There shall be a continuous network of alleys to the
rear of building lots within the TC District, except when topography or
physical feature makes such alleyways impractical. Dead end alleys are
prohibited.
            3.   Street furnishings. Street furnishings shall be included in a
TC District. In commercial areas such furnishings shall include, but not be
limited to: pedestrian scale decorative streetlights, decorative road signs,
benches, trash receptacles, water fountains, etc. In residential areas,
pedestrian scale decorative streetlights and decorative road signs shall be
included.
         c.   Utilities. To the extent possible, underground utilities (and
associated pedestals, cabinets, junction boxes, and transformers), including
electric, cable, telephone, and natural gas service, shall be located within
the alley right-of-way and not along the streetscape frontage. Domestic water
service and sanitary sewer must be located in such a way to cause the least
impact on the streetscape planting strip and required street trees.
Unless otherwise approved by the planning commission and the county council,
all utilities shall be placed underground.
         d.   Transit. Land for an on-site transit stop shall be reserved
within the district when the proposed TC District is within the service area of
a public transit system.

Sec. 26-104. AP Airport Height Restrictive Overlay District.
   (a)   Purpose. It is the intent of the AP Overlay District to restrain
influences that are adverse to the property and safe conduct of aircraft
operations in the vicinity of Jim Hamilton-L.B. Owens Airport and McEntire Air
National Guard Base. Furthermore, it is the intent of this overlay district to
prevent creation of conditions hazardous to aircraft operation, to prevent
conflict with land development that may result in loss of life and property,
and to encourage development that is compatible with airport use
characteristics.
   (b)   Applicability/Establishment. The AP Overlay District shall function as
an overlay district, providing additional requirements to the regulations of
the underlying general use zoning classification(s).
   (c)   Permitted uses, permitted uses with special requirements, and special
exceptions. The AP Overlay District may contain several different underlying
general use zoning classifications. All uses permitted in the respective
underlying zoning districts shall be permitted in the AP Overlay District.
Provided, however, when the provisions of this section impose higher standards
than are required for that zoning classification, the provisions of this
section shall apply. However, no use may be made of land or water within the AP
Overlay District in such a manner as to cause or create electrical interference
with navigational signals or radio communication between any airport and the
aircraft, make it difficult for pilots to distinguish between airport lights
and others, result in glare in the eyes of pilots using any airport, create
bird strike hazards, or otherwise in any way endanger or interfere with the
landing, take off, or maneuvering of aircraft using or intending to use any
airport.
   (d)   Development standards.
      (1)   General. Except as specifically provided for below, no material
changes shall be made in the use of land, no structure shall be erected or
otherwise established, and no tree shall be planted in any AP Overlay District
unless a permit is applied for and granted. The following exceptions shall
apply:
         a.   In the area lying within the limits of the AP horizontal zone
(see subparagraph (2)e. below) and the AP conical zone (see subparagraph (2)f.
below), no permit shall be required for any tree or structure less than
seventy-five (75) feet in vertical height above the ground, except when, due to
terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree or structure would
extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
         b.   In areas lying within the limits of the AP approach zones (see
subparagraph (2)b. below), but at a horizontal distance of not less than four
thousand two hundred (4,200) feet from each end of the runway, no permit shall
be required for any tree or structure less than seventy- five (75) feet in
vertical height above the ground, except when, due to terrain, land contour, or
topographic features, such tree or structure would extend above the height
limits prescribed for such zones.
         c.   In the areas lying within the limits of the AP transition zones
(see subparagraph (2)d. below), no permit shall be required for any tree or
structure less than seventy-five (75) feet in vertical height above the ground,
except when, due to terrain, land contour, or topographic features, such tree
or structure would extend above the height limits prescribed for such zones.
      (2)   Height standards: Except as otherwise provided in this section, no
structure shall be erected, altered, or maintained, and no trees shall be
allowed to grow in any zone created by this section to a height in excess of
the applicable height limitations established in this section for each zone in
question, as follows:
         a.   Primary zones: APP.
            1.   McEntire Air National Guard Base (APPM): The primary zone is
established at field elevation, two hundred fifty-one (251) feet, mean sea
level, longitudinally centered on each runway with the same length as the
runway. The width of the primary zone is two thousand (2,000) feet.
            2.   Jim Hamilton-L.B. Owens Airport (APPO): None.
         b.   Approach zones: APA.
            1.   McEntire Air National Guard Base (APAM): The approach zone

centerline elevation of the runway end and extends for fifty thousand (50,000)
feet. The slope of the approach clearance zone is fifty (50) to one (1) along
the runway centerline extended until it reaches an elevation of five hundred
(500) feet above the established airport elevation (equal to 251 feet mean sea
level). It then continues horizontally at this elevation to a point fifty
thousand (50,000) feet from the point of beginning. The width of this surface
at the runway end is the same as the primary surface, flaring uniformly, with
width at the fifty thousand (50,000) feet point being sixteen thousand
(16,000).
            2.   Jim Hamilton-L.B. Owens Airport (APAO): The approach zone
slopes twenty (20) feet outward for each one (1) foot upward beginning at the
end of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and extending to a
horizontal distance of five thousand (5,000) feet along the extended runway
centerline.
         c.   Clear zones: APCZ.
            1.   McEntire Air National Guard Base (APCZM): The clear zone is
established at field elevation (251 feet mean sea level) and extends outward

is equal to the width of the primary surface.
            2.   Jim Hamilton-L.B. Owens Airport (APCZO): None.
         d.   Transitional zones: APT.
            1.   McEntire Air National Guard Base (APTM): The transitional
zones connect the primary surface, the first two hundred (200) feet of the
clear zone surface, and the approach clearance surface to the inner horizontal
surfaces, conical surface, and outer horizontal surface. The slopes of the
transitional surface are seven (7) to one (1) outward and upward at right
angles to the runway centerline beginning at the sides of and at the same
elevation as the primary surface (251 feet mean sea level).
            2.   Jim Hamilton-L.B. Owens Airport (APTO): The transitional zone
slopes seven (7) feet outward for each one (1) foot upward beginning at the
side of and at the same elevation as the primary surface and the approach
surface, and extend to a height of one hundred fifty (150) feet above the
airport elevation (194 feet mean sea level). In addition to the foregoing,
there are established height limits sloping seven (7) feet outward for each one
(1) foot upward beginning at the sides and at the same elevation as the
approach surface, and extending to where they intersect the horizontal surface.
         e.   Horizontal zones: APH.
            1.    McEntire Air National Guard Base (APHM): The horizontal zones
for McEntire National Guard Base are separated into the inner horizontal zone
and the outer horizontal zone. Their dimensions are:
         Inner: The inner horizontal zone is an oval shape at a height of one
hundred fifty (150) feet above the established airfield (equal to 401 feet mean
sea level).
         Outer: The outer horizontal zone is a plane located five hundred (500)
feet above the established airfield elevation (equal to 751 feet mean sea
level), extending outward from the outer periphery of the conical surface for a
horizontal distance of thirty thousand (30,000) feet.
            2.   Jim Hamilton-L.B. Owens Airport: The horizontal zone is
established at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the airport elevation (equal
to 344 feet mean sea level).
         f.   Conical zones: APC.
            1.   McEntire Air National Guard Base (APCM): The conical zone is a
surface extending from the periphery of the inner horizontal surface outward
and upward at a slope of twenty (20) to one (1) for a horizontal distance of
seven thousand (7,000) feet to a height of five hundred (500) feet above the
established airfield elevation (equal to 751 feet mean sea level).
            2.   Jim Hamilton-L.B. Owens Airport: The conical zone slopes
twenty (20) feet outward for each one (1) foot upward beginning at the
periphery of the horizontal zone and at one hundred fifty (150) feet above the
airport elevation (equal to 344 feet mean sea level) and extending to an
elevation of three hundred fifty (350) feet above the airport elevation (equal
to 544 feet mean sea level) at a horizontal distance of four thousand (4,000)
feet.
      (3)   Other dimensional and use regulations.  Permitted accessory
structures, prohibited uses and structures, minimum lot area, minimum lot
width, minimum yard requirements, maximum lot coverage, minimum off-street
parking and loading requirements, regulation of signs, and provisions of
sidewalks and open space shall be provided as regulated in the general zoning
district to which the AP Overlay District is appended, unless the AP Overlay
District has a greater requirement upon such dimensions and characteristics of
use, in which case the stricter shall prevail.
      (4)   Obstruction marking and lighting. Any permit or variance granted
may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purpose of this
section and is reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require
the owner of the structure or tree in question to install, operate, and
maintain, at the owner’s expense, such markings and lighting as may be
necessary. If deemed proper by the board of zoning of appeals and acceptable to
the county, this condition may be modified to require the owner to permit the
county, at the county’s expense, to install, operate, and maintain the
necessary markings and lights.
   (e)   Variances.
      (1)   General. Any person desiring to erect or increase the height of any
structure, or permit the growth of any tree, or use the property not in
accordance with the regulations provided in this section, may apply to the
board of zoning appeals for a variance from such regulations.
      (2)   FAA review. The application for a variance shall be accompanied by
a determination of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as to the effect
of the proposal on the operation of air navigation facilities and the safe,
efficient use of navigable airspace. Such variances shall be allowed when it is
duly found that a literal application or enforcement of the regulations will
result in unnecessary hardship, and relief, if granted, will not be contrary to
the public interest, will not create a hazard to air navigation, will do
substantial justice, and will be in accordance with the spirit of this chapter.
      (3)   Airport management review. No application for a variance of these
regulations may be considered by the board of zoning appeals unless
notification of the request and a copy of the application have been furnished
to the airport manager for advice as to the aeronautical effects of the
variance. If the airport manager does not respond to the notification within
fifteen (15) days after receipt, the board of zoning appeals may act on its own
to grant or deny the application.
   (f)   Nonconforming uses.
      (1)   General. The regulations prescribed by this section shall not be
construed to require the removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of
any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective
date of this chapter, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of a
nonconforming use. However, the owner of any existing nonconforming structure
or tree is hereby required to permit the installation, operation, and
maintenance thereon of such markers or lighting as shall be deemed necessary by
the county to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the
airport the presence of such airport obstruction. Such markers shall be
installed, operated, and maintained at the expense of the county.
      (2)   Abandoned or destroyed.
         a.   Structure. Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a
nonconforming structure has been destroyed or torn down beyond seventy- five
percent (75%) of its most recent appraised value, no permit shall be granted
that would allow such structure to exceed the applicable height limit or
otherwise deviate from the zoning regulations.
         b.   Tree. Whenever the zoning administrator determines that a
nonconforming tree has been destroyed, torn down, decayed or deteriorated,
below the applicable height limit, no permit shall be granted that would allow
another tree to be planted which would exceed the applicable height limit or
otherwise deviate from the regulations contained in this section.

029-09HR, § II, 5-19-09; Ord. No. 054-09HR, § XXI, 11-3-09)
Sec. 26-105. C Conservation Overlay District.
   (a)   Purpose. The C Overlay District is intended to provide for safe,
suitable development along designated water resources throughout Richland
County. It is intended to allow development that will assist in the
preservation of views from the water and of the water resources, is consistent
with the shoreline areas that surround these features, and will provide
adequate measures of safety to property and life during periodic flooding.
   (b)   Applicability/establishment. The C Overlay District shall function as
an overlay district providing additional requirements to the regulations of the
underlying general use zoning classification(s), and shall only be applied to
individual water resource areas after study and rezoning by the Richland County
Council.
   (c)   Permitted uses, permitted uses with special requirements, and special
exceptions. The C Overlay District may contain several different underlying
general use zoning classifications. All uses permitted in the underlying zoning
district shall be permitted in the C Overlay District. Provided, however, when
the provisions of this section impose higher standards than are required for
that zoning classification, the provisions of this section shall apply.
Furthermore, additional overlay districts may be affixed to the general zoning
district (e.g. the Floodplain Overlay District). Provisions of any or all
overlay districts must be satisfied. However, in the case of conflict between
overlay district regulations, the stricter regulations shall apply.
   (d)   Development standards.
      (1)   Dimensional regulations. Uses within the C Overlay District shall
comply with the regulations of the underlying district, except uses on lots
abutting a water resource. For uses on lots abutting the water, a water
resource yard shall be provided as a setback within which no structures, except
approved uncovered docks, shall be erected. A setback from the top of the bank
of the water resource shall be required for a distance of twenty percent (20%)
of the lot depth (measured at the time of site plan approval), with a maximum
setback of fifty (50) feet and a minimum setback of twenty (20) feet. Existing
continuous tree stands shall be preserved to stabilize the water resource
banks. Walkways, trails, access areas, and similar activities may occur within
the water resource yard.
      (2)   Landscaping/bufferyard standards.  Landscaping and bufferyards
shall be provided in accordance with Section
26-176 of this chapter. Species suitable for a riparian environment shall be
utilized for required landscaping and buffering in a C Overlay District.
      (3)   Parking/loading standards. Parking and loading facilities shall be
as required in Section
26-173 and Section
26-174 of this chapter. Shared parking arrangements and common parking areas
are encouraged in the C Overlay District; however, in no instance are parking
or loading areas permitted in the water resource yard.
      (4)   Sidewalk and pedestrian amenities.  Sidewalks and other pedestrian
amenities shall be provided as required by Section
26-179 of this chapter. Public pedestrian trail/greenway easement segments
designed and approved as part of the site approval process may be provided in
lieu of sidewalks. The County shall not use its power of eminent domain to
condemn private land within a C Overlay District for the purpose of creating a
public pedestrian trail/greenway easement segment.
      (5)   Signs. Signs shall be regulated by the requirements of Section
26-180 of this chapter.
      (6)   Recreational/open space standards: Open space shall be provided for
new developments and expansions of existing developments in accordance with the
provisions established in Section
26-186 of this chapter.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04; Ord. No. 043-07HR, § XXII, 5-1-07; Ord. No.
054-09HR, § XXII, 11-3-09; Ord. No. 003-12HR, § I, 1-17-12)
Sec. 26-106. FP Floodplain Overlay District.
   (a)   General.
   (1)   Purpose. Certain areas within Richland County are subject to periodic
inundation by floodwater, which results or may be reasonably foreseen to result
in loss of life or property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce
and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety,
and general welfare of the citizens of Richland County. These hazards are
caused or extended in part by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses that
increase flood damage upon other lands, or uses that are vulnerable to floods
because they are inadequately elevated or not otherwise protected from flood
damages. In order for owners of property located within the county that is
subject to periodic inundation to obtain flood damage insurance through the
National Flood Insurance Program, the United States government, by statute and
through regulations promulgated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) requires that the county enact floodplain regulations designed to reduce
the amount of potential flood losses. It is, therefore, the intent of this
section to lessen such hazards and losses and ensure insurance coverage by
those affected property owners by restricting or prohibiting uses that are
dangerous to health, safety, or property in times of flood or that cause
excessive increases in flood heights or velocities. This shall be accomplished
by requiring that uses vulnerable to floods be protected against flood hazards
at the time of initial construction, and by controlling filling, grading,
mineral extraction, placing of obstructions within the flood channels, and
other activities, uses, or characteristics of use which may increase flood
damage.
   (2)   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this Section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering standards. Larger floods can and will
occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. This Section does not imply that land outside the areas of special
flood hazard, or uses permitted within such areas, will be free from flooding
or flood damages. This Section shall not create liability on the part of
Richland County or by any officer or employee thereof for any flood damage that
results from reliance on the provisions contained herein or on any
administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
   (b)   Applicability/establishment. The FP Overlay District shall function as
an overlay district providing additional requirements to the regulations of the
underlying general use zoning classification(s). It shall be applied to those
areas designated on the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Flood Insurance
Study, dated December 21, 2017, with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps
(FIRM), dated December 21, 2017, as areas of special flood hazard. In addition
to other required development approvals, development applicants subject to the
FP Overlay District must also receive a floodplain development permit from the
county's flood coordinator. Review of developments subject to these
requirements shall be conducted as part of the review for a grading or land
development permit, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   Permitted uses, permitted uses with special requirements, and special
exceptions.
      (1)   General: Any use permitted outright, with special requirements, or
permitted as an accessory use in the general use district(s) to which the FP
Overlay District is affixed to, is permitted; provided that such use complies
with all applicable regulations set forth below and in the other sections of
this chapter. (See however, restrictions for development in the designated
floodway as set forth in subsection (d)(2)h. below). All applications for land
development permits for uses permitted in the FP Overlay District shall be
reviewed by the flood coordinator in accordance with the requirements of
subsection (d) below. Before the planning department may issue a land
development permit, a floodplain development permit must be issued. The
findings and recommendations of the flood coordinator shall be binding upon the
planning department unless otherwise appealed.
      (2)   Permitted special exceptions. Any use listed as a special exception
in the general use district(s) to which the FP Overlay District is affixed to
may be permitted by the Richland County Board of Zoning Appeals as set forth in
Section 26-56 of this chapter; provided that such uses comply with all
applicable regulations set forth below and in the other sections of this
chapter. (See, however, restrictions for development in the designated floodway
as set forth in subsection (d)(2)h. below). All applications for special
exceptions in the FP Overlay District shall be reviewed by the flood
coordinator prior to review by the board of zoning appeals in accordance with
the requirements of subsection (d) below. Before the board of zoning appeals
may approve a special exception, a floodplain development permit must be
issued. The findings and recommendations of the flood coordinator shall be
binding upon the board of zoning appeals.
   (d)   Standards in the floodplain.
      (1)   General standards.
      a.   Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that
encroachments onto the floodplain are minimized. New development, if permitted
in the area of special flood hazard, shall minimize disruption to shorelines,
stream channels, stream banks, and the regulatory floodway. As used in this
paragraph, the term "minimize" shall mean the lowest degree of interruption
(i.e. the uniformity or continuity) to the natural course of action or
activity. All permit applications will be reviewed to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding.
      b.   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall
be designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of
the structures.
      c.   Materials/methods to be used. All new construction and substantial
improvements shall be constructed with flood resistant materials and utility
equipment resistant to flood damage. All new construction and substantial
improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages.
      d.   Electric, ventilation, plumbing, heating, and air conditioning
equipment. Electric, ventilation, plumbing, heating, and air conditioning
equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities, shall be designed
and elevated two (2) feet above the base flood elevation so as to prevent water
from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding as specifically provided for below:
         1.   When not substantial improvement. The replacement of existing
electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating, and air conditioning equipment
(including ductwork) and other service facilities, that do not constitute a
substantial improvement, are encouraged to be elevated at least two (2) feet
above the base flood elevation, but they may be located at the original
location and elevation.
         2.   New construction and substantial improvement. All electrical,
ventilation, plumbing, heating, and air conditioning equipment (including
ductwork), and other service facilities, for new construction and substantial
improvement must be elevated at least two (2) feet above the base flood
elevation.
         3.   Outdoor faucets. The requirements listed above do not preclude
the installation of outdoor faucets for shower heads, sinks, hoses, etc. as
long as cut off devices and back flow devices are installed to prevent
contamination to the service components and thereby minimize any flood damages
to the building.
      e.   Water and sanitary sewage systems. All new and replacement water
supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the sanitary
sewage systems into flood waters.
      f.   On-site waste disposal systems. On-site waste disposal systems shall
be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination from
them during flooding.
      g.   Foundation systems. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in the
design of any foundation system when velocity waters or the potential for
debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five (5)
feet per second), foundation systems other than solid foundation walls should
be considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized.
      h.   Non-conforming buildings or uses (see also Article X of this chapter
on nonconforming uses generally). Non-conforming buildings or uses may not be
enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction is
accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this section. Provided,
however, nothing in this section shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially
within the floodway, if the bulk of the building or structure below base flood
elevation in the floodway is not increased, and provided that such repair,
reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of this
section. Reconstructions or replacements of existing buildings or structures
sh.all be placed with their longitudinal axis parallel to the predicted
direction of the flow of flood waters or be placed so that their longitudinal
axis are on lines parallel to those of adjoining structures so as to offer the
minimum resistance to the flow of floodwaters.
      i.   American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the
specific standards for floodplain construction as outlined in subsection (d)(2)
below, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The cost of improvements
required to meet the ADA provisions shall be included in the costs of the
improvements for calculating substantial improvement.
      j.   Watercourse alterations and maintenance. In addition to the
notifications required for watercourse alterations per Section
26-36(a)(2)c., a maintenance requirement will be included in Floodplain
Development Permits whenever a watercourse is altered or relocated within a
Special Flood Hazard Area. Such maintenance activities shall ensure that the
flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse is not diminished, and shall consist
of periodic inspections, and routine channel clearing and dredging, or other
related functions. In addition, the permittee shall keep a written record
describing all maintenance activities performed, the frequency of performance,
and the name of the person(s) responsible for such maintenance and provide
copies to the Flood Coordinator. The Flood Coordinator shall keep permitting
records on file for FEMA inspection.
   (2)   Specific standards.
      a.   Residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall
have the lowest floor elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood
elevation. No basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls
be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with subsection f.
below.
      b.   Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial industrial, or nonresidential structure shall
have the lowest floor (including basement), or mechanical and utility
equipment, elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the level of the base
flood elevation or be flood-proofed to a level no lower than two (2) feet above
the level of the base flood elevation, provided that all areas of the building
(including mechanical and utility equipment) below the required elevation are
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy. Should solid foundation
perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in
accordance with subsection f. below. A South Carolina licensed registered land
surveyor, engineer, or architect authorized by law to certify such information
shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Flood-
proofed structures shall have an approved maintenance plan with an annual
exercise as required by FEMA. The maintenance plan must be approved by the
flood coordinator and notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to
same.
      c.   Foundation protection. A land surveyor, engineer, or architect
authorized by law to certify such information shall develop or review the
structural design, specifications, and plans for the foundation of all new
buildings and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in
accordance with accepted practices to withstand flotation, collapse, lateral
movement, erosion, scour, undermining, and the effects of water and wind acting
simultaneously on all building components during the occurrence of the base
flood.
      d.   Manufactured homes.
         1.   Substantially damaged homes.  Manufactured homes that are on
sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, which
have incurred “substantial damage,” must be subsequently elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is
elevated no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation and must be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
         2.   Existing manufactured homes.  Manufactured homes proposed to be
placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision that are not subject to the provisions of subsection d.1. above,
must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated
no lower than two (2) feet above the base flood elevation, and must be securely
anchored to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement.
         3.   Anchoring. Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement,
manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement in accordance with Section 19-425.42 of the South Carolina
Manufactured Housing Board Regulations, effective date May 25, 1990, as
amended. Additionally, when the elevation requirement would be met by an
elevation of the chassis at thirty-six (36) inches or less above the grade at
the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength. When the elevation of the
chassis is above thirty-six (36) inches in height, an engineering certification
is required.
         4.   Evacuation plan for parks and subdivisions. An evacuation plan
indicating vehicular access and escape routes for residents of manufactured
home parks and subdivisions located in or surrounded by an area of special
flood hazard must be developed. The owner of the manufactured home park or
subdivision shall be responsible for filing this plan with the flood
coordinator and shall see that each tenant thereof has received an evacuation
plan prior to the tenant’s moving into the manufactured home park or
subdivision. This plan shall be approved by the flood coordinator and the local
emergency preparedness coordinator.
      e.   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles placed on sites within
a floodplain shall either be on site for fewer than one hundred and eighty
(180) consecutive days and be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet
the general standards listed in subsection (d)(1) above, as well as the
standards for manufactured housing in subsection (d)(2)d. above. A recreational
vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on wheels or a jacking system, is
attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security
devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
      f.   Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls and are used solely for the parking of vehicles, building
access, or limited storage in an area other than a basement, and are subject to
flooding, shall be designed to preclude finished space and shall be designed to
automatically equalize flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters.
         1.   Designs for elevated buildings. Designs for complying with this
requirement must either be certified by a South Carolina licensed registered
land surveyor, engineer, or architect authorized by law to certify such
information, or meet the following minimum criteria:
            [a]   Provide a minimum of two (2) openings on different walls
having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square
foot of enclosed area subject to flooding;
            [b]   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above grade;
            [c]   Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood
elevation can be counted towards the required net opening amount;
            [d]   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or
other coverings or devices, provided they permit the automatic flow of
floodwaters in both directions, including engineered vents; and
            [e]   Fill placed around foundation walls shall be graded so that
the grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent
grade outside the building on at least one side of the building.
         2.   Access to enclosed area. Access to the enclosed area shall be the
minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited
storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises
(standards exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
         3.   Interior portion of enclosed area. The interior portion of such
enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms, except
to enclose a limited storage area. In addition, the interior portion must be
void of utilities, except for essential lighting as required, and cannot be
temperature controlled. One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a
ground fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor
elevation as specified in subsections (d)(2)a., b., and d., above.
         4.   Construction materials. All construction materials below the
required lowest floor elevation, as specified in subsections (d)(2)a., b., and
d. above, shall be of flood resistant materials.
      g.   Accessory structures. An accessory structure or garage, the cost of
which is greater than $1,000.00 must comply with the elevated structure
requirements of subsection (d)(2) a. and b. above. When accessory structures of
$1,000.00 or less are to be placed in the floodplain, the following criteria
shall be met:
         1.   One-story. Accessory structures shall be no higher than a single-
story building.
         2.   Not for habitation. Accessory structures shall not be used for
human habitation (including work, sleeping, living, cooking, or restroom
areas);
         3.   Flood damage potential. Accessory structures shall be designed to
have low flood damage potential;
         4.   Placement. Accessory structures shall be constructed and placed
on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of
floodwaters;
         5.   Anchoring. Accessory structures shall be firmly anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure;
         6.   Service facilities. Service facilities, such as electrical and
heating equipment, shall be installed in accordance with subsection (d)(1) f.
above; and
         7.   Openings. Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood
shall be provided below base flood elevation in conformance with subsection (d)
(2) f. above.
      h.   Floodways. The following provisions shall apply within the floodway
areas:
         1.   Permitted uses, excluding buildings. The following uses shall be
permitted in areas designated floodway areas, but only if such uses are
permitted within the basic district to which the FP overlay is appended, and
excluding buildings in connection with such uses:
            [a]   Agricultural and horticultural uses, and plant nurseries.
            [b]   Parking and loading areas.
            [c]   Open-air uses generally accessory to residential uses, such
as lawns, gardens, play areas, and parking areas.
            [d]   Recreational uses which are primarily open-air uses and which
do not offer a substantial impediment to water flow, such as swimming areas,
fishing areas, beaches, boat launching ramps, floating docks, life guard
stations, parks, playgrounds, play fields, picnic grounds, wildlife or nature
preserves, hiking trails, horseback riding trails, golf courses, driving
ranges, archery ranges, and tennis courts.
            [e]   Airport runways and landing strips.
            [f]   Streets, bridges, overhead utility lines, storm drainage
facilities, sewerage lines, waste treatment plant outlets, water supply intake
structures, and electronic transmission structures; provided that the structure
is demonstrated, by hydraulic and hydrologic analysis performed with standard
engineering practice and reviewed and approved by the County Floodplain
Coordinator, to cause no rise in the base flood elevation as established by the
Flood Insurance Study and further provided that:
               [1]   All structures are designed and constructed to minimize
infiltration by floodwaters; and
               [2]   The lowest horizontal member of bridges, excluding pilings
or columns, is elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation and
the superstructure attached thereto is designed to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting
simultaneously on all structural components.
         2.   Permitted uses, other. The following uses shall be permitted in
areas designated floodway areas, but only if such uses are permitted within the
basic district to which the FP overlay is appended:
            [a]   Any existing or future facility that is or will be a part of
or used by any public or private school that was constructed and operated
before January 1, 2001 on property subsequently classified as a regulatory
floodway;
            [b]   Any existing or future facility that is or will be a part of
or used by any publicly owned wastewater treatment facility that was
constructed and operated before January 1, 2001 on property subsequently
classified as a regulatory floodway.
      i.   Fill. Fill is the placement of natural sands, dirt, soil, or rock
above the natural grade in order to raise the elevation of the ground. Dredged
material may only be used as fill upon certification of suitability by a South
Carolina licensed registered professional geotechnical engineer. The use of
fill shall be limited to the elevation of individual structures (including
garages and garage aprons), utilities, infrastructure, and public road
crossings. Other methods of elevating structures should be considered first.
         1.   To allow the elevation of individual structures, the amount of
fill used shall be the minimum necessary. Floodplain authorization for fill
shall be based on findings by the county engineer that the minimum fill being
used for raising the structure is the most feasible alternative.
         2.   Fill, if approved, shall meet the following conditions:
            [a]   The flood storage capacity of the floodplain shall not be
affected and flood heights shall not be increased. The space occupied by the
authorized fill below Base Flood Elevation for all encroachment within the
special flood hazard areas within unincorporated Richland County, with the
exception of the special flood hazard area adjacent to Lake Murray, shall be
compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation
taken from below the Base Flood Elevation. All such excavations shall be
constructed to drain freely to the watercourse.
            [b]   Flooding from any source shall not be increased for
neighboring properties. Neighboring and adjacent properties shall not be
adversely affected in any way nor shall drainage problems be caused or
aggravated as a result of fill.
            [c]   Fill shall not be placed in the floodway except for essential
utilities and necessary infrastructure, and must meet the approval of the
county engineer.
            [d]   Fill shall not be placed in nontidal wetlands without the
required state and federal permits.
         3.   In the event buildings on adjacent properties are known or
determined to be subject to flooding under current conditions, the county
engineer may require submission of hydrologic and hydraulic analyses to
adequately demonstrate that the effects of the proposed fill wiil not increase
flooding on neighboring properties. Additional fill for landscaping purposes is
not permitted. Landscaping mulch (tree bark or pine needles) is not considered
fill and is allowed.
         4.   Where allowed, fill material shall meet the following additional
requirements:
            [a]   Fill material shall be compacted to 95% of the maximum
density, obtainable with the standard proctor test method issued by The
American Society For Testing And Materials (ASTM standard D-698) to provide the
necessary stability and resistance to erosion, scouring or settling.
            [b]   Fill shall be performed in such manner as to maintain or
increase flood storage and conveyance capacity, and to not increase FEMA base
flood elevations, nor to have an adverse impact on neighboring properties.
            [c]   All fill placed at or below the flood elevation in the
floodplain shall be balanced with at least an equal amount of soil material
removal from the same parcel(s) or from subwatershed for all special flood
hazard areas within unincorporated Richland County, with the exception of the
special flood hazard area adjacent to Lake Murray. Compensatory storage
required to offset floodplain fill must be created before the project begins
and should be available throughout the construction period. The required volume
of compensatory storage must be provided within the project boundary.
            [d]   Excavation shall not be counted as compensating for fill if
such areas will be filled with water in non-storm conditions.
            [e]   Fill shall be performed in a manner to maintain or increase
slope stability and maintain or decrease erosive velocities. Fill slopes shall
be no greater than two (2) horizontal to one (1) vertical. Flatter slopes may
be required where velocities may result in erosion.
            [f]   Applicants must submit an as-built survey certification by a
South Carolina registered professional engineer that demonstrates that the
required volume of storage has been created on site in order to ensure no net
loss as outlined and demonstrated per the approved plans.
         5.   Any change in the flood flow within a regulatory floodplain
through fill must be submitted and approved through the FEMA "Letter of Map
Revision" process in addition to review by the flood coordinator and county
engineer.
         6.   A South Carolina registered professional engineer shall certify
that all of the above standards and requirements within this subsection
26-106(i) have been met.
      j.   Critical facilities. Construction of critical facilities is
prohibited in the five hundred (500) year floodplain (A, 1AE and X500 Zones on
the FIRM).
   (e)   Standards for streams not having established base flood elevations and
floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard are small streams
where no base flood elevation data have been provided and where no floodways
have been identified. The following provisions shall apply to these areas:
      No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvement, or other development shall be permitted within one hundred (100)
feet of the stream bank unless certification (with supporting technical data by
a South Carolina licensed registered land surveyor, engineer, or architect
authorized by law to certify such information) is provided demonstrating that
such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge. Such data shall be submitted to the
flood coordinator.
      (1)   Standards for determining a Base Flood Elevation. When base flood
elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal, state or other source one
of the following methods may be used to determine a BFE. For further
information regarding the methods for determining the BFEs listed below, refer
to FEMA's manual Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas:
         a.   Contour Interpolation.
            1.   Superimpose approximate zone A boundaries onto a topographic
map and estimate a BFE.
            2.   Add one-half of the contour interval of the topographic map
that is used to the BFE.
         b.   Data Extrapolation - A BFE can be determined if a site within 500
feet upstream of a stream reach for which a 100-year profile has been computed
by detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope
characteristics are relatively similar to downstream reaches. No hydraulic
structures shall be present.
         c.   Hydrologic and Hydraulic Calculations - Perform hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations to determine the BFEs using FEMA approved methods and
software.
   (f)   Standards for streams with established base flood elevations without
floodways. Along rivers and streams where Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data is
provided but no floodway is identified for a Special Flood Hazard Area on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) or in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS).
      No encroachments including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, or other development shall be permitted unless certification with
supporting technical data by a registered professional engineer is provided
demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the community. Any increase shall not adversely impact any portion of
the community.
      (1)   General. All subdivisions, planned development communities, and
large-scale development proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize
or eliminate flood damage. In all areas where base flood elevation data is not
available, applications for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments containing at least 50 lots or 5 acres, whichever is less, shall
include a hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that generates base flood
elevations. In lieu of the aforementioned, the entire Zone A special flood
hazard area shall be placed in a perpetual deeded open space with no future
construction authorized.
      (2)   Public utilities. All subdivisions, planned development
communities, and large scale development proposals shall have public utilities
and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electric and water systems, located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      (3)   Access. An access road above the base flood elevation shall be
provided for all subdivision, planned development community, or other large-
scale development proposals to allow emergency access to flooded areas during
flood conditions.
      (4)   Drainage. All subdivision, planned development community, or other
large-scale development proposals shall have adequate drainage, in compliance
with all other applicable code regulations provided to reduce or eliminate
exposure to flood hazards.
   (g)   Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO and AH Zones). Located
within the areas of special flood hazard are areas designated as shallow
flooding.
      The following provisions shall apply within such areas:
      (1)   Residential structures. All new construction and substantial
improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor (including
basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the
depth number specified in feet on the FIRM. If no depth number is specified,
the lowest floor (including basement) shall be elevated at least three (3) feet
above the highest adjacent grade.
      (2)   Nonresidential structures. The lowest floor (including the
basement) for all new construction and substantial improvements of
nonresidential structures shall meet one of the following standards:
         a.   Elevation. The nonresidential structures(s) shall be elevated
above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified
in feet on the FIRM. If no depth number is specified, the lowest floor
(including basement) shall be elevated at least three (3) feet above the
highest adjacent grade; or
         b.   Construction. The nonresidential structure(s), together with
attendant utility and sanitary facilities, must be designed so that below the
base flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of
buoyancy. A South Carolina licensed registered land surveyor, engineer or
architect authorized by law to certify such information shall submit a
certification to the flood coordinator that the standards of this section are
satisfied. There shall be adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes
to guide floodwaters around and away from the proposed structures.
      (3)   Slopes. All structures on slopes must have drainage paths around
them in order to guide water away from such structure; provided, however, such
drainage paths must not adversely affect adjacent properties. (Design
information is defined in the Richland County Stormwater Design Manual).
   (h)   Standards for levees.
      (1)   General standards. All levees protecting residential structures or
nonresidential structures that are not flood-proofed shall be designed,
constructed, and maintained to provide protection against the 500-year flood,
plus three (3) feet of freeboard. Flood elevations shall be as shown on the
latest Flood Insurance Rate Maps as determined by appropriate hydrologic
methods. Any levee constructed or improved under this subsection shall also
comply with the other applicable provisions of Section 26-202 of this chapter.
      (2)   Specific standards.
         a.   Design and construction. Design and construction shall be in
accordance with the latest edition of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers'
(USACE's) Manual EM 1110-2-1913 Design and Construction of Levees. The design
and construction of drainage systems within levees shall be in accordance with
the latest edition of the USACE's Manual EM 1110-2-1413 Hydrologic Analysis of
Interior Areas. A South Carolina Registered Professional Engineer shall certify
that he has been involved in the design, construction, and inspection phases
and shall certify that the construction meets requirements of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers.
         b.   Records. Owners of levees will perform the necessary and required
maintenance and provide appropriate records to the county engineer. These
records shall include:
            1.   Signed agreements of perpetual operation and maintenance
between the constructor and/or owner and Richland County;
            2.   As-built construction plans sealed by a South Carolina
Registered Professional Engineer;
            3.   A description of the levee maintenance program in accordance
with Levee Maintenance Standards and Procedures of Richland County (see
subsection (h)(3) below); and
            4.   Periodic maintenance reports as required by the county
engineer.
      (3)   Maintenance standards and procedures.  Levees shall be maintained
as necessary to ensure serviceability against flood at all times, as follows:
         a.   Sod growth. Maintenance of a sturdy sod growth on levee
embankments is highly important, as sod is one of the most effective means of
protecting the levee against erosion from rain, water current, and wavewash.
Periodic mowing with tractor-operated equipment is essential to maintaining a
good sod growth, and shall be done at such intervals as necessary to keep down
weeds and other noxious growth and to prevent the grass height from exceeding
twelve (12) inches. However, the grass shall not be mowed to a height of less
than two (2) inches. The number of mowings required each season will depend on
local conditions. The last mowing of the season will be accomplished under
conditions that allow the grass to obtain a height of approximately eight (8)
inches to ten (10) inches entering the winter season. Mowing will be performed
to a distance of at least five (5) feet beyond the toe of the levee or berm.
Burning grass and weeds is not permitted in the levee maintenance program,
except during appropriate seasons when it is not detrimental to sod growth.
During the growing season, spraying with herbicides on an as-needed basis is
permissible and desirable for weed and brush control on levees and berms.
Reseeding and fertilizing shall be completed frequently enough to sustain sod
growth on levee embankments for erosion control.
         b.   Earth embankments. Levee embankments shall be maintained to not
less than the grade and section, as designed, by replacing any material lost
from the crown or slopes. Ruts, washes, slides, and subsidence should be
promptly repaired and the entire embankment maintained sufficiently smooth for
power mowing. Levee crowns shall be graded as necessary to drain freely and
prevent impoundment of rainwater. All brush, trees, and other undesirable
growth shall be removed from the levee embankment.
         c.   Animal burrows. Levees and adjacent landward areas shall be
maintained free of all types of animal burrows. Animal burrows, when found,
shall be backfilled with compacted material and sodded. To prevent recurrence,
effort shall be made to exterminate the burrowing animals.
         d.   Prevention of encroachment. Care shall be taken to assure that
levees are not encroached upon. Buildings, structures, and storage of materials
or equipment are not permitted on the levee. Refuse dumps are not permitted.
Following each high water, any debris deposited on the riverside slope of the
levee shall be removed promptly.
         e.   Roads and ramps. Access roads to and on the levees, including
ramps, shall be bladed as necessary to keep the roadway shaped properly and
free of ruts, pockets, and washes. Ramp embankments shall be maintain the
section and grade as designed.
            Maintenance shall be performed as necessary to correct any
encroachment into the levee crown where roads cross levees. Road surfacing
material shall be replaced as necessary to maintain the road surface in good
condition.
         f.   Miscellaneous levee facilities and appurtenances. Levee
facilities and appurtenances that are constructed on, over, or through the
levee shall be maintained in a good state of repair and/or inspected at least
annually. Facilities and appurtenances that operate only during high water must
be checked carefully and repaired as necessary, immediately prior to high water
season. Relief wells shall be checked during periods of high water. Wells that
do not flow for an extended period of time may have to be tested by pumping to
determine the extent of deterioration. Critically deteriorated wells shall be
rehabilitated by cleaning, surging, and pumping. Check valves shall be
inspected to ensure that they open freely and that the gaskets are in good
condition. The most common of the facilities and appurtenances referred to
herein are:
            1.   Drainage structures through the levee,
            2.   Toe drainage systems,
            3.   Relief wells,
            4.   Levee slope protection and protection on dike ends,
            5.   Gates, cattle guards, and fences, and
            6.   Siphons and pipe crossings.
      (4)   Inspection. Frequent inspections are essential to a good levee
maintenance program. In addition to the formal inspections required by the
county engineer, inspections will be made prior to the beginning of the flood
season, during and immediately following each high water period, and at such
intermediate times as necessary to ensure satisfactory care of the levee.

Sec. 26-107. RD Redevelopment Overlay District.
   (a)   Purpose. The RD Overlay District is intended to promote the
revitalization of existing blighted commercial strips and residential areas
while encouraging reinvestment in and reuse of areas in a manner consistent
with the Comprehensive Plan for Richland County. Revitalization initiates
housing and economic opportunities, which promotes socially vibrant centers of
community life through the coordinated efforts of public, private and community
organizations.
   (b)   Applicability/establishment. The RD Overlay District may be approved
and designated by County Council if two or more of the following conditions or
circumstances are evident:
      (1)   Loss of retail, office, and/or industrial activity, use or
employment;
      (2)   Forty percent (40%) or more of households are low-income
households;
      (3)   A predominance of residential or nonresidential structures that are
deteriorating or deteriorated;
      (4)   Abandonment of residential or nonresidential structures;
      (5)   Environmentally contaminated land;
      (6)   The existence of unsanitary or unsafe conditions that endanger
life, health, or property;
      (7)   Deterioration in public improvements, such as streets, street
lighting, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, related pedestrian amenities, and parks
and recreational facilities;
      (8)   Recent occurrence of a disaster; or
      (9)   Any combination of factors that substantially impairs or arrests
the sound growth and economic development of government, or adversely affects
the public, health, safety, or general welfare due to the redevelopment area’s
present condition and use.
   (c)   Permitted uses, permitted uses with special requirements, and special
exceptions. Reserved.
   (d)   Development standards.
      1.   Redevelopment Plan Requirement. A Redevelopment Plan shall be
submitted for approval prior to designating an RD Overlay District, and shall
include, without limitation, a capital improvement plan that identifies the
improvements required to achieve the objectives of the plan and its funding
sources. The capital improvement plan shall demonstrate that adequate funding
will be secured, including the commitment of County resources for
implementation.
      2.   Reserved.
   (e)   Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan.  The proposed Redevelopment
Plan Area must be consistent with and compliment the Richland County
Comprehensive Plan, the land use plan, and the capital improvement plan for the
planning area in which it is located. In addition, it is recommended that the
Redevelopment Plan be more clearly defined in the Comprehensive Plan update.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04; Ord. No. 043-07HR, § XXIV, 5-1-07; Ord. No.
054-09HR, § XXIV, 11-3-09)
Sec. 26-108. EP Environmental Protection Overlay District.
   (a)   Purpose. The EP Overlay District is intended to address general
environmental concerns within a designated area. In an effort to address some
of the most critical water resource problems that exist within Richland County,
environmental protection overlay districts may be initiated by the Public Works
Department as necessary and appropriate.
   (b)   Applicability/establishment. EP Overlay Districts may be approved and
designated by County Council in order to promote the general welfare of
Richland County and of the public generally where Richland County seeks to
regulate and control development activities adjacent to special protection
areas, impaired water bodies within Richland County and/or where TMDLs may have
been designated. The EP Overlay District map may be requested from the Public
Works Department.
   (c)   EP Overlay District sub-areas. Within the EP overlay district, there
is a sub-area classification, which is identified as follows:
      Gills Creek Environmental Protection Overlay District (EP-GC District).
Richland County seeks to preserve the Gills Creek Floodway in order to protect
and improve the water quality, scenic beauty, and wildlife habitat of the
creek. The creation of the EP-GC District for Richland County is done in order
to establish a mechanism for the accomplishment of these objectives. There is
hereby established one (1) EP overlay district  in the Gills Creek area of
Richland County. The boundaries of the EP-GC District shall be the Gills Creek
Floodway as shown on the FEMA Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
   (d)   Development requirements. Variances and exemptions shall not be
permitted within the EP Environmental Protection Overlay Districts; however,
the Public Works Department may consider applications for waivers where the
applicant demonstrates that alternative protection measures can be provided
that exceed the protection afforded by the requirements of this Section.
      (1)   Water Quantity Problem Areas. In EP Environmental Protection
Overlay Districts where flooding problems exist, the Public Works Department
may require additional design criteria in addition to the minimum design
standards as follows: The post-development peak discharge rates shall be
restricted to 1/2 the pre-development rates for the 2, 5, 10, and 25-year storm
events or to the downstream system capacity, whichever is less. Additional
design procedures are contained in the “Stormwater Design Manual”.
      (2)   Water Quality Protection Areas. In conjunction with the NPDES
permitting program, DHEC identifies impaired water bodies bi-annually and
reports them in accordance with Section 303 of the Clean Water Act. If a water
body is listed on the 303(d) as an impaired stream or a TMDL has been
established. Richland County will require a plan be implemented that uses
structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce the current pollutant loading to
either a certain maximum total load or by a percentage. In no case will
Richland County approve a land development activity that increases the
pollutant loading to an impaired stream. In EP Environmental Protection Overlay
Districts where impairments exist, all sites which disturb one (1) acre or more
shall have a permanent water quality BMP in place to treat at least the first
1-inch of runoff from the entire site. This volume shall be held for a minimum
period of twenty-four (24) hours.
(Ord. 006-10HR, § IX, 1-19-09)
Sec. 26-109. CRD Corridor Redevelopment Overlay District.
   (a)   Purpose. The CRD Overlay District is intended to promote the
revitalization of existing underutilized, vacant, or abandoned commercial
strips while encouraging reinvestment in and reuse of areas in a manner
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for Richland County. Revitalization
initiates housing and economic opportunities, which promotes socially vibrant
centers of community life through the coordinated efforts of public, private
and community organizations.
   (b)   Applicability/Establishment.
      (1)   The CRD Overlay District may be approved and designated by County
Council for any area within the county that has already had a Master Plan
approved and adopted by the County Council; provided, however, the standards of
such district shall remain optional, as described in subparagraph (2), below.
      (2)   Once a CRD Overlay District is applied to a designated area of the
county, the development standards of the underlying district shall remain in
place until such time as a property owner applies to the Planning and
Development Services Department to have the standards of the CRD Overlay
District apply to his/her property. Only one set of standards shall apply to

only) with permission from the County and SCDOT.
      (3)   Landscaping, bufferyard, and screening standards:
         a.   Bufferyards: Where a proposed use in a CRD Overlay District abuts
a lower impact residential use in a residential zoning district outside of the
CRD District, landscaping and bufferyards shall be provided in accordance with
Section
26-176 of this chapter. However, in order to provide a continuous pedestrian
transition for residential neighborhoods and commercial areas within CRD
developments, institutional, office/commercial, or recreational land use
categories shall not be separated from residential land use categories by berms
or buffers.
         b.   Solid waste storage areas: All trash containment devices -
including compactors, dumpsters, commercial roll-out bins, and areas for
storing cardboard - shall be located and designed so as not to be visible from
the view of nearby streets and properties and shall be placed in the side or
rear yards only, away from pedestrian circulation routes.
            1.   In all cases, trash containment devices shall be enclosed to
prevent windblown litter. The enclosure shall be at least as high as the
highest point of the container.
            2.   The enclosure shall be made of a material that is opaque at
the time of installation and compatible with and/or similar to the design and
materials of the principal building. Landscaping that will reach at least 6
feet in height at maturity shall be provided around the enclosure where it
abuts a single family residential use or zoning district.
         c.   Mechanical and utility equipment: Mechanical and utility
equipment shall be screened from view from nearby streets and properties in the
same manner as trash containment areas. If the equipment is not visible off-
site, then it need not be screened. The type of screening used shall be
determined based on the proposed location of the equipment, existing site
conditions, and the type and amount of existing and proposed vegetation on the
site.
            1.   Ground mounted: Ground mounted equipment shall be located in
the rear or side yard and screened.
            2.   Roof mounted: Such equipment located on the roof of the
building shall be made invisible from nearby streets and properties through the
use of setbacks from the edge of the roof or through the use of a screen
exceeding the height of the equipment and using building materials and design
which are compatible with those used for the exterior of the building.
      (4)   Parking/loading standards: Except as otherwise provided in this
section, parking and loading facilities shall be provided as required by
Section
26-173 and Section
26-174 of this chapter. However, due to the intended pedestrian nature of the
CRD Overlay District area, minimum parking requirements are reduced, parking
maximums established, on-street parking encouraged, and bicycle parking
required.
         a.   Off-street parking:

1 All square footage is in gross square feet.
 
            2.   Small retail and service/business uses: Uses involving a gross
floor area of less than twenty-five hundred (2,500) square feet shall not
require on-site parking, provided that the required parking is available within
a six hundred (600) foot radius of the activity.
            3.   Shared parking. Shared parking is encouraged for all uses and
shall meet the requirements of Section
26-173(e)(2).
            4.   Location:
               [a]   No off-street parking shall be located within any front
yard except parking for disabled or drop off spaces.
               [b]   For non-residential buildings, no more than 33% of the lot
width may be allocated to parking on the side of the building. Commercial and
Mixed-Use buildings that provide 100% of the parking to the rear of the
building shall be permitted one additional story of height above the maximum
building height permitted.
               [c]   All off-street parking spaces for townhouse and multi-
family buildings shall be in the rear yard only and access to any garages shall
be from the rear.
               [d]   Parking areas in the side yards shall be located a minimum
of 10 feet behind the frontage line of the building.
               [e]   Where primary parking abuts sidewalks or roads within the
CRD District, screening, a minimum of four (4) feet in height, shall be erected
on the frontage line, where primary parking lots are located. This screening
requirement may be met by the use of walls or densely planted vegetation,
providing for visual obstruction of the parking area from the abutting road(s).

connections and/or shall have vehicular connections from an alley.
            7.   Transit stop provision: Developments that provide a covered
transit stop with seating and approved by the Central Midlands Regional Transit
Authority (CMRTA) along an existing or planned transit route shall be allowed
to reduce their required off-street parking by ten (10) spaces.
         b.   On-street parking: On-street parking is encouraged on all streets
in CRD Districts. On-street parking shall count toward any minimum parking
requirements. The provision of on-street parking on thoroughfare or collector
streets within the CRD Overlay District will require the coordination with
SCDOT and appropriate County agencies and may require modification of the
existing curbline at the expense of the property owner or developer.
         c.   Bicycle parking: Bicycle parking for all non-residential uses and
for residential uses of more than four (4) units per building is required.
Bicycle parking shall be provided based on the use of the building and the
number of motor vehicle parking spaces. Where fewer than 2 bicycle spaces are
required, at least two spaces or one rack must be provided.

            1.   Required racks: “Inverted U” type racks or other racks that
support the bicycle at two points on the bicycle frame are required. A single
inverted U rack shall count as two bicycle parking spaces. Long term bicycle
parking, which protects the entire bicycle and its components from theft,
vandalism, and weather (such as bike lockers, locked rooms) may be provided for
use by employees, residents, and students and may count toward fulfillment of
the bicycle parking requirements.

space for access and maneuvering.
               [d]   At least four (4) feet between parallel racks shall be
provided for access.
               [e]   Bicycle racks installed on sidewalks shall provide for a
clear, unobstructed width of at least five (5) feet for pedestrians and shall
be installed parallel to the curb.
               [f]   Racks should be placed along a major building approach
line and clearly visible from the approach and no more than 50 feet from
building entrances or no further than the closest motor vehicle parking space,
whichever is less. Rack placement should allow for visual monitoring by persons
within the building and/or persons entering the building.
               [g]   If required bicycle parking is not visible from the street
or main building entrance, a sign shall be posted at the main entrance
indicating the location of the parking.
               [h]   Uses with several major, actively used entrances shall
locate a portion of the required bicycle parking at each entrance.
         d.   Loading: Loading areas shall be to the rear of the principal
building and may adjoin alleys or parking areas.
         e.   Parking area landscaping: Parking lots shall be landscaped in
accordance with the standards in Section
26-176(g), Vehicular Surface Area Landscaping, except as specified below.
            1.   Vehicle surface area interior landscaping: Vehicle parking
areas are to be planted with one (1) large shade tree for every five (5)
parking spaces.
            2.   Bioretention: required vehicle surface area interior
landscaping (Section
26-176(g)(3)) may be substituted with one or more consolidated bioretention
areas with minimum side dimensions measuring at least 38 X 12 feet each.
Bioretention areas shall be designed and landscaped to trap and mitigate runoff
from paved surfaces consistent with the description and intent of EPA Storm
Water Technology Fact Sheet - Bioretention (EPA 832-F-99-012, September 1999),
or equivalent. Bioretention areas may be sited anywhere in the parking lot that
is convenient to capture stormwater and manage parking lot traffic and
facilitate pedestrian use, including adjacent to and connecting with vegetated
areas on the perimeter of a parking lot. Bioretention areas shall be considered
part of the minimum required open space.
            3.   A portion of a parking space may be landscaped instead of
paved, as follows:
               [a]   The landscaped area may include up to 2 feet of the front
of the parking space as measured from a line parallel to the direction of the
bumper of a vehicle using the space, as shown at right;
               [b]   Landscaping must be ground cover plants; and
               [c]   The landscaping may count towards any parking lot interior
landscaping requirements and toward any overall site landscaping requirements.
However, the landscaped area does not count toward perimeter landscaping
requirements

            4.   Garbage receptacles: For every 100 parking spaces, one garbage
receptacle shall be provided and centrally located in parking areas.
         f.   Parking structures:
            1.   Liner buildings required. The ground-level of a parking
structure shall be wrapped by retail, office or some other active use along at
least the primary facade. All levels of a structured parking facility shall be
designed and screened in such a way as to minimize visibility of parked cars
from surrounding streets.
            2.   High-quality materials: Parking structure facades shall be
treated with high quality materials and given vertical articulation and
emphasis compatible to the principal structure. The facade should be designed
to visually screen cars. In no instance will rails or cabling alone be
sufficient to meet this screening requirement.
            3.   Clear entries: Pedestrian entries shall be clearly visible.
The vertical circulation should not be located in the center of the structure
or so that it is difficult or circuitous to locate.
            4.   Vents and utility openings: In addition to the above
requirements, in the event that any openings for ventilation, service, or
emergency access are located at the first floor level in the building facade,
then they shall be an integral part of the overall building design. These
openings as well as pedestrian and vehicular entrances shall be designed to
minimize visibility of parked cars. The remainder of the street level frontage
shall be either commercial space or an architecturally articulated facade
designed to minimize the visibility of parked cars.
         g.   Circulation drives: Along major thoroughfares, a circulation
drive may be permitted around the front of the building but may not encroach
into the front setback or any required landscape area. If provided, this drive
shall be designed to be the minimal width required for one-way circulation (not
to exceed 12 feet in width) and shall be constructed using alternative paving
treatments such as pavers or stamped concrete.
      (5)   Sidewalk and pedestrian amenities:
         a.   Sidewalks: Sidewalks shall be constructed along both sides of all
streets in CRD overlay districts.
            1.   Sidewalks on local streets shall be a minimum of 5 feet in
width.
            2.   Sidewalks on collectors or arterials shall be a minimum of 6
feet in width. Sidewalks should be a minimum of 8 feet in front of retail uses
within 10 feet of the right-of-way. Sidewalks located in a mixed-use area with
sidewalk-fronting, ground-floor retail and on-street parking may extend from
the back of curb to the buildings and/or plaza areas and shall be a minimum of
12 feet wide. When outdoor, cafe-seating is expected, the sidewalk shall be a
minimum of 16 feet wide.

         b.   Pedestrian network:
            1.   Developers shall provide a complete network of pedestrian
paths that interconnect building entrances, parking, transit stops, public
sidewalks and crosswalks, adjacent properties, adjoining off-street paths, and
other key destinations on or adjacent to the site. If no immediate benefit can
be derived from pedestrian links between adjoining properties, a future at-
grade link shall be provided for through a construction easement to the
adjoining property.

            2.   Pedestrian pathways shall be provided from buildings to the
sidewalk and through parking areas to ensure safe, direct, and convenient
pedestrian access to building entrances and off-street parking.
      (6)   Signs: Sign standards shall be governed by Section
26-180 of this Chapter with the following exceptions:
         a.   Existing signs not conforming to the standards above shall be
governed by the provisions of subsection
26-180(o), Non-conforming Signs. Furthermore, all existing non-conforming signs
must be removed in order to utilize the CRD Overlay provisions.
         b.   No permanent detached pole signs shall be permitted in the CRD
District.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/3d6d73a10acd918c41f3516a9384a2f8b6384635/
IMAGES/0-0-0-6489.jpg]
 
         c.   Ground mounted or monument signs are allowed as follows:
            1.   Not to exceed 5 feet in height and forty (40) square feet in
area per side.
            2.   Up to an additional fifteen (15) square feet of sign area is
permitted for a monument sign that has a rock or brick base and a routed or
sandblasted sign that is made out of wood.
            3.   Located behind the right-of-way and out of any sight distance
triangle prescribed by SCDOT and Richland County Public Works.
         d.   No outdoor advertising signs will be permitted.
         e.   Signs are allowed to project nine (9) feet into the required
setback or one-half the width of the required setback, whichever is less. A
minimum overhead clearance of eight (8) feet from the sidewalk must be
maintained.
      (7)   Recreation/open space standards: All CRD developments that include
residential units shall be required to dedicate open space. The amount of
useable open space required for dedication shall be determined using the Open
Space Dedication Matrix below. Unless otherwise specified below, the
requirements of Section
26-186 of this chapter shall apply.
         a.   Open space dedication requirements: This matrix has been
developed with regard to the availability of accessible open space in close
proximity to the proposed development. Credits are granted to developments
within a l/4 mile (5 minute) walk (along sidewalks or other pedestrian access)
to existing, publicly dedicated open space (parks, greenways, etc.).
Developments that are adjacent to existing publicly dedicated open space are
granted a fifty (50%) percent reduction in required dedication.
 
                        Required Open Space
                        Base open space required  200 sq ft per residential
                                                  unit
Required Open Space Per Within 1/4 mile of public 100 sq ft per residential
Residential Unit        park                      unit
                        Adjacent to public park   None required
                        Mixed-Use Development     2% of Lot or Development
 
         b.   Payment in lieu of dedication of open space:
            1.   The County Council may, at its discretion, accept either an
equitable amount of land in another location within 1/2 mile of the development
site or a fee paid to the County in lieu of dedication. A combination of
recreational open space dedication and payments-in-lieu of dedication may be
permitted. The following formula shall be used to determine the fee:
               Post Development Appraised Value of Entire Development X
Required Recreational Open Space Dedication=Payment in Lieu Dedication Fee
            2.   The post development appraised value of the entire development
shall be established by an appraiser who is a member of the American Institute
of Real Estate Appraisers.
            3.   Payments-in-lieu-of-dedication shall be approved as part of
the development plan. Any disagreement in the amount of required payment shall
be resolved by conducting a professional appraisal of the fair market value of
the property. The professional appraiser shall be mutually agreed upon by the
developer and County. An appraiser shall be appointed by the County should an
agreement not be reached. All payments made in lieu of dedication shall be made
at the time of preliminary plat approval. Failure to submit the required fee
along with such applications will delay approval of such submissions until
payment is rendered. All funds received for payment in lieu of dedication shall
be deposited in a special fund or line item to be used only for the
acquisition, development, or redevelopment of public recreation space within
the CRD Overlay District or other approved location.
            4.   Reasons for payments-in-lieu- of-dedication may include, but
are not limited to, proximity to existing public parks and/or existing
topographic or geographic conditions.
         c.   Open space improvement standards:
            1.   Inaccessible land: No more than 25% of open space may be
provided in “inaccessible land”, including: any land where no zoning or
building permits may be issued (such as dedicated easements and rights-of-way
except those existing only to protect underground utilities such as water or
sewer lines - wetlands, bodies of water, etc., as determined by County Planning
staff ); and, any land with a post-development slope greater than 3:1, which
would severely limit its usefulness as open space.
            2.   Natural areas: Significant stands of trees, streambed areas,
and other valuable topographic features shall be preserved within the required
open space areas where practical. Areas noted an the adopted Redevelopment Plan
as open space should be preserved and dedicated where practical and feasible
and may be left unimproved in accordance with the plan (e.g., greenways).
            3.   Location: The design and location of public open space on a
site is perhaps the most important determinant in a successful pedestrian
environment. To ensure that public open space is well-used, it is essential to
locate and design it carefully.
               [a]   Public open space should be fronted by streets and
buildings to encourage their use and patrol their safety.
               [b]   The space should be located where it is visible and easily
accessible from homes and public areas (building entrances, streets,
sidewalks). No residential unit shall be more than one thousand (1,000) feet
from any dedicated open space.

IMAGES/0-0-0-6491.jpg]
 
               [c]   Take views and sun exposure into account in design and
location.
               [d]   The space should be well-buffered from moving cars so that
users can enjoy and relax in the space.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/3d6d73a10acd918c41f3516a9384a2f8b6384635/
IMAGES/0-0-0-6493.jpg]
 
               [e]   The space may be visible from streets or internal drives
but should not be wholly exposed to them.
               [f]   Partially enclose the space with building walls,
freestanding walls, landscaping, raised planters, or on-street parking to help
buffer it and create comfortable “outdoor rooms”.
            4.   Public seating: Publicly accessible places to sit in the
public realm are important not only as basic amenities, but also in encouraging
casual social interaction. Seating can be both formal and informal, including
both park benches on the tops of garden walls or monumental stairs at the
entrance to public buildings. Planter walls should be set at a maximum height
of 2 l/2 feet to allow for their use as seating. Moveable chairs and sidewalk
cafes are strongly encouraged in public open spaces in the CRD Overlay
District.
            5.   Minimum amenities: The following requirements apply to
squares, plazas and other urban open spaces in the CRD Overlay District:
               [a]   One (1) tree (3 inch caliper minimum measured 6" above the
ground at installation) to be planted in at least 350 square feet of soil for
every 1,000 square feet of provided open space.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/3d6d73a10acd918c41f3516a9384a2f8b6384635/
IMAGES/0-0-0-6495.jpg]
 
               [b]   A minimum of twenty-five (25) linear feet of seating
should be provided for every 1,000 square feet of open space. Seating should be
more than 12 inches and less than 30 inches in height and not less than 16
inches in depth. Seating more than 28 inches in depth and accessible from two
sides should count double. Moveable chairs are encouraged and each count as 2
1/2 linear feet of suggested seating.
               [c]   At least half of the open space should be at street level.
               [d]   Playground equipment, statues, and fountains, if provided,
should be located toward the interior of squares and parks.
               [e]   One (1) water tap for each five thousand (5,000) square
feet of each landscaped open space.
               [f]   One (1) garbage receptacle for each five thousand (5,000)
square feet of each physically separated open space.
      (8)   Building design and operation standards:
         a.   Lots and buildings:
            1.   Lot frontage: All lots shall front a street, square or common
open space. (Exception: Buildings which are interior to a site that has
buildings that otherwise meet the frontage requirement).
            2.   Corner lots: Buildings located at street intersections must
place the main building, or part of the building, at the corner.
            3.   Setbacks: A building may be set back to create an “outdoor
room” or patio/café seating.
            4.   Adjacent lots: For similarly used properties, the grade of
adjacent lots should match where the properties meet. If there is a significant
grade difference, development should create an attractive transition using
creative grading and landscaping or a decorative retaining wall, incorporating
vehicular and pedestrian cross-access. Avoid using a blank or unscreened
concrete retaining wall or rock covered slope.
            5.   Termination of Vistas: Important street vistas (such as along
gateways and primary pedestrian streets) should terminate in a focal point,
such as a building or other architectural or landscape feature.
            6.   General building design standards:
               [a]   Entryway: The main entrance of all principal structures
shall open to a road, square, or common open space of at least twenty (20)
square feet in area.
               [b]   Architectural style: The building design standards of this
Chapter intentionally do not mandate a particular style and permit a wide
variety of architectural expressions. However, when a design exhibits a known
architectural style (i.e., Colonial, Victorian, Classical Revival) the details
shall be consistent with that style unless the local architectural vernacular
of Richland County provides an alternate precedent for a detail or element.
      (9)   Streets: Streets in the CRD Overlay District should permit the
comfortable use of the street by motorists, cyclists, and pedestrians. Pavement
widths, design speeds, and the number of vehicle lanes should be minimized
without compromising safety. The specific design of any given street must
consider the buildings which front on the street and the relationship of the
street to the area’s street network.
         a.   Connectivity: Streets shall interconnect within a development and
with adjoining development. Street stubs should be provided with development
adjacent to open land to provide for future connections.
         b.   Streetscape design: All new development or expansions to existing
development shall be required to build or upgrade their street frontage in
accordance with the following standards or standards established in an adopted
Redevelopment Plan:

IMAGES/0-0-0-6497.jpg]
 
            1.   On-street parking: All on-street parking should be parallel.
Angle parking is permitted in front of high traffic retail locations and where
the posted speed is 25 mph or less.
            2.   Access management: Developments should minimize or eliminate
curb cuts (driveways) along arterials. In general, curb cuts should be spaced
no closer than 600 feet apart.
               [a]   Where possible, vehicular access should be shared with the
adjacent properties and/or alleys should be utilized for access. Developments
that share access may reduce their required Vehicle Surface Area Interior
Landscaping requirements by twenty-five (25%) percent.
               [b]   Where a development is sited at a corner location, primary
access shall be from the secondary street.
               [c]   All lots, parcels, or any other division of land adjacent
to an arterial roadway may be allowed driveways or street connections in
accordance with the following table:
 
Parcel Frontage (feet) Number of Driveways Allowed
<600                   1
601-1200               2
>1201                  3
 
            3.   Curb-return radii: Curb radii shall be designed to reduce
pedestrian crossing times along all streets requiring sidewalks. In general,
curb radii should not exceed twenty (20) feet.
            4.   Curbs and drainage: Standard curbing is required along all
streets with on-street parking. All drainage grates, if provided, must be safe
for bicyclists (grating must be perpendicular or diagonal to the street
centerline).
            5.   Street trees/planting strips: Street trees shall be planted
between the street and the sidewalk for all new development. Trees shall be
planted in planting strips or in tree wells with tree grates located between
the curb and the sidewalk. Street trees shall substitute for required Street
Protective Yard requirements (Section
26-176(e)), except where buildings are set back more than forty (40) feet from
the right-of-way, in which case street trees and Street Protective Yards shall
be required.
               [a]   Shade trees shall be installed at a minimum average
distance of forty (40) feet on-center. Where overhead utilities exist prior to
development, ornamental trees shall be substituted.
               [b]   Planting strips shall have minimum width of six (6) feet
where ornamental trees are to be used and eight (8) feet where shade trees are
required.
               [c]   Trees shall be planted in tree wells with tree grates in
areas of mixed-use development where street frontages contain ground floor
retail uses and on-street parking.
               [d]   A consistent variety and species of street trees shall be
maintained by street, but adjacent streets shall use different species for
variety and as a precaution against blight.
            6.   Outdoor seating. Where uses such as outdoor seating for cafes
and restaurants use the public sidewalk, there shall be a minimum of four (4)
feet of clearance for adequate passing distance by pedestrians.
            7.   Street lighting: Street furnishings in residential and retail
areas shall include decorative, pedestrian-scale street lights no taller than
twelve (12) to eighteen (18) feet.
            8.   Roadway design: The road standards for the CRD Overlay
District may be different from those set forth in Sec. 26-181 of this chapter,
but must be approved by the county engineer during the CRD Overlay District
review process. Reduced roadway widths are encouraged for traffic calming and
due to a pedestrian-oriented approach to travel in a CRD Overlay District.
            9.   Alleys: Alleys are encouraged at the rear of building lots
within the CRD District, except when topography or physical features makes such
alleyways impractical. Dead end alleys are prohibited.
            10.   Street furnishings: Street furnishings shall be included in
the CRD District streetscapes. Such furnishings shall include, but not be
limited to: pedestrian scale decorative street lights, benches, trash cans, and
bicycle parking racks.
            11.   Traffic impact plan: A traffic impact assessment, conducted
by a registered engineer, must accompany a submission for all CRD Overlay
District developments with an estimated trip generation of 3,000 vehicles per
day or greater during an average weekday based on a five day national average
as defined in the ITE Trip Generation Manual. The plan shall analyze the multi-
modal transportation impacts of the proposed development and include proposals
for handling all impacts noted. (Typically, the following developments meet or
exceed the 3,000 vehicles per day threshold: 300 residential units; 55,000
square feet of retail; 250,000 square feet of office space; 350 room hotel.)
            12.   Utilities: To the extent possible, utilities (and associated
pedestals, cabinets, junction boxes, and transformers), including electric,
cable, telephone, and natural gas service, shall be located within alley right-
of-ways, or behind buildings. Domestic water service and sanitary sewer must be
located in such a way to cause the least impact to the streetscape planting
strip and required street trees Unless otherwise approved by the Planning
Commission and the County Council, all utilities shall be placed underground.
   (e)    Site Plan. The CRD site plan shall include all aspects of the spatial
relationships proposed for the development, including:
      (1)   Layout and dimensions of lots, setbacks, roadways, alleys, open
spaces and all information required to define the relationships within the
streetscapes;
      (2)   Street Sections; and
      (3)   Building elevations.
   (f)   Consistency with the Comprehensive Plan. The proposed Redevelopment
Plan Area must be consistent with and compliment the Richland County
Comprehensive Plan, the land use plan, and the capital improvement plan for the
planning area in which it is located. In addition, it is recommended that the
Redevelopment Plan be more clearly defined in the Comprehensive Plan update.
(Ord. No. 019-08HR, § IV, 3-18-08; Ord. No. 038-09HR, § II, 7-21-09; No. 054-
09HR, §§ XXV, XXVI, 11-3-09; Ord. No. 003-12HR, § II, 1-17-12)
Sec. 26-110. DBWP Decker Boulevard/Woodfield Park Neighborhood Redevelopment
Overlay District.
   (a)   Purpose. The DBWP Neighborhood Overlay District is intended to promote
the revitalization of the existing vacant, neglected or abandoned residential
property in this area. This is sought through encouraging the reinvestment in
and reuse of these locations in a manner that promotes the infill for housing,
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for Richland County. This infill
revitalization initiates many housing and economic opportunities and promotes
more socially active and environmentally responsible communities in conjunction
with public, private and community organizations.
   (b)   Applicability/establishment.
      (1)   The DBWP Neighborhood Overlay District may be approved and
designated by County Council for any area within the county that has already
had a Master Plan approved and adopted by the County Council; provided,
however, the standards of such district shall remain optional, as described in
subparagraph (2), below.
      (2)   Once a DBWP Neighborhood Overlay District is applied to a
designated area of the county, the development standards of the underlying
district shall remain in place until such time as a property owner applies to
the Planning and Development Services Department to have the standards of the
DBWP Neighborhood Overlay District apply to his/her property. Only one set of
standards shall apply to any one parcel of land, and a property owner is not
allowed to simultaneously use the development standards of both districts.
   (c)   Permitted uses. In addition to uses permitted in the underlying zone,
the following uses are permitted in the DBWP Neighborhood Overlay District:
      (1)   Residential.
         a.   One single-family detached dwelling and one accessory structure
(which may contain a dwelling unit) per lot is allowed.
         b.   Duets, triplexes, attached single family dwellings, townhomes and
other single and multi-family dwelling units (up to four) that meet required
overlay setback standards [see subsection (e)(1) below].
         c.   Home occupations are allowed if the use is clearly secondary to
the use of the dwelling for residential purposes, and does not change the
residential character of the dwelling.
      (2)   Commercial/employment. Small-scale commercial and mixed use
development is allowed, subject to special standards. Commercial/employment
uses may be mixed vertically or horizontally with residential uses. First floor
space of a multi-floor building (live/work units) shall be restricted to non-
residential use, if such building is located on a corner lot or is on a lot
that is contiguous to a commercial use, in areas of predominately commercial
uses, along Decker Boulevard and where the following roads run northeast to
their intersections with Dupont Drive: Foxcroft Road, Omega Drive, Quiet Lane,
Robin Nest Road, Castle Pinckney Road, Coral Vine Lane, and Cermack Street,
Percival Road, and East Boundary Road.
   All sites shall have frontage onto a collector or arterial street. Hours of
operation shall be limited from 6:00 am to 10:00 pm. The uses displayed below
and individually listed in Table 26-V-0 are permitted, with the exception that
an individual use shall not exceed one thousand to five thousand (1,000 -
5,000) square feet in gross floor area:
         a.   Daytime child care facilities
         b.   Food establishments
         c.   Business, professional and personal services (including specific
repair services)
         d.   Light retail
         e.   Other uses similar to those listed in a.- d., above (subject to
approval by the Planning Staff and Planning Commission).
      (3)   Civic/institutional. Civic or institutional uses listed in table
26-V-0 shall be integrated vertically or horizontally with residential.
Locations are restricted to parcels that exist along streets detailed for
commercial/employment use.
   (d)   Minimum lot area: 5,400 square feet, or as determined by DHEC, but in
no case shall it be less than 5,400 square feet.
   (e)   Design standards. Design standards are adopted to ensure the physical
character of projects within the DBWP and to allow the optional development and
redevelopment of land consistent with current neighborhood character, along
with a traditional neighborhood design approach, to guide this district under
smart growth principles.
      (1)   Compact design. In order to create a compact design that encourages
the Traditional Neighborhood Design (TND) approach, the following standards of
density and dimensions will be included in any DBWP proposal. The setbacks for
residential dwelling units and mixed residential development (excluding open
spaces) shall be determined as follows:
         a.   Building setback, front.
            1.   Single-family detached residences shall have a building
setback with a minimum of ten (10) feet and a maximum of fifteen (15) feet.
            2.   Single-family attached residences, multi-family residences,
and mixed use buildings shall have a building setback with a minimum of five
(5) feet and a maximum of ten (10) feet; provided, however, if the building is
on a major arterial road, a ten (10) foot setback is required.
         b.   Building setback, rear - residential. The principal building on
lots devoted to any residential use, including mixed-use, shall be setback no
less than five (5) feet from the rear lot line.
         c.   Side setbacks.
            1.   Provisions (through plan review) for zero lot-line single-
family and multi-family dwellings shall be made, provided that a reciprocal
access easement is recorded for both lots and townhouses or other attached
dwellings, and provided that all dwellings have pedestrian access to the rear
yard through means other than the principal structure.
            2.   Mixed uses require a side setback at a minimum of five (5)
feet between parcels.
         d.   Green space.
            1.   Green space shall be required regardless if the residential
use is located in an existing, expanded, or new structure.
            2.   The amount of green space must encompass at least ten percent
(10%) of the effective lot area.
      (2)   Architectural standards for new structures. A variety of
architectural features and building materials is encouraged to give each
building or group of buildings a distinct character that is consistent with the
maintained existing DBWP housing stock and blends TND techniques.
         a.    Guidelines for new structures.
            1.   Height. New structures within the DBWP district shall be no
more than three (3) stories for single-family residential, or five (5) stories
for multi-family residential, or mixed use.
         Exceptions: If the multi-family or mixed-use development is located
adjacent to residentially designated parcels and the maximum building height
allowed for the commercial district exceeds that allowed for the adjacent
residential district, the maximum building height shall be fifty-two (52) feet.
For those areas of parcels within fifty (50) feet of any property with a
general plan density designation of ten units per acre or less, the building
massing shall step down to thirty (30) feet to address the scale of the
adjacent development.
            2.   Entries and facades.
               [a]   The architectural features, materials, and the
articulation of a facade of a building shall be continued on all sides visible
from a public street or courtyard.

be located on the front and/or side of the building. Usable front porches are
at least six (6) feet deep and twelve (12) feet in width.
               [f]    Raised entries are required to provide privacy, all
residential entrances within fifteen (15) feet of the sidewalk shall be raised
from the finished grade (at the building line) a minimum of 1 1/2 feet.
               [g]   For multi-family and multi-use buildings, a minimum of
fifteen percent (15%) of the front facade on the ground floor shall be
transparent, consisting of window or door openings allowing views into and out
of the interior.
            3.   Design requirements. In order to encourage the compatibility
of new infill duplex and attached single-family development with the
surrounding neighborhood, all new infill shall utilize at least (4) of the
following design features:
               [a]   Dormers.
               [b]   Recessed entries.

         b.   Garages and accessory dwelling units. One (1) detached garage
(that may or may not include a dwelling unit) or one (1) detached accessory
dwelling unit may be placed on a single-family detached residential lot,
provided that the accessory dwelling unit shall not exceed eight hundred (800)
square feet and is set off to the side or back of the principal building.
         c.   Exterior signage. A comprehensive sign program is required for
the entire DBWP Neighborhood Overlay District to establish a uniform theme.
Signs shall share a common style (e.g., size, shape, material). In the mixed-
use area, signs shall be wall signs or cantilever signs. Cantilever signs shall
be mounted perpendicular to the building face and shall not exceed two (2)
square feet. Wall signs shall be sized and placed to fit within the character
of the architectural elements.
         d.   Parking requirements. On-street parking shall count toward any
minimum parking requirements.
            1.   In residential areas, parking may be provided on-site. One (1)
off-street parking space with unrestricted ingress and egress shall be provided
for each dwelling unit.
            2.   Multi-family residential development must provide one (1)
parking space for every dwelling unit and an additional one (1) parking space

located at the rear or side of a building. The parking lot shall not exceed a
maximum depth of sixty-two (62) feet, (two-way aisle with parking on both
sides), not including required landscaping. If located at the side, screening
shall be provided as specified in Landscaping and Screening Standards.
            4.   Access for service vehicles should provide a direct route to
service and loading dock areas, while avoiding movement through parking areas
and roads throughout the district.
            5.   All parking over the minimum requirements shall be paved with
pervious paving material. The reduction of impervious surfaces through the use
of interlocking pavers is required for parking areas of periodic uses.
            6.    Joint use parking. Where at least two (2) uses either within
a mixed use development or on adjacent parcels that each require parking, have
different peak parking demands during different times of the day, shared
parking is required. Where this is applied, the landscaping requirements may be
reduced by five percent (5%). Shared parking shall meet the requirements of
Section
26-173(e)(2).
      (3)   Bicycle parking. Bicycle parking for all non-residential uses and
for residential uses of more than four (4) units per building is required. A

surroundings. In general, larger, well-placed contiguous planting areas shall
be preferred to smaller, disconnected areas.
         a.   General screening. Where screening is required by section 26-176
of this chapter, it shall be at least three (3) feet in height, unless
otherwise specified. Required screening shall be at least fifty percent (50%)
opaque throughout the year.
         b.   Street trees. A minimum of one (1) deciduous tree, with full
maturity between twenty to forty (20-40) feet in height, per thirty (30) feet
of street frontage, or fraction thereof, shall be required. Trees should
preferably be located between the sidewalk and the curb, within the landscaped
area of a boulevard, or in tree wells installed in pavement or concrete. If
placement of street trees within the right-of-way will interfere with utility
lines, trees may be planted within the front yard setback adjacent to the
sidewalk. Species of trees as well as the planting standards are located in the
Richland County Development Design Manual.
         c.   Landscaping. All areas of a site not occupied by buildings,
required parking, driveways, walkways or service areas shall be landscaped
according to an approved landscape plan in accordance with section 26-176 of
this chapter.
         d.   Installation and maintenance of landscaping materials.

Sec. 26-111. CC Crane Creek Neighborhood District.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of the Crane Creek Neighborhood District (CC) is
to implement the policies and goals of the adopted Crane Creek Master Plan, and
to:
      (1)   Improve the image of the Crane Creek community;
      (2)   Preserve existing single-family neighborhoods;
      (3)   Develop local retail services and limit industrial zone expansion;
      (4)   Create a walkable community with viable pedestrian and bike trails;
      (5)   Increase community recreational facilities; and
      (6)   Preserve existing wetlands and create a community open space
network.
   (b)   Applicability/Establishment. The CC Crane Creek Neighborhood District,
through the use of CC Neighborhood District sub-districts, may be approved and
designated by County Council for that area of the county that is within the
Crane Creek Neighborhood Master Plan, such plan having been adopted by the
County Council. The provisions of this Section shall apply to all parcels of
land and rights of way, or portions thereof, within the boundaries of the CC
Neighborhood District. No change in the boundary of the CC Neighborhood
District shall be authorized, except by the County Council, pursuant to
procedures in Section
26-52.
   (c)   CC districts. The CC Neighborhood District contains four (4)
additional sub-district classifications designed to meet the development goals
for unique zones within the district. These sub-districts are categorized by
the mixture and intensity of uses allowed. Each of these sub-districts is
subject to unique form-based design standards.
      (1)   Requirements. Development in the CC sub-districts shall conform to
the standards in the subsections that follow. Each sub-district has detailed
provisions for uses, building type and design, density, height, the design of
public spaces, the mix of uses, and other aspects of the built environment.
      (2)   Sub-district classification.
         a.   CC-I, Residential: The CC-1 sub-district permits the development
of residential communities that conserve the natural and environmentally
sensitive features within the Crane Creek Master Plan area.
         b.   CC-2, Neighborhood Mixed Use: The CC-2 sub-district permits a
mixture of uses that create a land use transition between existing residential
neighborhoods and potential commercial areas that abut this area. The zone
allows a variety of building types, including civic/institutional, townhouses,
detached single-family housing, loft dwelling units, and commercial/office with
encouragement of mixed-use buildings that meet a variety of daily needs of
residents in surrounding neighborhoods.
         c.   CC-3, Activity Center Mixed Use: The CC-3 sub-district permits
higher density mixed-use buildings than CC-2. The zone allows a variety of
building types, including civic/institutional, loft dwelling units, townhouses,
and detached single-family housing, and commercial/office, with encouragement
of mixed-use buildings that serve the larger community and are appropriate for
an activity center.
         d.   CC-4, Industrial: The CC-4 sub-district minimizes the potential
negative impacts of existing and future industrial uses on adjacent land uses
by encouraging additions or enhancements to site buffers, landscaping, open
space, and other site elements. This sub-district is intended to accommodate
wholesaling, distribution, storage, processing, and light manufacturing which
are controlled operations that are relatively clean, quiet, and free of
objectionable or hazardous elements, such as smoke, noise, odor or dust. In
addition, such uses operate and/or have storage within open or enclosed
structures, and generate no nuisances.
         e.   Site Plan Review. All site development plan applications shall be
accompanied with materials required by the Zoning Administrator in Section
26-53 for major land development, as well as these additional items:
            1.   A Shared Parking Analysis for use of shared parking, if
applicable. See Section
26-111(d)(9)b.1. of this document for requirements.
            2.   A Signage Master Plan. For all multi-tenant or multi-owner
commercial or mixed use developments greater than twenty-five thousand (25,000)
gross square feet, a signage master plan shall be submitted, reviewed and
approved at the time of review of the site development plan. See Section
26-111(d)(10) a. of this document for specific standards. The signage master
plan shall include the following information:
               [a]   The location of each proposed sign and existing sign that
is to remain, and a table indicating the location, type, height, and sign area
of each sign.
               [b]   A computation of the maximum permitted number of signs,
maximum permitted total sign area, and maximum permitted area for individual
signs permitted under this Section.
               [c]   A computation, excluding window signs and incidental
signs, of the total proposed number of signs and the total sign area of such
signs.
         f.   Site Plan Review. Review of the site plan shall be consistent
with the procedures for major land development review as provided in Section
26-53.

      (11)   Open Space Standards.
         a.   Categories of open space. Open space is required in all CC sub-
districts and shall consist of any of the following categories of land:
            1.   Primary Conservation Areas. Primary Conservation Areas include
streams, required stream buffers, wetlands designated by the National Wetlands
Inventory, 100-year floodplain, slopes exceeding twenty-five percent (25%),
areas of exposed rock, and private cemeteries and burial grounds. These areas
shall be left in a natural and undisturbed state, except for the fewest
perpendicular crossings of essential access roads, pedestrian pathways, multi-
use trails, and utility lines.
            2.   Secondary Conservation Areas. Secondary Conservation Areas
include land in water supply watersheds, aquifer recharge areas identified in
the Richland County Comprehensive Plan, riparian and wetland buffers exceeding
the minimum required width, slopes exceeding fifteen percent (15%), significant
habitat areas as identified in the Richland County Comprehensive Plan, soils
unsuitable for septic tanks, prime agricultural soils, mature hardwood forest,
meadows, farm fields, pastures, and other areas of scenic value.
            3.   Active Recreation Area. Active recreation areas include
greenways, trails, bikeways, paths, tennis, volleyball, handball, squash, bocce
and basketball courts, ball fields, tracks, golf courses, swimming pools,
clubhouses, equestrian facilities, beaches, docks, amphitheaters, stages, band
shells, walkways, public squares, public lawns, picnic shelters and areas, open
landscaped areas, and other land containing outdoor recreation features and
facilities as determined by the Zoning Administrator. Lakes and ponds are
allowed in outdoor recreation areas, but shall not be counted as open space.
         b.   Open space design standards.
            1.   All primary conservation areas of a site shall be set aside as
open space and shall meet the requirements of the Richland County Conservation
Overlay District (Section
26-105).
            2.   A density bonus shall be provided for multi-use trail
development as provided in Section
26-111(d)(12).
            3.   Secondary conservation areas shall be set aside as open space
to the maximum degree possible.
            4.   No more than fifty percent (50%) of required open space may
consist of primary conservation areas.
            5.   A minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) of required open space
shall be used for passive parks, greenways, trails, squares, or greens, and
shall be open to the general public.
            6.   No more than ten percent (10%) of required open space may be
areas of impervious surface.
            7.   At least fifty percent (50%) of required open space within a
single development shall be located in a contiguous tract.
            8.   Interconnected Open Space Network. It is the intent of this
subparagraph b. that the protected conservation areas, open spaces, greenways,
bikeways, trails, sidewalks and outdoor recreation areas within a development
that provide open space be continuous with compatible areas containing similar
features on abutting property. The design of developments shall provide for
maximum connections, providing pedestrian and bike access to off-site and on-
site attractions, such as public trails, paths, parks, wildlife refuges, public
facilities (such as community centers, schools, libraries, fire and police
stations, senior centers, and utility easements), and institutions (such as
churches, museums, and other cultural facilities).
            9.   Each open space area must comprise an area of at least five
hundred (500) square feet with a minimum dimension of twenty (20) feet of width
or depth.
            10.   Best Management Practices (BMPs). Active recreation areas,
such as golf courses, playing fields, swimming pools and tennis courts, shall
employ applicable BMPs and shall not be permitted in primary conservation
areas.
         c.   Public seating. It is the intent of this Subsection (11) to
provide open space areas that promote a walkable environment and interaction
among community members. The provision of both formal and informal public
seating amenities is encouraged. Park benches, movable chairs and tables, and
seating in the form of garden walls and monumental stairs are encouraged in
open spaces, subject to approval by the Zoning Administrator.
         d.   Ownership, Maintenance and Control of Open Space. Open space
within a development shall be held in unitary ownership or control and be
perpetually administered and maintained by one (1) or a combination of the
methods below:
            1.   Fee simple dedication. Open space within developments may be
offered for dedication to the public at the time of application. The county
may, but shall not be required to, accept undivided open space.
            2.   Property owners’ association. The undivided open space and
associated facilities may be held in common ownership by an association of
property owners. Membership in the association shall be mandatory for all
purchasers of property and their successors. The association shall be
responsible for administration of common facilities and property and shall
permanently maintain the undivided open space.
            3.   Private conservation organization. The owner of open space may
transfer easements to a land trust or other conservation-oriented, nonprofit
organization with legal authority to accept such easements, subject to approval
of the Zoning Administrator.
         e.   Maintenance of Open Space. Open space areas shall be maintained
in a manner that prevents them from being nuisances to health or safety.
            1.   Open spaces shall be kept free from the accumulation of litter
and debris.
            2.   Landscaped areas shall be kept free from dead or diseased
trees and other vegetation.
            3.   Hardscaped areas and appliances, such as recreational
equipment and fountains, shall be maintained deeming them suitable for their
intended uses and so as to be free of hazards.
         f.   Liens by Richland County. In the event that the party responsible
for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain all or any portion of such
area as enumerated, upon ninety (90) days notice served to the owner, Richland
County may assume responsibility for the maintenance and may enter the premises
and take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance.
The costs of said corrective action and maintenance by Richland County may be
charged to the owner, property owners’ association, or to the individual
property owners that make up the property owners’ association and may included
administrative costs and penalties. Such costs shall become a lien on the
owners’ properties until paid in full.
      (12)   Bonus Density Incentives. It is the intention of this subsection
to promote superior performance in the conservation of open space and natural
resources, creation of mixed use development, and the provision of public
services, including but not limited to, the dedication of public land and
construction of multi-use trails consistent with the Crane Creek Master Plan.
As such, the developer shall be entitled to additional density of use, in
addition to that otherwise allowed, as provided in the table that follows:
 
Site Feature*                           Authorized Bonus Density**
a. Multi-use trail is provided that is  One dwelling unit or 1,000 square feet
consistent with the Proposed            of commercial space per 100 yards of
Circulation Plan in the Crane Creek     trail.

beyond that which is required.          percent of gross acreage of tract that
                                        is not in a primary conservation area.
c. Dedication of land for public
facilities other than roads and         Additional four dwelling units or 5,000
required open spaces, such as a school, square feet of commercial space per
fire station, library, senior center,   acre of dedicated land.
park, or other use approved by the
Planning Commission.
* Developments qualifying for a multi-use trail density bonus under both a. and
b. shall only be awarded a bonus for trail space under either a. or b., but not
both.
** Maximum densities listed in Section
26-111(d)(5) shall apply.
 
   (e)   Permitted Uses and Permitted Uses with Special Requirements for the CC
Neighborhood District.
      (1)   General. The Table of Permitted Uses and Permitted Uses with
Special Requirements for the CC Neighborhood District that follows, contains a
listing of uses that may be permitted in one or more of the various sub-
districts. Uses are listed in ten (10) functional categories. The categories in
order of their listing are: residential uses; accessory uses and structures;
recreational uses; institutional, educational and civic uses; business,
professional and personal services; retail trade and food services; wholesale
trade; transportation, information, warehousing, waste management, and
utilities; manufacturing, mining, and industrial uses; and other uses. If a use
is not listed, then the use is NOT permitted.
      (2)   Symbols used. The districts in which a particular use is permitted
(with or without special requirements), are indicated by a “P” or “SR” in the
sub-district column(s) opposite the listed use.
      (3)   Meaning of symbols. The meaning of the symbols in the Table of
Permitted Uses, Permitted Uses with Special Requirements, and Special
Exceptions for the CC Neighborhood District are as follows:
         a.   P. Means the indicated use is permitted in the indicated sub-
district.
         b.   SR. Means the indicated use is permitted provided special
additional standards set forth in this Section are met. These standards are
contained in Section
26-111(e)(7).
      (4)   North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The North
American Industry Classification System. United States Manual - 2002 Edition
(NAICS) was utilized in the preparation of the Table of Permitted Uses,
Permitted Uses with Special Requirements, and Special Exceptions for the CC
Neighborhood District. The listing of the numerical references (in the NAICS)
utilized is found in Appendix I. This listing and the 2002 NAICS manual shall
be consulted as a guide for the purpose of interpretation by the Zoning
Administrator when necessary. The NAICS number in the appendix refers to the
corresponding NAICS classification for that particular use. Listings with a
“000000” in the NAICS column do not correspond to any classification manual,
but rather are identified uses of local significance.
      (5)   Relationship to other laws. The listing of a use in the Table of
Permitted Uses and Permitted Uses with Special Requirements for the CC
Neighborhood District in no way relieves that use of having to meet all local,
state, and federal laws pertaining to the establishment and operation of that
use.
      (6)   Table of Permitted Uses and Permitted Uses with Special
Requirements for the CC Neighborhood District. See Table below:

Sec. 26-131. Table of Area, Yard, and Height Requirements.
   (a)   General. The Table of Area, Yard, and Height Requirements, found in
this section contains a listing of the principal development standards for the
general use zoning districts. Standards are listed for minimum lot area,
minimum lot width, structure size, setback, and height. Reference should be
made to the specific use district regulations found in Sections
26-84 through
26-101 of this chapter for the complete listings of applicable development
standards for each district. Standards for the PDD, TC, RD, CRD, DBWP, and CC
districts are not listed in this table since developments in these districts
are regulated primarily through the development review
process. Development within overlay districts, unless otherwise specified,
generally adheres to the requirements for the underlying general use zoning
district.
   (b)   Table of area, yard, and height requirements. The table (Table 26-V-1)
below lists the general dimensional and area requirements for the zoning
districts set forth in this article. See also the subsections for each district
for additional detailed dimensional and area requirements.

Sec. 26-141. Table of Permitted Uses, Permitted Uses with Special Requirements,
and Special Exceptions.
   (a)   General. The Table of Permitted Uses, Permitted Uses with Special
Requirements, and Special Exceptions that follows, contains a listing of uses
that may be permitted in one or more of the various zoning districts
established by this article. Uses are listed in alphabetical order in eleven
functional categories. The categories in order of their listing are:
agricultural uses; residential uses; accessory uses and structures;
recreational uses; institutional, educational and civic uses; business,
professional and personal services; retail trade and food services; wholesale
trade; transportation, information, warehousing, waste management, and
utilities; manufacturing, mining, and industrial uses; and, other uses.
   (b)   Symbols used. The districts in which a particular use is permitted
(with or without special requirements), are indicated by a "P", "SR", or "SE"
in the district column(s) opposite the listed use. Blank spaces in the district
column under any proposed use indicates that the use is NOT permitted in that
particular zoning district.
   (c)   Meaning of symbols. The meaning of the symbols in the Table of
Permitted Uses, Permitted Uses with Special Requirements, and Special
Exceptions are as follows:
      (1)   P. Means the indicated use is permitted in the indicated district.
      (2)   SR. Means the indicated use is permitted provided special
additional standards set forth in this chapter are met. These standards are
contained in Article VI., Supplemental Use Standards.
      (3)   SE. Means the indicated use is permitted in the indicated district,
subject to approval of a special exception by the board of zoning appeals
(Section
26-56 of this chapter). Minimum conditions that must be met in order for the
board to grant a special exception are listed in Article VI., Supplemental Use
Standards.
   (d)   North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The North
American Industry Classification System, United States Manual - 2002 Edition
(NAICS) was utilized in the preparation of the Table of Permitted Uses,
Permitted Uses with Special Requirements, and Special Exceptions. The listing
of the numerical references (in the NAICS) utilized is  found in Appendix I.
This listing and the 2002 NAICS manual shall be consulted as a guide for the
purpose of interpretation by the zoning administrator when necessary. The NAICS
number in the appendix refers to the corresponding NAICS classification for
that particular use. Listings with a "000000" in the NAICS column do not
correspond to any classification manual, but rather are identified uses of
local significance.
   (e)   Relationship to other laws. The listing of a use in the Table of
Permitted Uses, Permitted Uses with Special Requirements, and Special
Exceptions in no way relieves that use of having to meet all local, state, and
federal laws pertaining to the establishment and operation of that use.
   (f)   Table of Permitted Uses, Permitted Uses with Special Requirements, and
Special Exceptions. See Table 26-V-2.

oriented businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of Richland County, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent or reduce to any extent the secondary effects of
sexually oriented businesses within the County. The provisions of this
subsection have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or
restriction on the content of or reasonable access to any communicative
materials or expression. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of
these regulations to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented
materials or expression protected by the First Amendment of the United States
Constitution, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually
oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this subsection to condone or legitimize the distribution or
exhibition of obscenity.
            2.   Based on evidence of the adverse secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses presented in hearings and reports made available to the
Richland County Council, and on the findings, interpretations, and narrowing
constructions incorporated in the cases of City of Littleton v. Z.J. Gifts D-4,
LLC, 124 S. Ct. 2219 (2003); City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, Inc., 535
U.S. 425 (2002); Pap's A.M. v. City of Erie, 529 U.S. 277 (2000); City of
Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986); Young v. American Mini
Theatres, 427 U.S. 50 (1976); Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560
(1991); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); Chesapeake B&M, Inc. v.
Harford County, 58 F.3d 1005 (4th Cir. 1995); Giovani Carandola, Ltd. v. Fox,
470 F.3d 1074 (4th Cir. 2006); Centaur v. Richland County, 392 S.E.2d 165 (S.C.
1990); and other cases; and on reports of secondary effects occurring in and
around sexually oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, Phoenix,
Arizona (1979); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1980); Houston, Texas (1987);
Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); Amarillo, Texas (1977); Garden Grove, California
(1991); Los Angeles, California (1977); Whittier, California (1978); Austin,
Texas (1986); Seattle, Washington (1989); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); El
Paso, Texas (1986); New York City, New York (1994); Dallas, Texas (1997);
Newport News, Virginia (1996); New York Times Square Study (1994); Phoenix,
Arizona (1995-1998); Greensboro, North Carolina (2003); Toledo, Ohio (2002);
Centralia, Washington (2004); and also from the reports of Sexually Oriented
Businesses: An Insider's View, by David Sherman, presented to the Michigan
House Committee on Ethics and Constitutional Law, January 12, 2000; Survey of
Appraisers Fort Worth & Dallas, Effects of Land Uses on Surrounding Property
Values, by Duncan Associates, September 2004; and the Report of the Attorney
General's Working Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses,
(June 6, 1989, State of Minnesota), the Richland County Council finds:
            (a)   Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial
uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects
including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, public safety
risks, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency,
illicit sexual activity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative
impacts on surrounding properties, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
            (b)   Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes
a harm which the County has a substantial government interest in preventing
and/or abating in the future. This substantial government interest in
preventing secondary effects, which is the County's rationale for this
ordinance, exists independent of any comparative analysis between sexually
oriented and non-sexually oriented businesses. Additionally, the County's
interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to future secondary
effects that could occur in the County related to current sexually oriented
businesses in the future as well as sexually oriented businesses that may
locate in the County in the future. The County Council finds that the cases and
secondary effects documentation relied on in this ordinance are reasonably
believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

Sec. 26-152. Special exceptions.
   (a)   Purpose. Special exceptions are uses that are generally compatible
with the land uses permitted in a particular zoning district. However, because
of their unique characteristics or their potential impacts on the surrounding
neighborhood and/or the county as a whole, they require individual
consideration of their location, design, configuration, and/or operation at the
particular location being proposed. Such individual consideration may also call
for the imposition of individualized conditions in order to ensure that the use
is appropriate at a particular location and to ensure protection of the public
health, safety, and welfare.
   (b)   Conditions. All special exceptions shall, at a minimum, meet the
conditions set forth in this section. The Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve
or deny an application for a special exception (see also Section
26-56 of this chapter) based on the following:
      (1)   A determination that all standards for the particular use, as
defined in this article and in other relevant sections of this chapter, have
been met.
      (2)   A finding that the special exception is in harmony with the intent
and purpose of this chapter. In making this determination, the board shall
consider the following:
         a.   Traffic impacts.
         b.   Vehicle and pedestrian safety.
         c.   Potential impact of noise, lights, fumes, or obstruction of
airflow on adjoining properties.
         d.   Adverse impact of the proposed use on the aesthetic character of
the environs, to include the possible need for screening from view.
         e.   Orientation and spacing of improvements or buildings.
   In granting a special exception, the board may impose such additional
restrictions and requirements as it may deem necessary in order that the
purpose and intent of this chapter are served.

Secs. 26-153 - 26-170. Reserved.
ARTICLE VII. GENERAL DEVELOPMENT, SITE, AND PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Sec. 26-171. General.
   (a)   Purpose. This article sets forth standards for land development in the
unincorporated areas of Richland County, South Carolina, concerning a variety
of different development issues. These standards are designed to ensure the
compatibility of development within the county and to implement the policies
found in the county’s comprehensive plan. The applicability of the standards
set forth in this article may vary based on the use, location, and zoning
district (as set forth in this chapter). The criteria set forth in this
article, as with all other requirements, must be satisfied before an
application for development will be approved.
   (b)   Buffers. All required and/or approved buffers, provided from existing
vegetation and/or an approved landscape plan, for a project, shall not be
disturbed, and trees and shrubs shall be preserved by the owner.
   (c)   Common areas and open space. All required and/or approved common
areas, open space, recreation areas, and planted and/or vegetative areas shall
be preserved as such and shall not change to another use unless plans are
submitted to and approved by the Development Review Team.
   (d)   Utilities. Prior to the installation of utility lines and related
appurtenances, unless within the approved limits of clearing and noted on
approved plans, the utility provider shall submit plans to the planning
department and a land disturbance permit and land development permit issued
pursuant to the requirements of Sections
26-53,
26-54 and
26-64(a).
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04; Ord. No. 019-09HR, § I, 3-17-09)
Sec. 26-172. Density and dimensional standards.
   (a)   Number of principal buildings per lot.
      (1)   General. The number of principal buildings allowed on an individual
lot is limited as set forth in Article V. of this chapter.
      (2)   Single-family dwellings. There shall be no more than one single-
family dwelling on an individual lot in a single-family residential zoning
district except for permitted accessory dwellings.
   (b)   Required setbacks; allowable encroachment into required setbacks.
      (1)   General. No building, structure, or land shall be used or occupied
and no building structure or part thereof shall be erected, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or altered unless it meets the minimum setback
requirements established in Article V. for the use or overlay district in which
it is located, except as otherwise established in this chapter.
      (2)   Method of calculation.
         a.   Minimum setback. Minimum setback is the space defined by
measuring perpendicularly from and along the entire boundary of the lot
(property line) to the building line. A setback may be a front, side, or rear
setback.
         b.   Overlap of setbacks. When more than one setback depth applies,
the greatest setback dimension requirement must be met.
      (3)   Setbacks for lots with more than one road frontage. Structures
shall meet the front yard requirements for all sides of the structure abutting
public roads. Where one (1) of the front yards that would normally be required
on a through lot is not in keeping with the prevailing yard pattern, the zoning
administrator may waive the requirement for the normal front yard. In its
place, a special yard requirement shall be determined as specified in
subsection (4) below.
      (4)   Adjusting building lines. Where there are lots that comprise fifty
percent (50%) or more of the lots on the same side of the block as the lot in
question which are developed with less than the required road setbacks, the
average setback of the two (2) principal buildings nearest the lot in question
shall be observed as the minimum front yard setback.
      (5)   Projections into required yards. The general definition of yards is
set forth in Section
26-22 of this chapter. However, the general definition will be construed
subject to the following exceptions and interpretations:
         a.   Objects specifically excluded. Those objects that are
specifically excluded from the definition of a structure under Section
26-22 shall not be subject to regulation as an interpretation of the definition
of yard.
         b.   Steps and open porches. Steps and open porches without roofs
shall be allowed in any required yard to within five (5) feet of an adjoining
property line. Decks, whether covered or uncovered, do not fall within this
exemption and must meet all applicable yard requirements.
         c.   Screening or retaining walls and fences.  Screening or retaining
walls and fences may be permitted in a required yard upon the determination of
the planning department that the fence or wall:
            1.   Does not impede site vision clearance for driveways or roads.
            2.   Does not include gates that swing outward into sidewalks or
public rights-of-way.
            3.   Front yard fences may not exceed four (4) feet in height.
            4.   Fences and walls shall not exceed seven (7) feet in height
when located in the required side and rear yards; provided, however, retaining
walls are excluded from this limitation.
         d.   Architectural features. Eaves, cornices, gutters, or other minor
architectural features projecting less than twenty-four (24) inches from the
main portion of a building shall be allowed to project into any yard.
         e.   Canopy/awning projections. Canopies or awnings covering windows,
doors, or other openings of commercial or industrial uses shall be allowed to
project forty-eight (48) inches into required front yards provided they do not
constitute a substantial impediment to visibility across such yards which would
contribute to the creation of a traffic hazard, and further that such
projection would not interfere with public use of any adjacent sidewalk and/or
public road.
         f.   Service station and convenience store canopy projections. Service
station and convenience store gasoline island canopies may be located in the
front yard setback, provided that no equipment or part of the canopy is located
closer than fifteen (15) feet to a road right-of-way line.
         g.   At-grade impervious surfaces. At-grade impervious surfaces, such
as patios, shall be allowed to encroach into the side or rear yards. In no
case, shall such surfaces be located closer than five (5) feet to a side or
rear property line. Driveways are not included in this category and may
encroach upon front side or rear yards.
   (c)   Height restrictions.
      (1)   General. For the purpose of this chapter, the height of a building
shall be measured from the average finished ground elevation at the base of the
structure to the highest point of the roof of the structure.
      (2)   Exceptions. Spires, belfries, cupolas, chimneys, water tanks,
ventilators, elevator housings, mechanical equipment, or other structures
placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy shall not be
subject to height limitations. Antennas on buildings are subject to height
requirements.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04; Ord. No. 012-16HR, § I, 3-15-16)
Sec. 26-173. Off-street parking standards.
   (a)   General requirements. Permanent off-street parking is required in all
districts unless otherwise specified. Such parking shall be provided in the
amount required by this section at the time of erection, alteration,
enlargement, establishment, or change in any building or land use. Any permit
application submitted to the planning department shall include information as
to the location and dimensions of off- street parking and the means of ingress
and egress to such space.
   (b)   Parking requirements for a change in use. If a change in use causes an
increase in the required number of off-street parking, stacking, or loading
spaces, such additional spaces shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of this section. However, if a change in use would require an
increase of less than five percent (5%) of the required number of parking
spaces, or less than five (5) spaces, no additional off-street parking shall be
required.
   (c)   Number of spaces required. The requirements for off-street parking are
set forth in the table below. The number of spaces required will be rounded to
the nearest whole number. For uses not covered in this table, the parking
requirements shall be those of the most similar use as determined by the zoning
administrator.

   (d)   Design of parking areas. See also Section
26-176(g) of this chapter concerning vehicular surface area landscaping.
      (1)   Paving and general design.
         a.   General. Off-street parking areas developed to meet the minimum
requirements of this chapter shall be properly graded, marked, and improved
lots or within parking structures.
         b.   Paving material. Parking areas for all projects, except single-
family detached and two-family dwellings, shall be improved and maintained with
such material of sufficient thickness and consistency to support anticipated
volume and weights. Porous paving blocks and pervious paving materials are
permitted and encouraged as material for parking lots. The use of grass as a
parking lot surface is permitted for overflow parking.
         c.   Border barricades. Except in a single- family detached dwelling,
a rail, fence, curb, or other continuous barricade sufficient to retain the
parked vehicles completely within the property shall be provided, except at the
entrance and exit drives.
         d.   Entrances and exits. The location and design of all entrances and
exits shall be designed in accordance with the county regulations on traffic
engineering. No entrance or exit point for a nonresidential use that is not
permitted in an adjacent residential district shall be located within fifteen
(15) feet of a lot within the adjacent residential zoning district.
      (2)   Maneuvering space.
         a.   General. All off-street parking areas, with the exception of
parking areas for single-family detached, two-family dwellings, and townhouses,
shall be so designed that vehicles will not be required to back onto a public
road when leaving the premises. All parking areas shall be designed so that
there is sufficient area for access to all parking spaces and safe maneuvering
within the parking area.
         b.   Aisle widths. The minimum aisle widths between parking areas are:
            1.   Ninety (90)-degree parking - Twenty-five (25 feet)
            2.   Sixty (60)-degree parking - Twenty (20) feet
            3.   Forty-five (45)-degree parking - Fifteen (15) feet
   (3)   Size of spaces. The minimum size of one parking space shall be nine
(9) feet in width and eighteen (18) feet in depth; provided, however, up to
twenty-five percent (25%) of the total parking provided may consist of compact
parking spaces, which shall be a minimum of eight (8) feet in width and sixteen
(16) feet in depth. All parallel parking spaces shall be nine (9) feet in width
by twenty-six (26) feet in depth. See subsection (4) below for standards for
accessible parking spaces.
      (4)   Accessible spaces. Where parking is provided, accessible parking
spaces shall be provided in accordance with the requirements set forth in this
subsection.
         a.   Number of spaces. The required number of accessible parking
spaces shall be provided in accordance with the following table:

         b.   Location. Accessible parking spaces shall be located on the
shortest accessible route of travel from adjacent parking to an accessible
building entrance. In parking facilities that do not serve a particular
building, accessible parking spaces shall be located on the shortest route to
an accessible pedestrian entrance to the parking facility. Where buildings have
multiple accessible entrances with adjacent parking, accessible parking spaces
shall be dispersed and located near the accessible entrances.
         c.   Size of accessible spaces. Accessible parking spaces shall be
ninety-six (96) inches wide minimum and shall have an adjacent access aisle
complying with subsection d. below.
         d.   Access aisle. Parking access aisles shall be part of the
accessible route to the building and shall be provided for all accessible
spaces provided in a parking area. Two (2) parking spaces shall be permitted to
share a common access aisle. Access aisles shall be marked so as to discourage
parking in them.
            1.   Width. Van-accessible spaces require a minimum ninety-six
(96)-inch wide access aisle. All other accessible spaces shall require a
minimum sixty (60)-inch wide access aisle.
            2.   Length. Access aisles shall extend the full length of the
parking spaces they serve.
         e.   Floor or ground surfaces and clearance.  Parking spaces and
access aisles shall have surface slopes not steeper than 1:50. Access aisles
shall be at the same level of the parking spaces they serve.
         f.   Signage. Accessible parking spaces shall be identified by signs
including the International Symbol of Accessibility. Van-accessible spaces
shall have a sign designating them as van-accessible.
   (e)   Location of off-street parking. Required off- street parking shall be
provided on the same parcel as the principal structure or use, unless otherwise
set forth in this chapter or unless shared or remote parking is provided as set
forth below:
      (1)   Remote parking. If the off-street parking spaces required by this
section cannot be reasonably provided on the same lot on which the principal
use is located, such space may be provided on any land within four hundred
(400) feet of the principal use. Where such remote parking is utilized to
fulfill parking requirements, the owner or authorized agent for the land upon
which such remote parking is located shall restrict the use of such parking
area for parking only in connection with the use or structure for which such
remote parking is provided. Such restriction shall be recorded by a declaration
of restrictions properly filed with the Register of Deeds for Richland County,
which may be released only with written consent of the county. Remote parking
for a use shall not be established in any district that does not allow that
use.
      (2)   Shared parking. Shared parking is encouraged for mixed use
developments where there are at least two (2) uses that customarily have
different peak parking demand characteristics. The planning department may
approve the joint use of the required parking spaces for two (2) or more uses
located on the same parcel or adjacent parcels, provided that the developer can
demonstrate that the uses will not overlap hours of operations or demand for
the same shared spaces. Any sharing of required spaces by uses located on
different parcels shall be guaranteed by written agreement between the owner of
the parking area and the owner of any use located on a different parcel and
served by the parking area. Should the uses change such that the new uses
overlap in hours of operation or demand for the shared spaces, the shared
parking approval shall become void. Parking spaces meeting the requirements of
this section shall then be required. Shared parking for a use shall not be
established in any district that does not allow that use.
   (f)   Parking of recreational vehicles, boats, and travel trailers.
      (1)   Travel or camping vehicles: Not more than one (1) travel or camping
vehicle, per family living on the premises, shall be permitted to be parked on
a lot in any residential zone. The vehicle shall not be parked in the required
front or side yard nor shall any such vehicle be parked or stored in front of
the principal structure on a residentially zoned lot. The vehicle shall not be
occupied temporarily or permanently while it is parked or stored, except in an
authorized recreational vehicle park.
      (2)   Boats or travel trailers: No boat or travel trailer shall be stored
in any required front or side yard of any residentially zoned property nor
shall any boat or travel trailer be stored or parked in front of a principal
structure on a residentially zoned lot.

055-12HR, §§ VIII, IX, 10-16-12; Ord. No. 036-15HR, §§ V, VI, 7-28-15)
Sec. 26-174. Off-street loading requirements.
   (a)   General. Every building or structure hereafter erected and used for
business, trade, or industry shall provide space as indicated herein for the
loading and unloading of vehicles, with access to a public road or alley. Such
space shall be so arranged and marked to provide for orderly and safe loading
and unloading and designed so vehicles shall maneuver for loading and unloading
entirely within the property lines of the parcel or parcel containing the
structure or use.
   (b)   Minimum number of loading spaces required.
      (1)   Retail and service businesses. One (1) space measuring ten (10)
feet by twenty-five (25) feet for each twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of
gross floor area or fraction thereof.
      (2)   Wholesale and industrial uses. Berths measuring ten (10) feet by
fifty (50) feet, as listed in Table 26-VII-3 below:

forth in this section shall have a minimum overhead clearance of fourteen (14)
feet.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-175. Access.
   (a)   General. The standards contained in this section are designed to
ensure that access to development in the unincorporated parts of Richland
County does not impair the public safety and are the minimum necessary to
provide safe access to the adjacent property for both pedestrians and vehicles.
All proposed vehicle access points connecting to a public road shall conform to
the provisions of this section. Pervious materials, and two-track and shared
driveway designs, are allowed and encouraged for driveways.
   (b)   Driveway standards. All driveways shall be constructed in conformance
with the standards described below, and with the applicable portions of Section
26-181(c), regarding visibility at intersections. The term “Land Use Example”

In addition to the requirements described above, the Fire Marshal may require a
secondary access point to any development project.
      (2)   Major land development and major subdivisions. All proposed
parcels, including outparcels, shall be depicted int eh preliminary development
plan documents and access to such parcels shall be limited to internal points
within the project. Access may be limited to a “Right-In, Right-Out”
configuration, as may be deemed necessary.
      (3)   Shared access. The Planning department, with the consent of the
Public Works department, may require shared access agreements among adjacent
parcels, and/or installation of marginal access roads, as well as consolidation
of existing access points, as may be deemed necessary.
      (4)   Medians. The Planning department, with the consent of the Public
Works department, may require installation of raised medians by the applicant
as may be necessary to protect safe vehicular and pedestrian access to adjacent
property.
      (5)   Change of land use. When there is a proposed land use change on a
developed site that affects the amount, type, or intensity of traffic activity,
the Planning department, with the consent of the Public Works department, shall
require written documentation from SCDOT regarding the adequacy of the existing
access point to safely accommodate the traffic generated by the project prior
to issuing a development permit.
   (e)   Exceptions. The Planning department, with the consent of the Public
Works department, may reduce the requirements described above, provided the
applicant can demonstrate that all physically possible alterative development
plans have been considered in an attempt to conform to the requirements and
that any hardship to compliance is not the result of self- imposed actions,
including, but not limited to, the purchase of the subject parcel, the
topography of the site, and/or the geometry of the roadway.

Sec. 26-176. Landscaping standards.
   (a)   Purpose and applicability.
      (1)   Purpose. Recognizing that trees and landscaping contribute to the
public health, safety, and welfare, Richland County has set standards for
landscaping throughout the unincorporated areas of the county. Among the
benefits of trees, shrubs, and other plants are: improved air quality;
beneficial climate modification; reduction of glare, noise, odors and dust;
reduction of storm water runoff and flooding; screening of undesirable views;
provision of buffers between incompatible land uses; shelter and food for birds
and other wildlife; and the aesthetic enjoyment provided by the diversity and
dynamism of the planted landscape. All of these benefits contribute to a higher
quality of life, enhancing the appeal and economic value of both residential
and business properties in the county. It is the intent of the requirements set
forth in this section to provide for landscaping along public rights-of-way
(road protective yards), between dissimilar uses (buffer transition yards); and
in and around parking lots (vehicular surface area landscaping). Screening for
loading, trash collection, display, and utility areas is required and tree
protection standards must be met for all developments to which this section
applies. To ensure that landscaping continues to thrive and enhance the quality
of life in Richland County, requirements for maintenance are also included.
      (2)   Applicability.
         a.   Any new development must fully comply with the pertinent
requirements of this section unless specifically exempted elsewhere in this
chapter.
         Exemptions: These requirements shall not apply to:
            1.   Single-family detached and two- family dwellings. Individual
single- family detached and two-family dwellings that are located on separate
lots recorded with the Richland County Register of Deeds office, and any
existing lots zoned for single-family or two-family dwellings shown by a
recorded plat on or before July 1, 2005, shall not be subject to the
requirements set forth in this section. However, the construction in a
subdivision of single-family or two-family homes shall be subject to buffer
transition yards (Section
26-176(f)); tree protection (Section
26-176(j)), excluding street protective yards; and completion and maintenance
(Section
26-176(k)).
            2.   Public and private utilities. Public and private utilities are
not subject to the requirements of this section, except when a land development
permit or subdivision approval is required. Such utilities may include, but are
not limited to, storm drainage installation, road construction, water and sewer
construction, and electric, gas, communications, and other similar service
installations.
            3.    Existing structures and vehicular surface areas. Existing
buildings, structures, and vehicular surface areas are exempt from the
requirements of this section, unless they are involved in new construction or
expansion as explained in Section
26-176(a)(2)b. below.
         b.   Extent of compliance required. Any new development, other than
those exempted above, must fully comply with the requirements set forth in this
section:
            1.   Vehicular surface area expansions.  Any new, additional or
expanded portions of vehicular parking areas must fully comply with the
requirements for vehicular surface area landscaping (Section
26-176(g)).
            2.   Expansions. Any structure for which there is an expansion
that, singularly or collectively, equals twenty-five percent (25%) or more of
the gross floor area of an existing building and/or twenty-five percent (25%)
or more of the existing vehicular parking area, must comply with the
regulations of this section as follows:
               [a]   Vehicular surface area requirements (Section
26-176 (g)). Full compliance with vehicular surface area requirements in the
area of expansion of said vehicular surface area and fifty percent (50%)
compliance with the interior vehicular surface area planting requirements for
the existing portions of the vehicular surface area.
               [b]   Buffer transition and street protective yards requirements
(Section
26-176(f) and Section
26-176(e)). Full compliance is required.
               [c]   Screening (Section
26-176(h)).  Full compliance with the screening standards is required for all
trash collection, loading, or display areas.
            3.   Parking reductions to facilitate compliance in existing
developments. In order to facilitate compliance in situations involving
expansion, the planning department may allow up to a ten percent (10%)
reduction in the number of off-street parking spaces. (Section
26-173 (TABLE 26-VII-1))
            4.   Any existing vehicular surface that is used to satisfy the
parking requirements for a new building must fully comply with buffer
transition and street protective yard requirements (Section
26-176(f) and Section
26-176(e)).
   (b)   Alternative compliance.
      (1)   Generally. Alternative landscaping plans or plant materials may be
used where unreasonable or impractical situations would result from application
of the landscaping requirements. Such situations may result from streams,
natural rock formations, topography, or other physical conditions; or from lot
configuration, utility easements, or other unusual site conditions.
      (2)   Approval of alternative compliance. The planning department may
approve an alternate plan that proposes different plant materials or plans
provided that the quality, effectiveness, durability, and performance are
equivalent to that required by this section. In assessing equivalent
performance of landscaping, the planning department shall take into account the
number of plantings, species, arrangement and coverage, location of plantings
on the lot, and the level of screening, height, spread, and canopy of the
plantings at maturity.
      (3)   Appeal. Decisions of the planning department regarding alternate
methods of compliance may be appealed to the board of zoning appeals.
   (c)   Landscape plan required. Prior to obtaining a land development permit
or grading permit, an applicant must receive approval of a landscape plan. A
landscape plan is to be submitted with the site plan and shall include all
information specified in the Development Design Manual. The plan shall be
prepared by a landscape architect or other qualified landscape designer.
   (d)   Planting specifications.
      (1)   Species. Trees, shrubs, and other vegetative material shall be
selected from those listed in the "Development Design Manual" or shall be
approved by the planning department. Plants shall be adapted to the site
conditions where they will be planted and native plantings shall be planted
where possible. Trees to be planted shall meet or exceed minimum industry
standards as described in ANSI Z60.1 (current version) - American Standards for
Nursery Stock. Planting shall be done according to specifications developed
from the most recent edition of the "Best Management Practices for Tree
Planting", published by the International Society of Arboriculture (www.isa-
arbor.com).
      (2)   Trees.
         a.   Size. All large and medium-maturing trees planted in accordance
with the requirements of this section, unless otherwise listed, shall be a
minimum of ten (10) feet in height, and small- maturing trees shall be a
minimum of eight (8) feet in height, when planted. All trees must be at least
two (2) inches in caliper (measured one-half foot above ground level) when
planted. However, any new trees above four (4) inches in caliper shall be
measured twelve (12) inches above the ground.
         b.   Multi-trunk trees. All multi-trunk trees must be in "tree form"
with a maximum of five (5) stems or trunks and a minimum height of eight (8)
feet at planting.
         c.   Spread relationship. The height-to-trunk caliper ratio, root ball
sizes, or spread relationship for any tree to be planted shall meet the current
"American Standards for Nursery Stock" as set forth by the American Association
of Nurserymen.
      (3)   Shrubs. All shrubs planted to meet the requirements of this
section, unless required to be larger as set forth elsewhere, shall be a
minimum of three (3) gallon container size, eighteen (18) inches in height, or
fifteen (15) inches in spread (depending on whether the growth habit is upright
or spreading) measured from the top of the root zone. Shrubs with fifteen (15)
to twenty-three (23) inches of spread shall be planted on three (3) foot
centers. Shrubs with greater than twenty- three (23) inches of spread shall be
planted on five (5) foot centers. In no event shall spacing exceed five (5)
feet on center nor shall plants be closer than two (2) feet to the edge of any
pavement.
      (4)   Mulch. All planted materials are to be mulched with an approved
material in the amount (depth and area) specified in the "Development Design
Manual".
      (5)   Design. All required landscape areas shall conform to the design
principles and standards set forth in the county's "Development Design Manual".
      (6)   Diversity. To curtail the spread of disease or insect infestation
in a tree species, required plantings shall comply with the following
standards:
         a.   When fewer than twenty (20) trees are required on a site, at
least two (2) different species shall be utilized, in roughly equal
proportions.
         b.   When more than twenty (20), but fewer than forty (40), trees are
required to be planted on site, at least three (3) different species shall be
utilized, in roughly equal proportions.
         c.   When forty (40) or more trees are required on a site, at least
four (4) different species shall be utilized, in roughly equal proportions.
         d.   Nothing in this paragraph (6) shall be construed so as to prevent
the utilization of a larger number of different species than specified above.
   (e)   Street protective yards.
      (1)   Location. Street protective yards shall be located within twenty
(20) feet of all existing or proposed road rights-of-way that are adjacent to
the property to which this section is applicable. Such street protective yards
must be located on private property and not within any road right-of-way.
Portions of the property needed for driveways are exempt from street protective
yard requirements. No vehicular surface, storage, utility surface, display,
loading, or service area shall be permitted in a required street protective
yard.
      (2)   Width/square footage. The width of a required street protective
yard may vary on the property, but the minimum width cannot be less than seven
(7) feet and the minimum square footage of the street protective yard shall
equal the length in linear feet of the property adjacent to the right-of-way
times ten (10) feet.
      (3)   Plantings.
         a.   Required trees for residential subdivisions and commercial
developments. Each street protective yard shall contain at least one (1) large-
maturing tree, unless overhead utility lines are present. Any tree planted
within the right-of-way of an overhead utility line shall be a small-maturing
tree. If a large maturing tree is planted, a spacing of thirty-five (35) feet
must be used. If a small or medium maturing shade tree is planted, a spacing of
twenty- five (25) feet must be used. No street protective yard shall contain
less than one (1) tree. Existing trees 2-inch caliper or greater within the
street protective yard and right-of-way will be counted towards meeting this
requirement. Existing pine trees will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
          b.   Ground cover. The entire street protective area must be covered
with living material so that no soil is exposed, including ground cover and/or
shrubs, except for mulched areas directly around the trees.
   (f)   Buffer transition yards. The buffer transition yard is a landscaped
area designed to provide separation and screening between land uses of
different impacts.
      (1)   Determination of buffer transition yard requirements: To determine
the buffer transition yard required between two (2) adjacent land uses, the
following procedure shall be followed:
         a.   Identify the proposed new or expanding land use and each existing
adjacent land use. Identify the land use impact of each of these identified
uses as set forth in Table 26-VII-6 below. A land use is considered existing on
an adjacent property when a plan has been approved by the planning department
for the use. If adjacent property is vacant, and no plan has been approved by
the planning department for its use, its use shall be determined by assigning
it the highest level of impact in its zoning classification.
         b.   Determine the type of buffer transition yard required on each
boundary (or segment thereof) of the subject parcel by referring to Table 26-
VII-7 below. The letter designations in the table refer to the type of buffer
yard required.
         c.   Identify the buffer transition yard width and planting
requirements for the required yard type as set forth in Table 26-VII-8 below.
   This process must be applied to each property line, except where the
requirements of Section
26-176(e) concerning street protective yards apply.
      (2)   Location.
         a.   General. Buffer transition yards shall be located on the property
of the proposed or changing land use that is to be screened. Such transition
yards shall be located between the property line and any vehicular use areas,
buildings, storage, service areas, or other areas of activity on the property
to be screened and shall extend along the entire property line abutting the
less intensive land use. Ornamental entry columns and gates, flagpoles, lamp or
address posts, mailboxes, approved driveway openings, public utility wires and
poles, fences, retaining walls, or similar structures are permitted in required
buffer transition yards, provided that the general separation of land uses is
achieved and that the total number of required plantings is still met.
Plantings shall not obstruct the view of motorists using any road, driveway, or
parking aisle.
         b.   Planting/screening in easements. No vegetative screening or
fencing that is required by this section shall be planted inside utility and/or
drainage easements, excluding overhead easements, without the consent of the
planning department and the easement holder. If plantings or fences inside
utility and/or drainage easement areas are allowed, these plantings and fences
shall be maintained in accordance with the terms of consent and any applicable
maintenance provisions. Any tree planted within the right-of-way of overhead
utility lines shall be a small-maturing tree.
         c.   Buffer transition yards and required yards (setbacks). Where
front, side, or rear yards (setbacks) are required by this chapter, buffer
transition yards may be established within such setbacks. If the setback
requirement is less than the buffer transition yard requirement, the buffer
transition yard width requirement shall prevail.

   * Note - Eight (8) foot stockade fence required for ten (10) - fifteen (15)
foot Type "D" buffer.
   All existing healthy trees retained in buffer areas, can be credited toward
meeting the bufferyard requirements.
   All buffer widths greater than fifteen (15) feet must be rounded up to the
next whole number.
 
      (6)   Buffer yard reductions. Below are listed mechanisms by which the
width of a required buffer transition yard may be reduced. Notwithstanding any
of the provisions set forth in this section, no property on which a buffer
transition yard is required shall have such a yard that is less than ten (10)
feet in width.
      a.    Fences. The addition of a closed wooden fence in the required
transition yard allows reduction of the required width of the applicable buffer
transition yard by fifty percent (50%) if said fence meets the following
standards:
            1.   Height and arrangement. The fence must be a minimum of eight
(8) feet in height, measured on the side facing away from the property to be
screened. Such fence must also have its finished side facing away from the
property to be screened. The fence shall be solid and opaque, and shall include
provision for access to all landscape materials.
            2.   Materials. Rot-resistant wood is the acceptable material.
Chain link fencing does not meet buffer yard standards. Materials used should
be consistent with materials, other than chain link fencing, commonly used in
surrounding neighborhoods.
            3.   Required plantings. The number of required trees and shrubs is
reduced by fifty percent (50%) in a buffer yard in which a fence is installed.
At least one-half (½) of the required plantings shall be installed and
maintained on the side facing the less intensive use.
            4.   Construction. The buffer fence installation shall be
incorporated as early as possible in the sequence of construction.
         b.   Masonry walls. The addition of a masonry wall along the length of
the required buffer yard allows reduction of the required width of the yard by
fifty percent (50%) and the amount of required plantings by fifty percent
(50%), if said wall meets the following standards:
            1.   Height. The wall must be a minimum of six (6) feet in height
measured on the side of the wall facing away from the property to be screened.
            2.   Materials. Materials shall be brick, stone, stucco, or
textured block. The exterior surface of the wall shall not be of cinder block.
            3.   Required plantings. The number of required trees and shrubs is
reduced by fifty percent (50%) in a buffer yard in which a fence is installed.
At least one-half (½) of the required plantings shall be installed and
maintained on the side facing the less intensive use.
         c.   Grade elevation changes. The existence of a natural or man-made
grade separation in the required buffer transition yard allows reduction of
such yard by twenty-five percent (25%) in width if said elevation change
achieves a screening effect similar to a fence and meets the following
standards:
            1.   Elevation. The grade change must be at least six (6) feet in
elevation.
            2.   Slope. The side slopes of such grade may not be greater than
three to one (3:1).
            3.   Retaining wall. A greater slope is allowable if it is retained
by a structurally sound retaining wall that meets engineering standards for
such a wall.
            4.   Relationship to properties from which developing property is
to be screened.  The developing property must be located at an elevation lower
than the properties from which it is to be screened.
            5.   Location of required plantings. In order to maximize the
effectiveness of the screen, the required plantings shall be located at the top
of the slope in the reduced buffer transition yard.
      (7)   Buffer material specifications. See Section
26-176(d) for general specifications for trees, shrubs, and other vegetation.
         a.   Trees.
            1.   Size. Except as provided above under subsection (6), trees
planted in a buffer transition yard shall be large maturing trees unless within
fifteen (15) feet of an overhead power line, in which case small maturing trees
that will not exceed fifteen to twenty (15-20) feet in height at maturity shall
be used.
            2.   Species. One-half (½) of the required trees shall be locally
adapted evergreen species.
            3.   Distribution. Trees shall be distributed throughout the yard
so as to minimize gaps between them. Trees counted to meet the required number
shall be spaced at least ten (10) feet apart.
         b.   Shrubs. All shrubs are to be evergreen and shall be a minimum of
three (3) feet in height and have a minimum crown width of twenty-four (24)
inches when planted. All shrubs shall be expected to reach a height of eight
(8) feet or greater (to maximize screening potential) within three (3) years of
planting, and shall not be spaced greater than six (6) feet on center.
   (g)   Vehicular surface area landscaping.
      (1)   General. Vehicular surface areas shall comply with the following
landscape standards. There are two (2) vehicular surface area planting
requirements that may apply to a development. One requirement deals with
screening and the other deals with interior parking lot plantings.
      (2)   Vehicular surface area separation/screening.
         a.   Separation. When any vehicular use area is located within twenty
(20) feet of an abutting property and no buffer yard is required, a planting
strip shall be provided to ensure that parking lots are separated from one
another. The planting strip shall be a minimum of five (5) feet wide and shall
be planted between the parking, loading or other vehicular use area and the
abutting property, except along approved driveway openings. Five (5) evergreen
or deciduous shrubs shall be planted for every twenty (20) linear feet of
property line that parallels the vehicular surface area. The remaining ground
area shall be mulched or planted in a variety of evergreen plants, hydro- seed
or sod. Adjacent businesses on separate lots that share parking or driveways
shall be exempt from this requirement.
         b.   Screening from roads, sidewalks, or alleys.  In addition to
requirements for street protective yards (see Section
26-176(e)), vehicular use areas shall be screened from adjacent roads,
sidewalks, or alleys. The space in which this screening is to be located (which
shall be at least the width required for the street protective yard, or where
no street protective yard is required, a minimum of five (5) feet) shall be
planted with a screen that meets the following standards.
         The space shall be planted with a fifty percent (50%) opaque,
continuous screen that must be at least three (3) feet high and can consist of
plant material alone or berms, fences, walls, or grade changes combined with
plant material.
         A vegetative buffer shall consist of at least one (1) evergreen or
deciduous shrub planted for every five (5) feet of vehicular use area screen
required. Such shrubs shall be at least twenty-four (24) inches in height and
shall be maintained at a height of thirty-six (36) inches.
         If a fence or wall is used, at least one (1) shrub must be planted for
every eight (8) linear feet of fence or wall.
         c.   Groundcover. Grass or other ground cover shall be placed on all
areas within all perimeter landscape areas not occupied by other landscape
material or permitted access ways.
         d.   Use of perimeter landscape areas. Vehicle stops or other design
features shall be used in all parking facilities without curbing so that parked
vehicles do not overhang more than two (2) feet into perimeter landscape areas.
The vehicle side of the wheel stop shall be no more than eighteen (18) inches
from the end of the parking space.
      (3)   Vehicular surface area interior landscaping.
         a.   Placement. The required interior landscaped planting areas shall
be placed in any of the following locations: within or adjacent to the parking
lot area as tree islands; at the end(s) of parking bays; inside medians that
are eight (8) feet or greater in width; as part of a continuous street
protective yard; or as a vehicular surface area separation yard.
         b.   Plants. Vehicular parking areas are to be planted with one (1)
large shade tree for every twenty (20) parking spaces. Each planting area shall
contain at least one (1) large maturing tree. Within fifteen (15) feet of
overhead power lines, small maturing trees shall be planted in place of large
shade trees at a rate of two (2) small trees for each required large shade
tree. When planted in groupings, trees must be planted a minimum of twenty-five
(25) feet apart. Planted trees shall be a minimum of two (2) inch caliper to a
maximum of three (3) inch caliper. The tree species used shall be limited to
those that are listed in the current and approved "Tree Listings", which is on
file in the planning department, and can tolerate wet and dry conditions. Trees
and plants that are planted in parking lot islands that function as stormwater
quality treatment BMPs must consist of native trees and plants.
         c.   Distance from parking spaces. No vehicular parking space shall be
located farther than fifty (50) feet from the tree trunk of a shade tree in a
planting area with one (1) tree. Distances between trees and parking spaces
separated by intervening building(s) shall not be considered in meeting this
requirement.
         d.   Size of planting areas. Unless otherwise provided, a minimum of
two hundred (200) square feet of planting area is required for each tree. No
portion of the planting area shall be less than five (5) feet in width or
length.
         e.   Large vehicular surface areas greater than two (two) acres in
size (parking lots and vehicular display areas). In addition to the
requirements set forth in subsection b, above, all new and expanded vehicular
surface areas greater than two (2) acres in size shall meet all of the
following (unless exempt under Section
26-176(a)(2)b.2.):
            1.   Planted Median Strips. Large vehicular surface areas (parking
lots and vehicular display areas) must be broken by continuous planted medians.
Four (4) planted medians, each containing at least one thousand one hundred
thirty four (1,134) square feet of planted area, are required for every two (2)
acres, rounded off to the closest two (2) acre increment. The minimum median
width shall be eight (8) feet. The length of the planted median shall be
uninterrupted except for access ways.
            2.   Industrial and Warehouse (storage, loading, and maneuvering
areas). All existing, new, and expanded storage, loading, and maneuvering areas
are exempt from subsection (3)e. above. All other parking areas (excluding
trailer parking) shall be subject to subsections (3)a., b., c., and d. above.
      (4)   Standards for vehicular display areas. Interior plantings for
vehicular surface display areas shall meet those standards contained in
subsection (3) above. No stored vehicle shall be located farther than forty
(40) feet from the edge of any landscaped planting area. For interior
landscaped planting areas in such display areas, it is acceptable to replace
shade trees with small maturing trees.
   (h)   Screening for loading areas, trash collection areas, outdoor storage
display areas, shipping containers, and utility service areas. All loading
areas, trash collection areas (including dumpsters), outdoor storage display
areas, shipping containers, and utility service areas visible from a public
road or adjacent property line shall be screened from such adjacent road or
property unless already screened by an intervening building or buffer
transition yard. Landscaping shall not interfere with the access and operation
of any such structure or facility. Screen types include:
      (1)   Hedge. A continuous hedge of evergreen and/or densely twigged
deciduous shrubs planted in a five (5) foot strip spaced a maximum of five (5)
feet apart or a row of evergreen trees planted no more than eight (8) feet
apart. The shrubs shall be planted at a minimum height of forty-eight (48)
inches and the hedge shall exceed the height of the receptacle by at least six
(6) inches at the plants' maturity.
      (2)   Fence or wall. A fence or wall that matches the height of the
receptacle and with the finished side of the fence facing the abutting road or
property. Fences longer than twenty- five (25) linear feet shall be landscaped
with trees and/or shrubs planted in a minimum five (5) foot planting area,
except around access areas, spaced no further than eight (8) feet apart in
order to screen at least fifty percent (50%) of the fence or wall.
   (i)   Screening for stormwater management area. Unless designated as an
integral part of a landscape plan or features as an amenity (i.e., water
features in a wet bottom basin or recreation/open space in a dry bottom basin),
all detention ponds, retention ponds, or other similar holding area shall be
screened from view from any existing or future private or public street and
from adjoining developable property.
   (j)   Visual screening for thoroughfares and arterial roadways.
Thoroughfares or arterial roadways, when constructed within areas zoned for
residential use, shall provide a continuous visual screen consisting of
vegetation, berms, embankments, or a combination of such materials, as
appropriate. The use of existing vegetation is encouraged. When the existing
vegetation is inadequate to function as a visual screen, it shall be augmented
by two (2) staggered rows of shrub material, which will provide such a screen
at maturity.
   (k)   Protection of existing trees during development.  No grand tree shall
be removed unless it is determined that there is no alternative due to
unavoidable grading or because of required configuration of essential utilities
or buildings. In addition, where tree protection is required, no grading or
other land-disturbing activity can occur on a site until protective barriers
are installed by the developer. Protective barriers must protect the entire
critical root zone. No grading, trenching or equipment shall occur within the
protective barrier unless an alternative plan has been submitted to and
approved by the planning department. All work performed inside the protective
barrier, including tunneling underneath the critical root zone, must be
approved by the planning department and under the supervision of a certified
arborist. The diameter of the preserved trees and the location of protective
barriers must be shown on the landscape and grading plans, with the dimension
between the tree trunk and barrier indicated. A description of acceptable
protective barriers is set forth in the "Design Manual", which is on file in
the planning department.
      (1)   Trees to be protected: On sites where compliance with this section
is required, the owner/developer shall protect the following trees:
         a.   Grand trees.
         b.   All trees in fair or better condition that are ten (10) inches in
diameter or larger that are located in a protected zone (a portion of the
property required by permit to remain in natural open space or areas required
by permit to be landscaped, or to be used as buffer transition yards and/or
street protective yards).
      (2)   Tree replacement plan. In accordance with subsection (k)(1) above,
a tree replacement plan shall be submitted and approved before any protected
trees are removed. Grand trees that have been approved for removal shall be
replaced at a ratio of 6:1, with trees at a minimum of two (2) inch caliper to
a maximum of three (3) inch caliper. All other protected trees that have been
approved for removal shall be replaced at a ratio of 3:1, with trees at a
minimum of two (2) inch caliper to a maximum of three (3) inch caliper.
      (3)   Exemptions - tree protection. Commercial timber, tree farms,
agricultural operations, or timber clearing on private property are exempt from
tree protection requirements.
      (4)   Tree protection plan. A tree protection plan shall be submitted
prior to any proposed grading or clearing on site. The following information
shall be identified and submitted:
         a.   An infra-red and/or aerial photograph (no more than 5 years old)
may be utilized to assist in the location of the protected trees. A tree
protection plan shall be submitted identifying the footprint or proposed
footprint of any building or structure, areas of clearing, grading, trenching,
and other earth moving activities, protected trees and/or groupings of trees
designated to be saved (including estimated number and average diameter or
circumference), tree protection zones, ponds, creeks, wetlands, and other
important natural features.
         b.   If the information provided in subsection a. above is inadequate
to develop an approved tree protection plan, a site visit or a tree survey or
inventory of the affected area may be required.
      (5)   Tree survey or inventory. A tree survey or inventory is required
for all areas that are intended for development, as well as all undisturbed
areas that contain trees that are being retained to meet the requirements of
this subsection (k). The tree survey shall be prepared by a licensed and/or
certified arborist, engineer, forester, landscape architect, or surveyor that
will determine the size, species, health, condition, and structural integrity
of forest trees and whether or not said trees are in good enough condition and
safe enough to live beyond construction activity.
   (l)   Completion and maintenance. The owner or lessee of the property where
landscaping is required shall be responsible for the maintenance and protection
of all plant and screening material and fencing. Landscaped areas shall be
maintained in good condition. No required landscape area shall be used for
accessory structures, trash collection, parking, or other functional use unless
otherwise specified in this chapter. Deed restrictions may be placed on lots
that require each owner to maintain that portion of screening or landscaping
that is on his/her property. Where a homeowners' association and annual funding
is required by appropriate, enforceable deed restrictions, the screening and
landscaping may be either on a separately described private parcel of land or
on private property in a landscape easement, in common ownership of the
homeowners' association of said subdivision, and shall be maintained by the
homeowners' association. Failure to maintain plant material, or to replace
dead, damaged, or diseased material, or to repair a damaged buffer structure
shall constitute a violation of this chapter. All landscaping shall be
installed in accordance with the approved landscape plan unless revisions are
approved by the planning department and noted in writing on the plan. Neither a
certificate of occupancy nor a business license for any business or use on a
site with such an approved plan shall be issued until the installation of the
required landscaping is approved or a performance guarantee is posted with the
planning department in the minimum amount of one hundred twenty five percent
(125%) of the total cost of the required uncompleted landscaping, including the
labor. A site not requiring a certificate of occupancy shall not be used until
the required landscaping is installed or a guarantee posted. The guarantee
shall be released and returned to the party posting the guarantee upon
installation of all required landscaping and acceptance by the planning
department of such installation. If the landscaping is not complete and in
accordance with approved plans, the guarantee shall be forfeited to and used by
Richland County to complete the required landscaping with any remaining funds
being returned to the party who posted the guarantee.
   (m)   Irrigation. All required planting areas, except stormwater management
areas in residential subdivisions, shall be mechanically irrigated, provided
that plant material in detention ponds, retention ponds, or other similar
holding areas may be manually watered with water bags for at least one (1) year
to ensure that the landscape is established. Bubbler or drip irrigation systems
are required in order to reduce water consumption and overspray onto pedestrian
and vehicle use areas. This shall include all required planting areas except
areas within developments containing less than ten (10) parking spaces.
However, these exempted areas shall have an exterior water source (such as a
hose bib) located within one hundred (100) feet of all required planting areas.
Irrigation systems should first make use of all available surface runoff or
other retained or detained stormwater as the water supply source. If the
project area is required to be irrigated, an irrigation plan must be provided,
or the following statement must be provided on the site and landscaping plan:
"All planting areas shall be mechanically irrigated".
   (n)   Mitigation policy. When protected trees have been removed or damaged
without authorization, a restoration plan, depicting the type, size, and
proposed location of each replacement tree, shall be submitted to the planning
department for approval. The zoning administrator may require tree replacement
at a ratio not to exceed 4:1, with trees at a minimum of 4-inch caliper. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any development until all
applicable restoration conditions have been met.

Sec. 26-177. Lighting standards.
   (a)   Purpose and applicability.
      (1)   Purpose. It is the intent of this section to achieve several
purposes with respect to lighting in Richland County. Among these purposes are:
to minimize light pollution, glare, and light trespass; to conserve energy and
resources while maintaining night-time safety and utility; and to curtail the
degradation of the night-time visual environment.
      (2)   Applicability. This section shall apply to all new development in
the unincorporated portions of Richland County unless otherwise specified.
Although all new development must comply with the standards set forth in this
section, only major land developments and major subdivisions must submit a
lighting plan with their development application. When a building or structure
is extended, enlarged, or reconstructed after the effective date of this
chapter, the applicable lighting standards shall apply with respect to such
extended, enlarged, or reconstructed portion or portions of such structure.
   (b)   Standards.
      (1)   Requirements for all zoning categories and applications.
         (a)   Luminaire heights are measured from ground level to the top of
the luminaire.
         (b)   All luminaires shall be full-cutoff certified; provided,
however, outdoor athletic/sports fields are exempt from this requirement as
long as the luminaires are shielded to minimize glare.
         (c)   All luminaires shall have internal visors/panels or external
visors that control offsite light spill and glare.
         (d)   Illumination from any luminaire at property lines shall not
exceed .1 horizontal or .1 vertical foot-candles; provided, however, outdoor
retail uses shall not exceed an average of 2.5 horizontal and/or vertical foot-
candles.
         (e)   The orientation of all lighting shall be downward; provided,
however, churches, temples, mosques, and other such places of worship may
orient some lights upward onto specific architectural components of the
structure (such as steeples or domes).
         (f)   Accent lighting for sculptures, trees, landscaping features,
flags, and entrances may orient light upward.
         (g)   To control light spill and glare, luminaires shall be properly
aimed when installed, and proper aiming shall be maintained.
      (2)   Lighting exempt from these standards.

      (1)   Institutional developments and major residential subdivisions. All
new institutional developments and major residential subdivisions are required
to have sidewalks provided along one (1) side of all roads within and abutting
the development, except controlled access facilities. The radius of a cul-de-
sac shall be exempt from the installation of sidewalks. Sidewalks shall have a
minimum width of five (5) feet along external roads abutting the development
and a minimum width of four (4) feet along internal roads. A median at least
three (3) feet wide, consisting of a grassed area or a planting strip, shall be
provided to separate all sidewalks from adjacent curbs or the edge of interior
street pavement. Sidewalks shall match the grade or elevation of adjacent
sidewalks at the property lines. If there is no adjacent sidewalk, then the
sidewalk should be six (6) inches above the adjacent edge of the pavement grade
at the property line. Adjustments of the grades specified shall be at the
judgment of the engineer of record and specifically approved by the County
Engineer. All sidewalks shall be constructed to the specifications of the
public works department and shall meet the minimum requirements of the
Americans with Disabilities Act, which are referenced in the County Engineer's
“Design Guidelines Road Standards”. Sidewalks that will not be dedicated to the
county along private roadways shall have a minimum width of three (3) feet
along internal roads, and shall be exempt from ADA compliance if allowed by
federal law. The engineer of record shall provide a statement on the plans that

development within any commercial, office, industrial, or PDD district is
required to provide sidewalks along all sides of abutting roads, except along
controlled access facilities. Sidewalks shall have a minimum width of five (5)
feet and shall be constructed to the specifications of the public works
department. A median strip at least three (3) feet wide, consisting of a
grassed area or a planting strip, shall be provided to separate all sidewalks
from adjacent curbs or the edge of interior street pavement. The sidewalk shall
be six (6) inches above the adjacent edge of the pavement grade at the property
line. Adjustments of the grades specified shall be at the judgment of the
engineer of record and specifically approved by the County Engineer. The
engineer of record shall provide a statement on the plans that certifies that
all sidewalks shall be in compliance with ADA standards.
      (3)   Access to schools, greenways, parks, and open space areas from
residential developments. In major residential land developments or
subdivisions, accessways shall be provided by the developer to public schools,
greenways, parks, and open space areas abutting the residential development and
to open space or parks provided as part of a development. Such access shall be
provided in conformance with the following:
         a.   Where required.
            1.   Accessways are required when cul-de-sac roads back up to
public schools, greenways, parks, or open space areas.
            2.   Accessways are required where lots within the development back
up to public schools, greenways, parks, and open space areas.
         b.   Standards.
            1.   Access. Access to adjacent public schools, greenways, parks,
or open space areas, may be accomplished by direct access from a road, direct
access from a cul-de-sac, or a designated access between lots.
            2.   Width. Accessways shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet in
width.
            3.   ADA compliant. Walkways located within an access way shall
meet the minimum requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act.
      (4)   Exemptions. If the South Carolina Department of Transportation
(SCDOT) or the Richland County Public Works Department denies sidewalks within
their right-of-way due to the lack of connectivity, a written determination
letter must be received by the Planning Department prior to the approval of
preliminary plans or major land development. Any unusual existing site
conditions that would create a safety hazard should also be identified by the
engineer of record during the preliminary plan submittal. The County Engineer,
in conjunction with the Planning Director, will make a final determination of
exemption from the sidewalk requirement.
      (5)   Alternative to sidewalk. If a trail network is designed to be
functionally superior or equivalent to a standard sidewalk plan, then it may be
used as a viable alternative. Functionality should be assessed based on
connectivity, rather than linear feet.
      (6)   Waiver of sidewalk requirement. Strict sidewalk requirements may be
waived on a case by case basis, particularly if connectivity is improved by
alternative systems.
   (b)   Bicycle facilities. Bicycle parking shall be required for all uses
requiring over fifty (50) automobile parking spaces. A minimum of five (5)
bicycle parking spaces is required. Bicycle parking facilities shall be
standard bicycle racks or other secured lockable facilities.

Sec. 26-181. Road standards.
   (a)   Purpose/general requirements.
      (1)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to prescribe minimum design
standards for new public and/or private roads.
      (2)   General requirements. All required road improvements set forth in
this section shall be installed or constructed by the developer at no cost to
the county, except as may otherwise be specifically provided. The developer
shall be responsible for obtaining all permits. Required improvements under
this section shall not be installed or constructed until required site plans
have been approved by the planning department and an order to proceed has been
issued.
      (3)   Phasing. Development may be designated to be constructed and/or
platted in phases. Provided, however, the planning department may not approve a
phasing plan when in its opinion such phasing will not provide for adequate
roadway facilities to support any such phase or phases independent of the
overall development plan. In approving phases, the planning department may
require that additional roads be constructed as part of the phase or phases in
order to ensure that sufficient public facilities will be in place to support
such phase or phases independent of any future development.
   (b)   Design standards for public or private roads.
      (1)   Paving and curb requirements. All new roads must be paved and
include curbs and enclosed drainage systems unless otherwise provided in this
Section (or unless exempted pursuant to Section
26-224).
      (2)   Right-of-way and pavement widths.
         a.   Minimum standards. Minimum rights-of- way and pavement widths
shall be as follows, unless reduced by the development review team during land
development or subdivision review and approval:
Road Classification  Minimum ROW (ft.) Minimum Pavement Width (ft.)
Park Road (One- way) 41                17
Minor Rural          66                20
Rural                66                22
Minor Residential    50                22
Local Residential    50                24
Local Commercial     66                36
Collector            66                36
Industrial           80                36
Arterial             100               53
Loop Lane            40                16
 
      Pavement width for rural roads shall be measured from pavement edge to
pavement edge. Residential, commercial, collector, and industrial roads shall
measure pavement width from back-of- curb to back-of-curb or from low-point-
of-valley to low-point-of-valley. The mixing of rural and any other road
classification is prohibited. Curb and gutters shall be installed on all paved
roads unless the county engineer determines that another system is acceptable.
Roads without curb and gutter shall have a minimum right-of-way of sixty-six
(66) feet; provided, however, when storm water swales or other stormwater
features are located along the roadside and specifically outside of the right-
of-way, then the right-of-way may be reduced to fifty (50) feet. The stormwater
swales or other stormwater feature must be within a minimum eight (8) foot
drainage easement or conservation easement, with clearly defined maintenance by
a private owner or homeowners' association.
         b.   Additional right-of-way. In the event the development of property
includes or abuts an existing platted county road that does not conform to the
minimum requirements set forth in this chapter, or in the event that the
development will result in an increase in the average daily traffic using the
road to the extent that the classification of the road will change under these
regulations, or the road is shown on the county's thoroughfare plan, the
preliminary land development (land development or subdivision) plan must
provide for sufficient right-of-way to increase the size of the right-of-way to
the width needed under the new classification. In the event that the
development abuts only one (1) side of such a road, the additional right-of-way
reserved shall not exceed one-half (½) of the additional right-of-way required
under the new classification, measured from the centerline of the existing
right- of-way. The plat shall clearly denote that any subject right-of-way
described above is reserved for future road widening. Lot area requirements and
setback requirements shall not use the reserved right-of-way area in their
measurements.
      (3)   Connectivity.
         a.   Extension of existing roads. The arrangement of roads in a
subdivision shall provide for the alignment and continuation or extension of
existing roads in adjoining areas in compliance with the standards set forth in
this section. Greater widths may be required if the existing road is identified
for widening in the county's thoroughfare plan.
         b.   Access to undeveloped property. Where it is deemed necessary to
the development of a logical road pattern and transportation network, roads and
rights-of-way shall be extended to the boundary of adjoining property.
Incompatible characteristics of adjoining property shall be given due
consideration in making a determination of what shall constitute a logical road
pattern. Reserve strips adjoining road rights-of-way for the purpose of
preventing access to adjacent property shall not be permitted.
            1.   Construction of road connections. Where required for a logical
road pattern, road extensions or connections may be built. In the event that
the adjoining property is later developed in such a manner that it is
determined that the connection will not be necessary for a logical road
pattern, the connection may be abandoned and divided proportionally among
adjoining landowners. Temporary dead end roads shall be provided with a
temporary turnaround having a roadway surface diameter of eighty (80) feet, or
other approved type of turnaround.
            2.   Reservation of road connections. In certain situations, the
development review team may permit a platted lot to be "reserved for future
connection" in lieu of construction of the road connection, in which case an
escrow account will be established in favor of the county for a ten (10) year
period in an amount determined by the county engineer to cover the cost of
construction. In the event the connection is constructed, any remaining
property shall be conveyed to adjoining property owners and the balance of the
escrow account refunded to the developer. In the event that the adjoining
property is later developed in such a manner that it is determined that the
connection is not required or desirable, the reservation will be terminated,
ownership of the lot will remain with the developer and the escrow account
refunded to the developer. If the extension has not been constructed within the
ten (10) year period, the development review team will determine the continued
necessity of the extension and either extend the time of the escrow account or
recommend that the reservation be terminated, with ownership of the lot
remaining with the developer and the escrow account being refunded to the
developer.
         c.   Conservation areas. One (1) private access easement shall be

         a.   General. Cul-de-sacs shall not be used to avoid connection with
an existing road or to avoid connection to adjoining property. Cul-de-sacs
shall not be used to provide access to development on the boundary of the
development except where a cul-de-sac is necessitated by topography or property
accessibility, or is appropriate for land use separation.
         b.   Cul-de-sac length. Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed one thousand two
hundred (1200) feet in length unless necessitated by topography or property
accessibility, and are approved by the development review team. Measurement
shall be from the point where the centerline of the dead end road intersects

diameter and a paved turnaround with a minimum outside diameter of eighty (80)
feet, or other approved type of turn around, including T's, Y's or landscaped
islands with a minimum right-of-way sufficient for county maintenance. In
addition, all cul-de-sacs must have either a landscaped interior island at
least forty (40) feet in diameter or a minimum of 5,024 square feet or the area
of the proposed cul-de-sac of natural land preserved to increase pervious area
within the development. This preserved natural area cannot be wetlands,
streams, buffers, already preserved lands, or other sensitive areas. The
minimum pavement width around a cul-de-sac island shall be sixteen (16) feet,
and this portion of the pavement shall be designated as a one-way for traffic
purposes. A provision for adequate drainage must be designed for the island;
and a provision for maintenance of landscaping on the island must be included
in the recorded restrictive covenants for the subdivision.
      (5)   Temporary dead-end road and half roads.
         a.   Temporary dead-end roads. Temporary dead-end roads shall be
provided with a temporary turnaround having a roadway surface diameter of
eighty (80) feet, or other type of approved turnaround.
         b.   Half roads. Half roads of less than two (2) lanes are prohibited.
Whenever a road is planned adjacent to the proposed development tract boundary,
the entire road right-of-way shall be platted within the proposed development,
or a portion of the road may be platted and reserved with adequate provision
for the concurrent dedication of the remaining portion of the right-of-way by
the adjacent landowner, evidence of which shall be furnished by the developer
through an acquired and recorded easement.
      (6)   Intersections. All road intersections shall be designed in
substantial compliance with the applicable requirements of SCDOT’s "Access &
Roadside Management Standards", published in August 2008.

      (10)   Park Roads - seventeen (17) feet pavement width. On cul-de-sac
bulbs, the inside radius shall be a mountable curb. The "Park Road" paving
detail (see the "Road Design Standards" manual kept in the Department of Public
Works) may only be used when there is sufficient off street parking to provide
three (3) parking spaces per dwelling unit, and the total future parcels served
by the road do not exceed twenty-five (25). For common areas, a shared parking
space shall be considered as the equivalent of one and one-half (1½) dwelling
parking spaces.
      (11)   Other design standards.
         a.   Reverse curves. On state maintained roads, tangent distances
shall be determined by the use of South Carolina Department of Transportation
standards. On other roads, the Richland County design standards shall apply.

be less than one hundred and fifty (150) feet unless the topography of the land
to be subdivided makes this impractical.
         d.   Vertical curves. Minimum stopping sight distance on roads not
classified shall be determined by the South Carolina Department of
Transportation or by the county engineer. On collector, industrial, or
commercial service roads, the minimum stopping sight distance shall be two
hundred and seventy-five (275) feet (forty miles per hour) and on minor
residential roads, one hundred sixty (160) feet (twenty-five miles per hour).
Stopping sight distances shall be measured from a height of eye of three (3)
feet, nine (9) inches to an object with a height of six (6) inches, both
distances measured above the centerline of the road or road. Stopping sight
distance shall be determined in accordance with the standards of the American
Association of State Highway Officials.
         e.   Split-level roads. Roads that are constructed so as to have two
(2) traffic ways, each at a different level within the same right-of-way, shall
provide a paved traffic surface of at least twenty (20) feet on each level and
a slope between the two (2) traffic ways of 6:1 or flatter.
         f.   Alleys. Alleys shall only be permitted as approved by the county
engineer.

access roads between collector roads and adjacent development, if the
conditions warrant.
         j.   Grading and paving. All grading and paving work done on new roads
or road improvements must be approved by the county engineer.
         k.   Road signs/traffic control devices.  
            [1]   Road signs, in conformance with the requirements of the
Federal Highway Administration’s Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices 2009
Edition with Revisions 1 and 2 incorporated; provided, however, if a later
edition is published, this latest edition shall be used; and with the
addressing coordinating specialist, shall be located at all intersections in a
manner approved by the county engineer. Any sign within a new development shall
be installed by the developer at his/her own expense. Signs will be aluminum
blanks on metal posts fabricated and mounted in a standard design established
by the director of public works. Such signs shall have white reflective
lettering a minimum of six (6) inches in height on a reflective background.
Signs located on multi-lane roads with a speed limit of 40 mph or greater shall

Revisions 1 and 2 incorporated shall be installed by the developer at his/her
own expense. All devices shall conform to the required size and reflectivity
found in the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices 2009 Edition with
Revisions 1 and 2 incorporated. Provided, however, if a later edition of the
Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices is published, this latest edition
shall be used.
         l.   Alternative to curbed drainage. Minor rural roads and rural roads
may be exempt from the requirement to have curbs, subject to the following
conditions:
            [1]   A minor rural road shall provide access to less than twenty
(20) lots that are each greater than five (5) acres in size, and a rural road
shall provide access to less than fifty (50) lots that are each greater than
five (5) acres in size.
            [2]   For design criteria, see the "Road Design Standards" manual
kept in the Department of Public Works.
   (c)   Visibility at intersections.
      (1)   Sight clearance to be maintained. At each corner of each road or
driveway/road intersection, a sight area shall be maintained. Within the sight
area, no fence, wall, sign, slope, embankment, parked vehicle, hedge, foliage,
planting, object, or structure shall be placed, erected, or maintained that
will obstruct visibility within the sight area.
      (2)   Dimensions of the sight area. The horizontal dimensions of sight
areas are defined as triangular areas formed by the intersecting right-of-way
lines and a straight line joining the right-of-way lines at points that are
measured along the right-of-way lines as follows:
         a.   Fifteen (15) feet distant from the point of the intersection of
the right-of-way lines in commercial and industrial districts.
         b.   Twenty-five (25) feet distant from the point of the intersection
of the right-of- way lines in residential districts.
         Those sight areas shall be established regardless of the angle of
intersection of the right-of-way lines.
         For the intersection of a driveway and a road, the triangular area is
that formed by the right-of-way and the edge of the driveway and a straight
line joining the right-of-way and driveway edge at points that are fifteen (15)
feet distant from the point of intersection.
         The vertical dimensions (cross-visibility) of sight areas are defined
as the vertical space between the heights of two and one- half (2½) feet and
ten (10) feet in elevation above the nearest edge of the road pavement of a
paved road or above the nearest edge of the riding surface of an unpaved road.
Trees having limbs and foliage trimmed so that the cross-visibility within the
triangle is not obscured shall be allowed to overhang the sight triangle,
provided the location of any tree does not create a traffic hazard.

Sec. 26-183. Road naming and addressing.
   (a)   General provisions.
   (1)   Purpose. A uniform system for road naming is essential in expediting
the response time from all emergency services agencies, such as police, fire,
ambulance or other rescue services; in facilitating postal and other service
delivery; and in reducing confusion for the driving public.
   (2)   Guidelines. In addition to the regulations set forth herein, a uniform
system of naming roads and numbering properties and principal buildings, called
"Guidelines for Road Naming and Addressing in Richland County", will be
maintained by the Planning Department.
   (3)   Jurisdiction. The regulations set forth herein and in the "Guidelines
for Road Naming and Addressing in Richland County" shall apply only to those
properties, buildings, streets, and public or private roadways that are located
within the unincorporated area of Richland County, and those incorporated areas
that are included through intergovernmental agreement. It shall be the
responsibility of all municipalities and political subdivisions not included
through intergovernmental agreement to coordinate road naming and property
numbering with the Planning Department.
   (b)   Changing a road name.
   (1)   Existing road names may only be changed pursuant to S.C. Code 1976, §
6-29-1200, as amended, and include the following reasons:
      a.   A road name duplicates or is similar to another, either phonetically
or by spelling, within a 9-1-1 community or an emergency service district. In
accordance with State Law, "Existing duplicated road names must be changed as
necessary by the local government to ensure the efficiency of the emergency
response system"; or
      b.   The 9-1-1 Central Dispatch/ Communications Department submits a
written request to the county that a particular road name is causing confusion
with the dispatch and/or delivery of emergency service delivery; or an
emergency service provider requests in writing that a particular street name is
causing service delivery confusion; or
      c.   The United States Postal Service presents a request in writing
stating that a particular road name is causing service delivery confusion; or
      d.   When road configurations exist or change so that a road is split
into two (2) or more non-continuous sections; or
      e.   When conditions result in confusion for emergency services delivery;
or
      f.   A change may simplify markings or giving directions to persons
looking for an address; or
      g.   Any other good and just reason that may appear to the Planning
Commission.
   (2)   Administrative procedures for changing a road name.
      a.   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing regarding the
proposed road name change after providing notice of such public hearing in a
newspaper of general circulation at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
hearing. The Planning Department shall mail written notice to the property
owners of record, which are adjacent to or abutting the road, of the time,
date, and location of the public hearing.
      b.   After the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall either
approve, deny, or select an alternative name. The Richland County Planning
Commission is responsible for approving and authorizing street names in its
area of jurisdiction pursuant to S.C. Code 1976, § 6-29-1200, as amended.
      c.   Written notice shall be mailed to the affected property owners of
the Planning Commission's determination.
   (c)   Addressing.
   (1)   Approval agency. The Planning Department shall assign address numbers
in the unincorporated areas of Richland County; and shall coordinate municipal
addresses that are to be added to the E9-1-1 database. The Planning Department
shall also assign and maintain addresses within the jurisdiction of any
municipality with whom there is an intergovernmental agreement.
   (2)   Notification of address. Written notification of the proper address of
each building shall be mailed to the owner, occupant, or agent of each building
in all instances where a new number is assigned.
   (3)   Notification of new address information to proper agencies.
Notification shall be sent to all residents/property owners, the Richland
County 9-1-1 Communications Department, the U.S. Postal Service, the E9-1-
1 database maintenance organization, appropriate state agencies, and public
utility and affected emergency service providers whenever a new address has
been assigned. It shall be the responsibility of the occupant to notify their
respective telephone companies by informing the company of the correct address
at the time telephone service is requested.
   (4)   Placement and posting of numbers.
      a.   When a house or building has been assigned its respective number or
numbers, the owner, occupant, or agent/person in charge shall place or cause to
be placed upon each house or building controlled by him/her the number or
numbers assigned under the uniform system as outlined in this Section and in
the "Guidelines for Road Naming and Addressing in Richland County".
      b.   All numbers shall be made of a durable, clearly visible, and
reflective material that contrasts with the color of the house, building or
structure on which it is being placed.
      c.   The numbers must he posted as numerals and must not be spelled out.
      d.   The address shall be placed on existing buildings within twenty-one
(21) days from the date shown on the written notification that is referenced in
subsection (c) (2), above.
      e.   Residential numerals shall be at least three (3) inches in height,
and numerals for multiple dwelling units and nonresidential buildings shall be
at least six (6) inches in height, and shall be placed on the front of the
building facing the road or on the end of the building nearest the road.
      f.   Numbers shall be conspicuously placed immediately above, on, or at
the side of the door facing the road off which the structure is addressed so
that the number is clearly visible from the road line.
      g.   In the case where the building cannot be seen from the road or is
situated more than fifty (50) feet from the road line, the building number
shall also be placed near the walk, driveway, or common entrance to the
building, or upon the mailbox, gatepost, fence, or other appropriate place so
as to clearly be visible from the street or road.
      h.   The road address number shall be displayed on both sides of the mail
box. If mailboxes are grouped together, the road address number shall be
displayed on the mailbox door, as well as on the side visible towards the road.
      i.   Costs and installation of the numbers shall be paid for by the
property owner or occupant or person in charge of house or building.
   (d)   Enforcement, violations, and penalties.
   (1)   Enforcement of posting numbers. The office of the Richland County Fire
Marshal shall be responsible for enforcing the posting of numbers. Prior to the
issuance of a citation for any structure without properly posted numbers, the
Fire Marshal shall consult with the Planning Department regarding the proper
address of the structure in question. The Planning Department shall issue a
notice of violation giving the violator ten (10) days from the date the letter
is mailed, to correct the violation. Such notice of violation shall be in
writing and sent by certified or registered mail or delivered by personal
service. If the property owner, occupant, or agent has not properly posted the
address after the ten (10) day time period, then the Richland County Fire
Marshal or a local fire officer shall issue a citation. Such person shall be
deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be fined or imprisoned
for a term not to exceed the authority of the Magistrate's Courts. Each day
that such violation continues to exist shall constitute a separate offense.
   (2)   Tampering with street signs, posting illegal street signs. Removing or
defacing a street name sign in any manner, placing a street name sign in any
unapproved location, or being found in possession of a stolen street sign shall
constitute a violation; and such person shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor
and upon conviction shall be fined or imprisoned for a term not to exceed the
authority of the Magistrate's Courts.
   (3)   Damage to street signs. It shall be unlawful for any person,
corporation, firm, or organization to alter, remove, deface or damage any
street name signs placed by the county pursuant to this Section. Any violation
of this Section shall be deemed a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be
fined or imprisoned for a term not to exceed the authority of the Magistrate's
Courts.
   (4)   Naming of streets not approved by the Planning Commission. Failure to
obtain proper approval of any road name used within the unincorporated areas of
Richland County and the recordation of any plat containing any road name not
approved by the Planning Commission shall constitute a violation; and such
person shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction shall be
fined or imprisoned for a term not to exceed the authority of the Magistrate's
Courts.
   (5)   Removing or defacing numbers. Any person who unlawfully removes,
defaces, mars, changes, destroys, or renders an existing number or numbers
unreadable in any manner shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon
conviction shall be fined or imprisoned for a term not to exceed the authority
of the Magistrate's Court.

units may remain on the site for no more than twelve (12) months or until one-
half (½) of the units for the project are completed, whichever occurs first.
            3.   Real estate offices in model home.  A model dwelling may be
used as a real estate sales office in a new residential development. Such
temporary use shall be allowed in all zoning districts. Temporary real estate
offices in model homes may be permitted until ninety percent (90%) of the homes
in the development have been sold. The number of employees utilizing the office
at any one time may not exceed four (4).
         c.   Similar and compatible uses not specified. If a particular
temporary use is listed in this chapter, the zoning administrator shall have
the authority to grant a temporary use permit for a "similar and compatible"
use. Similar and compatible uses not specified are those uses that are similar
and compatible to those allowed as temporary uses in this section.
Determination of what constitutes similar and compatible shall be made by the
zoning administrator looking at the type of use, the number of employees, the
parking/ circulation needs, the hours of operation, etc.
   (b)   Accessory uses and structures (customary).
      (1)   General standards and limitations.
         a.   General standards. All customary accessory uses and accessory
structures shall conform to the applicable requirements of this chapter. The

Provided, however, accessory structures on lots that are two (2) acres in size
or greater in the RU Rural district shall not exceed a maximum total area of
fifty percent (50%) of the gross floor area of the principal building or twenty
five hundred (2,500) square feet.
            2.   There are no size restrictions for accessory structures that
are associated with agricultural uses in the RU district, provided that the lot
size is greater than two (2) acres and that a one hundred (100) foot setback is
maintained from all property lines.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04; Ord. No. 027-11HR, § II, 5-17-11)
Sec. 26-186. Development with Open Space Design Standards.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide optional standards
that will preserve land for conservation by permitting variation in lot sizes.
Subdivision of land into varying lot sizes provides home buyers a choice of lot
sizes according to their needs, while at the same time preserving open space,
tree cover, scenic vistas, natural drainage ways, and natural topography. Such
measures prevent soil erosion and flooding by allowing development to occur
according to the nature of the terrain, provide larger open areas with greater
utility for recreation and a "sense of community", and encourage the
development of more attractive and economical site design.
Incorporating open space into development has numerous environmental,
conservation and community benefits, including the following:
      (1)   Preserves green space.
      (2)   Provides open space for recreation.
      (3)   Reduces the impervious cover in a development. Impervious cover
contributes to degradation of water resources by increasing the volume of
surface runoff, degrading water quality by preventing infiltration into the
soil surface.
      (4)   Reduces stormwater pollutant loads to streams, receiving streams
and other resources. Protects and enhances stream and other resources.
      (5)   Reduces soil erosion and sediment delivery by reducing the amount
of clearing and grading on the site while increasing overall infiltration.
      (6)   Reduces the cost of stormwater management by minimizing the area
contributing to runoff and reducing runoff volumes and stormwater contaminants.
      (7)   Provides air quality benefits and reduces "heat island" impacts.
      (8)   Reduces the capital and long-run maintenance costs of development.
      (9)   Provides a wider range of feasible sites to locate stormwater best
management practices (BMPs).
      (10)   Reduces the cost and improves the efficiency of public services
needed by the development.
      (11)   Protects urban wildlife habitat, with a focus for corridors which
provide important habitat linkages.
      (12)   Creates a sense of community and pedestrian connectivity.
This optional section implements procedures to allow for development, while
preserving the natural attributes of the land and providing open space. This
section also encourages designing developments with open space design to
maximize larger, contiguous unconstrained open space areas [see subsection (g)
(2), below], especially areas adjacent to constrained open space areas [see

   (f)   Open Space Requirements. Open space set aside is required in all open
space developments and shall consist of any of the following categories of
land:
      (1)   Constrained open space is land that shall be covered by the
provisions for permanent protection, per subsection (h), below, and includes
the following:
         a.   Floodways and 100-year floodplains, in lieu of exceptions defined
in Section
26-106,
         b.   Jurisdictional lines and associated buffer zones per Section
26-187,
         c.   Highly erodible soils on steep slopes of 25% or greater,
including water quality buffers per Section
26-187(g), except minimal changes may be allowed for necessary access or
impacts (wetlands, jurisdictional or non-jurisdictional) of less than a quarter
(1/4) acre,
         d.   Federal and state listed rare, endangered or threatened species/
habitats,
         e.   Archeological features eligible for or listed in the national
Register of Historic Places,
         f.   Human cemeteries or burial grounds, and
         g.   Open water, except where alterations enhance open space value, or
as exempted in Section
26-187(b).
      (2)   Unconstrained open space is land other than constrained open space
that includes important environmental, conservation, wildlife or historic areas
and is acceptable to the county for conservation designation, and shall be
covered by the provisions for permanent protection, per subsection (h), below.
These include the following:
         a.   Important historic sites, not currently determined eligible for
or listed in the National Register of Historic Places,
         b.   Existing healthy, mature forests of at least one (1) contiguous
acre,
         c.   Contiguous areas surrounding groupings of grand trees,
         d.   Scenic view sheds of natural or historic features,
         e.   Unique rock outcroppings,
         f.   Prime agricultural soils or productive agricultural lands
consisting of at least one (1) contiguous acre,
         g.   Existing trails or wooded corridors that connect the tract to
neighboring areas,
         h.   Extension of the required water quality buffer,
         i.   Headwater streams, and
         j.   Restored pond; restorative or enhancing activities.
         Also considered unconstrained open space are community gardens of a
minimum quarter (1/4) acre, neighborhood greens and low impact development
(LID) storm water management facilities and practices, and these may be
constructed and maintained in the open space area. However, neighborhood greens
shall not exceed twenty percent (20%) of the total required open space area.
      (3)   Restored open space includes brownfield reclamation, as contracted
by the brownfield component of the SCDHEC Voluntary Cleanup Program; approved
watershed or stream restoration consistent with Section
26-187; and the removal of impervious cover and restoration of pervious areas
during redevelopment. Restored areas must be approved by Richland County staff
as part of the development review process. Restored farm ponds shall be
credited at one hundred percent (100%).
      (4)   Recreational open space includes pervious recreational areas.
   (g)   Open space design standards.
      (1)   To use these standards, one of the following alternatives must be
utilized, as appropriate for the applicable zoning district:
         a.   To utilize the density-based zoning and flexibility in lot size,
in all allowable zoning districts per subsection (b), above, all constrained
open space on a site must be set aside, plus a minimum of ten percent (10%)
unconstrained open space, for a total actual acreage set aside of fifteen
percent (15%). Open space set asides between fifteen percent (15%) and twenty-
five percent (25%) are based on a 1:1 ratio open space area to actual area.
Open space credits, as determined by the "Unconstrained Open Space Credit
Calculations" table in Section
26-186 (h) (1) b. 2., cannot be utilized to meet the open space requirements
under this alternative.
            If the constrained open space meets the twenty-five percent (25%)
minimum, then no additional unconstrained open space is required.
         b.   To utilize a density bonus over the base density, allowable only
in RU, RR, RS-E and RS-LD, a minimum of twenty-five percent (25%) open space
credits are required, which includes a minimum of ten percent (10%)
unconstrained open space credits, calculated using the "Unconstrained Open
Space Credit Calculations" table below. Constrained open space areas are based
on a 1:1 ratio of open space area to actual acreage.
            1.   A five percent (5%) density bonus is awarded for twenty-five
percent (25%) open space credits, under this alternative. Then, one percent
(1%) density bonus for every additional one percent (1%) of open space credits,
up to a maximum density bonus of twenty percent (20%) for RU, RR and RS-E and
fifteen percent (15%) for RS-LD zoning districts.
            2.   Open space will be credited based upon the following:
               i.   Constrained open space shall be credited at one hundred
percent (100%) of the land area.
               ii.   Restored open space shall be credited at two hundred
percent (200%) of the land area; except where exceptions apply per subsection
(f)(3), above.
               iii.   Recreational open space shall be credited at fifty
percent (50%) of the land area.
               iv.   Unconstrained open space shall be credited based on the
following table titled "Unconstrained Open Space Credit Calculations".

      (2)   Unconstrained open space areas may only be credited once per the
calculations in this section. When an unconstrained open space area qualifies
in two (2) categories, it shall be credited as follows:
         a.   Where both categories have a factor of 1.0 or greater, the
greater credit shall be applied.
         b.   If one of the two categories has a factor of less than 1.0, the
lesser credit shall be applied.
      (3)   The following activities or land uses may not be counted as a part
of designated open space:
         a.   Existing rights-of-way and utility easements,
         b.   Setbacks and lawns,
         c.   Dry stormwater detention ponds.
   (h)   Open Space Management.
      (1)   Open space areas. To maintain, enhance and sustain the
environmental, conservation, wildlife, recreational, historic, public and
community values and benefits of open space areas, property owners or his/her
authorized agents using the provisions of this Section must develop an open
space management plan. The plan shall include guidance on how to best manage
open space areas in their current condition, increase conservation values
through enhancement of existing conditions or establish processes to modify
open spaces to other intended open space functions and resultant conservation
values and benefits. The plan shall incorporate approved and current best
management practices (BMPs) for all constrained and unconstrained open space
areas as set forth in the Richland County Open Space Management Manual.
      The open space management plan must be approved by the planning
department prior to approval of the final plat.
         a.   Open space area management and maintenance. Management of the
open space area includes specific limitations on alteration of the natural
conditions. The following practices and activities are restricted within open
space areas, except with prior approval by the planning department:
            1.   Clearing or grubbing of existing vegetation,
            2.   Clear cutting of vegetation,
            3.   Soil disturbance by grading, stripping, or other practices,
            4.   Filling or dumping,
            5.   Use, storage, or application of pesticides, herbicides, and
fertilizers,
            6.   Conversion of vegetation from native to exotic species, and
            7.   Motor vehicles are not permitted in open space areas unless
during the installation of certain permitted utilities.
         b.   The following structures, practices, and activities are permitted
in open space areas, subject to prior approval from the county, and when
specific design or maintenance features are adhered to:
            1.   All activities within water quality buffers located within
open space areas shall be consistent with Section
26-187.
            2.   Pedestrian crossings, public or neighborhood bicycle or
pedestrian access, passive recreational amenities, such as pervious-surface
paths and minimum green infrastructure parking spaces, stream bank
stabilization efforts and LID stormwater control practices.
            3.   Utilities are allowed; however, utility easements shall not
qualify as open space areas.
      (2)   Open space area plat requirements. All preliminary, bonded and
final plats prepared for recording and all right-of way-plats (submitted under
this section) shall clearly:
         a.   Delineate and label all open space areas,
         b.   Provide a note to state: "There shall be no clearing, grading,
disturbance or construction or construction runoff impacts to the open space
areas except as allowed by the Public Works Department",
         c.   Provide a note to state: "All open space areas shown on the plat
are subject to perpetual conservation easements which are contained in land
records or covenants pertaining to the development",
         d.   Provide a note indicating ownership of the open space areas by
the property owners association, and
         e.   Show the location of all permanent open space boundary marker
signs.
         f.   All water quality buffer access easements shall be consistent
with Section
26-187.
      (3)   Open space area protection requirements during construction. The
following steps shall be taken during the site plan development and site
construction process to protect existing open space areas:
         a.   Open space areas must be clearly identified on all plan
submittals and construction drawings and marked with the statement "Open Space
Area. Do Not Disturb or Encroach."
         b.   Open space areas cannot be encroached upon or disturbed at any
time, unless in accordance with Section
26-187(c), Section
26-187(k) or without approval from the county.
         c.   Open space areas must be clearly marked with a warning barrier
prior to any construction activities. The marking(s) shall be maintained until
completion of all construction activities. All contractors and others working
on the construction site must be made aware of the existence of the open space
areas and the restrictions on disturbing these areas.
         d.   All open space areas must be left in the existing condition upon
completion of construction activities. Should any activities during
construction, including encroachment, cause damage or degradation to any of the
open space areas, these areas must be restored based upon preexisting
conditions or to conditions acceptable through a Richland County-approved
restoration plan.
         e.   If any trees are allowed to be removed, the tree location shall
be shown and a note shall be provided stating that the tree must be hand
cleared.
         f.   Where stormwater is concentrated into open space areas, best
management practices must be placed to protect it, as approved by the county.
         g.   The open space areas shall be shown and labeled on the
engineering plans, preliminary, bonded and final plat.
      (4)   Open space area protection requirements after construction. Open
space areas must be protected in perpetuity by either of the following options
and be in compliance with the open space management plan:
         a.   Option 1. Previous granting to qualified organization or entity.
Any proposed open space area found in this section and having previously been
granted in a conservation easement running in perpetuity to a third party
"qualified organization" recognized by Federal Treasury Regulation Section
1.170 A-14(c)(1), or successor provision, may qualify as open space area under
this section with certain exceptions. The owner must submit a copy of the
recorded easement, baseline assessment and annual monitoring inspections for
the previous three (3) years to the planning department for review. Based on a
review of the information, the department will determine if the proposed open
space areas and permitted uses protected in the easement qualify under this
section.
         Potential exceptions include, but are not limited to, active
timberlands or areas of the easement on which the conservation values have been
damaged by poor cutting and harvesting practices (conflicting with current
BMP's), encroachment by development, illegal dumping, above or below-ground
utility easements, runoff and erosion, fires, storms, insect infestation or
other damaging activity which has or continues to diminish the conservation
value of the open space area. Failure of the monitoring organization to
adequately enforce the provisions of the conservation easement shall be grounds
for refusing to accept such easement into the program.
         The property owner or property owners' association (POA) shall be
responsible for the continuous and perpetual protection, management,
maintenance and annual monitoring of all open space areas.
         b.   Option 2. Easement granted to richland county. Any proposed open
space area found in this section may be granted in a conservation easement
running in perpetuity to the Richland County conservation commission at the
time of application for an open space development. The purpose of the granting
to the Richland County conservation commission is to ensure the protection and
proper management of the open space areas and has no impact or bearing on the
acceptance of any open space areas or approval under this section by Richland
County.
         The property owner or POA (once deeded) agrees to pay a one-time
stewardship fee, to be established by the Richland conservation commission, to
cover the cost of annual monitoring, compliance and enforcement of the
conservation easement.
         The property owner or POA assumes the responsibility for the
continuous and perpetual protection, management, and maintenance of all open
space areas consistent with the guidance contained in the Richland County Open
Space Management Manual.
         c.   Option 3. Conveyance to the property owners' association. If not
utilizing Option 1 or 2 of this subsection, the property owner shall convey
ownership in a deed all open space areas in fee-simple to the POA which shall
be recorded and delivered prior to, or concurrent with, the recording of the
bonded plat for the first phase of the subdivision. To meet the purposes of
this section, the deed and covenants of the POA shall contain the following
language:
               "The conservation values and benefits of the areas conveyed by
deed and shown on the Final Plat shall remain permanently protected and shall
not be disturbed, or modified without prior approval from the Planning
Department. The open space areas identified in this covenant are intended for
public benefit, but for association members use, and it shall run in
perpetuity."
            The POA may establish criteria for public use of open space areas
protected under this section. The POA assumes the responsibility for the
continuous and perpetual protection, management, maintenance and annual
monitoring of all open space areas consistent with the guidance contained in
the Richland County Open Space Management Manual.
         d.   Option 4. Retention by the property owner. If not utilizing the
options above in this subsection, the property owner shall retain ownership of
all open space areas, which shall be recorded and delivered prior to, or
concurrent with, the recording of the bonded plat for the first phase of the
subdivision. To meet the purposes of this section, the deed shall contain the
following language:
               "The conservation values and benefits of the areas covered base
by deed and shown on the Final Plat shall remain permanently protected and
shall not be disturbed, or modified without prior approval from the Planning
Department. The open space areas identified in this covenant are intended for
public benefit, but for residents use, and it shall run in perpetuity."
            The property owner may establish criteria for public use of open
space areas protected under this section. The property owner assumes the
responsibility for the continuous and perpetual protection, management,
maintenance and annual monitoring of all open space areas consistent with the
guidance contained in the Richland County Open Space Management Manual.
         e.   Regardless of which option above is utilized, conservation
easements and/or open space areas are the property of the property owner or
POA. If a POA is established to manage open space areas, the following criteria
are recommended:
            1.   Membership in the POA is mandatory and automatic for all
property owners for the subdivision and their successors;
            2.   The POA shall have lien authority to ensure the collection of
dues from all members; and
            3.   The POA is responsible for informing each property owner at
the time of closing of the location of the open space areas and the requirement
not to disturb or encroach upon these areas.
         f.   Richland County retains an independent right of entry and
enforcement under such conservation easements independent of the property owner
or POA and such right of enforcement shall be included in all conservation
easements granted under this section and contained in the covenants for the
subdivision.
      (5)   Open space baseline surveys and annual monitoring. To quantify the
pre-construction condition and conservation values of the open space areas, the
developer shall:
         a.   Conduct a baseline survey by the applicant prior to any earth-
moving, tree clearing, infrastructure installation or home construction. The
baseline survey shall photo-document the condition of the open space areas
prior to the above activities. Photos must be of adequate quality, number and
distribution to adequately document all open space areas. Each photograph
should be geocoded to indicate both the location and bearing of the photograph
and each digital photographic file must be submitted electronically in a high-
resolution digital format.
         b.   Annual monitoring shall be conducted by the developer, POA or
qualified entity and document the existing condition of the protected open
space area. The annual monitoring shall photo-document the condition of the
open space areas. Photos must be taken at the same location and bearing as the
original baseline survey. Each photograph should be geocoded to indicate both
the location and bearing of the photograph and each digital photographic file
must be submitted electronically in a high-resolution digital format.
            As an alternative, the POA can retain the services of a qualified
entity (which could include Richland County) to perform the annual monitoring
survey.
            The annual monitoring should document any violations or changes
that have taken place since the last monitoring report, such as:
            1.   Homeowner or POA encroachment,
            2.   Removal of sand, gravel, loam, rock, etc,
            3.   Trash accumulation, dumping, organic debris,
            4.   Alteration of the open space,
            5.   Storm damage, erosion, etc,
            6.   Construction of roads, parking lots, utility lines, trails,
            7.   Removal or planting of trees or other vegetation,
            8.   Invasion of non-native species, and/or
            9.   Current use of adjacent properties and whether there are any
problems with encroachment and/or trespassing.
         c.   All baseline surveys and annual monitoring documents shall be
submitted to the planning department.
      (6)   Signage. For subdivisions, final permanent open space area boundary
marker signs are to designate open space areas prior to bonding of the
subdivision and/or finalizing the subdivision with the intent to transfer
property. Permanent boundary markers are required to ensure that property
owners are aware of the buffer. The planning department has the authority to
require the POA to replace boundary markers that have been removed or
destroyed.
         The following requirements shall apply to buffer boundary markers:
         a.   Open space area boundary markers shall be located in such a
manner as to accurately delineate the boundary. For commercial developments,
markers shall be posted every one hundred (100) feet along the buffer boundary.
For subdivisions where multiple lots are located along the boundary, a boundary
marker must be located at the intersection of every other lot line and the
boundary. The developer or POA may petition the planning department for a
lesser marker density as long as the markers are adequate to clearly mark the
boundary.
         b.   Open space area boundary markers shall include the statement
"Open Space Area - Do Not Disturb or Encroach".
         c.   The markers should be mounted to a treated wood or metal signpost
or on a non-grand tree, if not encroaching on the open space, between four (4)
and six (6) feet above the ground surface. The post must extend below the
ground surface at least twenty four (24) inches.
         d.   The boundary markers must be at least eight by twelve inches (8"x
12") and have a white or yellow background with dark lettering.
         e.   When water quality buffers are contained within an open space
area, the public works department may forgo boundary markers for the water
quality buffer. This decision is at the discretion of the public works
director.
         f.   In dark lettering, include a number for ombudsman to call for
encroachment or issues.
      (7)   Open space area restoration and enhancement plans. Prior to
reestablishing or planting the open space area, a restoration or enhancement
plan must be submitted to and approved by the planning department. Buffer
restoration and/or enhancement plans must include the following:
         a.   A drawing or plan that shows the location of the open space area
in relation to the existing or planned development; the disturbance limits for
the planned buffer restoration; direction of flow of runoff from the area;
erosion prevention and sediment control measures to be installed to protect the
open space area; access to a water source for the purposes of irrigating
vegetation; and other pertinent information. For large scale restoration and
enhancement projects the plan(s) must be stamped by a registered landscape
architect or engineer.
         b.   A visual plan and a narrative describing the vegetation plan to
restore or enhance the open space area: the area must be planted with native
trees, grasses and shrubs. Suitable native plants can be chosen from plant
species recommended and approved by the planning department.
         c.   The schedule for when plantings will occur and a two (2) year
survival guarantee provided by the responsible party.
      (8)   Penalty for noncompliance. In the event that the party responsible
for maintenance of the open space fails to maintain all or any portion of such
area as enumerated, upon ninety (90) days' notice served to the owner, Richland
County may assume responsibility for the maintenance and may enter the premises
and take corrective action, including the provision of extended maintenance.
The costs of said corrective action and maintenance by Richland County may be
charged to the owner or property owners' association.
   (i)   Development Requirements. Subdivisions shall meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Minimum subdivision size: Two (2) contiguous acres.
      (2)   The following densities will apply to the application of these
standards, based on the applicable property zoning:
         a.   RU = 1.32
         b.   RR = 1.32
         c.   RS-E = 2.20
         d.   RS-LD = 3.63
         e.   RS-MD = 5.12
         f.   RS-HD = 8.7
      (3)   The total number of units allowed shall be determined by using the
density of the zoning district and the following formula:
         T=D*A*B
         Where:
         T =   total units (dwelling units)
         D =   density (dwelling units/gross acre)
         A =   total site area (acres)
         B =   density bonus per Section
26-186(g) (percent)
      (4)   Lot size: No minimum.
      (5)   Lot width: No minimum.
      (6)   Minimum yard areas (setbacks):
         a.   Front:
            For front loaded - twenty (20) feet to garage, where the front
porch can extend into setback no more than ten (10) feet.
            For side or rear loaded - ten (10) feet, inclusive of front porch.
            For secondary front - half (0.5) the front or ten (10) feet on the
road intersecting the local residential road.
         b.   Rear: Twenty (20) feet for front loaded lots (or five (5) feet
from rear garage on alley).
         c.   Side: Five (5) feet.
         d.   For a zero "lot line" parallel development:
            No side setbacks; front and rear setbacks are as stated in
paragraphs (6) a. and (6) b., above.
      (7)   Buffer Transition Yards. A twenty five (25) foot minimum, vegetated
buffer transition yard is required along any lot line that abuts an existing
residential use. Properties with a residential plan approved by the planning
department are considered to have an existing residential use. Provided,
however, this requirement does not apply when continuity exists by way of all
of the following: the streets provide connectivity between developments, the
developer is the same, and the parcels within the development are similar in
lot size.
         a.   Location: As set forth in Sections
26-176(f)(2)(a) and (b). Residential yards (front, side or rear) shall not
apply towards buffer transition yards.
         b.   Buffer yard credits: All existing healthy, mature trees retained
in buffer areas, can be credited toward meeting the buffer yard requirements,
upon determination that adequate screening is provided. This may require a
field visit and determination by the planning department.
         c.   Buffer yard reductions: Reductions of the minimum transition
buffer yard widths are not permitted.
         d.   Buffer material specifications: As set forth in Section
26-176(f)(7).
      (8)   Maximum Height. Three (3) stories above ground level. (For the
purpose of this subparagraph, ground level shall mean: the average finished
ground elevation at the base of a structure to the highest point of the roof of
the structure; provided that spires, belfries, cupolas, chimneys, antennas,
water tanks, ventilators, elevator housing, mechanical equipment, or other such
structures that are placed above roof level and are not intended for human
occupancy, shall not be subject to height limitations).
      (9)   Street trees shall be provided along all roads at intervals of
thirty-five (35) feet and shall be 2 ½ inch caliper/10 feet in height at time
of planting.
      (10)   Proposed utilities shall be located underground.
      (11)   Roads shall follow the provisions of Section
26-181.
      (12)   Street Lighting. If street lighting is proposed, a pedestrian
scale shall be utilized (maximum 12 feet in height).
      (13)   Stormwater Controls. Low impact development (LID) techniques are
the preferred stormwater best management practice (BMPs) within open space
developments. In order to use LID as open space credit, the applicant must
assess the feasibility of LID practices as the exclusive stormwater BMPs or the
use of LID techniques as part of an integrated stormwater management system
incorporating traditional stormwater BMPs unless shown to not meet Richland
County's stormwater standards, or pertinent state or federal statues or
regulations. The applicant must submit data and design standards detailing the
engineering and technical specifications on the use of LID techniques. Such
data and design include:
         a.   An assessment of the existing pre and post development runoff and
the feasibility of the existing onsite soils, or engineered soils, to handle
LID techniques.
         b.   Stormwater controls shall meet Richland County's standards.
         c.   All stormwater systems, including LID, should be owned and
maintained by the POA.

Sec. 26-187. Water Quality Buffer Requirements.
   (a)   Purpose and applicability. It is the intent of the Public Works
Department to establish minimal acceptable requirements for the design of
buffers to protect the streams, wetlands and floodplains of the County of
Richland; to protect the water quality of watercourses, reservoirs, lakes, and
other significant water resources; to protect riparian and aquatic ecosystems;
and to provide for the environmentally sound use of the county’s land
resources.
      (1)   Purpose. A water quality buffer is an area of original or re-
established vegetation that borders streams, rivers, ponds, lakes, wetlands,
and seeps. Buffers are most effective when stormwater runoff is flowing into
and through the buffer zone as shallow sheet flow, rather than concentrated
flow such as channels, gullies, or wet weather conveyances. Therefore, it is
critical that design of all development include management practices, to the
maximum extent practical, that will result in stormwater runoff flowing into
the buffer zone as shallow sheet flow. Water quality buffers provide numerous
environmental protection and resource management benefits including:
         a.   Restoring and maintaining the chemical, physical and biological
integrity of the water resources,
         b.   Removing pollutants delivered in urban stormwater,
         c.   Reducing erosion and controlling sedimentation,
         d.   Stabilizing stream banks,
         e.   Providing infiltration of stormwater runoff,
         f.   Maintaining base flow of streams,
         g.   Contributing the organic matter that is a source of food and
energy for the aquatic ecosystem,
         h.   Providing tree canopy to shade streams and promote desirable
aquatic organisms,
         i.   Providing riparian wildlife habitat, and
         j.   Furnishing scenic value and recreational opportunity.
      (2)   Applicability. Water quality buffers are required along all
perennial and intermittent streams, waterways, shorelines and wetlands
according to a USACE jurisdictional determination, to be submitted from the
developer and approved by the Public Works Department. In addition, water
quality buffers may be required to protect waters (such as isolated wetlands)
pursuant to the S.C. Pollution Control Act, as determined by the Public Works
Department.
      (3)   This Section shall apply to the following:
         a.   All proposed development except for that development which meets
the criteria for an exemption [Section 26-187 (b)] and/or a waiver [Section 26-
187 (k)].
         b.   All surface mining operations except active surface mining
operations which are operating in compliance with an approved DHEC surface
mining permit. A copy of the approved surface mining permit shall be provided
to the Public Works Department.
         c.   The construction of agricultural structures as stated in this
chapter.
         d.   Except as provided in Sections 26-187(b), and 26-187(k), this
shall apply to all parcels of land, structures and activities which are causing
or contributing to:
            1.   Pollution, including non-point pollution, of the waters of
Richland County,
            2.   Erosion or sedimentation of stream channels, or
            3.   Degradation of aquatic or riparian habitat.
   (b)   Exemptions. The water quality buffer requirements shall not apply to
the following:
      (1)   Ephemeral streams, ditches, manmade ponds, and lakes, which are
outside of natural hydrologic connectivity.
      (2)   Any existing structure or structure under construction located
within the buffer area, provided the land owner can document prior existence.
      (3)   The addition or expansion to an existing structure, provided it
does not result in an increase in the total impervious area within the buffer
area.
      (4)   Activities associated with emergency operations, such as hazardous
materials removal, flood or fire control, evacuations, and storm damage clean
up.
      (5)   Single-family parcels of land, which exist as individual lots that
are two (2) acres or less and are not part of a new subdivision development.
      (6)   All “Entitled Property”; provided, however, this exemption shall no
longer be in effect after January 19, 2017. In addition, all entitled property
shall comply with the stormwater regulations that were in effect prior to
January 19, 2010.
   If any portion of a parcel proposed for development lies within an area
designated on an officially adopted Conservation Easement as a proposed trail
or greenway, the developer shall construct the designated improvements in
accordance with county standards and dedicate such land to the county.
   (c)   Stream Buffers.
      (1)   Stream buffers shall be considered a “no disturb zone” along
jurisdictional lines. Vegetation cannot be disturbed, removed or replanted
unless a buffer restoration plan has been approved by the Public Works
Department. Section 26-187 (g) provides requirements to expand the buffer
widths depending on slopes, water pollution hazards, or other uses that may
contribute to water quality degradation. The buffer width shall be calculated
as follows:
         a.   Along jurisdictional perennial streams identified by the USACE,
not associated with a floodplain or wetlands, the buffer shall be at least
fifty (50) feet perpendicular from the jurisdictional line on each side of the
waterway.
         b.   In areas where a floodway profile has been computed along a
perennial stream (AE Zones) as part of an approved flood study, the buffer area
shall be equal to the width of the floodway, but never less than fifty (50)
feet.
         c.   In areas where a floodway profile has not been computed along a
perennial stream (A Zones) the developer shall perform a flood study, determine
the floodway and follow the buffer requirements outlined above. As an
alternative to preparing the flood study, the buffer limits shall extend to the
delineated flood plain limits.
         d.   Along jurisdictional intermittent streams identified by the
USACE, the buffer shall be at least fifty (50) feet perpendicular from the
jurisdictional line on each side of the waterway. If these streams have
associated floodway as described above, the same requirements would apply to
have a total width of fifty (50) feet.
         e.   For delineated wetland areas associated with perennial streams,
the buffer shall be at least fifty (50) feet perpendicular beyond the wetland
edge. This buffer width is independent of any wetland offset requirements of
the USACE.
         f.   For delineated wetland areas associated with intermittent
streams, the buffer shall be at least fifty (50) feet perpendicular beyond the
wetland edge. This buffer width is independent of any wetland offset
requirements of the USACE.
         g.   For wetland areas not associated with perennial, intermittent
streams, or floodway, the buffer shall be the extent of the wetland area plus
an additional fifty (50) feet perpendicular beyond the wetland edge.
      (2)   Stream Buffer Management and Maintenance. The function of the
stream buffer is to protect the physical and ecological integrity of the
waterway, to reduce flooding potential, and to filter runoff from all
development. The objective of a stream buffer is undisturbed native vegetation.
         a.   Management of the stream buffer includes specific limitations on
alteration of the natural conditions. The following practices and activities
are restricted within stream buffers, except with prior approval by the Public
Works Department:
            1.   Clearing or grubbing of existing vegetation,
            2.   Clear cutting of vegetation,
            3.   Soil disturbance by grading, stripping, or other practices,
            4.   Filling or dumping,
            5.   Use, storage, or application of pesticides, herbicides, and
fertilizers,
            6.   Conversion of vegetation from native to exotic species.
            7.   Motor vehicles are not permitted in stream buffers unless
during the installation of certain utilities permitted in the buffer zone.
         b.   The following structures, practices, and activities are permitted
in the stream buffer, subject to prior approval of the Public Works Department,
and when specific design or maintenance features are adhered to:
            1.   Stream crossings and utilities:
               [a]   An applicant shall demonstrate that stream crossings are
minimized;
               [b]   The right of way should be the minimum width needed to
allow for maintenance access and installation;
               [c]   The angle of a crossing shall be as nearly perpendicular
to the stream or buffer as practical in order to minimize clearing
requirements; and
               [d]   The minimum number of crossings should be used within each
development, and no more than one crossing is allowed for every one thousand
(1,000) linear feet of buffer zone unless the applicant demonstrates to the
Public Works Department the need for additional crossings. Where possible, the
design of roadways and lots within a development should be aligned such that
all streams are either to the rear or the side of individual lots, never along
the front.
            2.   Transportation right-of-ways, pedestrian crossings, public
access, boat ramps, docks, fishing platforms, unpaved paths (i.e., trails and
greenways), and stream bank stabilization efforts.
            3.   Utilities are allowed; and shall be installed a minimum
distance of twenty-five (25) feet measured perpendicular from the
jurisdictional line within the buffer area.
         c.   In order to maintain the functional value of the stream buffer,
indigenous vegetation may be removed as follows:
            1.   Dead, diseased, or dying trees that are in danger of falling
and causing damage to dwellings or other structures may be removed with
approval from the Public Works Department;
            2.   Debris in the buffer area that is caused by storm damage may
be removed; and
            3.   Invasive plant species may be removed if they are replaced by
native species that are equally effective in retarding runoff, preventing
erosion and filtering non-point source pollution from runoff. A buffer
restoration plan for removal of invasive species must be approved by the Public
Works Department.
   (d)   Shoreline Buffers.
      (1)   Shoreline buffers shall be considered an area of managed vegetation
adjacent to shorelines with hydrologic connectivity (stream leading into/out of
the pond/lake or obvious spring input). The shoreline buffer width shall be
fifty (50) feet perpendicular from the jurisdictional line. For ponds and
lakes, the buffer shall be a minimum of fifty (50) feet from the jurisdictional
line.
   For Lake Murray, the buffer shall be measured from the 360' elevation or
current jurisdictional line as determined by USACE.
      (2)   Shoreline Buffer Management and Maintenance. The function of the
shoreline buffer is to protect the physical and ecological integrity of the
water body by providing a functional distance to reduce flooding potential,
reduce erosion, sedimentation, and filter runoff between development and the
water body.
         a.   Management of the shoreline buffer includes specific limitations
on alteration of the natural conditions. The following structures, practices
and activities are restricted in the shoreline buffer unless prior approval is
granted by the Public Works Department:
            1.   Septic systems;
            2.   Permanent structures;
            3.   Impervious cover, with the exception of paths;
            4.   Soil disturbance by grading, stripping or other practice;
            5.   Filling or dumping;
            6.   Stormwater management facilities; and
            7.   Use, application, or storage of pesticides or herbicides
except for the spot spraying of noxious weeds or other non-native species
consistent with approved agency recommendations. (Richland County, South
Carolina Forestry Commission, South Carolina Electric & Gas’ Lake Management
Department).
         b.   The following structures, practices, or activities are permitted
in the shoreline buffer, subject to the prior approval of the Public Works
Department:
            1.   Biking or hiking paths;
            2.   Recreational uses as approved by the Public Works Department;
and
            3.   Limited tree or underbrush clearing with approval from the
Public Works Department.
   (e)   Water Quality Buffer Plat Requirements. All preliminary, bonded and
final plats prepared for recording and all right-of way-plats shall clearly:
      (1)   Show the extent of any stream or shoreline buffer on the subject
property by metes and bounds;
      (2)   Label the stream and shoreline buffer;
      (3)   Provide a note to reference all buffers stating: “There shall be no
clearing, grading, construction or disturbance of vegetation except as
permitted by the Public Works Department”;
      (4)   Provide a note to reference any protective covenants governing all
buffer areas stating: “Any buffer shown on the plat is subject to protective
covenants which may be found in the land records and which restrict disturbance
and use of these areas”;
      (5)   If the buffer area will not be part of an individual lot, then
ownership must be stated by identifying who is the responsible party; and
      (6)   Provide the location of permanent boundary marker signs.
   (f)   Design Requirements.
      (1)   The buffer plan must be submitted in conjunction with the sediment
and erosion control plan, SWPPP document, and all applicable calculations for a
land disturbance permit.
      (2)   It is recommended that the buffer be marked off with a warning
barrier (orange safety fence) to show that no disturbance is allowed in the
buffer area.
      (3)   The following steps shall be taken during the site plan development
and site construction process to protect water quality buffers during
construction:
         a.   Water quality buffers must be clearly identified on all
stormwater management plans and construction drawings and marked with the
statement “Water Quality Buffer. Do Not Disturb”.
         b.   Water quality buffers cannot be encroached upon or disturbed
during project construction, unless in accordance with Section 26-187(b),
Section 26-187(k) or unless they are being established, restored, or enhanced
in accordance with an approved Buffer Enhancement Plan.
         c.   Water quality buffers must be clearly marked with a warning
barrier before the preconstruction conference. The marking shall be maintained
until completion of construction activities. All contractors and others working
on the construction site must be made aware of the existence of the buffer(s)
and the restrictions on disturbing the buffer(s).
         d.   All areas of the water quality buffer, including stream banks,
must be left in the existing condition upon completion of construction
activities. Should construction activities associated with development cause
degradation to stream banks, all eroding, bare or unstable stream banks shall
be restored to existing conditions.
         e.   If any trees are allowed to be removed, the tree location shall
be shown and a note shall be provided stating that the tree must be hand
cleared.
         f.   The locations of all signage must be clearly shown on plans.
         g.   A narrative stating the extent of the buffer areas, including any
allowed disturbance in the buffer areas (this should be in the narrative as
well as in the SWPPP document), must be included with the plans.
         h.   A double row of silt fence (with metal posts and wire backing)
shall be shown on the upstream side of applicable buffer area(s) that are
adjacent to a land disturbance.
         i.   The stream buffer shall be shown and labeled on the engineering
plans, preliminary, bonded and final plat.
         j.   If the stream buffers are dedicated to Richland County, placed in
a conservation easement, or turned over to a Homeowners Association (HOA), the
buffers shall be maintained in accordance with the maintenance and inspection
requirements for permanent storm water management structures.
            1.   If the buffer is dedicated to Richland County:
               [a]   All property lines shall terminate at the water quality
buffer.
               [b]   Access easements shall be a minimum twenty (20) foot wide
to allow maintenance of the buffer. Access points for these easements will be
coordinated with storm drainage easements during the plan review process.
            2.   If placed in a conservation easement or if the easement is
held by a viable third party, such as a land trust, land management company, or
utility, the organization shall:
               [a]   Have the legal authority to accept and maintain such
easements;
               [b]   Be bona fide and in perpetual existence; and
               [c]   Have conveyance instruments that contain an appropriate
provision for retransfer in the event the organization becomes unable to carry-
out functions.
            3.   If given to an HOA, the following criteria must be met:
               [a]   Membership in the HOA is mandatory and automatic for all
homeowners for the subdivision and their successors;
               [b]   The HOA shall have lien authority to ensure the collection
of dues from all members; and
               [c]   The HOA assumes the responsibility for protecting,
monitoring and maintaining the area as an undisturbed natural area, in
perpetuity.
      (4)   Shoreline buffers shall be shown and labeled on the engineering
plans. Shoreline buffers shall be maintained by the owner in accordance with
the maintenance and inspection requirements for permanent storm water
management structures outlined in this chapter. Shoreline buffers may be deeded
to Richland County, placed in a conservation easement, or given to the HOA as
outlined in Section 26-187(f)(3)j.
   (g)   Water Quality Buffer Width Adjustments. Adjustments to the buffer
width shall be made for the following conditions:
      (1)   If streams are on a current 303d list or with an approved TMDL, the
buffer area shall be increased to one hundred (100) feet. However, see also
section 26-187(g)(10) below.
      (2)   If water bodies are on DHEC’S Outstanding National Resource Waters
(ONRW) list, the buffer area shall be increased to one hundred (100) feet.
However, see also section 26-187(g)(10) below.
      (3)   If there are fifteen percent (15%) to twenty-four percent (24%)
slopes within the required buffer area, the buffer width must be adjusted to
include an additional ten (10) feet.
      (4)   If there are twenty-five percent (25%) or greater slopes within the
required buffer area width, the buffer width must be adjusted to include an
additional twenty-five (25) feet.
      (5)   If the adjacent land use involves drain fields from on-site sewage
disposal and treatment systems (i.e., septic systems), subsurface discharges
from a wastewater treatment plant, or land application of bio-solids or animal
waste, the buffer area width must be adjusted to include an additional twenty-
five (25) feet.
      (6)   If the land use or activity involves the storage of hazardous
substances or petroleum facilities, the buffer area width must be adjusted to
include an additional fifty (50) feet. However, see also section 26-187(g)(10)
below.
      (7)   If the land use or activity involves raised septic systems or
animal feedlot operations, the buffer area width must be adjusted to include an
additional one hundred (100) feet. However, see also section 26-187(g)(10)
below.
      (8)   If the land use or activity involves solid waste landfills or
junkyards, the buffer area width must be adjusted to include an additional two-
hundred (200) feet. However, see also section 26-187(g)(10) below.
      (9)   If all on-site stormwater runoff is captured and routed through a
permanent water quality basin, and there is no sheet flow discharging into the
buffer, the buffer area may be reduced to twenty-five (25) feet. This is
intended to apply in limited situations, such as small commercial developments.
      (10)   If the applicant satisfactorily demonstrates that there will be no
degradation of the receiving water body by implementing the proposed storm
water quality controls, then the established buffer may be reduced on a case by
case basis upon approval by the Public Works Department.
   (h)   Water Quality Buffer Averaging. This subsection outlines the criteria
for buffer averaging on new and redevelopment sites. Buffer averaging can be
utilized to adjust the required buffer width, allowing some flexibility for
site development. Using buffer averaging, the width of the buffer can be varied
with the criteria stated below, as long as a minimum average width of fifty
(50) feet from the jurisdictional line are maintained.
      (1)   Requirements and policies. The following criteria must be met in
order to utilize buffer averaging on a development site:
         a.   Buffer averaging is required for water quality buffers that have
stream crossings.
         b.   An overall average buffer width of fifty (50) feet, depending on
the water quality buffer requirement, must be achieved within the boundaries of
the property to be developed.
         c.   The average width must be calculated based upon the entire length
of the stream bank or shoreline that is located within the boundaries of the
property to be developed. When calculating the buffer length, the natural
stream channel should be followed.
         d.   Stream buffer averaging shall be applied to each side of a stream
independently. If the property being developed includes both sides of a stream,
buffer averaging can be applied to both sides of the stream, but must be
applied to each side of the stream independently.
         e.   That portion of buffers in excess of one hundred (100) feet will
not be credited toward the buffer averaging formula within the boundaries of
the property to be developed. The total width of the buffer shall not be less
than twenty-five (25) feet, or the width of the floodway at any location,
except at approved stream crossings. Those areas of the buffer having a minimum
width of twenty-five (25) feet (or less at approved stream crossings) can
comprise no more than fifty percent (50%) of the buffer length.
      (2)   Areas where buffer averaging is prohibited. Buffer width averaging
is prohibited when the result of averaging would allow any of the land uses
listed below to exist within the pre-averaged buffer area:
         a.   Developments or facilities that include on-site sewage disposal
and treatment systems (i.e., septic systems), raised septic systems, subsurface
discharges from a wastewater treatment plant, or land application of bio-solids
or animal waste;
         b.   Landfills (demolition landfills, permitted landfills, closed-in-
place landfills);
         c.   Junkyards;
         d.   Commercial or industrial facilities that store and/or service
motor vehicles;
         e.   Commercial greenhouses or landscape supply facilities;
         f.   Developments or facilities that have commercial or public pools;
         g.   Animal care facilities, kennels, and commercial/business
developments or facilities that provide short-term or long-term care of
animals;
         h.   Other land uses deemed by the Public Works Department to have the
potential to generate higher than normal pollutant loadings.
   (i)   Signage. For subdivisions, permanent boundary marker signs are
required for stream buffers prior to bonding of the subdivision and/or
finalizing the subdivision with the intent to transfer property. Permanent
boundary markers are required to ensure that property owners are aware of the
buffer. Permanent boundary markers are recommended, but not required, in
shoreline buffers. The Public Works Department has the authority to require the
person or entity responsible for permanent maintenance of the buffer to replace
boundary markers that have been removed or destroyed. The following general
requirements shall apply to buffer boundary markers:
      (1)   Generally, buffer boundary markers shall be located on the landward
edge of the buffer, and at other locations which will approximately delineate
the buffer boundary. For commercial developments, markers shall be posted every
one hundred (100) feet along the buffer boundary. For subdivisions where
multiple lots are located along the buffer, it is recommended that a buffer
boundary marker be located at the intersection of every other lot line with the
landward edge of the buffer.
      (2)   Buffer boundary markers shall include the statement “Water Quality
Buffer - Do Not Disturb”.
      (3)   Where possible, the markers should be mounted to a tree larger than
three (3) inches in diameter. Where it is not possible to mount the marker to a
tree, a treated wood or metal signpost must be used. The post must extend below
the ground surface at least twenty four (24) inches.
      (4)   The boundary markers must be mounted between four (4) and six (6)
feet above the ground surface.
      (5)   The boundary markers must be at least twelve by eighteen inches
(12"x 18").
      (6)   Buffer boundary markers may be purchased from the Public Works
Department or from another vendor.
   (j)   Buffer Restoration and Enhancement Plans. Buffer restoration is
required when a buffer is disturbed without prior approval from the Public
Works Department. A developer or property owner may also wish to enhance a
buffer to bring it closer to an optimal, undisturbed native forest condition.
Prior to reestablishing or planting the buffer, a restoration or enhancement
plan must be submitted to and approved by the Public Works Department. Buffet
restoration and/or enhancement plans must include the following:
      (1)   A drawing or plan that shows the location of the buffer in relation
to the existing or planned development and to the buffered waterway; the
disturbance limits for the planned buffer restoration; direction of flow of
runoff from the site and flow within the water feature; erosion prevention and
sediment control measures to be installed to protect the waterway; any existing
or proposed stream crossings; existing or proposed stream bank stabilization
measures; access to a water source for the purposes of watering vegetation; and
other pertinent information. For large scale restoration and enhancement
projects the plan(s) must be stamped by a registered landscape architect.
      (2)   A visual plan and a narrative that describe the vegetation plan for
the buffer: stream buffers must be planted with native trees, shrubs, and
grasses that will not be mowed. Suitable native plants can be chosen from the
recommended plant species, as listed in the “Stormwater Design Manual”. Species

ARTICLE VIII. RESOURCE PROTECTION STANDARDS
Sec. 26-201. General.
   (a)   Purpose. In order to protect the general health, safety and welfare of
the people of Richland County, and to protect the natural assets and resources
for posterity, this article is enacted to protect the lands and waters from the
effects of excessive soil erosion and sedimentation, to prevent siltation of
streams and lakes, to prevent clogging of drainage channels, and to prevent
damages to the property of adjacent landowners. It is furthermore the purpose
of this article to provide proper drainage channels, clear of obstruction, for
stormwater runoff; to control pollution of streams and drainage channels by
urban stormwater runoff; and to prevent encroachment into natural drainage
channels by buildings or other land improvements. Proper management of the
quality and quantity of stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and
private property, ensure a functional drainage system, promote the attainment
and maintenance of property, ensure a functional drainage system, promote the
attainment and maintenance of water quality standards, enhance the local
environment associated with the drainage system, maintain as nearly as possible
the predevelopment runoff characteristics of the area, and facilitate economic
development while mitigating associated flooding and drainage impacts.
   (b)   Jurisdiction. The provisions of this article dealing with erosion and
sediment control (Section
26-202 of this chapter) and stormwater management (Section
26-203 of this chapter) shall apply to all land in the unincorporated areas of
Richland County, South Carolina and to all land within the jurisdiction of
those municipalities that agree, in writing, to have these provisions
administered within their corporate limits.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-202. Stormwater management and SWPPPs.
   (a)   Applicability. Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, the surface
of land in the county shall not be disturbed or changed for any purpose, except
in accordance with this section and other applicable sections of this chapter.
   (b)   Guidelines. For all sites subject to this section, an SWPPP shall be
prepared based on the following guidelines (see Section
26-64 of this chapter for procedural requirements for review). Plans shall
include appropriate measures and practices for erosion and sediment control,
installed in a timely sequence during the development process, and maintained
to ensure their proper function.
      (1)   Land selection for development. Land should be selected where the
drainage pattern, topography, and soils are favorable for the intended use.
Tracts of land vary in suitability for different uses. Consideration shall be
given to the major characteristics of the land area and the kinds of soil
(identifying and evaluating potential erosion and sediment problems) and to the
selection of appropriate control measures and practices.
      (2)   Land exposure. The erosion and sediment control plan shall expose
the smallest practical area of land for the least possible time during
development.
      (3)   Retention of vegetation and topsoil. When feasible, natural
vegetation shall be retained and protected. Topsoil, where practical, shall be
saved for replacing on graded areas.
      (4)   Temporary measures. Temporary plant cover, mulching and/or
structures shall be utilized to protect areas subject to erosion during
construction.
      (5)   Provisions for increased runoff. Provisions shall be made for the
increased runoff caused by changed soil and surface conditions. Emphasis should
be placed on conservation of existing on-site soil. Effective means include the
use of diversion ditches, grassed or surfaced waterways and outlets, enlarged
and protected drainage channels, grade control structures, and effective use of
road gutters and storm sewers.
      (6)   Silt traps. Sediment basins or other forms of silt traps shall be
used, where practical, to remove heavy sediment loads from runoff waters
leaving the disturbed area.
      (7)   Long-term measures. Permanent vegetative cover and long-term
erosion protection measures or structures shall be installed as soon as
practical in the development process.
   (c)   Requirements and standards.
      (1)   Methods of calculating stream flow and runoff. SWPPPs shall be
based on stream flow and runoff for the site to be developed. Formulas and
values as prescribed in the county’s “Stormwater Design Manual” shall be used
for calculating all stream flow and runoff. Copies of the “Stormwater Design
Manual” may be obtained through the county engineer’s office.
         a.   Rainfall frequencies. The following rainfall frequencies shall be
used in the calculations for stormwater runoff and stormwater management
facility design, depending upon the size of the watershed:
 
Size-Acres Frequency-Years
300+       50 year
40 - 299   25 year
0-39       10 year
 
The two (2) year, twenty-four (24) hour rainfall shall also be used as
prescribed in the “Stormwater Design Manual”.
         b.   Future development. Calculations used in the design of proposed
stormwater management facilities shall reflect the anticipated future
development of the upstream watershed.
         c.   Inlet and outlet control curves. Appropriate inlet control and
outlet control curves shall be used to determine headwater depths, where
applicable.
      (2)   Primary drainage channel requirements.
         a.   General. All primary drainage channels located within or
immediately adjacent to any improvement, development or subdivision shall be
protected or improved by the applicant in accordance with the following
requirements. The applicant shall be responsible for carrying out the proposed
work in accordance with the approved SWPPP, and in compliance with the
requirements of this section. The applicant shall plan and carry out his/her
developments in a manner that will not interfere with or restrict the flow of
water, nor increase the 100-year flood elevation by more than one (1) foot. The
developer shall be responsible for any improvements to such channels, as needed
to handle increased runoff or other changes resulting from his/her development,
in accordance with the provisions of this section.
         b.   Dedication of primary drainage channels. All land adjacent to a
primary drainage channel and not protected by levees, dikes, or fill shall be
dedicated for the purpose of providing drainage right-of-way as follows:
            1.   Commercial and/or residential subdivisions. In commercial and/
or residential subdivisions, drainage easements of satisfactory width to
provide working room for construction and maintenance equipment shall be deeded
to the county for all drainage improvements, including stormwater management
facilities, and shall be separate and apart from adjoining lots.
            2.   Planned developments or town and country developments. In PDD
Planned Development Districts or TC Town and Country Districts, the property
owner(s) or HOA shall be responsible for maintenance of drainage channels and
easements. The final plat approved for recordation shall indicate the available
public easements for drainage channels. The county shall have the right to
encroach onto these public easements or permit others to encroach for any
purpose deemed appropriate by the county engineer. In no way does this right of
encroachment lessen the obligation of the property owner(s) or the
responsibility of the HOA for maintenance of the drainage channels and
easements.
         c.   Existing channel modifications. It is the intent of these
regulations that existing drainage channels within buffer areas be maintained
in their natural conditions whenever possible and whenever engineering is
feasible. It is recognized that additional capacity may be required, and the
ability to maintain such facilities must be provided, for which the following
provisions shall be followed. The existing channel lying within or contiguous
to a subdivision or parcel of land proposed for development or redevelopment
may be:
            1.   Cleaned to provide for free flow of water; and
            2.   Straightened, widened, and improved to prevent overflow
resulting from the 50-year frequency rainfall beyond the limits of the
dedicated drainage easement provided for in subsection b. above; provided:
               [a]   The SWPPP contains details of the proposed channel
modifications and includes either:
                  [1]   A mitigation plan for water quality impacts, including
best management practices to be implemented as part of the channel modification
and overall project; or
                  [2]   An engineering analysis demonstrating no water quality
impacts resulting from the proposed modifications.
               [b]   The SWPPP must be approved in accordance with this section
prior to commencing any channel modifications.
Whenever existing channel modifications are made, sodding, backsloping,
cribbing, and other bank protection shall be designed and constructed to
control erosion for the anticipated conditions and How resulting from a 50-year
rainfall.

final grading of all lots and building sites for new construction, or
substantial improvement of residential structures, shall provide for elevation
on fill, pilings, or earth filled curtain walls of the lowest habitable floor
to at least two (2) feet above the 100-year flood elevation. Where fill is
added to meet this requirement, the area two (2) feet above the 100-year flood
elevation shall extend at least ten (10) feet from each side of the building
pad. Certain types of structures are permitted within the floodplain if
properly "flood-proofed" in compliance with Section
26-106(d) of this chapter and all applicable building code requirements.
         e.   Primary channels located within road easements. Primary drainage
channels located within road easements shall be placed in enclosed storm
sewers, except under the following conditions:
            1.   Where a paved road surface at least two (2) lanes wide is
provided on both sides of an improved channel so as to provide access to
abutting properties.
            2.   For lots with a double-road frontage, an open drainage channel
is permitted between the rear lot line and the paved road, provided that access
from the road to the lot is prohibited both at the time of construction and in
the future.
            3.   When a condition outlined in either 1. or 2. above is present,
adequate width shall be dedicated as right-of-way to provide for the
maintenance of an improved drainage channel and its bank.
         f.   Levees protecting structures. All levees protecting residential
structures or non-residential structures that are not flood-proofed shall be
designed, constructed, and maintained to provide protection against the 500-
year flood, plus three (3) feet of freeboard. Flood elevations shall be as
shown on the latest Flood Insurance Rate Maps or as determined by appropriate
hydrologic methods. Any levee constructed or improved under this subsection
shall also comply with the other provisions of this article, including, but not
limited to, subsection g. below.
         g.   Structures or obstructions in regulatory floodway. Not
withstanding any other provision of this chapter, no levees, dikes, fill
materials, structures or obstructions that will impede the free flow of water
during times of flood will be permitted in the regulatory floodway, unless:
            1.   Such proposed impediment is a permitted use pursuant to
Section
26-106(d) of this chapter; or
            2.   Such impediment was approved by the county engineer under this
subsection g., or under any predecessor provision, before January 1, 2001;
   PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any specified activity permitted above must comply
with all applicable federal, state, and local requirements, including, but not
limited to, 44 C.F.R. 60.3(d)(3), as amended. Nothing in this subsection g.
shall limit provisions in this chapter or elsewhere authorizing or requiring
the maintenance and repair of levees, dikes, dams, and similar structures;
provided, however, that this sentence shall not be construed as authorizing or
requiring the repair or maintenance of any such structure to the extent that
such repair or maintenance would result in a structure that would be higher or
wider than it was before the need arose for such repair or maintenance.
         h.   National Flood Insurance Program. All applicable regulations of
the National Flood Insurance Program are incorporated by reference herein.
      (3)   Secondary drainage channel and surface requirements.
         a.   General. All secondary drainage channels that are within or
immediately adjacent to an improvement, development, or subdivision shall be
protected and improved by the applicant in accordance with the following
requirements.
         b.   Drainage maintenance. Drainage easements of satisfactory width to
provide working room for construction and maintenance equipment shall be
dedicated to the county for all drainage improvements in subdivision
developments, including stormwater management facilities. Drainage improvement
maintenance for planned developments, town and country developments, and
commercial buildings shall be the responsibility of the property owner(s) or
HOA.
         c.   Improvements.
            1.   Secondary drainage channels having a primary function of, 1)
collecting surface water from adjacent properties, or 2) intercepting and
diverting side hill drainage, shall be improved open channels.
            2.   Secondary drainage channels having a primary function of, 1)
transporting surface water through a block or development; or 2) collecting
surface water from cross channels, shall be improved as follows:
               [a]   Secondary drainage channels having drainage basins forty
(40) acres or larger shall be improved with either a closed storm sewer or
improved open channel designed to carry the runoff resulting from a 25-year
frequency rainfall. A natural stream may be approved by the county engineer for
environmental or aesthetic purposes, provided that it has the required carrying
capacity and that flood protection requirements are met.
               [b]   Secondary drainage channels having less than forty (40)
acres shall be improved with closed storm sewers designed to carry the runoff
resulting from a 10-year frequency rainfall. Variation from this requirement
may be approved by the county engineer for environmental or aesthetic purposes,
provided that it has the required carrying capacity and that flood protection
requirements are met.
            3.   All improvements to drainage channels shall be carried out
such that waters protected by the Federal Clean Water Act are not degraded.
         d.   Areas of special flood hazard. In areas of special flood hazard,
final grading of all lots and building sites for new construction, or
substantial improvement of residential structures, shall provide for elevation
on fill, pilings, or earth filled curtain walls of the lowest habitable floor
to at least two (2) feet above the 100-year flood elevation. Where fill is
added to meet this requirement, the area two (2) feet above the 100-year flood
elevation shall extend at least ten (10) feet from each side of the building
pad. Certain types of structures are permitted within the floodplain if
properly “flood-proofed” in compliance with Section 26-104(d) of this chapter
and all applicable building code requirements.
         e.   Secondary drainage channels within road easements. Secondary
drainage channels located within road easements shall be placed in enclosed
storm sewers, except under the following conditions:
            1.   Where a paved road surface at least two (2) lanes wide is
provided on both sides of an improved channel so as to provide access to
abutting properties.
            2.   For lots with a double-road frontage, an open drainage channel
is permitted between the rear lot line and the paved road, provided that access
from the road to the lot is prohibited both at the time of construction and in
the future.
            3.   When a condition outlined in either 1. or 2. above is present,
adequate width shall be dedicated as right-of-way to provide for the
maintenance of an improved drainage channel and its bank.
         f.   Off-site discharges. Off-site discharges from closed storm sewers
or improved open channels will only be permitted at natural streams or man-made
drainage channels acceptable to the county engineer, unless a drainage easement
is obtained from the adjoining landowner. Adequate provisions shall be made to
reduce discharge velocities such that the receiving channel is not degraded.
When off-site drainage channels are not adequate to accept the additional
runoff resulting from development, the developer shall install on-site
facilities for controlled release of stormwater runoff. These on-site drainage
facilities shall be designed to limit the runoff rate to predevelopment levels
during the design storm and the two-year storm.
         g.   Additional development requirements.
            1.   Single-family residential, duplex or manufactured home
development. Site grading for single-family, duplex, or manufactured home
development shall be carried out in such a manner that surface water from each
dwelling lot will flow directly to a storm sewer, improved channel, sodded
swale, or paved road without running more than two hundred (200) feet. Rooftop
runoff may be directed to pervious areas, infiltration practices, rainwater
harvesting systems, or other stormwater treatment facilities on the dwelling
lot.
            2.   Commercial, industrial, multi-family, and institutional
development. For commercial, industrial, multi-family, and institutional
development, roofs, paved areas, yards, courts, courtyards, and other
impervious surfaces shall be drained into a stormwater management facility,
with the exception that such drainage may flow directly into a road, curb and
gutter system, or improved channel when of small area and approved by the
county engineer. Construction of buildings over storm drainage improvements is
not permitted.
         h.   Surface water on roads. Surface water collected on roads shall be
diverted to enclosed storm sewers or drainage channels at satisfactory
intervals to prevent overflow of the road and its curbs and gutters, where
provided, during a 10-year frequency rainfall.
      (4)   Minimum water quality requirements.
         a.   Minimum water quality requirements. Requirements from the current
“Stormwater Design Manual” and “BMP Manual” shall be followed, and shall
provide for minimum quality control requirements for development. Such
requirements shall be adhered to unless waived by the county engineer after a
determination that both of the following have occurred:
            1.   It can be shown, by engineering calculations acceptable to the
county engineer, that stormwater management facilities are not needed to
control developed peak discharge rates and meet water quality requirements.
            2.   It can be shown that installing such facilities would not be
in the best interest of local citizens or the county.
         b.   Additional requirements. The county engineer may determine that
additional stormwater management facilities, beyond those required under this
section, are necessary for on-site stormwater management. Additional facilities
may be needed to enhance or provide for the general health, safety, and
welfare; to correct unacceptable or undesirable existing conditions; or to
provide protection for future development in a more desirable fashion. If such
a determination is made, the county engineer may do the following:
            1.   Require that the owner/applicant grant any necessary easements
to provide access to or drainage from the stormwater management facility.
            2.   Develop an agreement with the owner/applicant for the over-
design of the stormwater management facility to provide additional water
quality benefits beyond that required by this section.
            3.   Recommend financial participation by the county in
construction of the stormwater management facility, to the extent that such
facility exceeds the on-site stormwater management requirements, as determined
by -the county engineer. The county may pay the additional expenses incurred in
providing the additional storage capacity or water quality benefits, including
land costs and increased design and construction costs.
      (5)   Design criteria for improvements.
         a.   Open channels. Open channels shall be provided with an improved
section that will carry runoff from the appropriate design storm and preclude
the creation of backwater inundating any areas outside of dedicated drainage
easements. The channel shall be designed to minimize negative water quality
impacts and protect against erosion in accordance with standards adopted by the
county engineer.
         b.   Closed storm sewers and culverts. Closed storm sewers and
culverts shall be constructed of pre-cast or prefabricated pipe or box culvert
or built in place, of closed box design, in conformity with county
specifications. They shall be sized to carry the runoff from the appropriate
design storm and to preclude the creation of headwater inundating any areas
outside of dedicated drainage easements.
         c.   Bridges. Bridges shall be designed in accordance with standards
adopted by the county engineer. Construction shall be in accordance with South
Carolina Department of Transportation specifications.
         d.   Levees. Levees shall be designed, constructed, and maintained as
follows:
         1.   USACE Manuals. Design and construction shall be in accordance
with the latest edition of the USACE's Manual EM 1110-2-1913 Design and
Construction of Levees. The design and construction of drainage systems within
levees shall be in accordance with the latest edition of the USACE's Manual EM
1110-2-1413 Hydrologic Analysis of Interior Areas. A South Carolina Registered
Professional Engineer shall certify that he/she has been involved in the
design, construction, and inspection phases and shall certify that the
construction meets requirements of the corps of engineers.
            2.   Maintenance. Owners of levees will perform the necessary and
required maintenance and provide appropriate records to the county engineer.
These records shall include all of the following:
               [a]   Signed agreements of perpetual operation and maintenance
between the constructor and/or owner and the county.
               [b]   As-built construction plans sealed by a South Carolina
Registered Professional Engineer.
               [c]   A levee maintenance program in accordance with the levee
maintenance standards and procedures of the county.
               [d]   Periodic maintenance reports as required by the county
engineer.
         e.   Stormwater management facilities.
            1.   General. Stormwater management facilities may include both
structural and non-structural elements incorporating quantity and/or quality
control. A variety of different types of stormwater management facilities exist
and can be used to satisfy the minimum quantity and/or quality control
requirements. All proposed stormwater control measures shall be in accordance
with the county’s “Stormwater Design Manual”. The county engineer may reject a
SWPPP if it incorporates structures and facilities that do not meet the
requirements of this section or if the plan utilizes numerous small structures
where other alternatives are physically possible.
            2.   Restriction of runoff rate. Stormwater management facilities
shall restrict the peak post-development runoff rate to the peak pre-
development rate for the design storm. The design storm shall be ten (10),
twenty-five (25), or fifty (50) years, depending on the size of the drainage
basin. Overflow structures and emergency spillways shall be designed to
accommodate the 100-year rainfall.
            3.   Wet ponds. Wet ponds (retention structures with a permanent
pool) shall be utilized for drainage areas of twenty-five (25) acres or more,
in accordance with the county’s “Stormwater Design Manual”. Wet ponds may be
required for smaller drainage areas, as determined by the county engineer on a
case-by-case basis. In all cases, wet ponds shall be located at least fifteen
(15) feet from the property line of adjacent property.
            4.   Wet (retention) and dry (detention) facilities. Where wet
(retention) and dry (detention) facilities are used, designs that consolidate
them into a limited number of large structures are preferred over designs
utilizing a large number of smaller structures. Additional state and/or federal
permits may be required for larger stormwater management facilities impacting
waters of the state protected by the Federal Clean Water Act.
            5.   Landscaping. Landscaping of stormwater management areas shall
conform to ah requirements of this chapter and to the design approved by the
Public Works Department for any particular development. Retention/detention
areas shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs, ground covers, and native
perennials appropriate to the function as a wet or dry basin. If the landscaped
area is also designed to meet on-site stormwater management requirements, one
of the following must be met:
               [a]   The area must be designed to provide an aesthetic focal
point, such as a lake, creek or other water feature; to preserve a tree
grouping; or to utilize the existing terrain and/or geological features of the
site; or
               [b]   The landscaping for the basin shall be integrated within
the entire landscape plan.
            6.   Stormwater facilities records requirements. Drainage system
and all stormwater management structures within the county (including public
and private portions) shall be designed to the same engineering and technical
criteria and standards Owners of stormwater management facilities shall perform
the required maintenance and provide appropriate records to the county
engineer. These records shall include all of the following:
               [a]   As-built construction plans certified by a South Carolina
Registered Civil Engineer, Registered Landscape Architect, or Tier B. Land
Surveyor; and
               [b]   Periodic maintenance reports as required by the county
engineer.
      (6)   Maintenance of stormwater management facilities.
         a.   General maintenance requirements. All stormwater management
facilities shall be maintained by the owner(s) in such a manner as to maintain
and enhance the general health, safety, and welfare; to reduce and minimize
damage to public and private property; to reduce and minimize the impact of
such facilities on land and stream channel erosion; to promote the attainment
and maintenance of water quality standards; and to maintain, as nearly as
possible, the pre-development runoff characteristics of the area. All
maintenance of privately owned stormwater management facilities shall be at the
sole cost and expense of the owner(s) of such facilities.
         b.   Failure to maintain stormwater management facilities. It shall be
unlawful for the owner or occupant of any property upon which a stormwater
management facility is located, to fail to maintain the facility in such a
manner that the facility creates a danger to the general health, safety, and
welfare. Should the owner fail to so maintain the stormwater management
facility, this failure shall constitute a violation of this chapter and shall
be subject to the penalty provisions of Section 26-272.
         c.   County assistance in maintenance. All stormwater management
facilities shall be privately owned and/or maintained unless the county accepts
the facility for county ownership and/or maintenance. The county may assist
with maintenance only if the county has entered into a maintenance agreement
and the owner provides an easement (and provided that the county has available
resources to provide such assistance).
   (d)   Inspection of stormwater facilities.
      (1)   Inspection during construction. The county engineer shall
periodically inspect the work completed under the approved SWPPP. Upon
completion of such work, he/she shall make a final inspection, and if the work
has been carried out in accordance with the plan, he/she shall issue a letter
of satisfactory completion upon receipt of the as-built drawings.
      (2)   Right of entry.
         a.   General. The county engineer shall have a right-of-entry on or
upon the property of any person subject to this section. The county engineer
shall be provided ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of
inspection, monitoring, sampling, inventory, examination and copying of
records, and the performance of any other duties necessary to determine
compliance with this section.
         b.   Security. Where a person has security measures in force requiring
proper identification and clearance before entry onto the premises, the person
shall make necessary arrangements with security guards so that, upon
presentation of suitable identification, the county engineer will be permitted
to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
         c.   Sampling. The county engineer shall have the right to set up on
the person’s property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or
metering of the property as it relate to stormwater management
         d.   Obstruction to access. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to
safe and easy access to the areas to be inspected and/or monitored shall be
removed promptly by the person at the written or verbal request of the county
engineer. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the person.
         e.   Imminent threat to health and/or safety. In cases where an
imminent threat to the health or safety of the general public or the
environment is suspected, the county engineer or the director of emergency
services shall inspect existing stormwater management facilities to determine
if immediate action is necessary. Such inspection shall be made with or without
the consent of the owner, manager, or signatory official. If such consent is
refused, the county engineer may seek issuance of an administrative search
warrant.
   (e)   Levees.
      (1)   General. Adequate levee maintenance is essential and cannot be
overemphasized. Failure to properly maintain levees may render the levees
inoperative during periods when their protection is needed. For safety in times
of high water or floods, levee maintenance will be thorough and continuous.
This requires a balanced maintenance program based on defined standards and
procedures.
      (2)   Maintenance standards and procedures. Levees in Richland County
will be maintained in accordance with the following standards to ensure
serviceability against floods at all times.
         a.   Sod growth. Maintenance of a sturdy sod growth on levee
embankments is highly important, as sod is one of the most effective means of
protecting the levee against erosion from rain, current, and wavewash. Periodic
mowing with tractor-operated equipment is essential to maintaining a good sod
growth, and shall be done at such intervals as necessary to keep down weeds and
other noxious growth and to prevent the grass height from exceeding twelve (12)
inches. The grass shall be mowed to a height of no less than two (2) inches but
no greater than twelve (12) inches. The number of mowings required each season
will depend on local conditions. The last mowing of the season shall be
accomplished under conditions that allow the grass to obtain a height of
approximately eight (8) inches to ten (10) inches entering the winter season.
Mowing shall be performed to a distance of at least five (5) feet beyond the
toe of the levee or berm. Burning grass and weeds is not permitted in the levee
maintenance program, except during appropriate seasons when it is not
detrimental to sod growth. During the growing season, spraying with herbicides
on an as-needed basis is permissible and desirable for weed and brush control
on levees and berms. Reseeding and fertilizing shall be completed frequently
enough to sustain sod growth on levee embankments for erosion control.
         b.   Earth embankments. Levee embankments shall be maintained to not
less than the design grade and section by replacing any material lost from the
crown or slopes. Ruts, washes, slides and subsidence shall be promptly repaired
and the entire embankment maintained sufficiently smooth for power mowing.
Levee crowns shall be graded as necessary to drain freely and prevent
impoundment of rainwater. All brush, trees, and other undesirable growth shall
be removed from the levee embankment.
         c.   Animal burrows. Levees and adjacent landward areas shall be
maintained free of all types of animal burrows. Animal burrows, when found,
will be backfilled with compacted material and sodded. To prevent recurrence,
efforts will be made to exterminate the burrowing animals.
         d.   Prevention of encroachment. Care must be taken to assure that
levees are not encroached upon. Buildings, structures, and storage of materials
or equipment shall not be permitted on the levee. Refuse dumps are an item of
frequent concern and will not be permitted. Following each high water, any
debris deposited on the riverside slope of the levee shall be removed promptly.
         e.   Roads and ramps. Access roads to and on the levees, including
ramps, shall be bladed as necessary to keep the roadway shaped properly and
free of ruts, pockets, and washes. Ramp embankments shall be maintained to
their design section and design grade. Maintenance shall be performed as
necessary to correct any encroachment into the levee crown where roads cross
levees. Road surfacing material shall be replaced as necessary to maintain the
road surface in good condition.
         f.   Miscellaneous levee facilities and appurtenances. Levee
facilities and appurtenances that are constructed on, over, or through the
levee shall be maintained in a good state of repair and/or inspected at least
annually. Facilities and appurtenances that operate only during high water must
be checked carefully and repaired as necessary, immediately prior to high water
season. Relief wells shall be checked during periods of high water. Wells that
do not flow for an extended period of time may have to be tested by pumping to
determine the extent of deterioration. Critically deteriorated wells shall be
rehabilitated by cleaning, surging, and pumping. Check valves shall be
inspected to ensure that they open freely and that the gaskets are in good
condition. The most common of the facilities and appurtenances referred to
herein are:
            1.   Drainage structures through the levee.
            2.   Toe drainage systems.
            3.   Relief wells.
            4.   Levee slope protection and protection on dike ends.
            5.   Gates, cattle guards, and fences.
            6.   Siphons and pipe crossings.
      (3)   Inspection. Frequent inspections are essential to a good levee
maintenance program. In addition to the formal inspections required by the
engineer, inspections shall be made prior to the beginning of the flood season,
during and immediately following each high water period, and at such
intermediate times as necessary to ensure satisfactory care of the levee.
   (f)   Supplemental regulations. All applicable provisions of the Standards
for Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction (Sections 72-301, 302, 305,
307, 308, 312, 313, 314, 315, 316) administered by the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control pursuant to the South Carolina
Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Act of 1991 are incorporated
herein by reference.

055-12HR, § XV, 10-16-12; Ord. No. 053-17HR, §§ XXIII - XXVI, 11-14-17)
Sec. 26-203. NPDES Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) Program.
   (a)   Purpose and applicability.
      (1)   Purpose. The primary intent of this section is to minimize the
introduction of pollutants into stormwater runoff and subsequently into surface
waters of the state. This will be accomplished through the implementation of
programs developed to address specific activities that contribute to the
contamination of stormwater. Richland County is required by its NPDES permit to
regulate all discharges within the political boundary of the county; therefore,
the county will take any measures necessary to comply with its permit and
protect water quality within the jurisdictional areas defined with the NPDES
permit. Discharge of pollutants shall be reduced to the Maximum Extent
Practicable (MEP), shall not cause, nor contribute to, violations of South
Carolina water quality standards, and shall be in compliance with TMDLs where
applicable.
      (2)   General. Applicability. The DHEC re-issued NPDES permit is hereby
adopted in its entirety. This adoption includes individual programs developed
as part of the implementation of the NPDES permit. The current NPDES permit
became effective on September 11, 2006 and expires on September 10, 2011. The
duration of the adoption of the NPDES permit will be for a term of five (5)
years, and will be automatically renewed for a like term unless this provision
is amended by County Council with an intent to terminate. Richland County
personnel, the Director of Public Works, and Stormwater Management personnel,
or their designees, may enforce any of the regulations in regards to DHEC
delegated Richland County’s NPDES storm water discharge permit programs or
language.
   (b)   Components of NPDES MS4 Program.
      (1)   Pesticide, Herbicide and Fertilizer (PHF) program. The intent of
the PHF program is to aid Richland County in reducing the discharge of
pollutants related to the storage and application of PHFs applied by county
employees or residents or contractors to public rights-of-way, parks, and other
property.
         a.   All commercial and non-commercial application of pesticides is
regulated in the state of South Carolina by the Department of Pesticide
Regulation (DPR). The DPR requires mandatory licensing for applicators involved
in pest control activities in structural, landscape and turf, aquatic, and
public health areas.
         b.   Only Richland County staff members who are properly licensed by
the DPR, or who are directly supervised by a licensed applicator, will be
permitted to apply pesticides and herbicides.
         c.   Commercial Applicators.
            1.   Richland County will only contract for pesticide and herbicide
application with commercial applicators that are licensed through the DPR.
            2.   All commercial applicators who are contracted by the county
will maintain current licensing through the DPR throughout the entire contract
with the county.
            3.   Commercial applicators contracted by the county to apply
pesticides and herbicides must provide written notification to the appropriate
county divisional manager, the Public Works Director, or the Vector Control
Director (or their designee) prior to commencement of any work involving PHF
application.
         d.   Inspections may be conducted within the county by the Stormwater
Manager or designee to ensure compliance with the PHF Program. The county may
require monitoring if deemed necessary to protect water quality within the
county.
      (2)   Illicit Connections, Illegal Discharges, Illegal Dumping, Improper
Disposal, Organic Waste and Spills. The intent of this section is to aid
Richland County in reducing and eliminating the discharge of pollutants to the
county’s MS4 related to illicit/illegal discharges, illegal dumping,
destruction of stormwater facilities, improper disposal, organic waste and
spills. This section will also fulfill one of the minimum control measures of
the Phase II Rule: IDDB. The county shall have the authority to carry out all
inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to determine
compliance and noncompliance with permit conditions, including the prohibition
on illicit discharges to the county’s municipal separate storm sewer, as well
as the stormwater systems within the jurisdictional areas of its NPDES co-
permittees.
         a.   Illicit Connections.
            1.   It shall be unlawful to connect or allow connection to any
sanitary sewer. This includes existing connections.
            2.   It shall be unlawful to cause or allow an illicit discharge to
the stormwater system, or any component thereof, or onto driveways, sidewalks,
parking lots, sinkholes, creek banks, or other areas draining to the stormwater
system.
            3.   Building permits shall be required before the construction of
any connection to the county’s publicly owned stormwater management system.
         b.   Improper Disposal. It shall be unlawful to use any stream or
watercourse to carry off water from any kitchen sink, bathtub, or privy, or to
carry off any fluid of an offensive or dangerous nature. No water or refuse
from any industrial, commercial, or institutional process, including water used
for heating or cooling, shall be discharged in any stream or watercourse by any
person until such person has obtained the appropriate local, state, and/or
federal permits. Richland County shall be allowed on-site if there is a
suspected illegal discharge for inspection and monitoring as deemed appropriate
for the protection of water quality.
         c.   Illegal Dumping. It shall be unlawful to dispose of any trash or
wastes in an unpermitted area or by disposing of such trash or waste into any
storm drain or stormwater conveyance. Richland County shall be allowed on-site
if there is suspected illegal dumping for inspection and monitoring as deemed
appropriate. In addition, all provisions and authority contained within Chapter
12 (Garbage, Trash and Refuse) and Chapter 13 (Hazardous Materials) of this
Code of Ordinances that are applicable to the protection of water quality shall
be incorporated by reference to this section.
         d.   Destruction of Stormwater Facilities. It shall be unlawful,
either willfully or negligently, to injure, deface, mutilate, destroy, tamper
or interfere with any county-owned property or any property used in the
county’s publicly owned stormwater management system.
         e.   Illegal Discharges. It shall be unlawful for any person to
discharge non-stormwater to any stormwater conveyance. The following non-storm
water discharges to the MS4, wherever they are not a source of pollutants, are
permitted:
            1.   Water line flushing.
            2.   Diverted stream flows.
            3.   Rising ground water.
            4.   Uncontaminated ground water infiltration (as defined at 40 CFR
35.2005 [20]) to separate storm sewers.
            5.   Uncontaminated pumped ground water discharges from potable
water sources.
            6.   Foundation drains.
            7.   Air conditioning condensation.
            8.   Irrigation water.
            9.   Springs
            10.   Water from crawl space pumps.
            11.   Footing drains.
            12.   Lawn watering.
            13.   Car washing at one’s residence, not for hire.
            14.   Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands.
            15.   Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges.
            16.   Road wash water.
            17.   Discharges from fire fighting.
            18.   Dye testing is an allowable discharge provided that the
Director of Public Works or Stormwater Management personnel, or designee, is
verbally notified prior to the time of testing.
         f.   Oils, Toxics and Household Hazardous Wastes. It shall be unlawful
to discharge or dispose of used motor vehicle fluids and household hazardous
wastes into the MS4.
         g.   Organic Waste.
            1.   Yard waste. It shall be the duty of the property owner to keep
grass clippings, leaves, tree and shrub clippings, stumps, organic materials,
or any other yard trash out of gutters, inlets, catch basins, and side ditches.
It shall be unlawful to place grass clippings, leaves, tree and shrub
clippings, stumps, organic materials, or any other yard trash in any road,
storm drain, stream, storm water conveyance, or any other location where
concentrated flows could wash such wastes into the storm sewer system. All yard
waste shall be bagged and set out for collection weekly.
            2.   Human and animal waste. Privies, pigpens, and stables of all
kinds shall be placed far enough away from any stream, ditch, drain, or other
stormwater conveyance that human and/or animal waste(s) will not run into them.
The Stormwater Manager (or his/her designee) shall have the authority to
determine whether a privy, pigpen or stable is deemed “far enough away” from
stormwater conveyances in order that the human or animal waste(s) will not
adversely impact the receiving conveyance.
         h.   Spill Response.
            1.   General. The Richland County Director of Emergency Services,
or an authorized fire official, shall have the authority to summarily abate,
control and contain hazardous materials that are emitted into the environment
and endanger the health or safety of the general public or the environment. The
director of emergency services or an authorized fire official shall have the
authority to enter public or private property with or without the owner’s
consent, to respond to such hazardous materials emergencies. The director of
emergency services or authorized fire official shall determine the type,
amount, and quantity of equipment and personnel required to adequately abate,
control, and contain all hazardous materials emitted into the environment.
            2.   Liability for hazardous spill. The property owner and/or
person responsible for the hazardous materials spill or release shall be held
financially liable for the response, control, containment, equipment and
materials costs, including legal fees, incurred by the county and supporting
agencies. The property owner and/or person responsible for the hazardous
material spill may provide personnel to assist abatement, removal and remedial
measures, provided such personnel have been adequately equipped and trained
pursuant to the requirements of local, state and federal laws. The county shall
not be liable for the use of outside personnel. Assistance shall consist of any
or all of the following:
               [a]   Informing Richland County Emergency Services Department
personnel of all matters pertaining to the incident.
               [b]   Supplying emergency response plan information for the
site.
               [c]   Supplying emergency response equipment, personnel and
materials.
               [d]   Charges for hazardous materials emergency response shall
be based upon the actual costs of response, control, containment, equipment and
materials, including legal fees. All fees collected shall be turned in to the
county treasurer and credited to the county’s general fund.
            3.   Fire incidents. In fire incidents involving hazardous
materials or exposure to hazardous materials, no fee will be assessed for
resources normally associated with fire fighting operations. Fees shall be
assessed for those activities and resources associated with abatement, control
and containment of the hazardous materials involvement or exposure.
         i.   SSSO and Inflow/Infiltration (I/I).
            1.   Every person, firm, corporation or other entity using the
sanitary sewer system of the county, or pipelines connected to said system,
shall maintain all sewer lines connected to the county’s sewer system, or
privately owned sewer collection systems which are connected to the county’s
system, in good condition so that the sewer will not:
               [a]   Permit any leakage of stormwater or other surface water or
groundwater into the sewer service lines or sewer collection lines system
either by visual observation or low pressure leakage test.
               [b]   Receive rainwater flow from roof downspout connections,
yard drains, uncovered building area drains, sump pumps or other sources of
rainwater flow and any other source of inflow/infiltration.
            2.   The county shall notify all persons, firms, corporations, or
other entities where sewer service lines or sewer collection systems are found
to have excessive inflow or infiltration that their service line or sewer
collection system must be repaired so as to eliminate such violation. Such
repairs must be completed within sixty days of notification by the county, or
within such other time schedule as prescribed by the county.
            3.   All private and public sanitary sewer systems that are
operated within Richland County shall report any incidences of an SSO occurring
in Richland County, or has the potential to impact surface waters with
untreated wastewater within Richland County, to the Stormwater Management
Division of the Public Works Department. This reporting requirement shall be in
addition to any other state or local SSO reporting requirement and within the
same required reporting timeframe.
            4.   The Director of Public Works and Stormwater Management
personnel, or their designees, bearing proper credentials and identification,
may enter and inspect all sanitary sewer systems and appurtenances if there is
evidence of sanitary sewer overflows which have impacted or have the ability to
impact water quality with the county’s jurisdictional areas. County personnel
shall duly notify the owner of the system or the certified operator on site,
and the inspection shall be conducted at a reasonable time.
      (3)   Industrial and High Risk Runoff Program. The intent of the Richland
County Industrial and High Risk Runoff Program is to aid Richland County in
reducing the amount of stormwater runoff and improving the quality of runoff
from industrial and high risk facilities. The county may review industrial
stormwater pollution prevention plan(s), as well as Spill Prevention Control
and Countermeasure (SPCC) plan(s), as required under the NPDES storm water
discharge permit, while outfall monitoring indicates a suspected violation, or
proactively in its routine water quality checks, as per below guidelines:
         a.   The Director of the Public Works Department and/or Stormwater
Management personnel, or designee, bearing proper credentials and
identification, may enter and inspect all properties for regular inspections,
periodic investigations, monitoring, observation, measurement, enforcement,
sampling and testing. The personnel shall duly notify the owner of said
property or the representative on site, and the inspection shall be conducted
at a reasonable time.
         b.   Upon refusal by any property owner to permit an inspector to
enter or continue an inspection, the inspector shall terminate the inspection
or confine the inspection to areas concerning which no objection is raised. The
inspector shall immediately report the refusal and the grounds to the director.
The director shall promptly seek issuance of an administrative search warrant.
         c.   In the event that the director or the designee reasonably
believes that discharges from the property into the Richland County MS4 may
cause an imminent and substantial threat to human health or the environment,
the inspection may take place at any time and without notice to the owner of
the property or a representative on site. The inspector shall present proper
credentials upon reasonable request by the owner or representative.
         d.   Inspection reports shall be maintained in a permanent file
located in the Storm Water Management Division of the Public Works Department.
         e.   At any time during an inspection or at such other times as the
director or his/her designee may request information from an owner or
representative, the owner or representative may identify areas of its facility
or establishment, material or processes which contains or which might reveal a
trade secret. If the director or his/her designee has no clear and convincing
reason to question such identification, all material, processes and all
information obtained within such areas shall be conspicuously labeled
“CONFIDENTIAL TRADE SECRET.” The trade secret designation shall be freely
granted to any material claimed to be such by the owner or representative
unless there is clear and convincing evidence for denying such designation. In
the event the director does not agree with the trade secret designation, the
material shall be temporarily designated a trade secret, and the owner or
representative may request an appeal of the director's decision in the manner
in which all such appeals are handled in this article.
         f.   All trade secret material which are prepared or obtained by or
for the director shall be marked as such and filed in a secure place separate
from regular, non-secret files, and documents. Reports from samples prepared or
obtained by or for the director or submitted for laboratory analysis shall be
marked as such and treated in the same manner as other trade secret material.
Trade secret material shall not be divulged by the director to anyone other
than:
            1.   Other employees of the county or employees of the state or
federal governments engaged in an inspection or enforcement proceeding
involving the designated material; and
            2.   To administrative or judicial courts upon order to so divulge
the material to the court.
         g.   Monitoring. The Director of the Public Works Department and/or
Stormwater Management personal, or their designee, may require the person
responsible for any private property or premises, including, but not limited
to, any private property or premises which is or may be the source of a
stormwater discharge associated with industrial activity, or the source of a
discharge from a site of industrial activity, or the source of a discharge from
a high-risk facility, or the source of an illicit discharge, at that person's
expense, to establish and maintain such records, make such reports, install,
use and maintain such monitoring equipment or methods, sample such discharge in
accordance with such methods, at such locations, and intervals as the director
shall prescribe, and provide periodic reports relating to the discharge. To the
extent practicable, the director/stormwater personal or designee shall
recognize and approve the sampling procedures and test methods established by
40 CFR136.
         h.   Best management practices. Industrial facilities and high risk
facilities may be required to implement, at their own expense, structural and/
or nonstructural BMPs, as appropriate, to prevent the discharge of pollutants
to the Richland County MS4. To the extent practicable, the director shall
recognize that storage and handling of significant materials, material handling
equipment or activities, intermediate products or industrial machinery in such
a manner that they are not exposed to stormwater is an effective BMP.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent
practicable, shall be deemed in compliance with the provisions of this section.
         i.   Providing false information and tampering prohibited.
            1.   It shall be unlawful for any person to provide false
information to the director or anyone working under the director’s supervision
when such person knows or has reason to know that the information provided is
false, whether such information is required by this article or any inspection,
recordkeeping or monitoring requirement carried out or imposed under this
article.
            2.   It shall be unlawful for any person to falsify, tamper with or
knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under this
article.
      (4)   Construction Site Runoff Control Program. The intent of the
Construction Site Runoff Control Program is to aid Richland County in reducing
and controlling the discharge of pollutants from construction sites.
Construction sites have potential to introduce large volumes of soil and
sediment to stormwater runoff, as well as discarded building materials,
concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter and sanitary waste. The individual
requirements that make up the Construction Site Runoff Control Program are
contained in Sections 26-64 and 26-202 of this Chapter.
      (5)   Post-Construction Maintenance Program. The intent of the Post-
Construction Maintenance Program is to aid Richland County in reducing the
discharge of pollutants from permanent water quality BMPs that are left in
place after construction is complete. If not operated and maintained properly,
permanent water quality BMPs can become sources of pollutants; the goal of this
program is to prevent this from occurring by requiring BMP maintenance to
ensure these BMPs are operating as designed.
         a.   The individual requirements that make up the Post-Construction
Maintenance Program are contained in Sections
26-64 and
26-202.
         b.   Regular maintenance of permanent structural BMPs (i.e., ditches,
ponds, etc.) will be the responsibility of Richland County if the county has an
easement allowing it to access the BMP, and if the county has accepted
maintenance responsibilities for the BMP. If the BMP is privately owned, all
maintenance will be the responsibility of the owner.
      (6)   Accidental Discharges or Damages. In the event of any accidental
discharge or damage to the municipal separate stormwater systems of Richland
County or its co-permittees, immediate notification (not to exceed 24 hours)
shall be given to the Director of the Public Works Department and/or Stormwater
Management personnel, or their designee, regarding the nature, quantity (if
applicable) and time of the occurrence. In addition to this notification, the
responsible entity shall take immediate measures to contain and/or eliminate
the discharge and minimize its effects on the receiving waters. The responsible
entity shall also take steps to eliminate the recurrence of such events. The
Director of Public Works and Stormwater Management personnel, or their
designee, shall have the authority to inspect, monitor and approve any remedial
actions taken by the responsible entity. Failure to notify Richland County as
outlined above shall result in the action being deemed an illegal or illicit
activity as described in this Section and appropriate enforcement action shall
be taken as set out in Section
26-203(d), below, and the “Enforcement Response Guide”.
      (7)   Water Quality Controls for Impaired Water Bodies and Consistency
with TMDLs. The county may take action to provide reasonable assurance that
discharges will not cause or contribute to violations of water quality
standards in Impaired Water Bodies identified on the South Carolina 303(d)
list. If a TMDL has been established for a water body, the county may also
require additional conditions necessary to ensure consistency with the TMDL.
   (c)   MS4 Authority.
      (1)   The Director of the Public Works Department and/or Stormwater
Management personnel, or designee, bearing proper credentials and
identification, may enter and inspect all properties for regular inspections,
periodic investigations, monitoring, observation, measurement, enforcement,
sampling and testing, and any other NPDES related tasks. The personnel shall
duly notify the owner of said property or the representative on site, and the
inspection shall be conducted at reasonable times.
      (2)   In the event that the Richland County or the designee reasonably
believes that discharges from the property into the Richland County MS4 may
cause an imminent and substantial threat to human health or the environment,
the inspection may take place at any time and without notice to the owner of
the property or a representative on site. The inspector shall present proper
credentials upon reasonable request by the owner or representative. In
addition, the inspector may take such action as to abate or eliminate the
discharge and begin remedial steps necessary to protect human health and/or the
environment.
   (d)   Violations. Upon determination that a violation of any of the
provisions of this article or the NPDES permit has occurred, Richland County
personnel will respond according to the procedures in the current “Enforcement
Response Guide”, which includes timely personal notice at the property where
the violation has occurred and written notice to the violator. This notice
shall specify: the nature of the violation, the proposed penalty, and the time
line (depending on the violation and is left to the discretion of the
inspector) to correct deficiencies, if appropriate. There shall be sufficient
notification to deliver the notice to the person to whom it is addressed, or to
deposit a copy of such in the United States Mail, properly stamped, certified
and addressed to the address used for tax purposes.
      (1)   Civil Penalties. Any person violating any provision of this article
shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than five hundred dollars
($500) for each violation. Each separate day of a violation, constitutes a new
and separate violation.
      (2)   Criminal Penalties. In addition to any applicable civil penalties,
any person who negligently, willfully or intentionally violates any provision
of this article shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punished within
the jurisdictional limits of magistrate’s court. Each day of a violation shall
constitute a new and separate offense.
      (3)   Emergency Actions. Richland County reserves the right to seek
reimbursement of costs required to abate, eliminate and/or remediate discharges
that have been deemed an imminent threat to human health and/or the
environment. Such reimbursement shall be in addition to other appropriate
enforcement actions including, but not limited to, civil or criminal penalties.
   (e)   Supplemental regulations. All applicable provisions of the standards
for Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction (Section 72-301, 302, 305,
307, 308, 312, 313, 314, 315 and 316) administered by the South Carolina
Department of Health and Environmental Control pursuant to the South Carolina

Sec. 26-224. Certain subdivisions exempt from road standards.
   The planning director, or his/her designee, may exempt subdivisions from the
road construction requirements of Sec.
26-181 of this chapter only if the property is being given, for no monetary
compensation or any other consideration, to the owners' immediate family
members or is being transferred by will or intestate succession or forced
division decreed by appropriate judicial authority. The subdivider must submit
legal documentation satisfactory to the planning director, or his/her designee,
in order to establish eligibility for this exemption. In addition, the
subdivider must submit a "Hold Harmless Agreement" as to Richland County. This
exemption shall apply only to initial division of property, not to subsequent
sale or further subdivision by the heirs, devisees, or transferees. Plats of
subdivisions so exempted shall show an ingress/egress easement providing access
to all parcels. This easement may be an existing easement maintained by
Richland County. The plat shall contain the following information:
   (a)   Names of owners of each parcel being created; and
   (b)   Purpose of the subdivision; and
   (c)   A note stating that "ROAD ACCESS NOT PROVIDED"; and

subdivision from the construction of the private roadway, the property shall
also be exempt from delineation of jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional
wetlands (for purposes of approving the plat for recordation only; this section
shall not supersede any state and/or federal requirement for construction in,
around or through a jurisdictional wetland or flood zone). In the situation
that a property owner requests exemption from road construction as outlined in
this section, the property owner shall sign a statement that he/she understands
that the proposed subdivision of land shall not be exempted from any other
minimum standard set forth in this chapter; provided, however, all planning
department subdivision plan review fees shall be waived.

Richland County Public Works Department) shall be paid by the applicant.
      (2)   Roads. Roads within a private road subdivision shall be exempt from
the road paving requirements of Sec.
26-181 of this chapter, but shall not be exempt from any other road design
requirement. Roads within a private road subdivision shall not be eligible or
accepted for county maintenance, which is otherwise provided pursuant to
Section
21-5 of the Richland County Code of Ordinances, until they meet the road
construction standards provided in Chapter 21 of the Richland County Code. The
roadway shall have a minimum right-of-way width of fifty (50) feet and minimum
twenty (20) foot wide passable surface, which meets the standards established
and set forth by the county engineer. The subdivision documents shall include a
conspicuous statement stating that improvements to the roadway without the
approval of the county engineer are prohibited.
      (3)   Sidewalks. Private road subdivisions shall be exempt from the
sidewalk requirements of Sec.
26-179 of this chapter.
      (4)   Size of lots. Any and all lots created in a private road
subdivision shall conform to the RU zoning district's requirements.
      (5)   Number of lots. An owner of land may subdivide a tract of land
pursuant to this section provided that no more than seven (7) lots result from
the subdivision.

construction or routine (i.e. recurring) maintenance of the private road.
         c.   Clearly state that the parcels created by this process shall not
be divided again, except in full compliance with all regulations in effect at
the time.
      (2)   A "Hold Harmless Agreement" as to Richland County.

ARTICLE XI. NONCONFORMITIES
Sec. 26-251. General.
   (a)   Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish regulations that
govern uses, structures, lots, and other current circumstances that come into
being lawfully, but that do not conform to one or more requirements of this
chapter and/or amendments thereto. Such nonconformities could be created by the
adoption of this chapter, or could have been created by a change in the
classification of property or a change in the text of this chapter.
   (b)   Nonconformities - continuation. Any nonconforming use, structure, or
lot that lawfully existed as of the effective date of this chapter and that
remains nonconforming may be continued only in accordance with the terms of
this article. Any use, structure, or lot that has become nonconforming as a
result of the adoption of this chapter, or any subsequent amendment to the text
or official zoning map, may be continued and maintained only in accordance with
the terms of this article. As used in this article, the term "effective date of
this chapter, or any amendment thereto," refers to the date of the ordinance
that first rendered a use, structure, or lot nonconforming.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-252. Nonconforming vacant lots.
   (a)   General. A nonconforming vacant lot is a lot that was lawfully created
prior to the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment thereto, but
which does not conform to the dimensional or area requirements for the zoning
district in which it is located.
   (b)   Standards. A nonconforming vacant lot may be used for any of the uses
permitted by Article V. of this chapter in the zoning district in which it is
located if the use of the lot meets the following standards:
      (1)   All other minimum requirements for the particular zoning district
and proposed use must be met or a variance obtained from these requirements.
      (2)   The nonconforming vacant lot does not adjoin and have continuous
frontage with one or more other vacant lots in the same ownership. If a
nonconforming lot does adjoin and have continuous frontage with one or more
other vacant lots in the same ownership, such lots shall be combined or
recombined as necessary to form a conforming lot or lots. This subsection shall
not apply to a nonconforming vacant lot if a majority of the developed lots
located on either side of the road where such a lot is located and within five
hundred (500) feet of such lot are also nonconforming. The intent of this
subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other lots to
create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to
require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the
neighborhood has been previously developed.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-253. Nonconforming occupied lots.
   (a)   General. A nonconforming occupied lot is a lot which contained a
structure prior to the effective date of this chapter or any amendment thereto,
but which does not conform to the dimensional or area requirements for the
zoning district in which it is located.
   (b)   Standards. A nonconforming occupied lot may be used for any of the
uses permitted by this chapter in the zoning district in which it is located if
the use of the lot meets the following standards:
      (1)   Any improvement, erection, or extension of buildings or structures
on such a lot shall comply with all other minimum requirements of this chapter
or a variance must be obtained from these requirements.
      (2)   The nonconforming occupied lot does not adjoin and have continuous
frontage with one or more other vacant lots in the same ownership. If a
nonconforming lot does adjoin and have continuous frontage with one or more
other vacant lots in the same ownership, such lots shall be combined or
recombined as necessary to form a conforming lot or lots. This subsection shall
not apply to a nonconforming occupied lot if a majority of the developed lots
located on either side of the road where such a lot is located and within five
hundred (500) feet of such lot are also nonconforming. The intent of this
subsection is to require nonconforming lots to be combined with other lots to
create conforming lots under the circumstances specified herein, but not to
require such combination when that would be out of character with the way the
neighborhood has been previously developed.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-254. Nonconforming structures occupying conforming lots.
   (a)   General. A nonconforming structure occupying a conforming lot is a
structure which lawfully existed prior to the effective date of this chapter,
or any amendment thereto, which does not meet the minimum requirements for the
zoning district in which it is located. It is a structure, however, that is
located on a lot that does conform to the zoning district requirements.
   (b)   Standards. A nonconforming structure on a conforming lot may be used
for any of the uses permitted by this chapter in the zoning district in which
it is located if the use of the lot meets the following standards:
      (1)   A nonconforming structure may undergo a change of use or renovation
without having to bring the structure into conformity with the requirements of
these regulations provided that:
         a.   The change in use or renovation involves a permitted use within
the district, and
         b.   The number of parking spaces provided for the use is in
conformity with the requirements of these regulations or a variance is obtained
from the board of zoning appeals.
      (2)   A nonconforming structure may be expanded, without bringing the
nonconforming structure into conformity with these regulations, only if the
part of the structure to be expanded and the area of the lot into which the
expansion is taking place are both brought into conformity with the
requirements of this chapter. However, a structure that is nonconforming only
because of setback standards may be enlarged along the nonconforming setback up
to ten (10) feet in residential districts or thirty (30) feet in other
districts so long as all other aspects of the structure conform to the
regulations in this chapter.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-255. Nonconforming open uses of land.
   (a)   General. A nonconforming open use of land is an open use that was in
existence prior to the effective date of this chapter, or any amendment
thereto, and which would not be permitted by this chapter in the zoning
district in which it is located. For open uses of land, any structures
associated with the use are incidental and accessory to the actual use.
   (b)   Standards. A legally established nonconforming open use of land may be
continued subject to the following limitations:
      (1)   When a nonconforming open use of land has been changed to a
conforming use, it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use.
      (2)   Nonconforming open uses of land may be converted to another
nonconforming use if the board of zoning appeals finds that the new use is more
in character with the uses permitted in the zoning district in which the
property is located and grants a special exception. In granting such a change,
the board may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with
the purposes of this chapter.
      (3)   A nonconforming open use of land shall not be enlarged to cover
more land than was occupied by that use when it became nonconforming.
      (4)   When any nonconforming open use of land is discontinued for a
period in excess of twelve (12) months, any future use of the land shall be
limited to those uses permitted in the district in which the land is located.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-256. Nonconforming uses of structures.
   (a)   General. A nonconforming use of a structure is a use that was lawfully
created in a structure prior to the effective date of this chapter, or any
amendment thereto, and which would not be permitted by this chapter in the
zoning district in which it is located.
   (b)   Standards. A legally established nonconforming use of a structure may
be continued subject to the following limitations:
      (1)   When a nonconforming use of a structure has been changed to a
conforming use, it shall not thereafter be used for any nonconforming use.
      (2)   A nonconforming use of a structure may be converted to another
nonconforming use if the board of zoning appeals finds that the new use is more
in character with the uses permitted in the zoning district in which the
property is located and grants a special exception. In granting such a change,
the board may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with
the purposes of this chapter.
      (3)   A nonconforming use of a structure may be enlarged or extended only
into portions of the structure that existed at the time that the use became
nonconforming. No structural alterations will be allowed to any structure
containing a nonconforming use except:
         a.   Where such alteration does not enlarge the structure.
         b.   Where such alteration is required by law or by an order from the
county building inspector, fire marshal, or zoning administrator to ensure the
safety of the structure.
         c.   Where such alteration is of a residential structure as set forth
in subsection (4) below.
      (4)   Nonconforming existing residential structures in either commercial
or industrial districts may be enlarged, extended, or structurally altered,
provided that no additional dwelling units result from such enlargement,
extension, or alteration. Any such enlargement, extension, or alteration shall
comply with the dimensional or area requirements of the Residential, Single-
Family, High Density District.
      (5)   When any nonconforming use of a structure is discontinued for a
period in excess of twelve (12) months, any future use of the land shall be
limited to those uses permitted in the district in which the structure is
located.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-257. Other nonconforming issues.
   (a)   Standards for replacement of nonconforming manufactured housing. Any
manufactured home used for single-family residential purposes and maintained as
a nonconforming use may be enlarged or replaced with a post-1976 manufactured
home of the same or larger size, so long as the enlargement or replacement does
not create new nonconformities with respect to such matters as yard or parking
requirements. Any replacement authorized by this subsection can only take place
if said replacement occurs within one hundred eighty (180) days of the removal
of the initial manufactured home.
   (b)   Discontinuance.
      (1)   When discontinued. A nonconforming use shall be presumed
discontinued when any of the following has occurred:
         a.   The owner has in writing or by public statement indicated intent
to abandon the use.
         b.   A conforming use or a nonconforming use of lesser impact has
replaced the original nonconforming use.
         c.   The building or structure housing the nonconforming use has been
removed.
         d.   The owner has physically changed the building or structure or its
permanent equipment in such a way as to indicate clearly a change in use or
activity to something other than the nonconforming use.
         e.   The property, structure, or use has been vacant or completely
inactive for twelve (12) or more months.
      (2)   Overcoming presumption of abandonment.  A presumption of
abandonment for a nonconforming use in a structure, based solely on the length
of time the use of the structure has remained vacant or inactive, may be
rebutted. Such a presumption may be overcome upon a showing, to the
satisfaction of the zoning administrator, that during such period, the owner of
the land has done both of the following:
         a.   The owner has been maintaining the land and structure in
accordance with the building code; and
         b.   The owner has been actively and continuously marketing the land
or structure for sale or lease or has been making necessary improvements in
order to continue the use.
(Ord. No. 074-04HR, § V, 11-9-04)
Sec. 26-258. Maintenance and nonconformities.
   (a)   Maintenance and required alterations or remodeling. In the interest of
public safety and health, structural alterations or remodeling of nonconforming
structures or conforming structures on nonconforming lots that are required by
any public law, and so ordered by a public officer in authority, shall be
permitted. Routine maintenance shall also be permitted for nonconforming
situations so long as no expansion of the nonconformity occurs as a result of
the maintenance.
   (b)   Repair/reconstruction of damaged structures. Any nonconforming use
that has been damaged by fire, wind, flood, or other casualty may be repaired
and used as before, provided that such repair and reconstruction shall be
accomplished:
      (1)   Without any increase in structural dimensions or area devoted to
the nonconforming use.
      (2)   Without any change in location except to provide greater
conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
      (3)   With initiation of the repairs/reconstruction within twenty-four
(24) months of the damage.
      (4)   With completion of the repairs/reconstruction within three (3)
years of the damage.

   (a)   Notice of violation. When an authorized county official finds
violations of this chapter, it shall be the duty of said official to notify the
person alleged to be in violation. Such notice of violation shall be in writing
and sent by certified or registered mail or delivered by personal service. If
the violator cannot be ascertained, then the notice of violation shall be sent
to the record owner of the land on which the violation occurs. The notice of
violation shall include an opportunity to cure the violation within a
prescribed period of time. For violations of the floodplain regulations
contained in this chapter, the notice shall also indicate that a hearing will
be held before the flood coordinator at a designated place and time. Such place
and time shall be no later than twenty (20) days after the date of the notice,
at which time the owner or occupant shall be entitled to be heard in person or
by counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter.
   (b)   Extension of time to cure. Upon receipt of a written request from the
alleged violator or the property owner for an extension of time to cure or
correct the violation, the county official charged with the duty of enforcing
the regulation(s) being violated may grant a single extension of time, not to
exceed a period of thirty (30) days, in which the alleged violator may cure or
correct the violation before the county takes further action.
   (c)   Failure to cure. If the violator (or land owner if the violator cannot
be ascertained) fails to take prompt corrective action in the prescribed time,
then the county may pursue the penalties and remedies set forth above.
   (d)   Revocation of permits. In the event of a violation of any regulation
of this chapter, the county official charged with the duty of enforcing the
particular regulations, may stop any development of, use of, or activity on
property by the revocation of applicable permits.
