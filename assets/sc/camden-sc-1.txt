phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, or section.

another shall itself be repealed, the previous ordinance shall not be revived
without express words to that effect.

§ 10.12 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was clearly
intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected and such word
or words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest
intention, and the provisions shall have the same effect as though the correct
words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall
be made or permitted if any question exists regarding the nature or extent of
such error.

   (A)   There is hereby established by the joint action of the Kershaw County
Council and the City Council of Camden, the Kershaw County Special Services
Department, composed of the city and that portion of the county located outside
the bounds of the city.
   (B)   Duties and responsibilities.
      (1)   It will be the duty and responsibility of the Kershaw County
Special Services Department to carry out and enforce the animal control
ordinances and the litter control ordinances of the county and the city. All
officers of the Special Services Department of the county engaged in the
enforcement of either the animal control ordinances or the litter ordinances
shall be duly commissioned as state constables, and are vested with police
powers to enforce and administer all county and city ordinances and sate laws
and regulations or rules pertaining to animal control or litter control. The
Special Services Department will be under the supervision of the Director of
Special Services whose duty it shall be to direct, supervise, recommend, and
carry out the animal control programs and litter control programs and to
enforce the same within the bounds of the county and the city as authorized.
The Director of Special Services is designated as the chief constable and shall
have such additional duties and responsibilities as hereinafter set forth in
this ordinance or as may be directed by the County Administrator. The Director
of Special Services shall be selected by the County Administrator.
   (C)   Budget.
      (1)   A complete and comprehensive budget reflecting all anticipated
income and expenditures for this fiscal year of the special Services Department
will be prepared by the Special Services Director each year in time to be
studied and incorporated in both the city and county budgets. The final
approval for any and all income and expenditures are subject to the approval of
the City and County Councils. Agreement between the two bodies shall be
finalized by April 1 of each year. The budget of the Department will not be
deemed to have been approved until such time as identical draft budgets have
been approved by both the City and County Councils.
      (2)   The fiscal year of the Department will begin July 1 of each year.
      (3)   The budget will be set up in two parts. The portion which deals
with the income and expenditure of funds for tax-supported activities will be
included in the county budget. All income related to this part of the budget
will pass through the County Treasurer's office and expenditures will be
authorized through the Office of the County Administrator.
      (4)   The financial contributions of the city to the Department will be
forwarded to the County Treasurer's office for disbursement.
      (5)   That portion of the budget that handles income derived from fees,
donations, special events, and other similar activities will be handled in bank
accounts and expenditures will be authorized by the Special Services Department
Director. No expenditure may be made which is not authorized in the budget
without consent of the County Council, and the Special Services Director will
cause to be produced a monthly statement of income and expenditures compared to
budget for review by the City and County Councils.
      (6)   The financial records and transactions of the District will be
audited annually as a part of the regular county audit.
   (D)   Financial responsibilities.
      (1)   Each year as a part of its budget preparation, the County Special

control activities provided for the previous year. A use ratio will be
determined from the participation census, establishing the percentage of use of
animal control and litter activities by residents living outside of the city
limits and residents living inside of the city limits. The following shall be
considered in establishing the use ratio: number of animals picked up, number
of animals received at the shelter, number of complaints made to the shelter,
number of complaints unanswered, number of animals adopted, number of litter
citations issued, number of leash law citations issued, and other matters of
like nature. The county will be responsible for the percentage of the budget of
the animal control/litter district equal to the percentage of use of the animal
control and litter facilities and activities by residents residing outside of
the city limits. The city agrees to accept its percentage responsibility for
the balance of the budget of the Fiscal Services Department as evidenced by
that percentage figure for use of animal control and litter facilities and
functions by residents residing in the city.
      (2)   Any disagreements arising hereunder between the city and county
will be referred to a conference committee of four members, two from each
Council, which will be appointed to study the disagreement and recommend its
resolution to the Councils.
      (3)   The Special Services Department will operate within the budgets
currently in effect for fiscal year 1989 by the city and the county, the use
ratio shall become the basis of support for the city and the county for fiscal
year 1990 which begins July 1, 1989.
   (E)   Building lease and maintenance.
      (1)   Building lease. The city shall lease unto the county for a nominal

maintenance, repairs, utilities, and like items with the city paying its
prorate share. The county will also be responsible for all capital improvements
with the city paying its pro-rata share. All of these items shall be addressed
in the joint budget established by the city and the county. Upon the
termination of the lease of the facilities owned by the city, the city agrees
that it will pay unto the county for the costs of capital improvements in an
amount based upon agreed depreciation schedule of the improvements made. At any
time the capital improvements are made, the city and county agree to enter into
an agreement establishing a depreciation schedule.
      (3)   All maintenance of grounds or buildings which is related to the
animal control and litter programs, other than the structural maintenance as
set forth above, will be the responsibility of the Special Services Department.

Department.

      (1)   All equipment currently belonging to the city which is being used

performed by the county, with the city paying its pro-rata share as determined
by the use ratio.
   (G)   Capital improvement. The purchase, construction, or other procurement
of new animal control/litter facilities or capital improvements will be the
responsibility of the owner, such as the county or the city, with the
maintenance to be as above outlined. The Special Services Department Director

capital improvement program to assist the City and County Councils in Planning
for the providing of financial support to the Special Services Department.
   (H)   Title of equipment. Motor vehicles for which certificates of title are
required under state law and no longer used by the Special Services Department
will be returned to the owner as named in such certificate of title.

offenses occurring outside the city within the bounds of the county will be
remitted to the County Treasurer.
   (J)   Amendment or abrogation.
      (1)   This section may be amended by a joint ordinance of the City
Council and the County Council. This section may be abrogated by either the

integrity.

(Res. 11-003, passed 1-25-11; Am. Ord. 12-028, passed 1-22-13)
§ 39.13 ETHICS.
   (A)   Ethical conduct.
      (1)   No employee, officer or agent of the city shall participate in
solicitation, award or administration of a contract if a conflict of interest
would be involved, whether real or merely giving the appearance of a conflict
of interest. In addition to activities prohibited by the South Carolina Ethics
Act (S.C. Code §§ 8-13-800, et seq.), a “CONFLICT OF INTEREST” would arise when
any one of the following has a financial, personal or other interest in the
firm or business selected for a city contract, or receives anything of value
from the firm or business as a result of the transaction with the city: an
employee, officer, agent, or City Council members, including: (1) any member of
the person’s immediate family, including but not limited to parents, step-
parents, children or step-children, or the spouses thereof; (2) the person’s
partner or spouse; or (3) an organization that employs the person, or is about
to employ the person within 180 days, one of the above.
      (2)   It is unethical and unlawful for any employee or former employee to
knowingly use confidential information for actual or anticipated personal gain,
or for the actual or anticipated personal gain of any other person.
      (3)   Every activity covered by this policy imposes an obligation of good
faith on the employee or agent of the city in the negotiation, performance, and
enforcement of the duties of the person in a covered transaction.
   (B)   Equal opportunity. The policies of the city prohibit discrimination
against any person or business who, in pursuit of business opportunities with
the city, is discriminated against on the basis of race, color, national
origin, religion, sex, age, disability, sexual orientation or any other status
protected by law and it is the policy of the city to conduct it’s contracting
and procurement programs so as to prevent such unlawful discrimination.
   (C)   Fair and open competition.
      (1)   The city promotes the precept of a fair and open competitive
solicitation process, wherever feasible. Restrictive or proprietary
specifications are to be avoided, unless justified by the department head, and
only applied where reasonably necessary to meet technical demands for
operational compatibility with existing city equipment and/or operations, or
which offer the city the opportunity to obatin unique, cost effective
performance applications.
      (2)   The city may contract with persons other than city personnel for
the preparation of specifications. However, no person or entity preparing
specifications shall receive any direct or indirect benefit from the
utilization of such specifications. In other words, a person or entity
preparing specifications on behalf of the city for traditional, publically-bid
projects may not negotiate for the design of the projects, but may bid, or
negotiate for the construction management of the project, as appropriate.
However, in projects using the design-build or similar alternative project
delivery methods as provided in § 39.16 herein, where the preparation of the
specifications is an integral part of the process, the participation by a
person helping prepare specifications is not prohibited.

§ 39.14 POLICY STATEMENTS.
   (A)   Procurement involving state or federal funds.
      (1)   All goods and services obtained through the use of state or federal
funds shall be in compliance with applicable state and federal laws and
regulations, and shall be in compliance with the mandatory requirements of the
applicable agency.
      (2)   Whenever city policy is more restrictive than the applicable state
or federal laws or regulations, the provisions of the city policy shall be
followed.
   (B)   Freedom of Information Act. Procurement information shall be public
record to the extent required by the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA), S.C. Code §§ 30-4-10 et seq.
   (C)   Cooperative purchasing.
      (1)   The City Manager or his or her designee(s) may authorize the city
and its departments to participate in a cooperative purchasing agreement for
the purchase of goods and services with one or more governmental entities, by
entering into an intergovernmental agreement with the other governmental
entities. The purchasing laws, ordinances and policies of each entity will be
considered in the intergovernmental agreement. Participation in state
purchasing, as set forth above, does not require such an agreement.
      (2)   Whenever the city enters into an intergovernmental agreement for a
joint project with the federal, state, or another governmental entity,
including, but not limited to, a county, regional council of governments,
special purpose district, special tax district, state authority, joint
district, or public university, then the purchasing practices of the other
public entity may be used in lieu of the city's own procedures, if the use is
determined to be to the advantage of the city.
   (D)   Certificate of insurance.
      (1)   Contractors, vendors and professional service providers contracted
by the city, prior to commencing any work under a contract with the city, shall
be required to provide a duly executed certificate of insurance certifying to
the city that the contractor, vendor or professional service provider has in
effect workers compensation coverage valid in South Carolina and covering the
workers who will be performing the work for the city. Certificates of general
liability coverage and motor vehicle coverage may be required, as well as
errors and omissions insurance or professional liability insurance, as required
by the city. Certificates containing wording that would release the insurance
company from liability in the event of non- notification of the city of any
cancellation of the insurance policy shall not be acceptable. Policies shall be
endorsed to include a waiver of subrogation against the city, its officers,
officials, agents, and employees. Separate endorsements shall be required,
naming the city as additional insured, for liability insurance and providing a
waiver of subrogation for worker’s compensation insurance.
      (2)   At any time, if any insurance policy, or performance or payment
bond required by the city is canceled before the completion of the contract,
then all work shall cease until an insurance policy or bond acceptable to the
city is once again provided, including gap coverage. The City Manager or his or
her designee(s) may waive the certificate of insurance for professional
services, but only when the lack of proof of the coverage will likely have no
significant impact upon the city.
      (3)   Insurance coverage limits and requirements on contractual items
shall be as set in the bid specifications, the invitation for bid or the
request for proposals.
   (E)   Business licenses. Any company, person, contractor or vendor operating
within and conducting business with, or on behalf of the city shall obtain a
business license from the city.

      (2)   The compliance with this law by the contractors, bidders,
proposers, companies and subcontractors (including sub-subcontractors).
   (H)   Recycled products/sustainability. It is city policy to buy products
with recycled content where fitness, quality, and price are not more than 5%
over the cost of the equal non-recycled products.
   (I)   Local purchasing preference.
      (1)   It is city policy to promote the use of local businesses when
possible. Local contractors and vendors with a valid business license from the
city (for a period of at least one year from the date that bids are solicited)

notice shall be given, at a minimum, through the city's web site and/or the
local newspaper and to persons and firms who have asked to be placed on a
bidder’s list for a particular commodity or service. Email or fax notifications
to interested potential bidders should be used to the extent possible to
minimize the notification costs to the city.
      (3)   The invitation for bid documents shall include specifications and
all other contractual terms and conditions applicable to the purchase. The

lowest responsible bidders:
         (a)   The ability, capacity and skill of the bidder to perform the
contract or provide the service required in compliance with specifications;
         (b)   The ability of the bidder to perform the contract promptly or
within a specified time without delay or interference;
         (c)   The character, integrity, reputation, judgment, experience and
efficiency of the bidder;
         (d)   The quality of performance of previous contracts with or
services provided to the city;
         (e)   The previous and existing compliance by the bidder with laws and
ordinances relating to contracts or services;
         (f)   The sufficiency of the financial resources of the bidder, which
may impact the ability of the bidder to perform the contract, provide the
services or to meet any bonding or insurance requirements;
         (g)   The quality, availability and adaptability of the supplies or
contractual services to the particular use required or specified;
         (h)   The capability of the bidder to provide future maintenance and
service at a reasonable cost for the useful life of the subject of the
contract;
         (i)   The number and scope of conditions attached to the formal bid
which would vary the bid from strict compliance with the bid specifications or
which would attempt to add non-conforming conditions, limitations or other
provisions detrimental to the contract, as determined in the sole discretion of
the city. The assertion of the conditions will likely render the formal bid
nonconforming and unacceptable to the city, regardless of the bid amount;
         (j)   Whether the bidder has failed to fully perform prior contracts
to the city's satisfaction, or is past due, delinquent or owes the city money
for any reason; and
         (k)   The costs/price of the bidder’s services or goods.
      (6)   Bid payment and performance bonds or other securities may be
requested for supply contracts or service contracts as the City Manager, or his
or her designee(s), deems advisable to protect the city's interest. Any such
bonding requirements shall be set forth in the request.
      (7)   For bid security, an amount equal to at least 5% of the amount of
the bid shall be required for all competitive bidding for construction
contracts. Bid security shall be a legitimate bid bond provided by a surety
company authorized to do business in South Carolina, or the equivalent in cash,
certified check, cashier’s check or money order. If a bid is initially awarded
to a bidder, who subsequently fails to honor its bid for any reason, including,
but not limited to, failure to timely provide required bonds or certificates of
insurance coverage, or failure to proceed after receiving a notice to proceed,
the bidder shall forfeit its bid bond as liquidated damges to the city and
award of the bid is rescinded; thereafter, the contract for the project may be
awarded to the next lowest bidder, or the project may be rebid, at the city’s
sole discretion. Bidders who default in honoring a bid, or who fail to
successfully complete a project in accordance with project specifications, may
be prohibited from entering further bids on city projects until the bidder
establishes its responsibility as a bidder to the satisfaction of the city, at
its sole discretion.
      (8)   When a construction contract is awarded in excess of $50,000, the
following bonds or security shall be delivered by the successful bidder to the
city, and shall become binding on the parties upon the execution of the
contract. Bid or performance bonds shall not be used in place of the
determination of bidder's responsibility.
         (a)   A performance bond shall be in an amount equal to 100% of the
contract amount; and
         (b)   A payment bond for the protection of all persons supplying labor
and material to the contract or its subcontractors for the performance of the
work shall be in an amount equal to 100% of the contract amount.
      (9)   Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before bid
opening may be authorized in the absence of the appearance of collusion among
bidders, and in unusual cases, withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids after
award or cancellation of awards of contracts based on the bid mistakes may be
permitted upon approval by the City Manager or the Assistant City Manager,
subject to the provisions relating to the forfeiture of bid bonds. It is the
policy of the city that each bidder must bear the responsibility for the
accuracy of its bid.
      (10)   Requests or other solicitations through the competitive bid
process may be canceled when it is in the best interest of the city. This
action should be supported with internal documentation sufficient to satisfy
external audit and shall be made a part of the project file.

§ 39.15 ALTERNATE PROJECT DELIVERY METHODS.
   (A)   Justification for alternate project delivery methods. The City Manager
or any department head proposing to utilize this section of the purchasing
policy must detail in the project file why utilizing this section of the
purchasing policy is in the best interests of the city. The terms used herein
and not otherwise defined shall generally have the same meaning as for those
terms defined in the State's Procurement Code, which is found at S.C. Code §§
11-35-2910 et seq., as amended, but where the terms have been changed, those
terms have been intentionally adapted for use by the city. The policy of the
state in promoting alternate forms of project delivery, as set forth in Act No.
174 of 2008, is acknowledged as authority for implementing these specialized
procurement methods.
   (B)   Procurement methods.
      (1)   Design-build is a project delivery method in which the city enters
into a single contract for design and construction of an infrastructure
facility. Procurement of design-build services is appropriate when the city
does not have the in-house capability to design and supervise the project, and
when compliance with technical regulations and best practices for construction
is critical. With the assistance of experts, the city may develop performance
specifications for the desired infrastructure which can then be used to develop
design requirements for submission to design-build firms for development.
Errors and omissions insurance is required to cover the architectural and
engineering services provided by the offeror.
      (2)   Design-bid-build is a project delivery method in which the city
sequentially awards separate contracts, the first for architectural and
engineering services to design the project and the second, based on competitive
bidding by city, for construction of the project according to the final design.
This is the traditional method of designing and constructing facilities. The
procurement of construction management services for such a project would make
this method a specialized method of procurement.
      (3)   Operation and maintenance is a project delivery method whereby the
city enters into a single contract for the routine operation, routine repair,
and routine maintenance of an existing, or to-be-constructed, infrastructure
facility. Operation and maintenance services shall be procured from
prequalified contractors by utilizing competitive sealed proposals submitted in
response to a request for proposals, which has established the supplies and
services required to maintain and operate infrastructure facilities. The
contracts for city facilities funded by the issuance of tax-exempt financing
are subject to approval by bond counsel or tax counsel in the form of a written
opinion to the city.
      (4)   Design-build-operate-maintain is a project delivery method in which
the city enters into a single contract for design, construction, operation and
maintenance of an infrastructure facility over a contractually defined period.
Ownership of the facility may be in the name of the city or leased by the city
from a non-profit corporation. All or a portion of the funds required to pay
for the services provided by the contractor during the contract period are
either appropriated by the city prior to award of the contract or secured by
the city through fee or user charges or other sources of revenue. The city
should not participate in financing any such project without an opinion from
bond counsel or tax counsel. Errors and omissions insurance is required to
cover the architectural and engineering services provided by the offeror.
      (5)   Design-build-finance-operate-maintain is a project delivery method
in which the city enters into a single contract for design, construction,
finance, maintenance, and operation of an infrastructure facility over a
contractually defined period. No funds are appropriated to pay for any part of
the services provided by the contractor during the contract period. Procurement
of design-build- finance-operate-maintain services shall generally follow
procedures outlined above for design-build projects with the additional
elements of financing and operation incorporated into the project. A
preliminary determination by the city should have been made that project
revenues would be sufficient, over the length of the proposed contract, to
cover design, construction, finance, and operations, and that the traditional
design-bid-build approach is inappropriate or impracticable for this project.
City should not participate in financing any such project without an opinion
from bond counsel or tax counsel. Errors and omissions insurance is required to
cover the architectural and engineering services provided by the offeror.
      (6)   Construction management services is a project delivery process by
which a qualified third party provides construction leadership with a defined
scope throughout various phases of the project (e.g. planning, design and
construction). Construction management services are typically procured using
competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed proposals. Errors and
omissions insurance may be required to cover any architectural and engineering
services provided by the offeror.
      (7)   Other special project delivery methods or combinations of the above
may be utilized provided that the city can demonstrate that the delivery
methods meets the intent of this purchasing policy and receives the approval of
the City Manager and/or City Council. Insurance of various types may be
required as additional security for the city for the particular method of
project delivery.
   (C)   Evaluation factors. Any request shall state all evaluation factors and
sub-factors that will be separately rated and the weights to be given to each
factor and sub-factor in the evaluation. Evaluation factors may consist of the
following:
      (1)   Demonstrated compliance with design requirements;
      (2)   Qualifications and experience;
      (3)   Financial capacity;
      (4)   Project schedule;
      (5)   Price (or life-cycle price for Design-Build-Operate- Maintain and
Design-Build-Finance-Operate-Maintain procurements); and
      (6)   Other evaluation factors.
   (D)   Independent design peer review. Any request may require each offeror
to identify independent peer reviewer services whose competence and
qualification to provide such services shall be an additional evaluation factor
in the award of the contract. The city reserves the right to choose its
provider of independent peer reviewer services.
(Ord. 12-028, passed 1-22-13)
§ 39.16 BID PROTEST PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Generally. Any actual bidder who is aggrieved in connection with the
intended award or award of a contract shall protest to the City Manager or to
the City Clerk in the manner stated below within ten calendar days of the date
of notification of award posted in accordance with this subchapter. The term
"actual bidder" includes any bidder or offeror who submitted a bid which was
not received by the city on time, or delivered by an approved method, or not
considered by the city for any reason when bids were opened and evaluated.
   (B)   Protest procedure. A protest shall be in writing, submitted to the
City Manager or to the City Clerk and received in hand by either of them no
later than 5:00 p.m. of the tenth calendar day after posting of the
notification of award and the protest shall set forth the specific grounds for
the protest and the relief requested. Any grounds for the protest or type of
relief requested, which is not specifically set forth in the written protest,
is deemed to be abandoned.
   (C)   Authority to resolve protest. The City Manager or the Assistant City
Manager if so designated by the City Manager, in coordination with and under
the advisement of the City Attorney or outside counsel shall have authority, to
resolve a protest by an actual aggrieved bidder concerning the award of a
contract. The timely filing of a written protest is an administrative step that
must be complied with before any aggrieved "actual bidder" may file suit
against the city or any department, constitute agency or employee, of the city
seeking judicial relief from a court of competent jurisdiction. Exclusive venue
and jurisdiction in any such suit shall lie in Kershaw County, South Carolina.
   (D)   Decision. If the protest is not resolved by mutual agreement, the City
Manager or the Assistant City Manager if so designated, in coordination with
the City Attorney or outside counsel, and after investigation as is deemed
necessary by the City Manager or Assistant City Manager, shall issue a decision
in writing within 15 calendar days after receipt of the protest. The decision
shall state the reasons for the action taken.
   (E)   Notice of decision. A copy of the decision shall be posted on a public
bulletin board at City Hall and mailed or otherwise furnished promptly to the
aggrieved bidder, the successful bidder, and any other involved party. If the
city maintains a website, a copy of the decision may also be posted on the web
site. If requested by the protesting bidder, delivery of the decision may be
made by fax or email, without the necessity of mailing the decision by U.S.
mail. A courtesy copy may be sent to the attorney of the aggrieved bidder, if
requested by the bidder.
   (F)   Failure to render timely decision. If the City Manager or the
Assistant City Manager, if so designated, does not issue the written decision
within 15 calendar days after the filing of the protest, or within such longer
period of time as may be agreed upon by the parties, then the protest shall be
deemed to have been denied, and the aggrieved bidder must proceed as if an
adverse decision has been received by it on the last day allowed for a
response.
(Ord. 12-028, passed 1-22-13)
§ 39.17 ACQUISITION AND DISPOSITION OF SURPLUS PROPERTY.
   (A)   Surplus property. Surplus property consists of two types of property:
      (1)   Property available from the state that can be purchased by the city
from the General Services Division of the State without requiring competitive
bids; or
      (2)   Property of the city means property which:
         (a)   Has reached or is rapidly approaching an expiration date or the
end of its useful life;
         (b)   Is worn-out or otherwise no longer useful to the organization
for its intended purposes;
         (c)   Is obsolete; or
         (d)   Too costly to maintain or operate.
   (B)   Generally.
      (1)   Items which have little or no salvage value, considering the cost
of disposing of same, such as older model computers and printers, may be
offered to employees at nominal prices, as established by the department head
upon the approval of the City Manager or Assistant City Manager, before other
means of disposition are considered.
      (2)   Items with salvage value, but which are likely to bring little at a
conventional auction, may be sold through an internet site such as
www.govdeals.com or any other reputable internet site or auction service which
the City Manager, Assistant City Manager or designated department head has
determined will offer the most exposure to potential interested buyers, or
which will likely result in the highest return for the city.
      (3)   Surplus property with trade-in value may also be traded-in to a
dealer or vendor in exchange for, or toward the purchase of, items needed by a
department of the city. For example, surplus firearms may be traded to a
licensed firearms dealer to acquire new law enforcement weapons, rather than
being sold to the public.
      (4)   Surplus property may also be sold to, traded with or donated to
other governmental entities such Kershaw County or the fire and/or rescue
departments in the area, if such is found to be in the best interests of the
city.

sanitary sewer shall be completed by a person properly licensed or authorized
by the city to perform such services.
   (J)   Before any underground portions thereof are covered, the applicant for
the building sewer permit shall notify the city when the building sewer is
ready for inspection and connection to the public sanitary sewers. The
connection thereof shall be made to the public sanitary sewer by a licensed or
authorized plumber and only after inspection. The inspection thereof shall be
made within two working days of the receipt of notice by the city.
   (K)   All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately
guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazards.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city.

serviced by a building sewer maintain sewer in such a manner as to keep
excessive amounts of infiltration/inflow from entering the public sewers. The
city will notify the owner of any building sewer not properly maintained. The
owner will then be required to have the necessary repairs made at his own
expense. The owner shall be responsible for any necessary repairs which are
necessary on private property and the city will accept the responsibility for
any necessary repairs of the sewer service line from the customer's property
line to the city sewer main after the customer installs an appropriate "clean
out" at the property line. The "clean out" plug must be installed and kept
clear of obstructions so that it can be easily located. The city will determine
whether a person, properly licensed, will be required to make the repairs.
Before any underground portions are covered, the owner will notify the city
when the building sewer is ready for inspection.

equitable manner, the city adopts the following regulations and restrictions on
the delivery and consumption of water.
   (B)   This subchapter is declared necessary for the preservation of public
health, safety, and welfare and shall take effect upon its adoption by the
city.
   (C)   Whenever, in the judgement of the governing body of the city, it
becomes necessary to conserve water in the service area, due to drought, the
city is authorized to issue a proclamation that existing drought conditions
prevent fulfillment of the usual water-use demands. The proclamation is an
attempt to prevent depleting the water supply to the extent that water-use for
human consumption, sanitation, fire protection, and other essential needs
become endangered.

restrictions set forth under this subchapter shall become effective and remain
in effect until the water shortage is terminated and the proclamation
rescinded.
   (E)   Water uses, regulated or prohibited under this subchapter, are
considered to be nonessential and continuation of such uses during times of
water shortage are deemed to constitute a waste of water, subjecting the
offender to the penalties of §
52.99.

      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works that will interfere with its operation;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the Publicly Owned
Treatment Works that will pass through the Publicly Owned Treatment Works,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with
the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
      (3)   To protect Publicly Owned Treatment Works personnel who may be
affected by wastewater and sludge in the course of their employment and the
general public;
      (4)   To promote reuse and recycling of industrial wastewater and sludge
from the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
      (5)   To provide for fees for the equitable distribution of the cost of
operation, maintenance, and improvement of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works;
and
      (6)   To enable the city to comply with its National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System permit conditions, sludge use and disposal requirements, and
any other federal or state laws to which the Publicly Owned Treatment Works is
subject.
   (B)   This chapter shall apply to all users of the Publicly Owned Treatment
Works. The chapter authorizes the issuance of wastewater discharge permits;
provides for monitoring, compliance, and enforcement activities; establishes
administrative review procedures; requires user reporting; and provides for the
setting of fees for the equitable distribution of costs resulting from the
program established here.

§ 53.083 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify
the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state
hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a
substance which, if otherwise disposed of would be a hazardous waste under 40
CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as
set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of
discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100
kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also
shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known
and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous
constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that
calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the
wastestream expected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All
notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge
commences. Any notification under this division need be submitted only once for
each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under §
53.079. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of §§
53.075,
53.077, and
53.078.
   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A) of this
section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity
of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e),
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user
discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require
additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the Director,
the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and State hazardous
waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the
effective date of such regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the user
shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity
of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.

Penalty, see § 53.999
§ 53.085 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) of this section, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the Director
may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab
samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative
sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
(Ord., passed 11-28-95)

discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring
programs, and the Director's inspection and sampling activities, shall be
available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically
requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Director, that
the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or
methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable
state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a
report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately
upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or
pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other
"effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as
confidential information and will be available to the public without
restriction.

ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
§ 53.130 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may
serve upon that user a written Notice of Violation. Within ten days of the
receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Director. Submission of this
plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring
before or alter receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section
shall limit the authority of the Director to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a
Notice of Violation.
(Ord., passed 11-28-95)
§ 53.131 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Director may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
53.133 and
53.134 and shall be judicially enforceable.
(Ord., passed 11-28-95)
§ 53.132 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Director may order a user which has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before
the Director and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the
meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a
request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered
or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the
hearing. Such notice may be served on any authorized representative of the
user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the user.
(Ord., passed 11-28-95)
§ 53.133 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may
issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the
user come into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come
into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued
unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances
are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord., passed 11-28-95)
§ 53.134 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued
hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the
user's past violations are likely to recur, the Director may issue an order to
the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the
user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord., passed 11-28-95)
§ 53.135 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Director finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, a wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Director may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $2,000. Such fines shall
be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other
long term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during
the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be
assessed an additional penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall
accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5% per month. A lien against the user's
property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Director to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount
within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the
Director may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is
successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be
returned to the user. The Director may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
(Ord., passed 11-28-95)
§ 53.136 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   The Director may immediately suspend a user's discharge, alter informal
notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent
or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The Director
may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, alter notice and opportunity
to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or
which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the environment.
   (A)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Director may take
such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer
connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or
endangerment to any individuals. The Director may allow the user to recommence
its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Director that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in §
53.137 are initiated against the user.
   (B)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment, shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Director prior to the date of any show
cause or termination hearing under §§
53.132 or
53.137.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to
any emergency suspension under this section.

inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
   (E)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §§
53.020 through
53.025.
Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be
offered an opportunity to show cause under §
53.132 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Director shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.

AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
§ 53.160 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, "UPSET" means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or
improper operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the requirements
of division (C) of this section are met.
   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall
demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other
relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the causes of the
upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the Director
within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset provided; if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days:
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any
claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
(Ord., passed 11-28-95)
§ 53.161 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought
against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
53.020(A) or the specific prohibitions in §§
53.020(B)(3) through (B)(7) if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in
compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or
interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was
regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference,
was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal requirements.
(Ord., passed 11-28-95)
§ 53.162 BYPASS.
   (A)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
   "BYPASS." The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
   "SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE." Substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or substantial
and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to
occurring the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean
economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment
standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential
maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not subject to
the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.
   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Director, at least ten days before the date of the
bypass, if possible.
      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Director of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the
time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission shall also be
provided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The
written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the
duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has
not been corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps
taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The Director may waive the written report on a case-by- case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take an enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under division (C) of
this section.
      (2)   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in division (D)(1) of this section.

hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Director may
petition the Municipal Court of the city or the Court of Common Pleas through
the City's Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The Director may also seek such other action
as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement
for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user.

to construct, erect, operate and maintain a cable television system (including

company shall at all times strictly comply with the terms of that pole
attachment agreement.

amended to authorize the company to engage in other activities subject to such
additional conditions as may be required to protect the public interest.

interests obtained through this franchise without prior permission. The company
must pay all fees and compensation required by the franchise or local, state or

any longer than, or in any fashion other than in the city's judgment its own

and regulations of the Federal Communications Cammission, particularly with

unless the franchise provision is preempted as a matter of law. Any preemption
shall only limit the company's obligations for the time and to the extent the
provision is preempted. In the event there is a change of law or regulation

subscribers' receivers throughout the system essentially of the same quality
and characteristics as received by the company. The company shall maintain
properly calibrated test equipment and shall perform tests sufficient to
determine whether it is in compliance with this section at least annually, or
as necessary upon customer or city complaint. Except as prohibited by federal

determining compliance with this section, and/or may inspect the results of
tests performed by the company.
(Ord., passed 8-25-92)
§ 92.09 CONVENIENCE AND NECESSITY OF CUSTOMERS.
   Whenever it is necessary to shut-off or interrupt service for the purpose of
making repairs, adjustments or installation, the company shall do so at such
time as shall cause the least amount of inconvenience to its customers, and

reasonable notice thereof to its customers.
(Ord., passed 8-25-92)
§ 92.10 RATES FOR SERVICES.
   (A)   Except as prohibited by federal law, the city may regulate the rates
for services charged by the company. This section shall be interpreted to allow
the city to take any action appropriate to provide a complete bond of
protection to subscribers against rates or charges which are or become
excessive. This section shall also be interpreted to permit the city to require
the company to obtain prior approval before instituting or increasing any rate.
   (B)   The company shall not, as to rates, charges, service facilities,
rules, regulations or in any other respect make or grant any undue reference or
advantage to any person nor subject any person to any undue prejudice or
disadvantage. The company shall not, under any circumstance, discriminate on

(Ord., passed 8-25-92)
§ 92.11 PROVISION OF SERVICES; CUSTOMER PROTECTION.

extraordinary circumstances justify a higher charge, service shall be provided

service at then-prevailing installation rates where a new subscriber requesting
service is within 500 feet of the nearest cable system plant, or where the
density of homes which would be passed by an extension, is equal to or exceeds
six homes per quarter mile, measured from the nearest existing cable system
plant.
   (B)   In the event the requirements set forth in division (A) are not
satisfied, the company shall extend its system on request based on the
following cost-sharing formula:
      (1)   Actual turnkey cost to construct the requested extension (not
including the subscriber drop) equals the cost for the extension;
      (2)   Total cost divided by six times the number of quarter miles of
extension equals the company's share per subscriber;
      (3)   Total cost divided by number of homes requesting service equals the
cost per subscriber; and
      (4)   Cost per subscriber minus the company's share equals the
subscriber's share of the cost of the extension.
   (C)   If, within three years after any subscriber makes a contribution in
aid of construction of an extension, one or more homes are built or one or more
persons passed by the extension choose to subscribe to cable service, the
company shall rebate each contributing subscriber a pro rata amount equal to
company's share per subscriber times the number of homes or subscribers added,
up to the total amount of the subscriber's contribution.
   (D)   Where a subscriber drop exceeds 150 feet in length (measured to a
public way reasonably accessible to the company), the company may require the
subscriber to pay the additional actual cost of providing the drop (on a time
and materials basis).
   (E)   The company shall at all times provide service in a manner which
conforms to customer service requirements adopted by the city. The requirements
may be amended from time to time. The initial requirements are attached to

   (C)   The company may ascertain the needs of the community by completing an
annual survey of a representative sample of its subscribers and by publishing
and distributing to all subscribers a customer handbook which, among other
things, will solicit input from subscribers and detail procedures for
communications fram subscribers to the company. To provide formal documentation
that such communications are effectively occurring, the company shall maintain
written files of questions and comments from subscribers. These files will be
available for inspection by the city.

system (where the affiliate does not itself hold a cable franchise for Camden)
if that affiliate directly or indirectly provides any cable service over the

§ 92.19 NO TRANSFER WITHOUT CONSENT.
   (A)   The franchise may not be assigned or transferred, in whole or part, or
leased or sublet or mortgaged by any means without prior consent, which consent
shall not unreasonably be withheld. A change of control or ownership of the
company shall be considered a transfer. The term "control" includes actual
working control in whatever manner exercised, and shall be deemed to have
occurred upon acquisition or accumulation by any person of ten percent of the
shares or interests in the company or any entity which directly or indirectly
owns or controls the company. The company and the proposed transferee must
cooperate in the city's investigation of the transfer and each is required to
provide pertinent documents and respond to reasonable requests for information,
including specifically, requests for projections regarding the financial
performance and rates of the system after transfer.
   (B)   In reviewing a request for a transfer, the city may consider, but is
not limited to considering, the following factors, except as prohibited by

franchise and to continue to provide service at a reasonable price;
      (2)   The financial, technical and legal qualifications of transferee
(including character qualifications);
      (3)   The proposed transferee's record of performance in other

obligations under the franchise, including its duty to correct all past
deficiencies, if any; and whether the transferee is willing to sign the
franchise and transfer documents;
      (6)   Whether the transfer will adversely affect service to the public;
      (7)   Whether the transferee and the company have provided information
necessary to evaluate the transfer request; and
      (8)   Not withstanding the foregoing, transfer to a parent or affiliate
corporation with the same ownership and control shall not require consent of
the city, provided the city is given 60 days notice in writing.

§ 92.20 RATE REGULATIONS.
   The city and the company agree that, should the Acts be amended to allow

of the city, be reopened solely to establish procedures for such regulation.
The city shall give the company 60 days written notice of such proposed
reopening of this agreement.
(Ord., passed 8-25-92)
§ 92.21 PROVISION OF PUBLIC EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENT ACCESS.
   (A)   The city and the company agree that provision of access to cable
television channel time for public education and government use is an important
consideration. To provide such local access, the company shall be required to
designate a Public Access Channel and make up to two hours per 24-hour day
available free of charge for educational and governmental use. A proportionate
portion of the two hours shall be broadcast during prime viewing time, defined
as being between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 11:00 p.m. seven days per week.
   (B)   Such use shall be defined as free access to the company's character
generator and shall be subject to mechanical limitations of the company's
character generating equipment. Access will be provided at the company's
administrative office in the city, and company personnel shall assist
interested public parties in preparing announcements and other public
information.
   (C)   Public access uses shall be defined as public service announcements;
notices of meetings and activities, including fund raising events, of civic and
non-profit community organizations, and local governing bodies; announcements
of educational activities; non- commercial services and events of general
interest in the city; and the like.
   (D)   Commercial interests, paid political announcements, and other subject
matter which is deemed inappropriate by both the city and the company shall be
excluded from free public access as defined in this section.
   (E)   The company is further required to make special provisions for local
access which would not be adequately provided through use of the character
generator. In such cases, the company shall make available its video production
facilities in Abbeville, South Carolina. It will be the responsibility of the
interested party to schedule use of these facilities with the company and to
arrange its own transportation to Abbeville. The company shall make the
facilities available as quickly and as conveniently as possible.

§ 92.22 SEPARABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or portion of this
chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed to be a separate, distinct
and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the
remaining portions hereof. This severability clause is expressly subject to the
following: if any material provision is preempted, declared void or becomes
unenforceable for any reason, the city shall have the right to adopt
alternative provisions and amendments which preserve the benefits of the
franchise or establish equivalent benefits. If the alternative provisions and

the landlord during the existence of the tenancy or lease, then, and in that
case, the landlord is the person responsible. Any person who has caused to

days after submission, to the extent possible and practical. If the Urban
Forester, in his sole discretion, determines that it is not possible or
practical to rule on an application within the allotted time, the Urban
Forester shall notify the applicant of such delay. Any failure to properly
notify an applicant shall not constitute a waiver of the requirement for proper
approval by the Urban Forester and an applicant shall not be entitled to
perform any tree planting activity unless and until an application is properly
approved by the Urban Forester. Failure to properly comply with this provision
shall be grounds for penalties as provided in this chapter. Applications for a

three years after planting. Mulch shall be applied in an even layer, three to
four inches deep and applied outward to the dripline of the tree at a distance
of one lateral foot per one inch of caliper. Mulch shall be kept at least one-
half inch away from the tree trunk to avoid creating conditions favorable to
insect pests, disease or rodent infestation.
         (b)   All existing trees on public property should be mulched where
practical, as far out toward the dripline as possible. Mulch shall be kept at
least one-half inch away from the tree trunk to avoid creating conditions
favorable to or insect pests, disease or rodent infestation.

possible, for all newly planted trees during the months of March through
October (weather dependent) and at least once per week. Water shall be applied
consistently on and enough to thoroughly wet the tree's root ball. Watering
shall be performed at least through the first growing season or until the tree
is established in the landscape, whichever is later. When and where
appropriate, water shall be applied, to the extent possible, to mature trees
during the summer months and/or periods of low rainfall or extreme drought

in the necessary strength and applied at the proper time to obtain the desired
control. General spraying for pest control shall be discouraged. Any pesticide

         (b)   The city, acting under its police powers in order to protect
public welfare, is authorized, upon seven days written notice to the property
owner (or sooner, subject to the owner's consent), to treat trees on private
property, to the extent possible, if they are found to have a pest problem that
poses a major threat to surrounding trees and/or present a danger/nuisance to
humans or the environment, as determined by the Urban Forester. In the event
treatment does not abate or cannot be abated, the city may seek the removal of
infested trees in accordance with the removal provisions in §
100.09(A)(3)(g) herein. Treatment of pests or other nuisances is not a
prerequisite to the removal of such trees under §

primarily for public trees, but may also be requested for residential trees.
The Urban Forester shall be responsible for performing site visits and
completing an on-the-ground visual examination and evaluation regarding tree
health and structural soundness. The tree check will generally result in one of
the following: no action needed, re-inspect at a later date or a work order for
tree removal or pruning.
   (E)   Removal.
      (1)   Generally. If any public tree is determined by the Urban Forester
to be a hazard, irreparably diseased, injured or located in a manner that
endangers the public health, safety or welfare of city residents or
infrastructure, the Urban Forester may authorize its immediate removal.
      (2)   Tree removal requests. A tree removal permit shall be required for
any person wishing to remove a public tree. Depending on the nature of the
request and condition of the tree, the requestor may bear the responsibility of
the cost of removal; Otherwise, removal of trees on public property shall be
the responsibility, but not the obligation, of the city. The city may charge
the cost of the removal of the tree(s) to the requestor in response to the
request. The Urban Forester will approve or reject any and all permit requests
submitted.
      (3)   Tree removal permit. A permit shall be required for any party,
except for those acting at the express request or direction of the Urban
Forester, to remove any public tree. The application for a public tree removal
permit shall be reviewed by the Urban Forester who, shall rule on the
application and provide notification to the applicant of the results of the
ruling within ten business days after submission, to the extent possible and
practical. If the Urban Forester determines that it is not possible or
practical to rule on an application within the allotted time, the Urban
Forester shall notify the applicant of such delay. Any failure to properly
notify an applicant shall not constitute a waiver of the requirement for proper
approval by the Urban Forester and an applicant shall not be entitled to
perform any tree planting activity unless and until an application is properly
approved by the Urban Forester. Failure to properly comply with this provision
shall be grounds for penalties as provided in this chapter. The application for
a public tree removal permit must include, at a minimum, the following
information:

following reasons and removal for other reasons may be permitted in the sole
discretion of the Urban Forester:
         (a)   The tree is dead;
         (b)   The tree is affected by a pest problem that is untreatable or
treatment is impractical and will result in rapidly declining tree health or a
hazardous condition;
         (c)   The tree is in irreversible decline due to mechanical damage,
poor maintenance or environmental stresses or a combination thereof and its
condition cannot be improved with standard maintenance techniques;
         (d)   The tree has an uncorrectable structural defect that results in
an increased risk of whole or partial tree failure;
         (e)   The tree is reducing sight visibility of traffic signs/signals,
intersections or other situations, which may endanger life or property and the
correction of the problem will result in severe disfigurement of the tree or
will result in crown reduction encompassing more than 50% of the normal canopy;
         (f)   The tree is in a restricted growing space resulting in conflict
with the surrounding hardscape or infrastructure and the conflict cannot be
resolved;
         (g)   The tree is in conflict with overhead utility lines and proper
pruning cannot adequately reduce the conflict without severely disfiguring the
tree or will result in crown reduction encompassing more than 50% of the normal
crown; or
         (h)   The tree is in conflict with proposed site reconfiguration/
improvements or above/below ground utility upgrades and the conflict cannot be
resolved or the correction of the problem will result in severe disfigurement
of the tree or severe root damage which compromises structural stability or
will result in crown reduction encompassing more than 50% of the normal crown.
      (5)   Replacement of trees removed. Public trees removed shall, to the
extent possible and practical, be replaced within 12 months after removal. If
the site where the public tree was removed is not suitable for replanting, a
tree shall be planted in a suitable location as close as possible to the
removal location. Otherwise, a tree shall be planted in another location within
the vicinity as determined by the Urban Forester. The city shall assess a
replacement fee to the individual, group, entity or agency requesting the
removal. The replacement fee shall not exceed the actual costs to the city.
      (6)   Stump removal. Stumps of public trees shall, to the extent possible
and practical, be removed to a depth of six inches below the surface of the
ground so that the top of the stump shall not project above the surface of the
ground. Notwithstanding the provisions hereof, the city reserves the right to
preserve stumps with historic and/or cultural significance.
      (7)   Private trees.
         (a)   The city, acting under its police powers in order to protect
public welfare, is authorized to remove or cause to be removed trees on private
property that are hazard trees (as determined by the Urban Forester) have pest
infestations that are a threat to surrounding trees or are otherwise nuisances
that threaten the health and safety of the public.
         (b)   Owners of premises where a hazard, pest infested or nuisance
tree is located shall be provided written notification (either in person or by
registered mail) by the Urban Forester that action must be taken to abate the
situation within 30 days. If after 30 days the problem has not been abated, the
city shall have the right to remove the tree or cause the tree to be removed
and charge the property owner with the cost of removal and all other associated

of this chapter unless it is used as a childcare, adult day care, or health
care facility. Nor is a private passenger motor vehicle a "PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT"
when used in the performance of employment responsibilities, provided it is not

   This chapter shall be referred to as the "Development Impact Fee Chapter for
the City of Camden, South Carolina".
(Ord. 2023-027, passed 10-24-23)
§ 104.02 AUTHORITY.
   This chapter is adopted pursuant to and in compliance with the authority of
the South Carolina Development Impact Fee Act, codified at S.C. Code Title 6,
Article 9, as amended (the "Act"), and is to be interpreted in accordance with
such Act, or as it may be amended in the future.
(Ord. 2023-027, passed 10-24-23)
§ 104.03 FINDINGS.
   The Camden City Council hereby declares that:
   (A)   Adequate parks and recreation facilities, fire protection, and
municipal facilities and equipment are vital and necessary to the health,
safety, welfare, and prosperity of the city and its citizens. Substantial
growth and new construction are taking place within the city and is anticipated
to continue. This growth creates substantial need for new infrastructure
capacity. Meeting these needs is very costly; however, failure to do so will
result in an inadequate system of facilities and equipment to accommodate
anticipated demand. This would make the city a less desirable place to live and
do business and be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare, and prosperity
of the city and its citizens.
   (B)   To the extent that future growth and new construction in the city
place demands on parks and recreation facilities, fire protection, and
municipal facilities and equipment those demands and needs should be met by
shifting a portion of the capital costs for providing new capacity to serve new
development, which creates, in whole or in part, these demands and needs.
   (C)   By Resolution #2022-029 dated August 23,2022, the City Council
directed the Planning Commission to conduct the necessary studies and develop a
recommended development impact fee ordinance in accordance with the
requirements of the Act.
   (D)   The Planning Commission recommended to City Council a Development
Impact Fee Study Report for Camden dated September 12, 2023, a City of Camden
Capital Improvements Plan with projects eligible for impact fee funding dated
September 12, 2023, and a Housing Affordability Analysis in Support of a
Development Impact Fee Study Report in Camden dated September 12, 2023, each of
which have been adopted by the City Council, as modified.
   (E)   This chapter is enacted to implement the findings and recommendations
of the Development Impact Fee Study Report for Camden and endorse the list of
capital projects eligible for impact fee-funding in the City of Camden Capital
Improvements Plan.
   (F)   The development impact fees (as defined herein) prescribed in this
chapter are equitable, do not impose an unfair or disproportionate burden on
developers and new construction, and are in the best interests of the general
welfare of the city and its citizens.
   (G)   New facilities or equipment eligible for impact fee funding will
benefit all new development or redevelopment in city limits. Therefore, it is
appropriate to treat the entire city as one service area for calculating,
collecting, and spending development impact fees.
   (H)   This chapter provides the procedures for timely processing of
applications for determination of appropriate development impact fees
applicable to all development inside city limits subject to the development
impact fees, and for the timely processing of applications for individual
assessment of development impact fees, credits, or reimbursements allowed or
paid.
   (I)   The maximum allowable parks and recreation development impact fees
determined in the Development Impact Fee Study Report for Camden has been
reduced by 20% for the General Development Impact Fee Schedule summarized in
Exhibit A attached to Ord. 2023-027, setting the fees at 80% of the maximum
amount to provide a reasonable fee for residential investment and to ensure
that the development impact fees collected do not exceed the cost to provide
capital facilities that accommodate new development.
   (J)   The maximum allowable fire protection development impact fees
determined in the Development Impact Fee Study Report for Camden has been
reduced by 20% for the General Development Impact Fee Schedule summarized in
Exhibit A of Ord. 2023-027, setting the fees at 80% of the maximum amount to
provide a reasonable fee for residential and non-residential investments and to
ensure that the development impact fees collected do not exceed the cost to
provide capital facilities that accommodate new development.
   (K)   The maximum allowable municipal facilities and equipment development
impact fee determined in the Development Impact Fee Study Report for Camden has
been reduced by 20% for the General Development Impact Fee Schedule summarized
in Exhibit A of Ord. 2023-027, setting the fees at 80% of the maximum amount to
provide a reasonable fee for residential and non-residential investments and to
ensure that the development impact fees collected do not exceed the cost to
provide capital facilities and equipment that accommodate new development.
   (L)   Property for which a valid building permit (as defined herein) has
been issued prior to the effective date of this chapter shall not be subject to
new or updated development impact fees.

located within city limits.
(Ord. 2023-027, passed 10-24-23)
§ 104.07 APPLICATION AND EXEMPTIONS.
   The provisions of the chapter shall apply to all new development or
redevelopment within city limits for which a building permit or development
approval is required except for the following:
   (A)   Rebuilding the same amount of floor space of a structure that was
destroyed by fire or another natural catastrophe;
   (B)   Remodeling or repairing a structure with the same land use that does
not result in an increase in the number of service units or place new demand on
parks and recreation facilities, fire protection, or municipal facilities and
equipment;
   (C)   Replacing a residential unit, including a manufactured home, with
another residential unit on the same lot, unless it is demonstrated clearly
that the new unit creates new demand for parks and recreation facilities, fire
protection, or municipal facilities and equipment;
   (D)   Placing a construction trailer or temporary office on a lot during the
period of construction on the same lot;
   (E)   Construction of an addition to a residential structure that does not
increase new demand for parks and recreation facilities, fire protection, or
municipal facilities and equipment generated by the same land use;
   (F)   Adding uses that are typically accessory to residential uses, such as
a tennis court or a clubhouse, unless it is demonstrated clearly that the use
creates new demand for parks and recreation facilities, fire protection, or
municipal facilities and equipment;
   (G)   All or part of a particular development project if:
      (1)   The project is determined to create affordable housing; and
      (2)   The exempt development's proportionate share of system improvements
is funded through a revenue source other than development impact fees;
   (H)   Constructing a new elementary, middle, or secondary school; and
   (I)   Constructing a new volunteer fire department.
(Ord. 2023-027, passed 10-24-23)
§ 104.08 PROVISIONS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
   Because all or part of any particular development project may be exempt from
development impact fees for affordable housing, the following sets forth the
administrative standards for determining what constitutes affordable housing
and the procedures for exemption from one or more development impact fees.
   (A)   Median family income. Affordable housing is based upon 80% of the
median family income for residents living within the City of Camden. Median
family income shall be determined once a year utilizing the following
procedure:
      (1)   The most recently available figures from the U.S. Census Bureau
American Community Survey or Decennial Census, whichever is most current, will
serve as the base year for this evaluation; and
      (2)   Each subsequent year will be adjusted once annually thereafter
during January of the calendar year based upon the previous year's published
Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase, until the next U.S. Census Bureau data set
is published and this procedure is replicated.
   (B)   Maximum expenditure. The maximum expenditure for housing costs shall
correspond to the Fannie Mae Foundation Mortgage Calculator multiplier of 30%
of gross family income as used in the Housing Affordability Analysis in Support
of a Development Impact Fee Study in Camden. Affordable housing based upon 80%
of median family income is:
      (1)   Multi-family rental dwelling units of which the gross monthly rent
cost does not exceed 30% of 80% of the gross median family monthly income.
      (2)   Fee simple ownership dwelling units of which the cost of
homeownership for the dwelling unit does not exceed 30% of 80% of the gross
median family monthly income as reflected in the sales price using the Fannie
Mae Foundation Mortgage Calculator (or comparable methodology) assuming a 20%
down payment and a specified interest rate. The specified interest rate shall
be determined by selecting the lowest 30-year fixed mortgage rate reported by
area lending institutions as of the first week of January for any given year
and shall remain so for the balance of the year.
   (C)   Procedures for exemption from development impact fees.
      (1)   A developer seeking exemption from one or more development impact
fees for the construction of affordable multi-family rental dwelling units must
identify the alternate source of funds for the impact fee and, unless the
alternative source is from city resources, post a financial guarantee suitable
to the city prior to the issuance of a building permit. The amount of the
financial guarantee shall reflect the amount of development impact fees due for
all affordable housing units as if they were not affordable housing units. No
Certificate of Occupancy for any of the units may be issued until the impact
fees for the affordable housing units have been paid by the alternate source or
from the proceeds of the financial guarantee.
      (2)   (a)   A developer seeking exemption from one or more development
impact fees for construction of a fee simple ownership dwelling unit shall
identify the alternate source of funds for the impact fees and, unless the
alternate source is from city resources, post a financial guarantee suitable to
the city prior to the issuance of a building permit. The amount of the
financial guarantee shall reflect the amount of development impact fees due for
all affordable housing units as if they were not affordable housing units. No
Certificate of Occupancy may be issued for the affordable housing dwellings
until the impact fees have been paid by the alternate source or from the
proceeds of the financial guarantee.
         (b)   If the alternative source of funds for impact fees is from city
resources, prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy by the city, the
developer shall file with the city a closing statement for the dwelling unit
indicating an arm's length sales price no greater than allowed for affordable
housing at the time of final sale and a recorded covenant, approved by the
city, restricting the sales price of the dwelling, for a period of ten years,
to the original sales price, adjusted annually for inflation.
(Ord. 2023-027, passed 10-24-23)
§ 104.09 DETERMINATION OF FEES.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   The City Planning and Development Department shall determine and
collect all development impact fees administered within city limits.
      (2)   (a)   Upon the effective date of this chapter, development impact
fees shall be charged to new development or redevelopment in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this chapter. The fees to be collected for a
development will be determined at the time of application for a building
permit. If the development is one that does not require a building permit, the
impact fee for the development will be determined at the time of development
approval. No building permit or development approval shall be issued for any
development requiring the payment of development impact fees until the fees
have been remitted to the City Planning and Development Department, or in the
case of affordable housing, the appropriate financial guarantees have been
filed with the City Manager.
         (b)   At the City Planning and Development Director's discretion, any
development impact fees may be remitted after the issuance of a building
permit, but in all instances, the development impacts fees must be remitted to
the City Planning and Development Department prior to the issuance of a
Certificate of Occupancy.
         (c)   Payment of such fees shall not relieve the developer from
obligations to comply with any other applicable city ordinances, regulations,
or requirements including, but not limited to, the "Land Development
Regulations" or "Zoning" chapters of the City of Camden Code of Ordinances
prior to receiving a Certificate of Occupancy.
      (3)   All monies paid by the fee payor pursuant to this chapter shall be
identified as development impact fees and promptly deposited in the appropriate
development impact fee trust fund described under § 104.10.
      (4)   For the purpose of calculating development impact fees, the land
use types assumed in the General Development Impact Fee Schedule of this
chapter (i.e., Exhibit A of Ord. 2023-027) shall be defined in accordance with
the definitions contained in the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip
Generation Manual, Tenth Edition (see Development Impact Fee Study Report for
Camden).
      (5)   Payment of development impact fees according to the General
Development Impact Fee Schedule (i.e., Exhibit A of Ord. 2023-027), or
independent impact fee calculation study accepted by City Council, shall
constitute full and complete payment of the new development's proportionate
share of public facilities costs.
      (6)   A developer may negotiate and contract with the city to provide
facilities or services in lieu of payment of development impact fees in
accordance with S.C. Code § 6-1-1050.
   (B)   Parks and recreation impact fee formula. Parks and recreation impact
fees collected within city limits shall be in accordance with the following
formula:
      Development Impact Fee = (NNDU) x (P/HH) x (COST) x (CDR)
      Where:
      NNDU = The number of net new dwelling units generated by the proposed
development.
      P/HH = Average person per household estimate published by the U.S. Census
Bureau for various dwelling unit categories (see Development Impact Fee Study
Report for Camden).
      COST = The cost per capita for providing improvements to parks and
recreation facilities based on information presented in the Development Impact
Fee Study Report for Camden adopted by City Council on            . The cost
per capita is $1,787.88.
      CDR = For the purpose of this calculation, it is City Council policy to
charge only 80% of the maximum allowable parks and recreation impact fee
determined in the Development Impact Fee Study Report for Camden.
   (C)   Determining park and recreation impact fees. The amount of parks and
recreation impact fees attributable to a specific development shall be
determined through the following process:
      (1)   Verify the type and number of new residential dwelling units for
which the building permit is being sought;
      (2)   Determine whether any of the proposed residential dwelling units
qualify as "Affordable Housing" and, if so, the number and type of such units;
      (3)   Determine the applicable residential dwelling unit category set
forth in Exhibit A of Ord. 2023-027 (as applicable) of this chapter; and
      (4)   Multiply the discounted development impact fee rate for the
residential dwelling unit category by the number of net new units within the
development and the average persons per household estimate.
   (D)   Independent parks and recreation impact fee calculation. In the event
that a fee payor or city staff contend that the land use for which the building
permit is being sought is not within those land uses identified in Exhibit A of
Ord. 2023-027, or if the fee payor contends that the Exhibit A of Ord. 2023-027
calculations are not accurate for its intended use, then the City Planning and
Development Director, or its designee, shall make a determination as to the
most comparable land use category to assume for calculating parks and
recreation impact fees. If the fee payor disagrees with the determination of
the City Planning and Development Director or if the city otherwise deems it
appropriate, an independent impact fee calculation may be performed to quantify
the fair share of system improvement costs attributable to the development.
Preparation of an independent impact fee calculation will immediately halt the
building permit application process until such time that the necessary
calculation is deemed complete by the City Planning and Development Director.
If an independent calculation is requested, it must accompany the building
permit application and be prepared in accordance with the following provisions:
      (1)   Independent calculations for the determination of parks and
recreation impact fees must be performed by a certified professional engineer,
architect, landscape architect, planner or other duly qualified and licensed/
certified professional approved by the City Planning and Development Director.
      (2)   The independent calculation shall be subject to review and approval
by the City Planning and Development Director, or its designee. In the event
that the City Planning and Development Director elects to contract with a third
party to review the independent calculation, the cost of the review shall be
borne by the applicant based on the cost of the third-party review plus a 10%
administrative fee.
      (3)   The City Planning and Development Director shall either approve or
provide in writing the reasons for disapproval of the independent calculation
study within 30 days of its submittal for review.
      (4)   Prior to commencing the study, the developer's hired professional
and the City Planning and Development Director, or its designee, shall agree
upon the relevant factors and values that will be utilized in the independent
calculation of impact fees.
      (5)   The maximum allowable parks and recreation impact fee determined in
the Development Impact Fee Study Report for Camden shall be reduced by 20% for
the purposes of completing an independent impact fee calculation, setting the

development. In instances where a variable other than square feet is used to
represent development intensity (such as hotel rooms or hospital beds or movie
screens) than that variable should be used in lieu of square feet, and such
variable is not divided by 1,000 as described in the formula above.

represent development intensity (such as hotel rooms or hospital beds or movie
screens) than that variable should be used in lieu of square feet, and such
variable is not divided by 1,000 as described in the formula above.
            ESR = Average employee space ratio approved by the City Planning
and Development Director.
            COST = The cost per employee for providing municipal facilities and
equipment based on information presented in the Development Impact Fee Study
Report for Camden adopted by City Council on            . The cost per employee
is $207.62.
            CDR = For the purpose of an independent impact fee calculation, it
is City Council policy to charge only 80% of the maximum allowable municipal
facilities and equipment impact fee determined in the Development Impact Fee
Study Report for Camden.
   (K)   Special cases. The City Planning and Development Department shall take
the following special cases into account when calculating development impact
fees for a building permit application:
      (1)   When an application for a building permit has been made that
contains two or more land uses in any combination, including two or more land
uses within a single building or structure, the total development impact fee
assessment shall be the sum of the products, as calculated above, for each land
use unless an independent impact fee calculation is performed, and approved for
use by the City Planning and Development Director, or its designee, consistent
with divisions (D),(G), or (J) of this section.
      (2)   In the case of a change, redevelopment, or modification of a land
use which requires a building permit, and which is not exempted from
development impact fees under § 104.07, the impact fee calculation shall be
based upon the net increase in new or proposed land use as compared to the
existing or previous land use.
      (3)   In the case of a demolition or termination of an existing use or
structure, development impact fees for future redevelopment shall be based upon
the net increase in development impact fees for the new or proposed land use as
compared to the existing actual active previous land use since its original
occupancy. Credit for the prior use shall not be transferable to another
location.
      (4)   In the case of relocating an existing land use, development impact
fees shall be assessed to the relocated use at its new location. Future
redevelopment of the old location from which the use was removed will receive a
credit against development impact fees assessed equal to the impact fees that
would have been assessed against the relocated use. Credits shall not be
transferable to the new location.
      (5)   Before a building permit application may become eligible for the
provisions set forth in divisions (K)(2) through (4) of this section, a
developer shall provide reasonably sufficient evidence that a previous land use
had been actively maintained on the site within 12 months of the date of
application for a building permit. Such evidence may include proof of utility
records, records for the use sought to be shown, or other documentation.
      (6)   Any claim of existing or previous use must be made no later than
the time for application of a building permit. Any claim made after such time
shall be deemed invalid.
(Ord. 2023-027, passed 10-24-23)
§ 104.10 IMPACT FEE TRUST ACCOUNTS.
   (A)   Development impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be
kept separate from other revenue of the city. There are hereby established the
Parks and Recreation Impact Fee Trust Account, the Fire Protection Impact Fee
Trust Account, and the Municipal Facilities and Equipment Impact Fee Trust
Account. Parks and recreation impact fees, fire protection impact fees, and
municipal facilities and equipment impact fees collected pursuant to this
chapter shall be kept in the Parks and Recreation Impact Fee Trust Account, the
Fire Protection Impact Fee Trust Account, and the Municipal Facilities and
Equipment Impact Fee Trust Account, respectively. All development impact fees
collected shall be properly identified by property address noted on the
approved building permit, date of payment, and by the appropriate trust
account.
   (B)   Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure shall
be maintained in an interest-bearing account prior to expenditure on eligible
projects. Interest earned on development impact fees in deposit must be
considered revenue to the trust account for which income is earned and must be
subject to all restrictions placed on the use of development impact fees
pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 2023-027, passed 10-24-23)
§ 104.11 LIMITATION ON EXPENDITURES OF FUNDS COLLECTED.
   (A)   Eligible system improvement costs. Funds from Development Impact Fee
Trust Accounts shall be expended only for the public facilities and system
improvements identified as eligible for impact fee funding in the City of
Camden Capital Improvements Plan, incorporated herein by reference. No funds
shall be used for administrative or operating costs associated with imposing
any of the development impact fees. Eligible components of a public facility
may include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Design and construction plan preparation;
      (2)   Right-of-way acquisition;
      (3)   Construction of new facilities, structures, or amenities that

improvements;
      (7)   Purchase and installation of traffic signalization;
      (8)   Construction of new curbs, medians, and shoulders;

      (10)   Principle payments, interest, and other finance charges on bonds
or other indebtedness issued by or on behalf of the city for financing any or
all public facilities.
   (B)   Rationale nexus test. The City Finance Director, or its designee,
shall make an annual report to the City Council and publish this report for
access by the general citizenry showing where development impact fees have been
collected and what projects have been funded with these revenues. The Council
shall consider this report and whether the fees are being spent for the benefit
of new development within city limits. If the Council determines that this is
not the case, then it shall adjust the City of Camden Capital Improvements Plan
and other projected capital expenditures to correct the condition.
   (C)   Expenditure of funds. Development impact fee funds shall be expended
in the order in which they were collected. The disbursal of such funds shall
require approval of the City Council, upon recommendation of the City Manager
or its designee.
   (D)   Reimbursement. Development impact fee funds not obligated for
expenditure within three years of the date that they are scheduled to be
expended in the City of Camden Capital Improvements Plan shall be returned,
with actual interest earned, to the record owner of the property for which the
fees were collected, on a first-in, first-out basis.

(Ord. 2023-027, passed 10-24-23)
§ 104.13 APPEAL PROCESS.
   A developer shall have the following rights for appeal of development impact
fees imposed by the city on their development pursuant only to this chapter:
   (A)   Administrative appeal.
      (1)   A developer may file an administrative appeal with the City Manager
regarding the payment of development impact fees, independent calculation of
impact fees, or credits or reimbursements by filing a written Notice of Appeal.
Said Notice shall be filed within 30 days of the decision sought to be
appealed. The filing of an appeal will immediately halt the building permit
application process, unless the developer posts a bond or submits an
irrevocable letter of credit for the full amount of the development impact fees
as calculated by the city to be due. All Notices of Appeal shall include a full
explanation of the reasons for the appeal, specifying the grounds therefore,
and containing any documentation that the developer desires to be considered.
The appeal shall contain the name and address of the developer filing the
appeal and shall state their capacity to act as a representative or agent if
they are not the owner of the property to which development impact fees or
credits pertain.
      (2)   Within 30 days following receipt of the written Notice of Appeal,
the City Manager will review the appellant's written report, supporting
documentation and departmental staff reports. The 30 day review period may be
extended if additional information is needed from the appellant in order to
render a decision. Upon completion of the administrative review, the City
Manager will provide a written response to the appellant constituting a final
administrative determination.
      (3)   Any person desiring to appeal the final administrative
determination of the City Manager regarding payment of development impact fees
or credits shall file a written Notice of Appeal to the City Council. Said
Notice of Appeal to City Council shall be filed with the Clerk of City Council
within 15 days following receipt of the final administrative determination.
Receipt shall be construed to have occurred when the final administrative
decision is deposited in the United States mail postage prepaid to the person
whose name and address is identified in the original Notice of Appeal.
      (4)   The City Clerk of Council will schedule all impact fee appeals for
the first City Council meeting following ten days from receipt of the Written
Notice of Appeal to the City Council. Postponements of the City Council appeal
date may be granted by the City Manager if they are requested in writing at
least ten days in advance of the scheduled City Council meeting date.
      (5)   When an appeal is scheduled for oral presentation before the City
Council, the appellant and city staff shall each be given ten minutes at the
oral argument to present the appeal and to discuss the submitted written
record.
   (B)   Payment under protest. A fee payor may pay development impact fees
under protest. Payment under protest does not preclude the developer from
filing an administrative appeal nor is the fee payer estopped from receiving a
refund of an amount considered to have been collected illegally. A fee payor,
at its option, may also post a bond or submit an irrevocable letter of credit
for the amount of development impact fees due instead of making a cash payment
under protest, pending the outcome of an appeal.
   (C)   Mediation. City Council shall provide for mediation by a qualified
independent party, upon voluntary agreement by both the developer and the city,
to address a disagreement related to development impact fees calculated by the
city. Neither a request for, nor participation in, mediation shall preclude a
fee payor from pursuing other developer rights or remedies otherwise available
by law.

§ 104.14 REFUNDS.
   (A)   General provisions. Funds not obligated for expenditure within three
years of the date that they are scheduled to be expended in the Capital
Improvements Plan shall be refunded to the record owner of property for which
the development impact fees were paid, with actual interest earned, on a first-
in, first-out basis. For the purpose of determining whether funds have been
spent or encumbered, the first money placed in a Trust Account shall be deemed
to be the first money taken out af that account when withdrawals have been
made.
   (B)   Refund process.
      (1)   The owner of property eligible for a refund of one or more
development impact fee payments shall submit to the City Planning and

owner of the property for which a refund is due, a certified copy of the latest
recorded deed, and a copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill for the

earned while on deposit in the specific Development Impact Fee Trust Account.

fee refunds are due has standing to sue for such refund pursuant to S.C. Code §
6-1-1020(D) of the Act if there has not been a good-faith effort towards a
timely payment of a refund pursuant to division (B)(2) of this section.

§ 104.99 PENALTIES.
   City Council shall have the following remedies, which may be exercised
individually or collectively, for collecting development impact fees. The
failure to pursue any remedy at any time shall not be deemed as a waiver of
city rights to pursue any remedy at such other time as may be deemed
appropriate.
   (A)   Interest and penalties. The city may, at its discretion, seek funds in
addition to the amount of calculated development impact fees due prior to award
of a Certificate of Occupancy for reasonable interest and penalties for non-

failure of the developer to pay required development impact fees in full.
   (E)   Other. The city may pursue the collection of the development impact
fees, including interest, by way of civil process in the Court of Kershaw

§ 110.03 PURPOSE AND DURATION.
   The business license levied by this chapter is for the purpose of providing
such regulation as may be required for the business subject thereto and for the
purpose of raising revenue for the General Fund through a privilege tax. Except
for the business license year beginning January 1, 2021, wherein each license
shall be issued for the 16-month period beginning January 1, 2021 continuing
through April 30, 2022, thereafter each license shall be issued for the 12-
month period of May 1 through April 30. The provisions of this chapter and the

§ 110.04 BUSINESS LICENSE TAX, REFUND.
   (A)   The required business license tax shall be paid for each business
subject hereto according to the applicable classification on or before the due
date of the 30th day of April in each year, except for those businesses in Rate
Class 8 for which a different due date is specified. Late payments shall be
subject to penalties as set forth in §
110.12 hereof, except that admitted insurance companies may pay before June 1
without penalty.
   (B)   A separate license shall be required for each place of business and
for each classification or business conducted at one place. If gross income
cannot be separated into separate classifications at one location, the business
license tax shall be computed on the combined gross income for the
classification requiring the highest rate. The business license tax must be
computed based on the licensee's gross income for the calendar year preceding
the due date, for the licensee's 12-month fiscal year preceding the due date,
or on a 12-month projected income based on the monthly average for a business
in operation for less than one year. The business license tax for a new
business must be computed on the estimated probable gross income for the
balance of the license year. A business license related to construction
contract projects may be issued on a per-project basis, at the option of the
taxpayer. No refund shall be made for a business that is discontinued.
   (C)   A licensee that submits a payment greater than the amount owed may
request a refund. To be considered, a refund request must be submitted in
writing to the municipality before the June 1 immediately following the April
30 on which the payment was due and must be supported by adequate documentation
supporting the refund request. The municipality shall approve or deny the
refund request, and if approved shall issue the refund to the business, within
30 days after receipt of the request.

   (A)   The owner, agent or legal representative of every business subject to
this chapter, whether listed in the NAICS classification index or not, shall
register the business and make application for a business license on or before
the due date of each year; provided, a new business shall be required to have a
business license prior to operation within the municipality, and an annexed
business shall be required to have a business license within 30 days of the
annexation. A license for a bar (NAICS 722410) must be issued in the name of
the individual who has been issued the corresponding state alcohol, beer, or
wine permit or license and will have actual control and management of the
business.
   (B)   Application shall be on the then-current standard business license
application as established and provided by the Director of the South Carolina
Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office and shall be accompanied by all information
about the applicant, the licensee, and the business deemed appropriate to carry
out the purpose of this chapter by the License Official. Applicants may be
required to submit copies of portions of state and federal income tax returns
reflecting gross receipts and gross revenue figures as necessary to determine
gross income.
   (C)   The applicant shall certify under oath that the information given in
the application is true, that the gross income is accurately reported (or
estimated for a new business) without any unauthorized deductions, and that all
assessments, personal property taxes on business property, and other monies due
and payable to the municipality have been paid.
   (D)   The municipality shall allow application, reporting, calculation, and
payment of business license taxes through the business license tax portal
hosted and managed by the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office,
subject to the availability and capability thereof. Any limitations in portal
availability or capability do not relieve the applicant or licensee from
existing business license or business license tax obligations.

§ 110.06 DEDUCTIONS, EXEMPTIONS, AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS.
   (A)   No deductions from gross income shall be made except income earned
outside of the municipality on which a license tax is paid by the business to
some other municipality or county and fully reported to the municipality, taxes
collected for a governmental entity, or income that cannot be included for
computation of the tax pursuant to state or federal law. Properly apportioned
income from business in interstate commerce shall be included in the
calculation of gross income and is not exempted. The applicant shall have the
burden to establish the right to exempt income by satisfactory records and
proof.
   (B)   No person shall be exempt from the requirements of the chapter by
reason of the lack of an established place of business within the municipality,
unless exempted by state or federal law. The License Official shall determine
the appropriate classification for each business in accordance with the latest
issue of NAICS, as available. No person shall be exempt from this chapter by
reason of the payment of any other tax, unless exempted by state law, and no
person shall be relieved of liability for payment of any other tax or fee by
reason of application of this chapter.
   (C)   Wholesalers are exempt from business license taxes unless they
maintain warehouses or distribution establishments within the municipality. A
wholesale transaction involves a sale to an individual who will resell the
goods and includes delivery of the goods to the reseller. It does not include a
sale of goods to a user or consumer.
   (D)   A charitable organization shall be exempt from the business license
tax on its gross income unless it is deemed a business subject to a business
license tax on all or part of its gross income as provided in this section. A
charitable organization, or any affiliate of a charitable organization, that
reports income from for-profit activities or unrelated business income for
federal income tax purposes to the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed a
business subject to a business license tax on the part of its gross income from
such for-profit activities or unrelated business income.
   (E)   (1)   A charitable organization shall be deemed a business subject to
a business license tax on its total gross income if:
         (a)   Any net proceeds of operation, after necessary expenses of
operation, inure to the benefit of any individual or any entity that is not
itself a charitable organization; or
         (b)   Any net proceeds of operation, after necessary expenses of
operation, are used for a purpose other than a charitable purpose.
      (2)   Excess benefits or compensation in any form beyond fair market
value to a sponsor, organizer, officer, director, trustee, or person with
ultimate control of the charitable organization shall not be deemed a necessary
expense of operation.
   (F)   For profit vendors at community sponsored events or festivals within
the municipality may be exempt from regular business license taxes, provided,
and as shall be approved by Council, that a per event or per festival fee is
paid in lieu of a license tax prior to each such event or festival.

the business, licensee, or business license tax required by this chapter.

establishment at the address shown on the license. A transient or non-resident
shall carry the license upon his person or in a vehicle used in the business
readily available for inspection by any authorized agent of the municipality.
   (B)   A change of address must be reported to the License Official within
ten days after removal of the business to a new location and the license will
be valid at the new address upon written notification by the License Official
and compliance with zoning and building codes. Failure to obtain the approval
of the License Official for a change of address shall invalidate the license
and subject the licensee to prosecution for doing business without a license. A
business license shall not be transferable, and a transfer of controlling
interest shall be considered a termination of the old business and the
establishment of a new business requiring a new business license, based on old
business income.

   (A)   For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, the
License Official or other authorized agent of the municipality is empowered to
enter upon the premises of any person subject to this chapter to make
inspections, examine and audit books and records. It shall be unlawful for any
such person to fail or refuse to make available the necessary books and
records. In the event an audit or inspection reveals that the licensee has
filed false information, the costs of the audit shall be added to the correct
license tax and late penalties in addition to other penalties provided herein.
Each day of failure to pay the proper amount of license tax shall constitute a
separate offense.
   (B)   The License Official shall have the authority to make inspections and
conduct audits of businesses within the municipality to ensure compliance with
the chapter. Financial information obtained by inspections and audits shall not
be deemed public records, and the License Official shall not release the amount
of license taxes paid or the reported gross income of any person by name
without written permission of the licensee, except as authorized by this
chapter, state or federal law, or proper judicial order. Statistics compiled by
classifications are public records.

§ 110.11 ASSESSMENTS, PAYMENT UNDER PROTEST, APPEAL.
   (A)   Findings. The Council hereby makes the following findings of fact in
connection with the adoption of this section:
      (1)   The city is a municipal corporation of the State of South Carolina
(the "state"), located in Kershaw County, South Carolina and possesses all
general powers granted by the Constitution and statutes of the state to
municipal corporations.
      (2)   In September 2020, the South Carolina General Assembly adopted the
“South Carolina Business License Tax Standardization Act,” now codified at S.C.
§ 6-1-400 to 6-1-420, as amended (the “Act”) which taxing jurisdictions must
comply with when assessing business license taxes.
      (3)   The Act establishes various requirements including those related to
the assessment and appeals process for taxpayers.
      (4)   In order to effectively comply with the Act and administer the
city's business license program, the city has determined that it is appropriate
to adopt an assessment and appeals policy (the “policy”) that sets forth
specific procedures for the assessment of delinquent taxes, the conduct of
informal conferences, hearings, and the appeals process, and further includes
details regarding the presentation of testimony and evidence.
   (B)   Assessment and appeals policy. The Council hereby approves the policy
which is attached to Res. 2025-010 as Exhibit A. The policy shall take effect
as of the passage of this section and shall be utilized by the city in the
administration of its business license program.
   (C)   Modification. Any modification to the policy shall be undertaken by
and through subsequent amendatory actions of the Council.

§ 110.12 DELINQUENT LICENSE TAXES, PARTIAL PAYMENT.

tax, the License Official shall impose and collect a late penalty of 5% of the
unpaid tax for each month or portion thereof after the due date until paid.
Penalties shall not be waived. If any business license tax remains unpaid for
60 days after its due date, the License Official shall report it to the City
Manager and/or his designee for appropriate legal action.
   (B)   Partial payment may be accepted by the License Official to toll
imposition of penalties on the portion paid; provided, however, no business
license shall be issued or renewed until the full amount of the tax due, with
penalties, has been paid.

that business license taxes are due. If notices are not mailed, there shall be

the municipality three times prior to the due date in each year. Failure to
receive notice shall not constitute a defense to prosecution for failure to pay
the tax due or grounds for waiver of penalties.

   NON-RESIDENT RATES
   Unless otherwise specifically provided, all taxes and rates shall be doubled
for nonresidents and itinerants having no fixed principal place of business

   CLASS 8 RATES
Each NAICS number designates a separate subclassification. The businesses in
this section are treated as separate and individual subclasses due to
provisions of state law, regulatory requirements, service burdens, tax
equalization considerations, and other factors that are deemed sufficient to
require individually determined rates. In accordance with state law, the
municipality also may provide for reasonable subclassifications for rates,
described by an NAICS sector, subsector, or industry, that are based on
particularized considerations as needed for economic stimulus or for the
enhanced or disproportionate demands on municipal services or infrastructure.
Non-resident rates do not apply except where indicated.
8.1 - NAICS 230000 - Construction, All Types [Non-resident rates apply]
Resident rates, for contractors having permanent place of business within the
municipality:
      Minimum on first $2,000.00    $35.00 PLUS
      Each additional $1,000.00    $1.20
Non-resident rates apply to contractors that do not have a permanent place of
business within the municipality. A trailer at the construction site or
structure in which the contractor temporarily resides is not a permanent place
of business under this chapter.
No contractor shall be issued a business license until all state and municipal
qualification examination and trade license requirements have been met. Each
contractor shall post a sign in plain view on each job identifying the
contractor with the job.
Sub-contractors shall be licensed on the same basis as general or prime
contractors for the same job. No deductions shall be made by a general or prime
contractor for value of work performed by a sub-contractor.
No contractor shall be issued a business license until all performance and
indemnity bonds required by the Building Code have been filed and approved.
Zoning permits must be obtained when required by the municipality's Zoning
Ordinance.
Each prime contractor shall file with the License Official a list of sub-
contractors furnishing labor or materials for each project.
For licenses issued on a per-job basis, the total tax for the full amount of
the contract shall be paid prior to commencement of work and shall entitle the
contractor to complete the job without regard to the normal license expiration
date. An amended report shall be filed for each new job and the appropriate
additional license fee per $1,000 of the contract amount shall be paid prior to
commencement of new work. Only one base tax shall be paid in a license year.
Licensees holding a per-job license shall file, by each April 30 during the
continuation of the construction project, a statement of compliance, including
but not limited to a revised estimate of the value of the contract.
If any revised estimate of the final value of such project exceeds the amount
for which the business license was issued, the licensee shall be required to
pay a license fee at the then-prevailing rate on the excess amount.

applicable to retail telecommunications services are set forth in the
Telecommunications Collections Ordinance.
8.4 - NAICS 5241 - Insurance Brokers for Non-Admitted Insurance Carriers
Independent agents, brokers, and their employees are subject to a business
license tax based on their natural class. With respect to insurers subject to
license fees and taxes under S.C. Title 38, Chapter 7 and to brokers under S.C.
Title 38, Chapter 45, the municipality participates in a collections program
administered by the Municipal Association of South Carolina. The municipality
has approved participation in the collections program by separate ordinance
(the "Insurers and Brokers Collections Ordinance"). The rates, terms,
conditions, dates, penalties, appeals process, and other details of the

the city by the FCC, the city shall immediately notify all cable operators in
the city, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that the city intends to
regulate subscriber rates charged for the basic service tier and associated

cable operator's rates for the basic service tier and associated equipment are
within the FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable
benchmark, the City Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rates within 30 days from the date the cable
operator filed its basic cable rates with the city.
      (2)   If the City Council takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its basic rates with the city, the proposed rates will
continue in effect.
   (D)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the City Council is unable to determine whether the rates in
issue are within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the City
Council shall, within 30 days from the date the cable operator filed its basic
cable rates with the city and by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the
following additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final
determination:
         (a)   Ninety days if the City Council needs more time to ensure that a
rate is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard; or
         (b)   One hundred and fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate above the applicable
benchmark.
      (2)   If the City Council has not made a decision within the 90 or 150
day period, the City Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of
the period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all
amounts received by reason of the proposed rate and on whose behalf the amounts
are paid.
   (E)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the proposed rate, the City Council shall hold at least one public
hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (F)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed initial basic rate may submit the objection in writing anytime
before the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made
part the record, the objector must provide the City Clerk with the objector's
name and address.
   (G)   Benchmark analysis. If a cable operator submits its current basic
cable rate schedule as being in compliance with the FCC's reasonable rate
standard, the City Council shall review the rates using the benchmark analysis
in accordance with the standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the City
Council's findings, the initial basic cable rates shall be established as
follows:
      (1)   If the current basic cable rates are below the benchmark, those
rates shall become the initial basic cable rates and the cable operator's rates
will be capped at that level.
      (2)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, the rates
shall be the greater of the cable operator's per channel rate on September 30,
1992, reduced by 10%, or the applicable benchmark, adjusted for inflation and
any change in the number occurring between September 30, 1992 and the initial
date of regulation.
      (3)   If the current basic cable rates exceed the benchmark, but the
cable operator's per channel rate was below the benchmark on September 30,
1992, the initial basic cable rate shall be the benchmark, adjusted for
inflation.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator does not wish to reduce
the rates to the permitted level, the cable operator shall have the opportunity
to submit a cost-of-service showing in an attempt to justify an initial basic
cable rate above the FCC's reasonable rate standard. The City Council will
review a cost-of-service submission pursuant to FCC standards for cost-of-
service review. The City Council may approve initial basic cable rates above
the benchmark if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a
cost-of-service determination resulting in rates below the benchmark or below
the cable operator's September 30, 1992 rates minus 10%, will prescribe the
cable operator's new rates.
   (I)   Decision.
      (1)   By formal resolution. After completion of its review of the cable
operator's proposed rates, the City Council shall adopt its decision by formal
resolution. The decision shall include one of the following:
         (a)   If the proposal is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard or
is justified by a cost-of-service analysis, the City Council shall approve the
initial basic cable rates proposed by the cable operator; or
         (b)   If the proposal is not within the FCC's reasonable rate standard
and the cost-of-service analysis, if any, does not justify the proposed rates,
the City Council shall establish initial basic cable rates that are within the
FCC's reasonable rate standard or that are justified by a cost-of-service
analysis.
      (2)   Rollbacks and refunds. If the City Council determines that the
initial basic cable rates submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that
the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justifies lower rates, the City
Council may order the rates reduced in accordance with division (G) or (H)
above, as applicable. In addition, the City Council may order the cable
operator to pay to subscribers, refunds of the excessive portion of the rates
with interest (computed at applicable rates published by the Internal Revenue
Service for tax refunds and additional tax payments), retroactive to September
1, 1993. The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the City Council's decision
resolution.
      (3)   Statement of reasons for decision and public notice. If rates
proposed by a cable operator are disapproved in whole or in part, or if there
were objections made by other parties to the proposed rates, the resolutions
must state the reasons for the decision and the City Council must give the
public notice of its decision. Public notice will be given by advertisement
once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.

   (A)   Notice. A cable operator in the city who wishes to increase the rates
for the basic service tier or associated equipment shall file a request with
the city and notify all subscribers at least 30 days before the cable operator
desires the increase to take effect. This notice may not be given more often
than annually and not until at least one year after the determination of the
initial basic cable rates.
   (B)   Expedited determination and public hearing.
      (1)   If the City Council is able to expeditiously determine that the
cable operator's rate increase request for basic cable service is within the
FCC's reasonable rate standard, as determined by the applicable price cap, the
City Council shall:
         (a)   Hold a public hearing at which interested persons may express
their views; and
         (b)   Act to approve the rate increase within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go
into effect.
      (2)   If the City Council takes no action within 30 days from the date
the cable operator filed its request with the city, the proposed rates will go
into effect.
   (C)   Extended review period.
      (1)   If the city council is unable to determine whether the rate
increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard based on the material
before it, or if the cable operator submits a cost-of-service showing, the City
Council shall, by adoption of a formal resolution, invoke the following
additional periods of time, as applicable, to make a final determination:
         (a)   Ninety days if the City Council needs more time to ensure that
the requested increase is within the FCC's reasonable rate standard as
determined by the applicable price cap; and
         (b)   One hundred and fifty days if the cable operator has submitted a
cost-of-service showing seeking to justify a rate increase above the applicable
price cap.
      (2)   The proposed rate increase is tolled during the extended review
period.
      (3)   If the City Council has not made a decision within 90 or 150 day
period, the City Council shall issue a brief written order at the end of the
period requesting the cable operator to keep accurate account of all amounts
received by reason of the proposed rate increase and on whose behalf the
amounts are paid.
   (D)   Public hearing. During the extended review period and before taking
action on the requested rate increase, the City Council shall hold at least one
public hearing at which interested persons may express their views and record
objections.
   (E)   Objections. An interested person who wishes to make an objection to
the proposed rate increase may submit the objection in writing anytime before
the decision resolution is adopted. In order for an objection to be made part
of the record, the objector must provide the City Clerk with the objector's
name and address.
   (F)   Delayed determination. If the City Council is unable to make a final
determination concerning a requested rate increase within the extended time
period, the cable operator may put the increase into effect, subject to
subsequent refund if the City Council later issues a decision disapproving any
portion of the increase.
   (G)   Price cap analysis. If a cable operator presents its request for a
rate increase as being in compliance with the FCC's price cap, the City Council
shall review the rate using the price cap analysis in accordance with the
standard form authorized by the FCC. Based on the City Council's findings, the
basic cable rates shall be established as follows:
      (1)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase is within the price cap
established by the FCC, the proposed rates shall become the new basic cable
rates.
      (2)   If the proposed basic cable rate increase exceeds the price cap
established by the FCC, the City Council shall disapprove the proposed rate
increase and order an increase that is in compliance with the price cap.
   (H)   Cost-of-service showings. If a cable operator submits a cost-of-
service showing in an attempt to justify a rate increase above the price cap,
the City Council will review the submission pursuant to the FCC standards for
cost-of-service review. The City Council may approve a rate increase above the
price cap if the cable operator makes the necessary showing; however, a cost-
of-service determination resulting in a rate below the price cap or below the
cable operator's then current rate will prescribe the cable operator's new
rate.
   (I)   Decision. The City Council's decision concerning the requested rate
increase, shall be adopted by formal resolution. If a rate increase proposed by
a cable operator is disapproved in whole or in part, or if objections were made
by other parties to the proposed rate increase, the resolution must state the
reasons for the decision. Objections may be made at the public hearing by a
person in writing at anytime before the decision resolution is adopted.
   (I)   Refunds.
      (1)   The City Council may order refunds of subscribers' rate payments
with interest if:
         (a)   The City Council was unable to make a decision within the
extended time period as described in division (C) above; and
         (b)   The cable operator implemented the rate increase at the end of
the extended review period; and
         (c)   The City Council determines that the rate increase as submitted
exceeds the applicable price cap or that the cable operator failed to justify
the rate increase by a cost-of-service showing, and the City Council
disapproves any portion of the rate increase.
      (2)   The method for paying any refund and the interest rate will be in
accordance with FCC regulations as directed in the City Council's decision
resolution.
   (K)   Appeal. The City Council's decision concerning rates for the basic

§ 120.04 CABLE OPERATOR INFORMATION.
   (A)   City may require.
      (1)   In those cases when the cable operator has submitted initial rates
or proposed an increase that exceeds the reasonable rate standard, the City
Council may require the cable operator to produce information in addition to
that submitted, including proprietary information, if needed to make a rate
determination. In these cases, a cable operator may request the information be
kept confidential in accordance with this section.
      (2)   In cases where initial or proposed rates comply with the reasonable
rate standard, the City Council may request additional information only in
order to document that the cable operator's rates are in accord with the
standard.
   (B)   Request for confidentiality.
      (1)   A cable operator submitting information to the City Council may
request in writing that the information not be made routinely available for
public inspection. A copy of the request shall be attached to and cover all of
the information and all copies of the information to which it applies.
      (2)   If feasible, the information to which the request applies shall be
physically separated from any information to which the request does not apply.
If this is not feasible, the portion of the information to which the request
applies shall be identified.
      (3)   Each request shall contain a statement of the reasons for
withholding inspection and a statement of the facts upon which those reasons
are based.
      (4)   Casual requests which do not comply with the requirements of this
division (B), shall not be considered.
   (C)   City Council action. Requests which comply with the requirement of
division (B), will be acted upon by the City Council. The City Council will
grant the request if the cable operator presents by a preponderance of the
evidence, a case for nondisclosure consistent with applicable federal
regulations. If the request is granted, the ruling will be placed in a public
file in lieu of the information withheld from the public inspection. If the
request does not present a case for nondisclosure and the City Council denies
the request, the City Council shall take one of the following actions:
      (1)   If the information has been submitted voluntarily without any
direction from the city, the cable operator may request that the city return
the information without considering it. Ordinarily, the city will comply with
this request. Only in the unusual instance that the public interest so
requires, will the information be made available for public inspection.
      (2)   If the information was required to be submitted by the City
Council, the information will be made available for public inspection.
   (D)   Appeal. If the city denies the request for confidentiality, the cable
operator may seek review of that decision from the FCC within five working days
of the City Council's decision, and the release of the information will be
stayed pending review.
(Ord., passed 11-9-93)
§ 120.05 AUTOMATIC RATE ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Annual inflation adjustment. In accordance with FCC regulations, the
cable operator may adjust its capped base per channel rate for the basic
service tier annually by the final GNP-PI index.
   (B)   Other external costs.
      (1)   The FCC regulations also allow the cable operator to increase its
rate for the basic service tier automatically to reflect certain external cost
factors to the extent that the increase in cost of those factors exceed the
GNP-PI. The factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs,
state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service,
and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a
franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without
regard to its relation to the GNP-PI.
      (2)   For all categories of external costs other than retransmission
consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external
costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the
date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February
28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be
adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees
incurred before October 6, 1994.
   (C)   Notification and review. The cable operator shall notify the city at
least 30 days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment
items. The city shall review the increase to determine whether the item or
items qualify as automatic adjustments. If the city makes no objection within
30 days of receiving notice of the increase, the increase may go into effect.
(Ord., passed 11-9-93)
§ 120.06 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   Refunds. The city may order the cable operator to refund to
subscribers a portion of previously paid rates under the following
circumstances:
      (1)   A portion of the previously paid rates have been determined to be
in excess of the permitted tier charge or above the actual cost of equipment;
or
      (2)   The cable operator has failed to comply with a valid rate order
issued by the city.
   (B)   Fines. If the cable operator fails to comply with a rate decision or
refund order, the cable operator shall be subject to a fine of $500 for each
day the cable operator fails to comply.

term in used in the Bailey Bill, for the purposes of the Bailey Bill Program.
The jurisdiction of the Commission, as provided for in §
158.060 of the city's Code of Ordinances, is hereby expanded, but only for the
purposes of the duties prescribed to the Commission pursuant to the Bailey Bill
Program, to include jurisdiction over the following:
   (A)   All properties within the city that have been designated as historic
properties by the City Council;
   (B)   All properties within the city that have been listed on the National
Register of Historic Places; and
   (C)   All properties within the city located within an area that has been
listed on the National Register of Historic Places as a historic district.
(Ord. 2015-017, passed 8-25-15)
§ 123.09 APPROVAL PROCESS.
   (A)   Application. In order to be eligible to receive the Special
Assessment, a Historic Property proposing a Historic Rehabilitation must
receive Preliminary Certification by the City Council using the application and
review process provided for in this section. Any owner of a Historic Property
may apply to the city for Preliminary Certification of a proposed Historic
Rehabilitation by submitting an Application for Preliminary Certification (an
"Application") to the Planning Department of the city. In order to receive
consideration, all Applications must be complete and must include the following
fees and other information:
      (1)   A completed Application;
      (2)   An application fee (such amount to be determined in the city's
annual budget process);
      (3)   A plan detailing the proposed Historic Rehabilitation detailing the
scope of work that is to be performed and demonstrating compliance with the
Rehabilitation Standards;
      (4)   Sufficient evidence of the current fair market value of the
Historic Property; and
      (5)   The total amount that the owner anticipates will be expended on the
Historic Rehabilitation.
   (B)   Commission review. The Commission shall review all Applications at its
next regular meeting, provided they have been filed, completed in form and
content, at least seven calendar days before the regularly scheduled meeting of
the Commission; otherwise consideration shall be deferred until the following
meeting. Any applicant may be present at any such meeting to offer further
explanation regarding the proposed Historic Rehabilitation and answer any
questions of the Commission. The Commission shall affirm that the Minimum
Expenditure is expected to be met and that the property meets the standard for
a Historic Property. The Commission shall review each Application and proposed
Historic Rehabilitation to ensure that the proposed scope of work complies with
the Rehabilitation Standards. In the event that all criteria are met, the
Commission may recommend to the City Council that the Historic Rehabilitation
be approved. In the event that the Commission declines to recommend approval to
the City Council, the Commission shall provide the applicant with specific
reasons for its denial and the applicant may re-apply under the terms of this
section.
   (C)   Certificate of appropriateness. In no instance shall a recommendation
to City Council for the approval of a Historic Rehabilitation be construed as a
grant of a certificate of appropriateness by the Commission as required by §§
158.095  et seq. of the City's Code of Ordinances; however, applicants are
encouraged to submit applications for Preliminary Certification and
applications for a Certificate of Appropriateness for any Historic
Rehabilitation at the same time and the Commission is hereby authorized to
defer the consideration of either application for no more than one regularly
scheduled meeting in order to permit both applications to be considered in
conjunction.
   (D)   City Council preliminary certification. Upon an application receiving
a recommendation of approval by the Commission, the Application shall be
considered at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the City Council,
provided that sufficient time remains to include such an Application on the
upcoming meeting agenda. City Council may, by ordinance, approve the
Application and proposed Historic Rehabilitation and, in such event, shall make
specific findings of the following facts regarding the following:
      (1)   The property is a Historic Property as designated herein;
      (2)   The Minimum Expenditures are expected to be met; and
      (3)   The fair market value of the Historic Property that is to be used
to calculate the Special Assessment.
   (E)   Substantive changes. If at any time during the application process or
after Preliminary Certification is granted, the scope of work considered or
approved thereunder is substantively changed in any way, the applicant must
promptly notify the city's Planning Department who shall make a determination
as to whether such a change required the prior approval of the City Council. In
the event that such approval is necessary, such a change may be brought
directly before the City Council at its next available regularly scheduled
meeting for consideration. Unapproved substantive changes are conducted at the
risk of the property owner and may disqualify the property from eligibility for
the Special Assessment.
   (F)   Assessment for two years during work. Once a proposed Historic
Rehabilitation has received Preliminary Certification, the Historic Property
shall receive the Special Assessment for an initial period of two years during
which the proposed Historic Rehabilitation is undertaken. Any such period shall
apply towards the total Assessment Term in § 123.04(B) herein. In the event
that, after the expiration of two years, the Historic Rehabilitation is not
complete but the Minimum Expenditure has been met, the Special Assessment shall
continue for such time as it is necessary to complete the Historic
Rehabilitation. In the event that after the expiration of two years, the
Minimum Expenditures have not been met, the City Council may, at its
discretion, disqualify the property from eligibility for the Special Assessment
and any monies not collected by the city due to the Special Assessment must be
returned to the city and other affected taxing districts.
(Ord. 2015-017, passed 8-25-15)
§ 123.10 REHABILITATION MONITORING; FINAL CERTIFICATION.
   (A)   Monitoring. During the period of time during which the Historic
Rehabilitation is underway, staff of the city's Planning Department may inspect
the work in progress to ensure that the Historic Standards are met. Inspections
of any exterior work may be made at any time and inspections of any interior
work may be made upon 24 hours notice. The refusal of an applicant to permit
inspection shall serve as grounds for the disqualification of the property from
eligibility for the Special Assessment. In the event that such an inspection
shows substantive deviations from the approved scope of work or a failure to
comply with the Historic Standards, the City Council may disqualify the
property from eligibility for the Special Assessment.
   (B)   Final certification. Upon completion of the Historic Rehabilitation,
the applicant must notify the Planning Department and request that the property
be granted Final Certification. The Planning Department staff shall inspect the
Historic Property to ensure compliance with the approved scope of work and the
Historic Standards. If compliance is found, the Planning Department staff shall
grant Final Certification and shall provide the property owner with sufficient
documentation of such Final Certification.
(Ord. 2015-017, passed 8-25-15)
§ 123.11 NOTIFICATION OF THE KERSHAW COUNTY TAX ASSESSOR.
   Upon receipt of Final Certification, it shall be the responsibility of the
property owner to provide such Final Certification to the Kershaw County
Assessor in order to secure the Special Assessment.
(Ord. 2015-017, passed 8-25-15)
§ 123.12 ADDITIONAL WORK; DECERTIFICATION.
   (A)   For the remainder of the Assessment Period, the property owner shall
notify the Planning Department staff of any additional exterior work undertaken
on the Historic Property, other than ordinary maintenance. The Planning
Department staff will present the proposed work to the Commission at its next
regularly scheduled meeting who will review the work and determine whether the
overall project is consistent with the standards for rehabilitation. If the
additional work is found to be inconsistent, the property owner shall withdraw
his request and cancel or revise the proposed additional work.
   (B)   Once the Historic Property has received Final Certification, it shall
remain so certified and must be granted the Special Assessment until the
property becomes disqualified by any one of the following:
      (1)   The expiration of the Assessment Term;
      (2)   Written notice from the property owner to the Planning Department
staff and the Kershaw County Auditor requesting removal of the Special
Assessment;
      (3)   Removal of the historic designation by the City Council; or
      (4)   Rescission of the approval of the Historic Rehabilitation by the
Commission because of alterations or renovation by the owner or the owner's
estate which causes the property to no longer possess the qualities and
features which made it eligible for Final Certification.
   (C)   Notification of any change affecting eligibility must be given
immediately to the Kershaw County Assessor, Auditor, and Treasurer.

(Ord. 2015-024, passed 12-8-15)
§ 124.04 AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   Authorization to grant incentives. The Council, at its discretion and
on a case-by-case basis, but subject to the general eligibility criteria
provided for in §
124.06 (A) herein, may enter into an incentive agreement (as defined herein)
with a person, firm or corporation providing for incentives in order to
encourage and support the development of real property within the incentive
area.
   (B)   Incentive agreements. The incentives shall only be provided to an
incentive recipient after an agreement has been entered into between the city
and such person, firm or corporation, which agreement shall set forth: the
particulars of the development; the incentives to be provided; and sufficient
assurances that the benefits will accrue to the city and the goals will be met
by the development (an “incentive agreement”). Pending the approval by the
Council of any incentive agreement and subject to the provisions of §
124.07  herein, the city. Manager of the city (or any person so delegated by
the City Manager) is authorized to discuss the provisions of this economic
development incentive program, aid in the completion of any proposal (as
defined herein) and, subject to the final approval by the Council, negotiate
with the potential incentive recipient on behalf of the city. Each incentive
agreement shall be approved by Council by ordinance. Council is authorized to
provide incentives in any amounts and for any period of time within the
thresholds provided for herein or within the time periods and thresholds
provided for in any applicable statutory authorization.
(Ord. 2015-024, passed 12-8-15)
§ 124.05 AUTHORIZED INCENTIVES.
   (A)   Multiple incentives. The Council may provide to an incentive recipient
any combination of incentives provided for herein; provided, however, that the
total amount of incentives given to a development must be in keeping with the
goals and the value of the benefits accruing to the city (and its citizens)
must be greater than the financial value of the incentives to an incentive
recipient.
   (B)   Incentives of the city. All direct incentives of the city shall be
granted in the form of reimbursements and refunds of fees and taxes that have
been duly paid to the city. No upfront abatements of fees or taxes shall be
permitted. Where incentives continue for a period of more than one year, such
incentives may be graduated to increase or decrease year-to-year as the Council
sees fit, but subject to monitoring by the city to ensure compliance with the
terms of any incentive agreement. The Council may, at its discretion and on a
case-by-case basis, enter into an incentive agreement to reimburse or refund

1-730, and which have been approved by Council and included in the incentive
agreement;
      (5)   Up to 50% of the local accommodations taxes collected by the city
for as many as five years, but funds received through such incentive are to be
spent only for purposes that are related to tourism, pursuant to S.C. Code § 6-
1-530, and which have been approved by Council and included in the incentive
agreement; and
      (6)   Such other incentives that the Council, at its discretion and on a
case-by-case basis, determines are appropriate given the amount or type of
investment made by the incentive recipient in the incentive area.
   (C)   State incentive programs. The state programs that may be considered by
Council to be included within any package of incentives or as a stand-alone set
of incentives for in-city projects located outside of the incentive area,
include the following:
      (1)   Property tax credits authorized by the provisions of the South
Carolina abandoned buildings revitalization act, codified at S.C. Code §§ 12-
67-100 et seq. (collectively, the "Abandoned Building Act"). Incentive
recipients requesting consideration of the Abandoned Building Act by the
Council shall submit an Abandoned Building Act application form, a copy of
which is attached to Ord. 2015-024 as Exhibit A.

sprinkler system, codified at S.C. Code § 12-6-3622.
      (5)   Any other incentive authorized by the state and applicable to its
municipalities.
(Ord. 2015-024, passed 12-8-15)
§ 124.06 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.
   (A)   General eligibility criteria. Except for those incentives discussed in
§
124.05 (C) above as authorized by the state and which are intended by the terms
of this economic development incentive program to be applied city-wide, in
order for a development to be eligible to receive incentives, the Council must
determine that the development meets, or upon completion will meet the
following criteria:
      (1)   Respecting a development located or to be located in the incentive
area:
         (a)   The development is consistent with the 2007-2017 City of Camden
comprehensive plan, as may be amended (the “comprehensive plan”) as well as the
goals.
         (b)   Absent the provision of incentives, the development would be
unlikely to occur or unlikely to occur at the level or scale contemplated by
the developer.
         (c)   The development must be located within the incentive area, as
defined in §
124.03.
         (d)   1.   The development must have a minimum threshold investment of
$1,000,000 (the “minimum investment”). The minimum investment may be comprised
of any combination of:
               A.   Real property acquisition costs;
               B.   The costs of physical improvements to real property; or
               C.   The costs of capital improvements to city infrastructure.
            2.   The minimum investment may be calculated based upon investment
in a single property or the cumulative investment in multiple properties, each
within the incentive area. Where multiple users or businesses are to be located
within a single development as separate businesses, the Council may, at its
discretion and on a case-by-case basis, allocate appropriate portions of the
total investment in the development to such separate business in order to allow
such business to meet the minimum investment eligibility requirement. In order
to meet the threshold for the minimum investment, a development may be given a
credit towards the minimum investment of $25,000 for each job that will be
created by the development.
         (e)   The intended use of the development must be for one or more of
the following business purposes:
            1.   Retail uses;
            2.   Tourism-related business or activities;
            3.   Cultural arts activities and associated businesses;
            4.   Corporate headquarters;
            5.   Research and development;
            6.   High technology growth businesses; and
            7.   Other uses, as may be determined by the Council, that are
consistent with the goals and the comprehensive plan.
      (2)   Respecting a development located or to be located the super
incentive area:
         (a)   The development is consistent with the comprehensive plan as
well as the goals.
         (b)   Absent the provision of incentives, the development would be
unlikely to occur or unlikely to occur at the level or scale contemplated by
the developer.
         (c)   The development must be located within the super incentive area,
as defined in §
124.03.
         (d)   1.   The development must have a minimum threshold investment of
$250,000 (the "super incentive minimum investment”). The super incentive
minimum investment may be comprised of any combination of:
               A.   Real property acquisition costs;
               B.   The costs of physical improvements to real property; or
               C.   The costs of capital improvements to city infrastructure.
The super incentive minimum investment may be calculated based upon investment
in a single property or the cumulative investment in multiple properties, each
within the super incentive area. Where multiple users or businesses are to be
located within a single development as separate businesses, the Council may, at
its discretion and on a case-by-case basis, allocate appropriate portions of
the total investment in the development to such separate business in order to
allow such business to meet the super incentive minimum investment eligibility
requirement. In order to meet the threshold for the super incentive minimum
investment, a development may be given a credit towards the super incentive
minimum investment of $25,000 for each job that will be created by the
development.
         (e)   The intended use of the development must be for one or more of
the following business purposes:
            1.   Retail uses;
            2.   Tourism-related business or activities;
            3.   Cultural arts activities and associated businesses;
            4.   Corporate headquarters;
            5.   Research and development;
            6.   High technology growth businesses; and
            7.   Other uses, as may be determined by the Council, that are
consistent with the goals and the comprehensive plan.
   (B)   Specific criteria. The Council may, at its discretion and on a case-
by-case basis, include within an incentive agreement any other eligibility
criteria that must be met upon completion of a development in order to ensure
that the goals are met and that the development provides benefits to the city
(and its citizens) in amounts that warrant the implementation of incentives.
(Ord. 2015-024, passed 12-8-15)
§ 124.07 ADMINISTRATION AND TERMS OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   Application for incentives. Except where an applicant seeks only
incentives authorized by the state incentive programs listed in §
124.05 (C), in order to be eligible for incentives, a person, firm or
corporation must submit to the City Manager a proposed set of incentives for a
development (a “proposal”). A form of the proposal is attached to Ord. 2015-024
as Exhibit D. The proposal must include a sufficient description of the
development, to include, without limitation, the following information:
      (1)   Identification of the property or properties on which the
development is to be located (the "subject property") and any acquisition costs
thereof;
      (2)   The estimated start date and completion date for any work to be
performed on the subject property;
      (3)   A list of any physical improvements that are to be made to the
subject property as part of the development, including a good-faith estimate of
the costs thereof;
      (4)   The then-current value of the subject property and a good-faith
estimate of the value of the subject property upon completion of the
improvements thereto;
      (5)   A good-faith estimate of the number of jobs that the development is
projected to create, including an estimate of the date upon which the estimated
number of jobs will have been created;
      (6)   A statement affirming that, based upon any acquisition costs for
the subject property, along with good-faith estimates for the costs of physical
improvements and the number of jobs created, the development will meet or
exceed the minimum investment requirements or super incentive minimum
investment requirements, as applicable;
      (7)   A good-faith estimate of other revenue for the city that will be
created as a direct result of the development, including anticipated business
license fees, additional property tax revenue, capital improvements to city-
owned infrastructure and utilities revenue; and
      (8)   Any other additional information that the incentive recipient or
the City Manager deems may be necessary and helpful for the Council to evaluate
and give due consideration to the Proposal.
   (B)   Determination of incentive amounts. The amount of incentives granted
to a development shall be based upon the amount of the capital investment in
the development, the amount of new revenue for the city directly created by the
development, the location of the development (incentive area versus super
incentive area) and the number of new jobs that will be directly created by the
development. The amount of incentives granted to a development shall in no case
exceed the value of the direct and indirect benefits of the development to the
city. These amounts shall be expressly, included within any incentive
agreement.
   (C)   Certification. Commencement and continuation of incentives.
      (1)   No incentive shall commence or be given until such time as:
         (a)   The development has been issued:
            1.   A certificate of occupancy; and/or
            2.   A business license;
         (b)   The city determines it will derive positive benefits from the
development; and
         (c)   A certificate that all terms and benchmarks included within the
applicable incentive agreement, including without limitation benchmarks for
capital investment, property valuation, and job creation (the "benchmarks"),
have been fully achieved or otherwise completed.
      (2)   Where benchmarks, such as the number of jobs created, are to be met
continuously over a period of time, the incentive recipient shall provide to
the city, on an annual basis, sufficient proof that the development has
continuously achieved or otherwise complied with such benchmarks.
      (3)   If, at any time after completion of a development or at any time
within the period of time during which a development is granted incentives, a
development fails to achieve or otherwise comply with a benchmark, the Council
may, at its discretion and on a case-by-case basis:
         (a)   Declare the incentive agreement null and void and refuse to
grant any future incentives; or
         (b)   Decrease the amount of incentives based upon the actual direct
and indirect benefits of the development to the city and its citizens.
(Ord. 2015-024, passed 12-8-15)
§ 124.08 ADMINISTRATION OF INCENTIVES AND INCENTIVE AGREEMENTS.
   The administration of the application process, specifically including the
drafting of any proposal, and continuous monitoring of developments pursuant to
applicable incentive agreements shall be the responsibility of the City Manager
and any person designated to oversee such process by the City Manager.

a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under circumstances that warrant
alarm for the safety of persons or property in the vicinity. Among the
circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such alarm is
warranted is the fact the actor takes flight upon appearance of a police
officer, refuses to identify himself or herself or manifestly endeavors to
conceal himself or herself or any object. Unless flight by the actor or other
circumstances make it impracticable, a police officer, prior to any arrest for
an offense under this division, shall afford the actor an opportunity to dispel
any alarm which would otherwise be warranted, by requesting him or her to
identify himself or herself and explain his or her presence and conduct. No
person shall be convicted of violating this division if the police officer did

linger or to idle in or about any said school, park or public place without a
lawful purpose for being present.
   (E)   Buildings. No person shall loiter or lodge in any building, structure,
or place, whether public or private, without the permission of the owner or
person entitled to possession or in control thereof.
   (F)   Restaurants, taverns. No person shall loiter in or about a restaurant,
tavern or other building open to the public. As used in this division, “LOITER”

or to remain upon the property immediately adjacent thereto after being asked
to leave by the owner or person entitled to possession or in control thereof.
   (G)   Parking lots. No person shall loiter in or upon any public parking
surface lot or public parking structure, either on foot or in or upon any
conveyance being driven or parked thereon, without the permission of the owner
or the person entitled to possession or in control thereof.
   (H)   Private or residential property. No person shall loiter in or on
private or public residential property in residential neighborhoods. As used in
this division, “LOITER” means to, without just cause, linger, remain in or on
private or public residential property, or to remain upon the property
immediately adjacent thereto after being asked to leave by the owner or the
person entitled to possession or in control thereof, or where “No Loitering”
signs are posted.

his or her name and address either verbally or by providing the officer with
written evidence of the person’s name and address, including but not limited to
a driver’s license or picture.
   (J)   Penalty; continuing violations. Any person who is convicted of any
violation of this section, the court before whom an offender shall be tried may
sentence him or her to pay a fine not exceeding the maximum fine permitted by
law or serve a term not exceeding 30 days in jail, or both. Each day any
violation of this section occurs shall constitute a separate offense.
   (K)   Court order on jurisdictional limits. In addition to the penalty that
may be imposed pursuant to division (J) above, any person who is arrested for
and/or convicted of violating any provision of this section may be subject to
an order of the court which shall impose a jurisdictional limit on said person
prohibiting his or her presence in a specific geographic area of the City of
Camden. Failure to comply with the court order shall constitute a violation of
the court order and shall result in the following:
      (1)   In the case of a bond where jurisdictional limits have been
imposed, the bond may be revoked and the person shall be incarcerated until
trial; and/or
      (2)   In the case of a sentence where jurisdictional limits have been
imposed, the suspended sentence may be revoked and the person shall be
incarcerated until he or she has served the original sentence imposed by the

alarm, the assessed fee may be waived; provided that only one fee will be
waived for any alarm user in any 365 day period.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code Title 5 and
Title 6, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local
governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council does
ordain this chapter.
(Ord., passed 10-25-83; Am. Ord. 2018-012, passed 8-28-18)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards, disruption
of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for
flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in flood plains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord., passed 10-25-83)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges
located in flood plains;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use
and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future
flood blight areas; and
      (7)   To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a flood area.
   (B)   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health,
safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to
flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
flood waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord., passed 10-25-83)
§ 152.04 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   “ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE).” Structures that are located
on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which
is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures
should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation,
and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory
structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay
sheds.
   “ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING BUILDING).” An extension or increase in the floor
area or height of a building or structure. Additions to existing buildings
shall comply with the requirements for new construction regardless as to
whether the addition is a substantial improvement or not. Where a firewall or
load-bearing wall is provided between the addition and the existing building,
the addition(s) shall be considered a separate building and must comply with
the standards for new construction.
   “AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURE.” A structure used solely for agricultural purposes
in which the use is exclusively in connection with the production, harvesting,
storage, drying, or raising of agricultural commodities, including the raising
of livestock. Agricultural structures are not exempt from the provisions of
this chapter.

of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
   “AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING.” A designated AO or VO Zone on a community’s
flood insurance rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident.
   “AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.” The land in the flood plain within a
community subject to a l% or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
   “BASE FLOOD.” The flood having a l% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.
   “BASEMENT.” That portion of a building between floor and ceiling which may
be partly below and partly above grade.
   “BUILDING.” Any structure built for support, shelter, or enclosure for any
occupancy or storage.
   “CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT.” Development that is critical to the community’s
public health and safety, is essential to the orderly functioning of a
community, store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials,
or house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or
injury. Examples of “CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT” include jails, hospitals, schools,
fire stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, water plants,
and gas/oil/ propane storage facilities.
   “DEVELOPMENT.” Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of
equipment or materials.
   “ELEVATED BUILDING.” A non-basement building built to have the lowest floor
elevated above the ground level by means of solid foundation perimeter walls,
pilings, columns, piers, or shear walls parallel to the flow of water.
   “EXECUTIVE ORDER 11988 (FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT).” Issued by President Carter
in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be conducted
in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard areas,
unless there is no practicable alternative.
   “EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK” or “MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION.” A
manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities
for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before October 25, 1983 (initial ordinance date).
   “EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME
SUBDIVISION.” The preparation of additional sites by the construction of
facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be
affixed (including the installation of utilities, either final site grading or
pouring of concrete pads, or the construction of streets). Any expansion is
considered “new construction.”
   “FLOOD” or “FLOODING.” A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (l) The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
      (2) The unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   “FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM).” An official map of a community, issued
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, where the boundaries of the areas
of special flood hazard have been defined as Zone A.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM).” An official map of a community on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of
special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
   “FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY.” The official report provided by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the
Flood Boundary-Floodway Map and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   “FLOOD PROOFING.” Any combination of structural and non-structural
additions, changes or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood
damage to real estate or improved property, water and sanitary facilities,
structures or their contents.
   “FLOOD-RESISTANT MATERIAL.” Any building material capable of withstanding
direct and prolonged contact (minimum 72 hours) with floodwaters without
sustaining damage that requires more than low-cost cosmetic repair. Any
material that is water-soluble or is not resistant to alkali or acid in water,
including normal adhesives for above-grade use, is not flood-resistant.
Pressure-treated lumber or naturally decay-resistant lumbers are acceptable
flooring materials. Sheet-type flooring coverings that restrict evaporation
from below and materials that are impervious, but dimensionally unstable are
not acceptable. Materials that absorb or retain water excessively after
submergence are not flood-resistant. Please refer to Technical Bulletin 2,
Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from
the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced
therein, are acceptable flood-resistant materials.
   “FLOODWAY.” The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent
land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   “FLOOR.” The top surface of an enclosed area in a building (including
basement), that is: top of slab in concrete slab construction or top of wood
flooring in wood frame construction. The term does not include the floor of a
garage used solely for parking vehicles.
   “FLOOR, LOWEST.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area. An unfinished
or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access, or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a
building’s lowest floor provided that such an enclosure is not built so as to
render the structure in violation of other provisions of this chapter.
   “FREEBOARD.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood
level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for
the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than
the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such
as wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of
the watershed.
   “FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE.” A use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The
term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for
the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building repair
facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing
facilities.
   “HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE.” The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
   “HISTORIC STRUCTURE.” Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior (DOI) (or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior) as meeting the requirements for
individual listing on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district;
      (3)   Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places;
      (4)   Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in
communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified by an
approved state program as determined by the Secretary of Interior, directly by
the Secretary of Interior in states without approved programs. Some structures
or districts listed on the state or local inventories may be “historic” as
cited above, but have been included on the inventories because it was believed
that the structures or districts have the potential for meeting the “historic”
structure criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures to meet NFIP
historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced that the
South Carolina Department of Archives and History has individually determined
that the structure or district meets DOI historic structure criteria.
   “INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC).” Applies to all new and renewed flood
insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable
the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and
control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the
payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with state or community
floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a
building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged.
   “LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG).” An elevation of the lowest ground surface
that touches any deck support, exterior walls of a building or proposed
building walls.
   “LOWEST FLOOR.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s “LOWEST FLOOR” provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   “MANUFACTURED HOME.” A structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. It does not
include recreational vehicle.
   “MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION.” A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   “MEAN SEA LEVEL.” The average height of the sea for all stages of the tide.
It is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the flood
plain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is synonymous with National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD).
   “NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD) OF 1929.” As corrected in 1929,
elevation reference points set by National Geodetic Survey based on mean sea
level.
   “NEW CONSTRUCTION.” Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after October 25, 1983 (initial ordinance date). The term also
includes any subsequent improvements to such structure.
   “NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR MANUFACTURED HOME SUBDIVISION.” A parcel or
contiguous parcels of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for
rent or sale for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lot on
which the manufactured home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete
pads, and the construction of streets) is completed on or after the effective
date of this chapter.
   “NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD) OF 1988.” Vertical control, as
corrected in 1988, used as the reference datum on Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
   “RECREATION VEHICLE.” A vehicle which is built on a single chassis; 400
square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
designed preliminarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   “REPETITIVE LOSS.” A building covered by a contract for flood insurance that
has incurred flood-related damages on two occasions during a ten-year period
ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the
cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.
   “START OF CONSTRUCTION.” Includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within 180
days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured home) on a
site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles,
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the
placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does
notinclude land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does
it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include
excavation for footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary
forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory
buildings, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units or not part
of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of
construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.
   “STRUCTURE.” A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   “SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure where by
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted
cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of “substantial improvement.”
   “SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.” Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the
structure, either (l) before the improvement or repair is started, or (2) if
the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage
occurred. For the purposes of this definition “SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT” is
considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. The term does not, however,
include either any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions, or any alteration of a
structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or a state
inventory of historic places.
   “VARIANCE.” A grant of relief to a person from the requirements of this
chapter which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this
chapter where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   “VIOLATION.” The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

§ 152.21 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES.
   Duties and responsibilities of the Building Official shall include, but not
be limited to:
   (A) Permit review. Review all development permits to assure that the
requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
   (B)   Requirement of federal and/or state permits. Review proposed
development to assure that all necessary permits have been received from those
governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law,
including section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of
1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334.
   (C)   Watercourse alterations.
      (1)   Notify adjacent communities and the South Carolina Department of
Natural Resources, Land, Water and Conservation Division, State Coordinator for
the National Flood Insurance Program, prior to any alteration or relocation of
a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
      (2)   In addition to the notifications required watercourse alterations
per §
152.21(3)(a), written reports of maintenance records must be maintained to show
that maintenance has been provided within the altered or relocated portion of
the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is maintained. This
maintenance must consist of a comprehensive program of periodic inspections,
and routine channel clearing and dredging, or other related functions. The
assurance shall consist of a description of maintenance activities, frequency
of performance, and the local official responsible for maintenance performance.
Records shall be kept on file for FEMA inspection.
      (3)   If the proposed project will modify the configuration of the
watercourse, floodway, or base flood elevation for which a detailed Flood
Insurance Study has been developed, the applicant shall apply for and must
receive approval for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR) with the
Federal Emergency Management Agency prior to the start of construction.
      (4)   Within 60 days of completion of an alteration of a watercourse, the
applicant shall submit as-built certification, by a registered professional
engineer, to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (D)   Floodway encroachments. Prevent encroachments within floodways unless
the certification and flood hazard reduction provisions of §
152.44 are met.
   (E)   Adjoining floodplains. Cooperate with neighboring communities with
respect to the management of adjoining floodplains and/or flood-related erosion
areas in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards.
   (F)   Notifying adjacent communities. Notify adjacent communities prior to
permitting substantial commercial developments and large subdivisions to be
undertaken in areas of special flood hazard and/or flood-related erosion
hazards.
   (G)   Certification requirements.
      (1)   Obtain and review actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level)
of the lowest floor of all new or substantially improved structures.
      (2)   Obtain the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to
which the new or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed.
      (3)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect.
   (H)   Map interpretation. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in this subchapter.
   (I)   Prevailing authority. Where a map boundary showing an area of special
flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations for flood
protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table,
and the like) shall prevail. The correct information should be submitted to
FEMA as per the map maintenance activity requirements.
   (J)   Use of best available data. When base flood elevation data and
floodway data has not been provided obtain, review, and reasonably utilize best
available base flood elevation data and floodway data available from a federal,
state, or other source, including data developed pursuant to the standards for
subdivision proposals, in order to administer the provisions of this chapter.
Data from preliminary, draft, and final Flood Insurance Studies constitutes
best available data from a federal, state or other source. Data must be
developed using hydraulic models meeting the minimum requirement of NFIP
approved model. If an appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR

flotation, collapse and lateral movement of the structure;
         (e)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment
shall be installed in accordance with this chapter;
         (f)   Openings to relieve hydrostatic pressure during a flood shall be
provided below base flood elevation in conformance with this chapter; and
         (g)   Accessory structures shall be built with flood resistance
materials in accordance with Technical Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant
Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and available from the Federal Emergency
Management Agency. Class 4 and 5 materials, referenced therein, are acceptable
flood-resistant materials.
   (G)   Swimming pool utility equipment rooms. If the building cannot be built
at or above the BFE, because of functionality of the equipment then a structure

resisting damage during flood conditions.
   (F)   The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment
provisions of this chapter.
   (G)   Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such
protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the
building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents,
permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood
elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents
without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site
out of the floodplain.
(Ord. 14-006, passed 2-25-14)
§ 152.59 FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED BY THE BOARD.
   In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
   (A)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
   (B)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and
the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   (C)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
   (D)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
   (E)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
   (F)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
   (G)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
   (H)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
   (I)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and
   (J)   Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain
areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure
exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting
of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be
in the Special Flood Hazard Area and no other alternative locations for the
structure are available.

§ 152.60 ISSUANCE OF VARIANCE; CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Findings. Findings listed above shall be submitted to the Appeal
Board, in writing, and included in the application for a variance.
Additionally, comments from the Department of Natural Resources, Land, Water
and Conservation Division, State Coordinator’s Office, must be taken into
account and included in the permit file.
   (B)   Flood ways. Variances shall not be issued within any designated
floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result unless a CLOMR is obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In order
to ensure the project is built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the
variance is granted the applicant must provide a bond for 100% of the cost to
perform the development.
   (C) Conditions. Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter. The following conditions shall apply to all variances:
      (1)   Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the
structure in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (3)   Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and
sufficient cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
      (4)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk. Such
notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
      (5)   The Building Official shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) upon request.
      (6)   Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other
development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
Violations must be corrected in accordance with this chapter.

violation of this chapter. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined
not more than $500 or imprisoned for not more than 30 days, or both, and in
addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such

contained shall prevent the city from taking such other lawful action as is
necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.

   (A)   A vested right in a specific land development plan shall not attach
until the final plat and necessary documentation has received final approval by
the Planning Commission. All administrative appeals must be resolved in favor
of the applicant before a vested right attaches. Upon approval, such vested
right must attach prior to the issuance of a building permit and prior to the
authorization to proceed with investment in infrastructure. Any subsequent
changes to the proposed development plan must be approved by the Planning
Commission.
   (B)   A vested right is established for two years after final approval of a
preliminary plat. Such vested right shall receive five one-year extensions upon
proper application by the landowner in each year that an extension is desired
unless an amendment to the land development regulation has been adopted which
prohibits approval.
   (C)   A vested site specific development plan is subject to later enacted
laws adopted to protect public health, safety, and welfare, including, but not
limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes and
nonconforming structure and use regulations which do not provide for the
grandfathering of the vested right. The issuance of a building permit vests the
specific construction project authorized by the building permit to the standard
codes enforced at the time of the issuance of the building permit.
   (D)   A vested site specific development plan will be subject to subsequent
overlay zoning that imposes plan-related requirements but such zoning cannot
affect allowable types, height as it affects density or intensity of uses, or
density or intensity of uses which was previously approved.
   (E)   The Board of Zoning Appeals does not have the authority to grant a
vested right and no such right shall accrue as a result of their decision.
Variances do not create a vested right.
   (F)   A vested right is subject to revocation by the Planning Commission
upon its determination, after notice and public hearing, that there was a
material misrepresentation by the landowner or substantial noncompliance with
the terms and conditions of the original or amended approval.

City of Camden, South Carolina, as obligee, in the sum of $              , for
payment whereof to the obligee, the principal and security bind themselves,
their heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, jointly and
severally, firmly to these presents:
Signed, sealed, and dated, this        day of               , 20    .
WHEREAS, application was made to the obligee for approval of a subdivision
shown on a plat entitled
“                                                            ”, dated
                   , 20   , and filed with the Camden Planning Commission, and
said final plat was approved upon certain conditions, one of which is that an
improvement guarantee in the amount of $                 be filed with the City
of Camden to guarantee certain improvements in said subdivision;
NOW THEREFORE, THE CONDITION OF THIS OBLIGATION is such that if the above-named
principal shall, within                          from the date hereof (in no
case shall the improvement guarantee be valid for more than two years), truly
make and perform the required improvements and construction of public
improvements in said subdivision in accordance with the specifications of the
Land Development Ordinance, then this obligation will be void; otherwise it
will remain in full force and effect.
   It is hereby understood and agreed that in the event any required
improvements have not been installed within the term of this improvement
guarantee, the City Council may thereupon declare this guarantee to be in
default and collect the sum remaining payable thereunder, and upon receipt of
the proceeds thereof, the city shall install such improvements as are covered
by the guarantee.
   It is further understood and agreed that when the required improvements have
been approved for conformity with these regulations by the Planning and
Development Director or designee, the guarantee shall be released and returned.
In addition, if any portion of the required improvements is completed by the
subdivider and approved by the Planning and Development Director or designee, a
portion of the guarantee commensurate with the cost of these completed
improvements may be released and returned. In no event shall an improvement
guarantee be reduced below 25% of the principal amount until all improvements
have been approved by the Planning and Development Director or designee.

Clerk of Court in and for the County of Kershaw, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof, shall forfeit and pay penalties as
the court may decide for each parcel so transferred or sold or agreed to be

(Ord. 15-002, passed 2-24-15; Am. Ord. 2021-012, passed 6-22-21)
§ 157.026 PURPOSE OF DISTRICTS.
   All areas within the city limits of the city are divided into zoning
districts, within which the use of land and water areas; the location, height,
bulk, appearance and use of structures; the provision of parking and loading
areas; and the provision of buffers, landscaping and screening are regulated as
herein provided. Collectively, these districts are intended to advance the
purposes of this Zoning Ordinance as stated in §
157.002-Purpose. Individually, each district is designed and intended to
accomplish the following more specific objectives.
   (A)   Primary districts. Each primary zoning district serves a different
purpose and imposes its own set of requirements and restrictions on the use of
land within the district in addition to the general requirements and
restrictions imposed on all land or uses within the city.
      (1)   R-E, Residential Estate District. The R-E Residential District is
intended to foster, preserve and protect areas of the community in which the
principal use of land is for detached, single-family dwellings, and limited
residential support facilities at very low densities.
      (2)   R-15, Low Density, Single-family Residential District. The R-15
Residential District is intended to foster, preserve, and protect at low
densities areas of the community in which the principal use of land is for
detached, single-family dwellings, and limited residential support facilities.
      (3)   R-10, Medium Density Residential District. The R-10 Residential
District is intended to foster, protect and accommodate single-family and two-
family residential development, and limited residential support facilities in
areas so designated.
      (4)   R-6, High Density Residential District. The R-6 Residential
District is intended to accommodate higher density residential development and
a variety of housing types on small lots or in project settings, in areas
accessible by major streets and in proximity to commercial uses and employment
opportunities.
      (5)   R-6S, High Density, Single-Family Residential District. The R-6S
Residential District is intended to foster, preserve, and protect at higher
densities areas of the community in which the principal use of land is for
detached, single-family dwellings, and limited residential support facilities.
      (6)   OI, Office and Institutional District. The OI District is intended
to accommodate office, institutional and residential uses in areas whose
character is mixed or in transition. It is designed principally for use along
major streets and subdivision borders characterized by older houses to help
ameliorate the consequences of change impacting these areas, and to provide a
transitional buffer between potentially incompatible commercial and residential
development.
      (7)   CBD, Central Business District. The CBD District is intended to
promote the concentration and vitality of commercial and business uses in core
commercial areas and as such, encourages a mixture of complementary uses and a
pedestrian orientation. This district is characterized by wall-to-wall and lot-
line-to-lot-line development, pedestrian walkways, and off-street public
parking lots.
      (8)   GBD, General Business District. The GBD District is intended to
provide for the development and maintenance of commercial and business uses to
serve the community and the larger midlands region. Toward this end, a wide
range of business and commercial uses are permitted herein.
      (9)   LBD, Limited Business District. The LBD District is intended to
meet the commercial and service needs generated by nearby residential areas.
Goods and services normally available in this district are of the "convenience
variety." The size of these districts should relate to surrounding residential
markets and the locations should be at or hear major intersections, in
proximity to residential areas and/or on the periphery of residential areas,
moderating transition between residential and commercial uses.
      (10)   IND, Industrial District.
         (a)   The intent of the IND District is to accommodate retail,
wholesaling, distribution, storage, processing and manufacturing uses in an
environment suited to such uses and operations while promoting land use
compatibility through the application of performance standards within and
beyond the boundaries of this district.
         (b)   Toward these ends, residential development is not permitted
herein, nor is the establishment of this district on a street providing primary
access to or traversing a residential district.
      (11)   CMU, Commercial Mixed Use District. The intent of this multiple
use district is to provide for the development and maintenance of commercial,
business and other complementary uses in strategic locations to serve the
traveling public without negatively impacting surrounding land uses or
environmental resources.
      (12)   EQ, Equine District. The intent of the Equine District is to
accommodate and promote present and future equine activities including, but not
limited to, training, racing, and showing of horses, donkeys, or other related
activities in an environment compatible with surrounding properties. This
district is intended primarily for large tracts of land devoted to or developed
for equine and related activities.
      (13)   PDD, Planned Development District. 
         (a)   The intent of the Planned Development District is to encourage
flexibility in the development of land in order to promote its most appropriate
use; and to do so in a manner that will enhance the public health, safety,
morals, and general welfare of the population.
         (b)   Within the PDD, regulations adapted to unified planning and
development are intended to accomplish the purpose of zoning and other
applicable regulations to an equivalent or higher degree than instances in
which such regulations are designed to control unscheduled development on
individual lots or tracts, promote economical and efficient land use, provide
an improved level of amenities, foster a harmonious variety of uses, encourage
creative design, and produce a better environment.
         (c)   In view of the substantial public advantage of "planned
development," it is the intent of these regulations to promote and encourage
or, where applicable, to require development in this form where appropriate in
character, timing, and location, particularly in large undeveloped tracts.
   (B)   Overlay districts. Overlay districts are established to provide for
certain additional requirements or to establish special development
requirements for permitted uses. Where overlay districts exist and there is a
conflict between the requirements specified between the overlay district and
the underlying primary district, the standards and requirements of the overlay
district shall prevail. Otherwise, the standards and requirements of the
underlying primary district shall also be in effect for any area additional
zoned as an overlay district. Each overlay district is identified on the
official zoning map of the city.
      (1)   Historic Overlay District (HOD). The Historic Overlay District is
designed and intended to promote the educational, cultural, economic and
general welfare of the community by providing a mechanism for the
identification, recognition, preservation, maintenance, protection and
enhancement of existing historic and architecturally valuable structures and
properties which serve as visible reminders of the social, cultural, economic,
political and/or architectural past, thereby:
         (a)   Fostering civic pride;
         (b)   Preserving local heritage;
         (c)   Fostering public knowledge and appreciation of structures and
areas which provide a unique and valuable perspective on the social, cultural,
and economic mores of past generations;
         (d)   Fostering architectural creativity by preserving physical
examples of outstanding architectural techniques of the past; and
         (e)   Encouraging new structures and development that will be
harmonious with existing structures, properties and sites included in the
districts.
      (2)   Commercial Overlay District (COM). The purpose of the Commercial
Overlay District is to protect and enhance the aesthetic and visual character
of all commercial development within the primary commercial corridors of the
city.
      (3)   Downtown Overlay District (DTN). The Downtown Overlay District is
intended to protect and maintain the character of the core of the Downtown
Commercial District and to provide for architectural cohesion within the
designated corridors by regulating the type of construction and the design of
other buildings that are in proximity to historically significant buildings or
sites. Buildings located in this overlay district are commercial or mixed-use
and typically have a shopfront style façade.

§ 157.027 INTERPRETATION OF DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts shown on the
official zoning map, the following rules shall apply.
   (A)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streets, highways, alleys, or public utility easements shall be construed to
follow such center lines.
   (B)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following platted lot or tract
lines shall be construed as following such lines, whether public or private.
   (C)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following political lines shall
be construed as following such lines.
   (D)   Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines shall be construed to
be midway between the main tracks.
   (E)   Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
natural barriers such as, rivers and streams, shall be construed to follow such
center lines.
   (F)   Boundaries indicated as parallel to, or extensions of features
indicated in divisions (A) through (E) above shall be so construed. If
distances are not specifically indicated on the official zoning map, or in
other circumstances not covered by divisions (A) through (E) above, the
boundaries shall be determined by the use of scale of such map.
   (G)   Where uncertainties continue to exist after the application of the
rules in this section, appeal for clarification may be taken to the Board of
Zoning Appeals with jurisdiction for such matters.

§ 157.028 ZONING CLASSIFICATION OF ANNEXED TERRITORY.
   On property to be annexed into the corporate limits by petition, as provided
for in S.C. Code §§ 5-3-10, et seq., the zoning classification shall be
determined for the annexed property subject to the following procedures:
   (A)   Upon receipt of a petition for annexation of property into the city
limits, the Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the City Council
regarding the appropriate zoning classification for the property to be annexed
in accordance with §
157.211 (H)-Amendments. Prior to making such recommendation to the City
Council, the Planning Commission shall conduct a public hearing on the matter
pursuant to the requirements of §
157.211 (H). Upon receipt of a recommendation by the Planning Commission,
Council shall then take final action regarding the annexation of the subject
property. The zoning classification shall become effective on the effective
date of the annexation ordinance.

§ 157.029 ZONING DISTRICT TABLE OF PERMITTED USES.
   (A)   Establishment of table. The uses permitted in the residential, mixed
use and nonresidential zoning districts established by §
157.025  are set forth in the Table of Permitted Uses provided in §
157.029 (D).
   (B)   Determination of use category.
      (1)   The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), 2012, as
amended, is the basis for determining the use of property permitted by the
various zoning districts. The Zoning Administrator shall make a determination
as to whether or not any proposed use is permitted within the city limits based
on the uses listed in division (D) of this section. Whenever it is not clear
whether a proposed use is or is not permitted, the Zoning Administrator shall
consult the latest version of the NAICS to help make a determination. Any use
not specifically listed in division (D) of this section and any proposed use
not substantially similar to a listed use as determined by the Zoning
Administrator after consultation with the latest version of the NAICS shall be
deemed to be prohibited.
      (2)   Uses not listed in the NAICS codes are identified by the symbol
"NA" (not applicable) in the NAICS column.
      (3)   Where the symbol "P" is shown, the use to which it refers is
permitted as a use by right in the indicated district, provided it otherwise
complies fully with all applicable development standards and requirements of
this Zoning Ordinance.
      (4)   Where the symbol "C" is shown, the use to which it refers is
conditionally permitted in the indicated district, subject to applicable
conditions and requirements contained in §§
157.038 through
157.062, which requirements are referenced by section number following each
conditionally permitted use.
      (5)   Where a dash (-) is shown on the table, the use to which it refers
is not permitted in the indicated district.
   (C)   Determination of principal use. The Zoning Administrator shall make a
determination as to whether or not any proposed use is permitted within the
city limits based on the uses listed in the Table of Permitted Uses. When
multiple principal uses are proposed for a development site, each principal use
is classified separately and is subject to all applicable regulations for that
use. Whenever it is not clear whether a proposed use is or is not permitted,
the Zoning Administrator shall consult the latest version of the NAICS to help
make a determination. Any use not specifically listed in the Permitted Uses
Table and any proposed use not substantially similar to a listed use as
determined by the Zoning Administrator after consultation with the NAICS shall
be deemed to be prohibited.

§ 157.031 PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (PDD).
   (A)   The Planned Development District (PDD) promotes innovative design
within developments by permitting a mixture of different types of housing with
compatible commercial uses, shopping centers, office parks and other mixed use
developments. Flexibility and creativity in the design, character and quality
of the development and preservation of natural and scenic features or open
spaces is made possible through the development and approval of a detailed plan
which describes the specific uses, densities, and other requirements for
development. In accordance with S.C. Code § 6-29-740, in order to establish a
PDD, the City Council must amend the Zoning Ordinance text and the official
zoning map, after having received a recommendation from the Planning Commission
regarding the PDD. The approved plan constitutes the district regulations for
each planned development district.
   (B)   Permitted uses in PDDs. Any combination (mix) of uses meeting the
objectives of this section may be established in a PDD upon review and approval
by the Planning Commission and City Council. Once approved, the proposed use(s)
and no others shall be permitted. Said uses shall be identified as listed per §
157.029 (D)-Table of Permitted Uses. The list of approved uses shall be binding
on the applicant and any successor in title, so long as the PDD zoning applies
to the land, unless otherwise amended by ordinance.
   (C)   Mixture of uses. For PDDs that are or are planned to be primarily
residential, 10% of the total gross area of the PDD must be reserved for
office, retail, service, live-work units and other non-residential uses that
serve the needs of project residents and others in the vicinity of the
development. For PDDs that are or are planned to be primarily nonresidential,
10% of the total gross area of the PDD must be reserved for residential uses.
   (D)   Establishment of PDD Districts.
      (1)   PDDs shall be established on the official zoning map by the same
procedure as for amendments generally as provided for in §

      (2)   The developer/applicant shall arrange for preliminary meetings with
the City Planner prior to submitting an application for rezoning.
      (3)   The Planning Commission will review the conceptual plan and text to
insure conformity with this section and applicable requirements of the Land
Development Regulations,
Chapter 156; to consider the comments of the Review Committee; and to obtain
and consider public comments concerning the proposed PDD.
      (4)   Upon approval by City Council, the conceptual plan and text shall
constitute the PDD ordinance. Violations of any ordinance approving a PDD shall
be subject to any and all enforcement and penalty provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance.
   (E)   Conceptual Plan and Text Requirements.
      (1)   A conceptual plan meeting the requirements for site plans contained

conceptual plan approval and, in special cases, may waive a particular
requirement if, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the inclusion of
that requirement is not essential to a proper assessment of the project.
   (F)   The developer is authorized to begin construction of street and
infrastructure following verification that the preliminary plat complies with
all requirements specified by City Council, the Planning Commission, DHEC,
Chapter 156 and other approved conditions including recording of restrictive
covenants.
   (G)   Final plat approval shall also comply with
Chapter 156, Land Development Regulations.

plans shall be binding on the owner and any successor in title.
      (1)   Minor changes. Changes proposed in writing by the applicant which
do not alter district boundaries and which involve revision to minor
characteristics of the PDD such as the revision of floor plans, facades,
landscaping, drainage structures, and features which do not substantially alter
the approved plan concept, anticipated offsite impacts, or violate any
applicable regulations may be approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Major changes. Changes proposed in writing by the applicant which
alter district boundaries or which substantially alter the characteristics of
the PDD shall be submitted under normal zoning amendment procedures applicable
to establishment of the PDD.
   (N)   Expiration of time limits on PDD amendments. The final approved plan
for a PDD shall be in effect for a period of two years or other specified

surface within a five foot horizontal distance of the exterior wall of the
building when such sidewalk or ground surface is not more than ten feet above,
or
         (b)   The elevation that is ten feet higher than the lowest grade when
the sidewalk or ground surface.
      (2)   Measuring building height for different roof types.
         (a)   Flat roof: measure to the top of the parapet, or if there is no
parapet, to the highest point of the roof.
         (b)   Mansard roof: measure to the deck line.

the highest point.
         (e)   Stepped or terraced building: measure to the highest point of
any segment of the building.
   (C)   Exception to height requirements in residential districts. In all
residential districts, the maximum height of the primary residence may exceed
35 feet provided that the part of the residence which is higher than 35 feet is
set back an additional two feet for each foot of height over 35 feet.
   (D)   Exceptions to height limitations. The height limitations of this
chapter shall not apply to church spires, belfries, cupolas, domes not intended
for human occupancy, monuments, water towers, utility poles, chimneys,

choices, and well planned parks and open spaces; the following standards shall
apply to all development in all zoning districts unless otherwise noted.
   (B)   The following design standards shall apply to a specific type of land
use or an overlay district insomuch as the standard would apply to the
applicable underlying district, unless properties in an overlay are otherwise
exempted within the text of this Zoning Ordinance. Please review the overlay
district requirements as set out in §
157.030 for guidance on interpreting applicability of these standards to an
individual property or district. The category "All Commercial" shall apply to
all commercial development, including businesses, offices, and industrial uses
unless otherwise noted.

         (d)   Alternatively, a basement foundation may be used on the sides
and/or rear façades.
         (e)   Foundations shall not be clad in finished or unfinished concrete
block.
      (10)   Eaves. Eaves must extend beyond the plane of façade by at least
six inches. Similar treatments such as coping on top of a brick façade or a
stucco parapet wall are also allowed.
      (11)   Entries. All entries must be sheltered with an overhang, portico,
or porch.
      (12)   Outdoor area. In addition to the common open space required for
the entire project, each unit must have an outdoor living area for the
residents to use for recreation. Specific standards include:
         (a)   Types. The outdoor area may take forms such as, but not limited
to, a yard, balcony, covered or screened porch, rooftop area, patio or deck.
         (b)   Location. The private outdoor area must be fully contained on
the individual parcel, outside of all required utility easements.
         (c)   Size. The private outdoor living area must be at least 200
square feet in area per unit. This area may be physically broken up into two
separate areas, but neither area may be smaller than 48 square feet.
         (d)   Separation. Private outdoor living areas must have physical
separation from adjacent units through building walls, fences, hedges, or
similar. The physical separation is not required to provide a full screen; for
example, a three-foot hedge or decorative fence is allowed.
         (e)   Surfacing. Private outdoor areas must have a surface appropriate
for the use.
         (f)   Parking areas. Parking areas that are provided to meet the
parking standards of this section and driveways that access a garage do not
count as approved outdoor areas.

§ 157.096 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   Applicability. The following standards apply to all building plans
approved after June 30, 2024. For projects built under old standards but that
have space for additional buildings, those new buildings would be expected to
meet these standards unless it is determined:
      (1)   The location is not on an arterials and collector road or other
highly visible location where strict compliance is crucial to meeting overall
city aesthetic goals; and
      (2)   The likelihood is low of surrounding non-conforming buildings
changing use, being redeveloped, or otherwise being brought into greater
compliance with these design standards within the foreseeable future.
   (B)   Design intent. The following design standards are intended to create
high quality, walkable urban environments based on time-tested urban design
principles. These principles, along with the careful location of these
buildings and communities in high-amenity, mixed-use locations, are intended to
create long-term value that allows buildings to become even more coveted
addresses over time. Architectural details, the design quality and
functionality of open spaces, and the design and functional integration of
these buildings and communities with their surrounding mixed-use environment
are the important public interests that are reflected in these standards.
   (C)   Orientation of buildings to streets and open space.
      (1)   All multi-family dwellings must be oriented so that the primary
entrance(s) and street-level unit entries face the street. In the case of
corner lots, the primary entrance(s) must face the street from which the
building derives its street address. It is acceptable to have two primary
entrances, but no secondary entrance may face a street. A primary entrance is
defined by the entrance's function, scale, and/or design detail.
      (2)   When a required open space area is included within the development,
at least 10% of the dwelling units must front the open space area; this
includes lots where a street is located between dwelling units and the open
space. The percentage may be reduced if the open space is designed to preserve
specific natural features, or extend existing open space or pedestrian
corridors, or such a percentage cannot be reasonable met.
      (3)   Within the context of other design requirements, streets and
buildings should be arranged to frame the open space to the maximum extent
practicable (see picture below).

IMAGES/0-0-0-3106.gif]
 
   (D)    Open space. Required open space must be functional and enhance the
resident or visitor's experience. Amenities include special paving, enhanced
landscaping, trellises, and other features that promote outdoor recreation,
scenic amenity, and/or shared exterior space for people to gather. See examples
below.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3108.gif]
 
   (E)    Parking. Multi-family projects must comply with the following, in
additional to any related standards elsewhere in this subchapter.
      (1)   Off-street parking lots associated with multi-family dwellings
cannot be located between any structures and the street.
      (2)   Off-street parking lots located next to a building must not occupy
more than 25% of the parcel's street frontage. Associated driving areas must be
included as part of such off-street surface parking.
      (3)   Any podium parking or structured parking should be adequately
screened and integrated into the overall design of the building through the use
of metal screens, louvers, grilles, and/or green screens.
   (F)   Pedestrian walkways.
      (1)   Continuous internal pedestrian walkways must be provided to connect
off-street parking areas with primary building entrances and the public
sidewalk system.
      (2)   If a public sidewalk is adjacent to the project site, at lease one
internal pedestrian walkway with a minimum width of five feet must be provided
from the primary entrance to the public sidewalk at a major connection point.
In the case of a corner lot, a connection must be made to the sidewalk of both
streets.
      (3)   The crossings at major entrances, major internal routes, and major
pedestrian walkways must be distinguished from driving surfaces through the use
of durable, low-maintenance surface materials such as pavers, bricks, or
scored/stamped concrete or asphalt to enhance pedestrian safety and comfort, as
well as the attractiveness of the walkways.
   (G)   Building size. Individual building footprints are limited to 15,000
square feet, or in cases where at least 25% of the ground floor is reserved for
neighborhood commercial uses served by their own exterior entrance, to 25,000
square feet. A larger building footprint may be approved by the Planning
Commission for special purpose facilities or an established mixed-use area if
compatible with the sale of the surrounding development.
   (H)   Building massing.
      (1)   All building façades of multi-family uses must include a
distinguishable and distinct base, middle and top such that the base of the
building relates to the pedestrian scale.
      ( 2)    All buildin g elevatio ns must be treated in a consiste nt manner
regardi ng the design, material s, color, and complex ity, unless the elevatio
n exclusiv ely fronts a service area or alley, or is otherwise not visible from
to the general public.

   Base, middle and top examples
   (I)   Design of front façades.
      (1)   Façades must incorporate wall offsets in the form of projections
and/or recesses in the façade plane at least every 30 feet of façade frontage.
      (2)   Wall offsets, resets, and projections must have a minimum depth of
two feet.
      (3)   The building façade must express the module of the actual
residential unit in order to scale to create a façade that has depth, visual
interest, and rhythm.
      (4)   In additional to wall offsets, façades of multi-family buildings
must provide a minimum of four of the following design features in a cohesive
manner for each residential unit fronting onto a public street or public space
unless there are unique and challenging circumstances that would otherwise make
the implementation of these features not feasible (such as incompatibility with
an established building aesthetic, lack of public visibility, or demonstrated
physical constraints of the site):
         (a)   One or more dormer windows or cupolas above the corresponding
residential unit.
         (b)   A projecting or recessed balcony for at least 50% of the units
facing a public street or public space and a covered porch for each unit at
ground-level facing a public street or public space.
         (c)   Ornamental pilasters, columns, or other similar architectural
features integrated into the overall architectural design.
         (d)   One or more bay windows with a minimum 12-inch projection from
the façade plane.
         (e)   Eaves with a minimum of six-inch projection from the façade
plane.
         (f)   A parapet wall with an articulated design, which entails design
variation rather than a simple rectilinear form.
         (g)   Multiple windows grouped together to establish a design feature
that can be either recessed or projecting with a minimum four-inch wide trim.
         (h)   Windows that have dimensional window surrounds or trim.
         (i)   Windows that incorporate ornamental elements such as shutters,
arched windows, transom windows, or any other design feature that would
otherwise add ornamental characteristics to a window or group of windows.
         (j)   Other prominent design details that are consistent with the
overall architectural character and scale of the building.
      (5)   Pitched roofs must have multiple planes and elements, including
hips, gables and dormers reflecting required wall offsets or other
architectural features of the building, with at least one additional roof plane
or feature for every 60 feet of façade frontage.
      (6)   Flat roofs should include elements that act as a prominent visual
termination for the building, such as projecting architectural features,
cornices, and eaves. Where a flat roof is used, a parapet should extend beyond
the roof plane and include an element that provides a visual termination of the
façade. The parapet should extend far enough above the roof plane that any
mechanical equipment is concealed from public view at street level.
   (J)   Consistency of façade design. Each façade must receive similar
treatment to the façades that are oriented toward the street. They should have
variation in massing, similar pattern of openings, at least one projection or
recess, or one bay window or covered porch meeting the standards in division
(I) above. This requirement may be waived by the Planning Commission for
adjacent building sides or façades otherwise oriented with minimal public
visibility.
   (K)   Design of building entries.
      (1)   At any entry, whether a common entry or access to an individual
unit entry at ground level, a canopy, awning, balcony, or other significant
architectural feature combined with the entry itself being either recessed or
projecting from the primary façade must be provided to promote pedestrian
safety and orientation to the building by creating a well-defined and welcoming
building entry.
      (2)   Shared or common building entries should provide a transition from
the street to the entries themselves to create a unique shared sense of entry
that provides a defensible space, therefore generating a sense of pride and
ownership. This can be accomplished by changes in grade, stairs, low masonry
walls, ornamental railing, a change in paving materials and/ or landscaping.
      (3)   Exterior, open corridors (breezeways) designed to provide primary,
street-side access to dwellings are prohibited, whether the breezeways are
ground level or elevated.
      (4)   All residential units, other than units that are accessed
individually directly from the exterior, should be accessed through enclosed,
shared common access points that are monitored by a security system and/or on-
site security/management staff and be accessible to emergency responders.
Building access must be provided via a keypad entry, card access, or similar
system equipped with the ability to provide on-demand access to emergency
responders.
   (L)   Building foundations.
      (1)   A slab foundation is permitted, provided that the foundation
supporting the floor framing is an average of at least 18 inches above grade on
the front and side façades and is clad with brick, brick veneer, stone, stone
veneer, stucco, or other masonry materials on the front and side façades.
      (2)   Buildings that are age-restricted to citizens ages 55 and older,
and buildings that are designed or intended for occupation by persons with
physical disabilities may use a slab-on-grade foundation or raised slab
foundation, provided that an average of 18 inches from the ground levels is
clad with brick, brick veneer, stone, stone veneer, stucco, or other masonry
materials on the front and side façades.
      (3)   Foundations shall not be clad in finished or unfinished concrete
block.
   (M)   Building materials.
      (1)   Buildings must have a minimum of 50% brick, stone or stucco on
façades facing a public street or public open space, and 30% brick, stone or
stucco on façades that front service areas or alleys, or are otherwise not
visible to the general public. Stucco or synthetic stucco (EIFS) may only be
placed above the first building level on all façades, except for detailed
design elements that may extend to the ground level.
      (2)   The following materials are prohibited for all building elevations:
         (a)   Metal siding (unless architectural grade in limited application
such as design accent or feature only).
         (b)   Vinyl siding.
         (c)   Plywood.
         (d)   Exposed smooth-finished concrete block.
      (3)   Changes in materials and color should correspond to the building
modulation and other architectural features of the building. At a recess,
projection or change in material, the materials should return to meet the
primary façade.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/a178da95ab651604c8901bef06ba60a1b98db04e/
IMAGES/0-0-0-3112.gif]
 
   (N)   Windows, doors, balconies, patios and porches.
      (1)   Windows and doors should be recessed within the façade in which
they are located or have dimensional surrounds/trim a minimum of four inches
wide.
      (2)   False balconies (or Juliet balconies) should not be used unless the
depth is at least 12 inches from the façade.
   (O)   Garages and carports.
      (1)   Garages/carports serving multi-family buildings must be located to
the side or rear of the building.
      (2)   Garage doors are prohibited from facing a public street.
      (3)   Side-facing garages must not face existing single-family detached
dwellings unless a perimeter buffer with a minimum width of 30 feet is provided
between the garage and existing single-family detached dwellings.
      (4)   The exterior materials, design features, and roof form of garages
and carports must be compatible with the building they serve.
      (5)   Garage doors facing a public street or public open space must be
recessed within the façade and include detailing elements to create visual
interest and add to the overall architectural character of the building. This
does not apply to garage doors facing an alley, service area, or otherwise non-
public area.
   (P)   Roof penetrations and equipment.
      (1)   To the degree practicable, all roof vents, pipes, antennas,
satellite dishes, and other roof penetrations and equipment (except chimneys)
must be located on the rear elevations or configured to have a minimal visual
impact as seen from the street.
      (2)   Where wall-mounted equipment is visible from the street or any
public area, it should be of similar color to the façade on which it is located
and be integrated into the overall design.
   (Q)   Unique conditions and exceptions. In situations where the applicant
can show that building orientation, building layout, adjacent land use, or
other determining factors preclude adherence to the standards, the Planning and
Development Director may reduce the applicable standards of this section after
all reasonable efforts are made to incorporate them in their entirety.
(Ord. 2024-014, passed 6-25-24)
§ 157.097 NON-RESIDENTIAL DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   These non-residential design standards apply to all new public,
institutional, commercial and industrial development.
      (2)   In addition to new non-residential development, these standards
also apply to any existing non-residential buildings if any expansion or
alteration exceeds 50% of the structures gross square footage at the time of
expansion or alteration.
      (3)   The approving authority for a site plan, subdivision plat, or other
permit may modify or waive any or all of these standards for industrial uses
when they conflict with the covenants or design scheme of an existing
industrial park. Modification or waiver must consider the following criteria:
         (a)   The surrounding area is substantially developed with buildings
not meeting any or all of these standards;
         (b)   The location is not on an arterial or collector road or other
highly visible location where strict compliance is crucial to meeting overall
city aesthetic goals; and
         (c)   The likelihood of surrounding non-conforming buildings changing
use, being redeveloped, or otherwise being brought into greater conformance
with these design standard within the foreseeable future is low.
   (B)   Building presentation and wall pattern. Front building façades shall
be substantially parallel to the front property line except that:
      (1)   The entrance of corner buildings may be oriented to front the
corner;
      (2)   Buildings interior to a development site may be arranged to front a
common courtyard, parking area, driveway;
      (3)   Where the street curves at the front property line the building
shall be parallel to a tangent of the curve that does, or would if lines were
extended, intersect the side property lines;
      (4)   In pedestrian-oriented areas such as the Central Business District,
an operable primary building entrance must face the street;
      (5)   In automobile-oriented transportation corridors, the operable
primary entrance is considered the main customer entrance and may face a street
or parking lot;
      (6)   Side yard houses built to conform to historic design principles
shall be exempt from this requirement.
   (C)   Building articulation required. In order to provide building
articulation and interest in design and human scale to the façade of a
building, a variety of building techniques are required. The purpose of this
section is to ensure that the front of non-residential structures have a
variety of offsets, relief, and insets to provide a more interesting façade
appearance. Front façades more than 60 feet wide must comply with the following
articulation requirements.
      (l)   Horizontal articulation.
         (a)   A wall must have a perpendicular offset after a horizontal span
of two times its average height, or more frequently if desired.
         (b)   The offset depth must be at least 5% of the average building
height. Offsets can be of varying depth as long as this minimal standard is
met.
         (c)   The offset must extend laterally for a distance equal to at
least 10% of the entire façade, up to a maximum of 40 feet.
         (d)   Industrial buildings may use a change of materials, colors, or
texture to meet the horizontal articulation requirements. Buildings must still
meet the distance and length requirements above.
         (e)   For calculation purposes, the façade will be considered the
total distance of the building façade.

IMAGES/0-0-0-3114.gif]
 
      (2)    Vertical articulation.
         (a)   A wall must chance elevation after a horizontal span of two
times its average height, or more frequently if desired.
         (b)    The change in height must be at least 15% of the average
building height.
         (c)    The elevation chance must continue to extend laterally for a
distance equal to at least l0% of the entire façade, up to a maximum of 40
feet.
         (d)   Elevation changes can be of varying heights as long as the
minimal standard is met.
         (e)   For calculation purposes, the façade will be considered the
total distance of the building façade.

      (3)   Prominent entry. All non-residential buildings must have at least
one prominent entry. All non-residential buildings other than industrial uses
must use at least two of the following features, and industrial uses must use
at least one feature:
         (a)   Canopies, porticos, or roof overhangs above the entrance;
         (b)   Entry recesses/projections, with raised parapets, gabled roof
forms, arcades, or arches above the entrance;
         (c)   Architectural details, such as tile work and moldings, that are
integrated into the building structure and design, and are above and/or
directly adjacent to the entrance; or
         (d)   Integral planters or wind walls that incorporate landscaped
areas or seating areas. A wing wall is a wall secondary in scale projecting
from a primary wall and not having a roof.
   (D)   Building materials.
      (1)   Prohibited materials.
         (a)   Lap siding is only permitted on office and commercial buildings
of less than 10,000 square feet, and above the ground floor of multi-story
mixed-use buildings. Vinyl lap siding must have a smooth finish with no visible
grain pattern.
         (b)   Stucco or synthetic stucco is prohibited on buildings larger
than 10,000 square feet, and within two feet of the grade level or within two
feet of any exterior door jamb.
      (2)   Colors.
         (a)   Paint colors used on exterior walls of non-residential buildings
shall be of low reflectance, subtle, neutral, or earth-tone colors or shall
relate to historic building colors found within the city generally or on
neighboring historic buildings. Contrasting colors shall be kept in tone with
the primary color.
         (b)   The exterior wall area of each side of the building may contain
nonfluorescent highlighting trim or dark contrasting features which use bright,
dark, or vivid colors, but are restricted to no more than 10% of the façade.
   (E)   Roofs.
      (1)   Roof planes. Except for mansard roofs, cupolas, and steeples,
sloped roofs must include two or more sloping roof planes with greater than or
equal to one foot of vertical rise for every three feet of horizontal run, and
less than or equal to one foot of vertical rise for every one foot of
horizontal run.
      (2)   Flat roofs. When flat roofs are used, parapet walls with three-
dimensional cornice treatments must conceal them. The cornice must include a
perpendicular projection a minimum of four inches from the parapet façade
plane.
      (3)   Pitched roofs. Pitched roofs shall be dark-colored fiberglass
shingles (except red and blue), slate, clay tile, or standing-seam metal roofs.

         (a)   All loading docks, storage areas, solid waste, maintenance
equipment and similar items shall be screened from public view.
         (b)   Mechanical equipment at ground level shall be placed on the
parking lot side of buildings away from public streets and buildings on
adjacent sites, except for single-family residential uses and industrial
buildings in the CMU zoning district. All such equipment shall be substantially
screened from public view.
         (c)   Mechanical equipment and antennas located on rooftops shall be
camouflaged as a normal architectural feature of the building, or hidden by a
decorative cornice or parapet wall, as seen from the ground.
         (d)   All trash and recycling receptacles and storage areas shall be
located away from public streets and screened entirely from public view.
         (e)   All non-vegetative screening used to block public view of trash
and recycling receptacles and storage areas shall be made of materials
compatible in color and type to the principal structure(s) on the property.
         (f)   Drive-thru windows, freestanding ATMs, and similar devices and
accessory uses shall only be placed in areas that will not interfere with the
safe movement of pedestrians and vehicles in parking and driveway areas.
         (g)   Drive-thru windows, freestanding ATMs, and similar devices shall
not be placed between the primary façade of a building and the public street.

in §
157.192(B)(2).
      (3)   For signs on a base material and attached without a frame, such as

be used in the measurement, unless it is clear that part of the base contains
no sign-related display or decoration.
      (4)   For sign structures consisting of individual pieces attached to a
building wall, sign area is determined by the smallest perimeter that can be
drawn around all sign elements.

      (1)   Permanent off-street parking for all structures and uses of land,
except parking for individual single-family residences, shall conform to the
minimum requirements of division (I) of this section. These standards, to be

parking and unloading spaces must be provided, in compliance with this
subchapter, for churches, daycare centers, schools, and residences.
      (4)   Off-street parking is permitted in yard and setback areas required
by this Zoning Ordinance, but shall not be permitted in any required buffer

      (2)   Calculation for required off-street parking for any bar, lounge,
nightclub, or restaurant shall include all seats located in outdoor seating
areas.
   (C)   Change or expansion of an existing use.
      (1)   Change in the use of an existing structure or site shall require
compliance with the minimum parking requirements applicable to the new use.
      (2)   Any expansion of an existing building or use shall require review

offsite in an area approved by the city as shared parking for the use, or where
such parking is to be provided by a public garage or facility, approved by the
Zoning Administrator. Shared parking areas are encouraged and shall be
permitted whenever the Zoning Administrator determines that the minimum parking
requirements can be met for each use based upon the number of spaces needed for
each use, the frequency of the use of spaces by each use, and the timing of the
use of spaces for each use.

used to satisfy the off-street parking requirements for residential uses

   (I)   Design standards. Where off-street parking is required, the following
design and development standards shall apply:
      (1)   Parking dimensions.
         (a)   Parking stalls. Parking stalls shall be not less than 9 feet by
19 feet, except that a maximum of 10% of the total number of stalls may be 8.5
feet by 18 feet. However, the dimensions of all parallel parking stalls shall
be not less than 9 feet by 24 feet.
         (b)   Minimum isle width shall be as follows:
 
Angle of Parking Aisle Width
                 One Way Traffic Two Way Traffic
30 degrees       13 feet         19 feet

60 degrees       18 feet         22 feet
90 degrees       20 feet         24 feet
 
         (c)   No parking aisle serving the general public that contains more
than ten parking spaces shall dead end. Any parking aisle that dead ends shall
be provided a suitable turnaround.
      (2)   Construction.
         (a)   All off-street parking areas for ten or more vehicles shall be
paved with asphalt, concrete, brick pavers, or approved pervious pavement and
pavers as detailed in division (I)(2) of this section, except for areas used
for overflow, special events, and peak parking, and parking areas serving
single-family detached and duplex housing. However, parking designed to
accommodate the regular parking of heavy construction and industrial vehicles
may be allowed to pave those areas with suitable gravel. Any parking for ten or
more vehicles on such site intended to park automobiles, small service
vehicles, and similar passenger vehicles shall be paved.
         (b)   Surfaces for all driveways and off-street parking areas for less
than ten vehicles may consist of asphalt, concrete, crushed stone, gravel,
approved pervious pavement and pavers as detailed in division (I)(2) of this
section, or other similar material approved by the Zoning Administrator, except
for areas used for overflow, special events, and peak parking, and parking
areas serving single-family detached and duplex housing.
         (c)   Parking lot construction shall be designed to minimize off-site
storm water runoff.
         (d)   Driveways and parking areas which are required to be paved shall
be paved with a minimum ten foot wide apron made of asphalt, concrete, brick
pavers, or similar hard material approved by the Zoning Administrator and
suitable for driveway use, which extends at least ten feet from the edge of the
public street to prevent washout into the public street and to protect the edge
of pavement. This standard shall not apply to single-family residential and
duplex uses.
         (e)   Alleys shall be paved with asphalt or concrete and shall be
designed and constructed to withstand regular use by heavy vehicles such as
garbage trucks. All alleys paved with asphalt shall have continuous concrete
edges a minimum of 12 inches in width
         (f)   Pedestrian crosswalks shall be incorporated into the design and
construction of parking lots in all mixed use and commercial districts wherever
pedestrians are likely to cross to access parking or other buildings.
      (3)   Low impact design required. Low impact design (LID) of all parking
areas is required to control stormwater and meet the city's stormwater goal
that post-construction discharge does not exceed pre-construction discharge, as
reviewed and approved by the City Planner. General LID standards and
requirements are detailed in §
157.194 -Low Impact Design Required and apply to all parking areas. Specific
low impact design standards for parking lots are as follows:
         (a)   Bioretention/biofiltration swales designed within planting
islands and around the perimeter shall be a minimum of ten feet in width. If
curbing is not placed around the swale, stop blocks must be used for each
parking space to prevent vehicles from entering the swale.
         (b)   Permeable pavements are permitted including interlocking paving
systems and porous pavement, provided handicapped spaces and pathways are
designed and installed to meet ADA requirements. Open-grid pavers may be used
in peripheral and overflow parking areas.
         (c)   If curbing is used to provide a barrier around swales or other
landscaped or natural areas designed to receive stormwater from the site
regular gaps in the curbing must be provided to allow stormwater runoff to
drain into these areas as planned without ponding in parking spaces or drive
aisles.
      (4)   Separation from walkways and streets. Off-street parking spaces
shall be separated from walkways, sidewalks, streets, or alleys, and required
yards and buffers as provided in §
157.138 (J)-Parking Lot Landscaping. In smaller parking lots with less than ten
spaces, off-street parking spaces shall be separated from walkways, sidewalks,
streets, alleys, required yards and buffer areas by curbing or a landscaped
buffer area per the requirements of §
157.138 (J)-Parking Lot Landscaping, as approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   Entrances and exits. Curbing or other approved barriers, including
landscaping as provided in §
157.138 (J)-Parking Lot Landscaping, shall be provided along boundaries to
control entrance and exit of vehicles or pedestrians. All off-street parking
areas shall be designed so that all movement onto a public street is in a
forward motion. No driveway may be located closer than 40 feet to a street
intersection measured in a straight line from the closest point of the driveway
to the closest point of the edge of pavement or curb line of the intersection.
      (6)   Onsite turnaround required. Onsite turnaround area adequate to
accommodate typical passenger vehicles shall be provided for all parking
spaces.
      (7)   Marking. Off-street parking, except for single-family detached
residential use, shall be clearly marked on the ground by painted lines, curbs
or other means to indicate individual spaces. Signs or markers, as approved by
the Zoning Administrator, shall be used as necessary to ensure efficient and
safe vehicle operation on the lot.
      (8)   Lighting. Adequate lighting shall be provided if off-street parking
spaces are to be used at night. Equipment for lighting parking facilities shall
be shielded so as to prevent sky glow and light trespass onto adjacent
residential areas, public streets and rights-of-way.
      (9)   Landscaping. Off-street parking areas for ten or more vehicles
shall be landscaped in accordance with the provisions of §
157.138 (J)-Parking Lot Landscaping.
      (10)   Maintenance. All off-street parking areas shall be maintained in a
clean and orderly condition, removing and/or controlling dust, debris and weeds
to the extent possible on a regular basis, at the expense of the owner or
lessee and not used for the sale, repair, dismantling or servicing of any
vehicles or equipment, except for service and auto repair stations.
      (11)   Circulation. All off-street parking shall be served by interior
circulation drives. No private off-street parking spaces shall directly connect
to public streets. This standard shall not apply to single-family detached
residential, duplex, patio home and townhouse developments.
      (12)   Drive-thru stacking. In addition to required parking spaces,
drive-thru facilities shall provide a minimum of five stacking spaces per
drive-thru facility, window, or bay. Stacking spaces shall be located entirely
outside of a required driveway or parking aisle needed to access required
parking spaces. The following exceptions shall apply to the five stacking
spaces required hereunder:
         (a)   Fast food restaurants shall have an additional five stacking
spaces. A minimum of five of the total stacking spaces shall be located at or
prior to the ordering station.
         (b)   Non-automated car washes shall only be required to have at least

dry down area.
         (c)   Automated car washes shall be required to have an additional two
stacking spaces per bay.
   (J)   Parking for the physically handicapped. Parking for the physically
handicapped shall be provided per the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended; and the International Building
Code, as amended and adopted by the city. Each space shall be paved,
prominently outlined in blue paint, and shall include appropriate signage
provided per the requirements of the ADA and the International Building Code.
   (K)   Parking, storage, or use of campers, boats, trailers, or recreational
vehicles in residential zones. One such vehicle no longer than 17 feet may be
stored or parked in the front yard or side yard of a residential lot. One
vehicle longer than 17 feet may be stored in the side yard provided it does not
extend into the front yard. Vehicles must be parked at least five feet from
adjacent side or rear property lines. A maximum of three vehicles of any size
may be parked in the rear yard area unless they are stored in an enclosed

promote careful landscaping of outdoor areas, soften and enhance the manmade
environment, reduce summer heat and provide shade, and to assist with
stormwater drainage, the following minimum standards shall apply in all zoning
districts unless otherwise noted.
(Ord. 15-002, passed 2-24-15; Am. Ord. 2024-014, passed 6-25-24)
§ 157.137 LANDSCAPING STANDARDS.
   The landscaping standards included in this section shall apply, as
appropriate, to all required landscaped areas in this subchapter.
   (A)   General standards.
      (1)   Commercial outparcels shall be vegetated and maintained by the
property owner while vacant to maintain an attractive appearance. Vegetation
shall consist of turf grass, shrubs, trees, live ground cover, annuals,
perennials, ornamental grasses or other vegetative cover that will secure the
soil and create an attractive appearance.
      (2)   All required plantings installed shall be: (1) nursery grown stock
that is free from pests or growth problems; (2) installed and maintained
according to best management practices and standards set forth by the American
Nursery and Landscape Association, ANSI 260.1-2004, as amended; and (3)

Administrator.
      (3)   All required landscaping shall be included in the required site
plan as provided in §
157.211(D).
      (4)   All required plantings shall be installed in a manner that insures
the availability of sufficient soil and water for healthy growth and that is
not intrusive to above and below ground utilities.
      (5)   Only landscaping and approved fences, berms and walls shall be
permitted within a required buffer or street buffer area, except that sidewalks
and other pedestrian walkways, bicycle paths, aboveground utilities, drainage
ways, and approved signs shall be permitted where they do not comprise of more
than 20% of the total area of the required buffer or street buffer or
compromise the ability of the site to meet the intent and planting requirements
herein. Underground utilities are permitted wherever they do not interfere with
the ability to provide the required buffer or street buffer area and
landscaping.
      (6)   Clustering and/or random spacing of plants and trees is encouraged
to produce a natural appearance in the landscape, except where uniformity is
required for opaque screening.
      (7)   Landscaping, including berms, shall be installed and maintained so
as not to interfere with the sight distance requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance or the sight distance needs of vehicular traffic in parking areas and
at entrance and exit locations.
      (8)   Small maturing trees are required to be substituted for required
large maturing trees whenever overhead utility lines are present or planned.
      (9)   Native species and related cultivars are encouraged.
      (10)   Monocultures shall be avoided in formally designed parks, buffers,
screens, or in conjunction with a streetscape plan as approved by the Zoning

      (13)   In landscaped areas adjacent to parking spaces or street curbs, no
plant material with the potential to reach over six inches in height may be
located within 12 inches of the curb or other protective barrier. This is
intended to protect planted materials from damage by car bumpers and car doors.
      (14)   The Zoning Administrator will conduct inspections as needed to
determine that required landscaping is properly installed and maintained as
provided in this subchapter.
      (15)   The Zoning Administrator may require changes to any planting
schedule or plant size requirement and may require plant substitution when, in
their opinion, the size, nature, and/or spacing of plantings will compromise
the safety and security of the public.
      (16)   The Zoning Administrator may approve revisions to landscaping in
an approved site plan in order to accommodate seasonal planting problems or a
lack of plant availability as long as:

a public right-of-way or undeveloped required yard or buffer on any development
site except individual single-family residential properties shall be retained
unless approved for removal by the Zoning Administrator during site plan review
per the requirements of §
157.142. In addition, every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and
retain existing trees not actually lying in planned roadways, drainage ways,
building foundation sites and construction activity areas on all development
sites. A plan for protection of existing vegetation shall be submitted and
approved by the Zoning Administrator prior to clearing, grading or development
of the site.
      (2)   Existing vegetation shall count towards meeting the requirements of
this section as long as such are:
         (a)   Free from pests or structural problems;
         (b)   Clearly shown on the site plan;
         (c)   Approved by the Zoning Administrator prior to development as
meeting the intent of the landscaping requirements;
         (d)   Not considered invasive or noxious plants; and
         (e)   Adequately protected before and during grading and development
of the site.
      (3)   Along streets and property boundaries that are forested and are to
be maintained in a forested condition by the property owner; new buffer
planting requirements may be reduced or eliminated upon approval of the Zoning
Administrator to minimize grading and enhance conservation of existing, mature
trees.
      (4)   No residential lot shall be clear cut unless a tree replacement
plan is approved by the Zoning Administrator.
   (D)   Irrigation. Except for individual single family lots, all newly-
planted and relocated plant material shall be watered by permanent irrigation
systems. Trees shall be watered at a rate of five gallons per inch of caliper
at least one time per week or as needed based on soil and weather conditions.
All other vegetation shall be watered sufficiently to ensure healthy growth and
longevity in the landscape.
   (E)   Landscape installation and maintenance responsibility.
      (1)   To ensure compliance with this subchapter and to encourage required
vegetation to be installed during the appropriate season and within the
required time period as prescribed by this subchapter, a letter of compliance
may be accepted by the city in lieu of installation prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for the site. This letter shall be in the form of an
affidavit signed by the property owner properly notarized, and shall:
         (a)   Acknowledge that such owner is aware of any landscaping and/or
screening requirements which apply to the property; and
         (b)   Stipulate that he or she will comply with those requirements by
a specific date within the next appropriate planting season, but in no case
more than nine months after the date of the affidavit, unless otherwise
approved by the Zoning Administrator; and
         (c)   Acknowledge that failure to comply with the provisions of this
section within the time frame specified in the letter shall constitute a
violation of this section, which shall subject the property owner to any and
all enforcement actions permitted by law.
      (2)   All landscape materials required or installed voluntarily by the
developer, whether used for screening, buffering, open space, street buffers,
or other required landscaping areas, shall be properly maintained by the
property owner. Maintenance includes all actions necessary to keep landscaping
materials healthy, neat and orderly in appearance, and free of litter and
debris. Any landscape material lost, stolen, or vandalized, or which has died
or become irreparably or irreversibly damaged, by disease, pests, or for any
other reason shall be removed and replaced unless, in the determination of the
Zoning Administrator, the maturity of the remaining vegetation compensates for
the loss of an individual shrub or tree, thereby causing the intent of the
landscape standard to still be met without replacement. Maintenance of trees
planted or included in landscaped areas must follow best management practices
included and referenced in
Chapter 100 of the City of Camden Code of Ordinances as provided by the Zoning
Administrator.

§ 157.139 BUFFERS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of a landscaped buffer is to help provide
transition between different types of land uses, to break up or soften the
appearance of paved surfaces, to protect significant water bodies and to
provide the shade and greenery necessary to create a livable urban environment.
Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, buffers shall be
required for all development as follows.
   (B)   Applicability. Buffers shall be required whenever new development is
approved or an existing building is expanded by more than 20%.
   (C)     Location. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of an existing
street or right-of-way; however, they may occupy part or all of any required
front, side or rear yard setback. Property buffers shall be located on the
outer perimet er of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary
line.

   (D)   Use of buffers. A buffer may be used for passive recreation. All other
uses are prohibited, including off-street parking. However, where permitted,
freestanding signs may be installed in required buffers. To prevent damage to
existing trees, overhead utility lines and underground pipes cannot be
installed in buffers. With approval of the Zoning Administrator, such pipes may
cross, but shall not run longitudinally within, the buffer.
   (E)   General requirements.
      (1)   Planting requirements in buffer areas may be altered on a case-by-
case basis by the Zoning Administrator in locations where the required buffer
is wholly or partially within an existing easement.
      (2)   Along areas that are scheduled for easement or right-of-way
acquisition or expansion by the SC Department of Transportation in the near
future, the Zoning Administrator may allow a postponement of all or a portion
of the buffer planting. Whenever postponement is allowed, a letter of
compliance pursuant to this section shall be required.
      (3)   Where the location of existing permanent buildings on an existing
site reduces the area available for a buffer, buffer requirements shall be met
to the maximum extent practicable.
      (4)   Where implementation of the buffer requirements on an existing site
would require the removal of parking spaces, the Zoning Administrator may
approve a reduction of up to 20% of the required parking spaces in order to
make room for required landscaping.
   (F)   Exceptions. In the event that unusual topography or elevation of a
development site, the size of the parcel to be developed, the soil or sub-
surface condition of the site would make strict adherence to the requirements
of this section serve no meaningful purpose or would make it physically
impractical to install and maintain the required buffer plantings, the Zoning
Administrator may alter the requirements of this section as long as the
existing features of the development site comply with the spirit and intent
herein. Such an alteration may occur only at the request of the property owner,
who shall submit a plan to the Zoning Administrator showing existing site
features that would buffer or screen the proposed use and any additional buffer
materials the property owner will plant or construct to buffer the proposed
use.
   (G)   Street buffers.
      (1)   Street buffers shall be required along all streets for new
development sites, except residential development with no more than four units;
redevelopment sites; and expansion of a commercial building by more than 20%,
except that street buffers shall not be required in the CBD district.
      (2)   For non-residential uses, all required street buffers shall be
planted within 20 feet of the right-of-way line along the entire length of the
property.
      (3)   Street buffers for residential uses.
         (a)   All new single-family detached or attached neighborhoods must
provide buffers of at least 30 feet wide along all arterial or collector roads
that are external to the development. (Conversely, when single-family detached
or attached neighborhoods are designed with the front façades of the homes
facing an external local road or another type of road smaller than a local
road, no buffer is required.)
         (b)   All new multi-family developments must provide buffers of at
least 50 feet wide along all arterial or collector roads that are external to
the development.
         (c)   Even if this area is wooded at the outset of the development,
additional landscaping may be required to screen the new neighborhood from the
view of the road, to provide privacy to homes that are adjacent to these roads,
and to beautify the entrances to the community. This buffer must be planted
with a variety of plant material and meander visually for species diversity and
visual interest. Tue design must consist of layered evergreen trees and
shrubbery that are fully branched from the ground-level upward as well as
canopy trees and ornamental selections. A berm may also be included.

      (4)   Large maturing trees shall be planted unless overhead utility lines
or other factors require the use of medium or small maturing trees, as approved
by the Zoning Administrator. Fractions generated by applying the minimum number
of plants to the actual linear footage of the buffer shall be rounded up to the
next whole number. (For example, 125 feet of buffer length would be required to
have two large trees or three medium trees or four small trees.) The planting
schedule for street buffers shall be as follows:
 
Type                  Minimum Number Per Linear Foot
Large maturing trees  .02
Medium maturing trees .04
Small maturing trees  .06
 
      (5)   In addition to the tree planting requirements, a minimum of 30% of
the buffer area shall be planted in a combination of approved shrubs,
perennials, ornamental grasses, live ground cover, or turf grass, except that
additional plantings may not be required in significant natural forested areas
maintained within the street buffer if so approved by the Zoning Administrator.
All other areas, including bare ground under trees, shall be covered in a
minimum of three inches of mulch. Spacing and arrangement of plant material
must be primarily based on the mature dimensions of the plants.
      (6)   Berms shall be allowed to augment required street buffer plantings
as long as a minimum of 50% of all required trees and plantings shall be
planted along the street front portion of the berm.
   (H)   Property buffers.
      (1)   The purpose of a property buffer is to minimize the potential
negative impact between adjacent land uses and streets, and to promote land use
compatibility.
      (2)   Property buffers shall be required along all applicable property
boundaries for new development sites, redevelopment sites, major subdivisions,
and whenever an existing nonresidential use is expanded by more than 50%.
Property buffers shall not be required in the CBD Zoning District. Buffers for
a Master Planned District shall be established within the requirements for each
specific development.
      (3)   The property buffer width shall be established for new development
using the following table.
Proposed Land Use Existing Land Use Required Buffer Width

                              Heavy industry           75 feet
*Required property buffers for single-family detached or attached uses must be
contained within a common area maintained by a homeowners’ association and not
on private lots.
 
      (4)   The total number of trees required shall be determined by the
following table.
 
Required Buffer Width Large Maturing Trees (per 100 Small or Medium Maturing
                      feet)                         Trees (per 100 feet)

      (5)   The use of evergreen trees and plans are strongly encouraged. In
addition to the tree planting requirements, a minimum of 40% of the buffer area
shall be planted in a combination of approved shrubs, annuals, perennials, live
ground cover, ornamental grasses, or turf grass. All areas shall be maintained
in a minimum of three inches of mulch. Plant materials shall be designed and
installed in a manner that provides variability of height at maturity. Spacing
and arrangement of plant material must be primarily based on the mature
dimensions of the plants.
      (6)   Property buffers must be located along the outer perimeter of the
parcel and must extend to the property line or right-of-way line; however, the
buffer may be located along shared access easements between parcels in non-
residential developments.
   (I)   Riparian buffers. A riparian buffer is required along perennial and
intermittent streams, rivers, ponds, and lakes per the requirements of §
157.194 .
   (J)   Parking lot landscaping. The following standards shall apply to all
new parking areas with ten or more spaces and all expansions to existing
parking areas which add ten or more spaces, unless otherwise noted. In an
expansion, only the area of expansion is required to be included in the
calculation; however, the landscaping may be provided anywhere within the
parking area.
      (1)   Plant material shall be selected and arranged to ensure the maximum
safety of the public. No landscaping area shall be designed, installed or
maintained in such a way that it provides cover or refuge for criminal
activities.
      (2)   Plant material is required along 10% of the length of exterior
building walls and structures to provide separation between the building and
the vehicular surface area.
      (3)   Landscaped islands at least 200 square feet in size and a minimum
of five feet on any side shall be placed at the ends of each row of parking
spaces. Intermediate islands at least 200 square feet in size and a minimum of
five feet on any side shall be placed throughout the parking lot so that no
parking space is further than 60 feet from a tree, as measured from the end or
edge of the parking space. One tree is required at the end of every row of
parking, even if the row terminates at a buffer area.
         (a)   Each landscaped island shall include one large maturing tree
unless there is an overhead utility line or street light present, in which case
a small or medium maturing tree shall be planted.
         (b)   In addition to the tree planting requirement, a minimum of 20%
of each landscaped island shall be planted in a combination of small maturing
shrubs, perennials, annuals, ornamental grasses, and/or live ground cover. All
other areas shall be maintained in a minimum of three inches of mulch wherever
plant material is placed.
      (4)   Landscaped areas within or adjacent to parking areas must be
protected from vehicular damage by a raised curb, wheel stops or approved
equivalent barrier of at least six inches in height.
      (5)   All parking lots, including vehicle sales and display areas, must
contain a continuous row of evergreen shrubs along roadways and shared access
drives that are not already protected by a land use buffer. This screening may
be accomplished by shrubs, small or medium maturing trees, berms, or other
hardscape features that are architecturally compatible with the development.

      (6)    Alternative, creative landscaping plans that incorporate larger
islands or different spacing of landscaped areas than required in this section
may be approved by the Zoning Administrator, as long as the minimum area of
landscaping and minimum number of trees is provided.
(Ord. 15-002, passed 2-24-15; Am. Ord. 2024-014, passed 6-25-24)
§ 157.140 SCREENING.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of screening is to provide a visual barrier
between an unsightly or out of scale feature and the view from public streets
and abutting properties.
   (B)   Opaque screening required. Unless otherwise specified in this section,
all required screening shall be opaque. An opaque screen is intended to exclude
all visual contact with the screened feature from an adjacent property, public
street, or right-of-way. An opaque screen may be composed of a wall, fence,
building, or berm; planted vegetation; existing vegetation; or a combination
thereof; as approved by the Zoning Administrator. A wall, fence, or building,
or combination thereof, must be used to screen dumpsters and loading and
delivery areas. The compliance of a planted vegetative screen or existing
vegetation will be determined by the Zoning Administrator on the basis of
average mature dimension and density of foliage of the proposed or existing
plant species, and/or field observation of existing vegetation. Vegetated
screens must be opaque in all seasons of the year. Therefore, all plant
material used shall be evergreen, must be selected from the List of Approved
Plant Species for the City of Camden and List of Approved Tree Species for the
City of Camden, and must be installed and maintained per the requirements of
this chapter.
   (C)   Structural screens. If structural materials are used for screening,
such as for walls or fences, such structure must be augmented with vegetation
to soften the appearance of the structure. Such structures used to screen
dumpsters and loading and delivery areas in the CBD are exempt from this
requirement. Plants required for buffer landscaping per the provisions of this
chapter may be incorporated to satisfy these requirements, per approval by the
Zoning Administrator. Such vegetation shall be planted or in the case of
incorporation of existing vegetation shall exist on the side of the fence or
wall that faces away from the land use or feature that requires screening.
   (D)   Height of required screening. The height of required screening shall
be sufficient to block the view of the feature for which the screening is
required from the adjoining property that is to be provided such protection.
All required screening shall be opaque to a height of at least six feet above
grade at maturity.
   (E)   Length of required screening. The length of a required screen shall be
that which is necessary to totally visually screen the feature from protected
properties, streets, and rights-of-way as provided in this section. The Zoning
Administrator may approve accommodations for reasonable access and use, as
necessary.
   (F)   Screening required for features. To maximize site line obstruction, a
screen shall be placed immediately adjacent to the feature to be screened
except as otherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning
Administrator may approve accommodations for reasonable access, use, and
maintenance of the features and equipment, as necessary. Screening to minimize
views from adjacent existing residential properties, properties in residential
zoning districts, roads and public rights-of-way shall be required for the
following features.
      (1)   Mechanical equipment for all non-residential uses at ground level
and mounted on roofs, including, but not limited to HVAC equipment,
transformers and generators;
         (a)   Roof mounted mechanical equipment shall not be visible in any
direction from any adjacent existing residential properties, properties in
residential zoning districts, roads and public rights-of-way. Where it can be
clearly demonstrated that such equipment is not visible from any adjacent
existing residential properties, properties in residential zoning districts,
roads and public rights-of-way, the Zoning Administrator may waive screening
requirements.
         (b)   Screening of roof-mounted equipment shall be accomplished by
solid and permanent roof-mounted screens, compatible with the architectural
style, materials and color of the building upon which the equipment is located;
      (2)   Garbage and trash collection areas, including dumpsters;
      (3)   Delivery and loading areas; and
      (4)   Open storage areas accessory to non-residential uses must be
totally screened from public view.
   (G)   Fences and walls. All fences and walls shall meet the requirements of
§
157.060 (D)(4).
   (H)   Berms. The following standards shall apply to all berms.
      (1)   No structures, including fences, shall be placed on a berm unless
approved by the Zoning Administrator as part of the landscaping requirements
for a development site.
      (2)   Berms shall not be used for the display of vehicles or other
merchandise.
      (3)   If included in the landscape design, berms shall:
         (a)   Have a minimum height of 18 inches, a minimum crown width of two
feet, and a side slope with a width to height ratio of no greater than three to
one (3:1). No berm shall exceed four feet in height once the soil settles.
         (b)   Be designed and constructed with an undulating appearance which
mimics, as much as is practicable, a natural topographical feature of the site.
         (c)   Be substantially planted and covered with live vegetation. No
berm shall consist entirely of turf grass, ground cover, mulch or similar
material.
         (d)   Be fully installed, planted, stabilized and maintained prior to
certification of zoning compliance.
         (e)   Be designed to prevent standing water or to impede the flow of
storm water from adjacent properties.
      (4)   Berm soil. The following standards shall apply to soil to be used
as a planting berm.
         (a)   The soil shall be imported topsoil or manufactured topsoil from
off-site sources.
         (b)   The soil should be obtained from naturally well-drained sites
where topsoil occurs at least four inches deep, but shall not be obtained from
agricultural land, bogs or marshes.
         (c)   Berm soil shall be free of stones of one inch or larger in any
dimension; roots, plants, sod, clods, clay lumps, or pockets of course sand;
contaminants such as chemicals, construction materials and building debris,
fuels, and other extraneous materials harmful to plant growth; and obnoxious
weeds and invasive plants, including but not limited to quackgrass,
Johnsongrass, poison ivy, nutsedge, nimblewill, Canada thistle, bindweed,
bentgrass, wild garlic, ground ivy, perennial sorrel, and bromegrass.
         (d)   The soil shall not be infested with nematodes, grubs, other
pests, pest eggs, or other undesirable organisms and disease-causing plant
pathogens.
         (e)   Soil for berms shall be friable and with sufficient structure to
give good tilth and aeration. Soil shall be within a pH range of 6.2 to 6.8.
         (f)   Soil analysis required. For each soil type included in the berm
soil, a soil analysis and a written report by a qualified soil-testing
laboratory must be provided that states percentages of organic matter; pH; and
mineral and plant-nutrient content of the soil.
         (g)   Soil-testing laboratory qualifications. Soil analyses for berm
soil must be conducted by an independent laboratory or university laboratory,
recognized by the South Carolina Department of Agriculture, with the experience
and capability to conduct the testing indicated.

§ 157.141 OPEN SPACE.
   In general. In order to continue the development of a system of quality open
spaces and recreation areas throughout the city's jurisdiction, the following
standards shall apply to all developments and all open space and recreation
areas in all zoning districts unless otherwise noted.
   (A)   In developments with 20 or more multi-family residential units
(including townhouses and patio homes) or manufactured home parks with more
than nine manufactured homes, open space shall account for a minimum of 20% of
the total land area of the site. In developments with 20 or more single-family
detached residential units, open space shall account for a minimum of 10% of
the total land area of the site.
      (1)   No existing development, building or structure meeting the criteria
above shall be expanded or enlarged unless the minimum open space requirements
of this section are met.
      (2)   In single-family detached developments, open space may not include
any required yard, setback or buffer area for individual residential lots or
parcels.
      (3)   In multi-family developments and manufactured home parks, required
buffer areas may be included in open space if held in common ownership.
   (B)   Public open space and recreation areas, except environmental open
space, shall:
      (1)   Have direct access from public streets;
      (2)   Be visible and easily accessible; and
      (3)   Have multiple points of entry.
   (C)   All open space and recreation areas, except environmental open space,
shall be well separated from moving vehicles by vegetation, fencing, walls,
sidewalks or a combination of those elements.
   (D)   Open space not meeting the criteria of environmental open space shall
be substantially clustered around the edges of the development to buffer the
development against adjacent tracts of land, especially land used for
agriculture and low density residential development.
   (E)   The land used for required open space and recreation areas, except
environmental open space, shall have an average slope of 5% or less with no
portion of the land exceeding a 15% slope.
   (F)   Required open space and recreation areas may be public or private. The
planning, construction, and maintenance of privately owned facilities shall
adhere to the following:
      (1)   Private open space intended to count towards the open space
requirements of this section shall be held and maintained by a legally
constituted homeowners’ association or corporation. Land designated as open
space may not be separately sold, subdivided or developed.
      (2)   High maintenance cost facilities such as swimming pools shall not
be counted in determining compliance with the minimum open space and recreation
area requirements of this section. Bridges along pedestrian and bicycle paths
and similar high cost facilities shall not be permitted as an integral part of
any required open space or recreational area unless no feasible alternative
exists.
      (3)   Each phase of a phased development shall meet the minimum
requirements for open space and recreational areas. All plans for such
developments shall demonstrate compliance for each phase. No certificates of
occupancy shall be issued until all such required facilities have been
installed or bonded by the developer and approved by the city.
      (4)   The responsibility for the perpetual maintenance of open space
shall be with the owner. Maintenance for required open spaces shall include
ensuring that no hazards, nuisances or unhealthy conditions exist; and keeping
the property neat and orderly in appearance and free of litter and debris.
Failure to adequately maintain open space shall constitute a violation of this
subchapter and shall subject the owner to any and all remedies permitted
herein.
(Ord. 15-002, passed 2-24-15; Am. Ord. 2024-014, passed 6-25-24)
§ 157.142 TREE CONSERVATION.
   (A)   Purpose. The tree conservation requirements for the City of Camden are
intended to promote the conservation of healthy and structurally sound trees
for the purpose of protecting the public safety, health and welfare through
benefits of such trees, including, but not limited to the following.
      (1)   Improving air quality through the reduction of carbon dioxide and
provision of oxygen.
      (2)   Reducing air pollution by filtering dust and other unwanted
airborne particles.
      (3)   Filtering and purifying of storm water passing through the ground
to drinking water aquifers.
      (4)   Stabilizing soil as an effective component of soil conservation and
erosion and flood control.
      (5)   Providing shade, which reduces ambient temperatures and makes
outdoor areas more habitable during warmer months.
      (6)   Assisting in the reduction of noise levels and glare.
      (7)   Assisting in the retention and improvement of the character and
appearance of the city, which increases the desirability of the area and
consequently has a positive impact on residential and economic growth and
property values.
   (B)   Unlawful to remove, cut or damage significant trees. Unless authorized
by the terms of this section or approved by the Zoning Administrator during
site plan review, no person shall cut down, remove, irreparably or irreversibly
damage or destroy any significant tree located within a public right-of-way, or
required buffer, setback, yard, landscaped area or open space, except when
necessary to provide access to a site or ensure the safety and security of
people and property or when located on a single-family property. Violations of
this section are subject to any and all remedies, fines and fees as specified
herein and in §
157.212 (D).
   (C)   Platting of subdivisions. Developers shall design projects so that
buildable areas exist on lots to minimize the need for future builders to
remove significant trees to achieve a reasonable use of an individual lot.
   (D)   Tree conservation on undeveloped or redeveloped properties.
      (1)   Undeveloped property shall not be clear cut. A tree removal permit
shall be required to remove trees from undeveloped property.
      (2)   Removal of significant trees on all properties, except for single-
family residential properties, shall be prohibited prior to any land
disturbance on the site and prior to securing a grading permit, land
development permit and/or building permit for new construction or development,
redevelopment, or expansions to buildings or site elements such as parking lots
or service areas. However, on parcels of 20 acres or more that are designated
as tree plantations, trees internal to the property may be removed prior to
development as long as a 50 foot wide undisturbed tree protection zone is
defined on the perimeter of the property, as identified on the site plan and
approved by the Zoning Administrator. Within such specified tree protection
zone, no trees or other vegetation may be removed without the approval of the
Zoning Administrator, except to accommodate permitted driveways and new roads.
      (3)   All significant trees must be identified on the site plan and
reviewed by the Zoning Administrator prior to any land disturbance on the site,
and to securing a grading permit, land development and/or building permit.
Notwithstanding this requirement, on parcels of 20 acres or more that are
designated as tree plantations, the applicant will not be required to identify
individual significant trees. It is required that applicants for grading, land
development and/or building permits request a preliminary review of the site
plan by the Zoning Administrator to maximize protection of significant trees
while enabling efficient use of the property before finalizing all site,
development and construction plans.
      (4)   Replacement is required for the removal of significant trees
identified on the site plan and approved by the Zoning Administrator, except as
exempted in §
157.142(F)(4). One tree of appropriate caliper at the time of planting, as
provided in §
157.137(B), selected from the List of Approved Tree Species for the City of
Camden and approved by the Zoning Administrator, is required to be planted in a
suitable location on the property to replace each tree removed. Replacement
trees must be planted according to the Chapter 100 of the City of Camden Code
of Ordinances as provided by the Zoning Administrator. Trees included as part
of required buffer areas and parking lot landscaping may be counted as
replacement trees. A tree replacement plan, including the location, genus and
size (DBH) of the tree to be removed; and the species and proposed locations
and caliper at the time of planting (as provided in §
157.137(B)) of replacement trees, must be approved by the Zoning Administrator
prior to site plan approval.
      (5)   On parcels of 20 acres or more in size that are designated as tree
plantations, where trees internal to the property are to be removed prior to
development as provided in §
157.142(E)(l) above, required tree replacement shall be 15 large maturing trees
per acre for each area that is cleared. Such trees shall be selected from the
List of Approved Tree Species for the City of Camden and planted according to
the Chapter 100 of the City of Camden Code of Ordinances as approved by the
Zoning Administrator. Trees included as part of required buffer areas and
parking lot landscaping may be counted as replacement trees.
      (6)   If replacement of significant trees to be removed is not possible
due to factors including, but not limited to, the inability of the site to
accommodate the required replacement trees, or site or development constraints,
at a minimum, a fee in an amount established by the City of Camden Fee Schedule
shall be assessed for each significant tree removed, which shall be deposited
into the City of Camden Tree Fund.
      (7)   In order to ensure the replacement of trees according to this
section, where it is determined that trees can be replaced, a bond, letter of
credit, or other surety satisfactory to the city shall be deposited with the
Zoning Administrator in an amount and of a term satisfactory to the Zoning
Administrator prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or any use of the
property. Trees shall be replaced, in compliance with this section, within the
term of any such surety. In the event that adequate replacement trees have not
been planted within 30 days of the expiration of any such surety, the city
shall be granted the ability to draw upon the funds of any such surety in order
to fund the planting of replacement trees as shown on the approved site plan.
   (E)   Tree protection. Before and during any land disturbance, construction
or development, the following measures shall be utilized to protect significant
trees, including tree crowns and roots, designated for retention and protection
per the site plan as approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (1)   Prior to clearing/grading/land disturbance, construction and/or
development of a property, the owner shall be responsible for any and all tree
and root protection necessary to protect identified significant trees from
damage before, during and after construction. All significant trees, as well as
other existing and newly planted vegetation that is required by the landscaping
and buffer provisions, shall be protected with a sturdy and visible fence
before any land disturbance begins. At a minimum, such Tree Protection Zone
(TPZ) shall be established and be equal to a one foot radius on the ground for
every inch of Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) of each significant tree to be
protected.
      (2)   The location of the TPZ fencing and method of construction shall be
noted on the site plan. Tree protection fencing shall be installed and remain
in place and in good condition until all clearing/grading/land disturbance,
development and construction activities are completed. The tree protection
fencing shall be constructed from any material substantial enough to prohibit
and keep out vehicles, people, and all other activities associated with the
clearing/grading/land disturbance, development and construction process, as
approved by the Zoning Administrator. Examples include wood posts and rails,
chain link fencing, wire fencing and posts, and other substantial materials.
Tree protection fencing shall be a minimum of four feet high.
      (3)   All tree protection zones shall be designated as such with "Tree
Protection Zone - Caution Do Not Enter" signs posted visibly on all sides of
the fenced protection area, with lettering and colors that provide maximum
readability in terms of distance and contrast.
      (4)   No soil disturbance or compaction, stockpiling of soil or other
construction, paving or landscaping materials, vehicular traffic, or storage of
heavy equipment is allowed in the tree protection zones of trees to be
retained.
      (5)   In situations where strict adherence to the provision of tree
protection zones is not possible due to factors including, but not limited to,
site conditions, overlapping tree protection zones, or grade changes, the
Zoning Administrator may, through field determination and consultation, allow
modifications to the required tree protection zone based on accepted best
practices and procedures.
   (F)   Tree removal permit required for existing developed properties.
      (1)   Permit required. Except for single-family residential properties, a
permit shall be required for the removal of any significant tree as specified
in §
157.211 (D).
      (2)   Responsible party. The property owner will be held responsible for
all actions related to tree damage and removal.
      (3)   Acceptable reasons for tree removal. Removal of significant trees
shall be permitted for the following reasons.
         (a)   The tree is dead.
         (b)   The tree is affected by a pest or disease problem that is
untreatable or treatment is impractical and will result in rapidly declining
tree health or a hazardous condition.
         (c)   The tree is in irreversible decline due to mechanical damage,
poor maintenance or environmental stresses or a combination thereof and its
condition cannot be improved with standard maintenance techniques.
         (d)   The tree has an uncorrectable structural defect that results in
an increased risk of whole or partial tree failure.
         (e)   The tree is reducing existing or proposed site visibility of
traffic signs/signals, intersections or other situations, which may endanger
life or property, and the correction of the problem will result in crown
reduction encompassing more than 50% of the normal canopy.
         (f)   The tree is in an existing or proposed restricted growth space
resulting in conflict with the surrounding hardscape or infrastructure and the
conflict cannot be resolved.
         (g)   The tree is in conflict with overhead utility lines and proper
pruning cannot adequately reduce the conflict without severely disfiguring the
tree or will result in crown reduction encompassing more than 50% of the normal
crown.
         (h)   The tree is in conflict with proposed site reconfiguration/
improvements or above/below ground utility upgrades and the conflict cannot be
resolved or the correction of the problem will result in severe disfigurement
of the tree or severe root damage which compromises structural stability or
will result in crown reduction encompassing more than 50% of the normal crown.
      (4)   Replacement of trees removed. All trees removed per an approved
tree removal permit shall be replaced within 90 days after removal unless a
longer period of time is approved by the Zoning Administrator after determining
that construction activities or weather conditions warrant an extension. Trees
that have been removed shall be replaced by a tree of comparable size at
maturity and of appropriate caliper at the time of planting, as provided in §
157.137(B), selected from the List of Approved Tree Species for the City of
Camden and approved by the Zoning Administrator. All replacement trees shall be
planted in suitable locations on the property as approved by the Zoning
Administrator. Replacement trees must be planted according to the Tree
Installation Specifications for the City of Camden as provided by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (5)   Tree replacement not possible. If tree replacement on the property
is not possible for reasons approved by the Zoning Administrator including, but
not limited to, unique site conditions, safety concerns, and/or limitations of
reasonable use of the property, the property owner may submit a request in
writing to the Zoning Administrator to pay a fee to the City of Camden Tree
Fund in lieu of replacing the tree(s). The request shall include information
that demonstrates why the on-site planting of replacement tree(s) is not
possible. A fee in an amount established by the City of Camden Fee Schedule
shall be assessed for each significant tree removed, which shall be deposited
into the City of Camden Tree Fund as provided in §
157.212 (E).
   (G)   Exemption for the removal of significant trees. In the event that a
tree poses a severe or imminent threat to public safety or property, such as a
result of a catastrophic event or when a tree is irreparably damaged, the
Zoning Administrator may waive the requirements of this section. Written and
photographic documentation must later be submitted to the Zoning Administrator,
describing the threat which initiated the removal. The Zoning Administrator may
require replacement of any trees which are removed where it is determined that
the threat resulted from negligence.
   (H)   Tree maintenance. Maintenance of significant trees protected before
and during development, planted as replacements for significant trees that were
removed during development, or otherwise planted or protected by the provisions
of the tree conservation section, must be maintained using best management
practices included and referenced in the City of Camden Tree Maintenance
Requirements as provided by the Zoning Administrator.
   (I)   Forestry activity.
      (1)   Permitted forestry activity. Pursuant to the provisions of the
South Carolina Forestry Management Act § 48-23-205, forestry activities are
permitted on all forestland parcels within the City of Camden.
      (2)   "FORESTLAND" means land supporting a stand or potential stand of
tree valuable for timber products, watershed or wildlife protection,
recreational use, or for other purposes.
      (3)   "FORESTRY ACTIVITIES" include, but are not limited to, timber
harvest, site preparation, controlled burning, tree planting, application of
fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, weed control, animal damage control, fire
control, insect and disease control, forest road construction, and any other
generally accepted forestry practices.
      (4)   "STAND" means a contiguous group of trees sufficiently uniform in
age-class distribution, composition and structure and growing on a site of
sufficiently uniform quality, to be a distinguishable unit. A mixed stand is
composed of a mixture of species, a pure stand is composed of essentially a
single species, and in a stratified mixed stand, different species occupy
different strata of the total crown canopy.
      (5)   All forestry activities are permitted on forestland that is:
         (a)   Taxed on the basis of its present value as forestland under S.C.
Code § 12-43-220(d); or
         (b)   Managed in accordance with a forest management plan that is
prepared or approved by a South Carolina registered forester; or
         (c)   Certified under the Sustainable Forestry Initiative, the Forest
Stewardship Council, the American Forest Foundations Tree Farm System, or any
other nationally recognized forest certification system; or
         (d)   Subject to a legally binding conservation easement under which
the owner limits the right to develop or subdivide the land; or
         (e)   Managed and harvested in accordance with the best management
practices established by the State Forestry Commission pursuant to S.C. Code §
48-36-30 as determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (6)   Time restrictions on permit issuance after completion of certain
forestry activities. In the event that the Zoning Administrator determines that
any forestry activity on forestland, that is otherwise permitted pursuant to
divisions (I)(5)(a)-(e) above, has resulted in a change in the land from
forestland to nonforest or nonagricultural use, the Zoning Administrator may
deny a grading permit, building permit or land development permit for a period
of either:
         (a)   One year after the completion of a timber harvest if the
activity results in the removal of all or substantially all of the trees from
the parcel.
         (b)   Five years after the completion of a timber harvest if the
harvest results in the removal of all or substantially all of the trees from
the parcel and the harvest was a willful violation of city regulations.
   (J)   Site monitoring and inspections. The Zoning Administrator shall have
access to all active and recently completed development, redevelopment and
construction sites and all sites upon which land disturbance is planned or is
occurring, to make sure that the requirements of this section, including any
modifications approved by the Zoning Administrator, are being met.
   (K)   Violations and enforcement. Provisions for violations and enforcement
of this section are provided in §
157.212 (D).

PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
§ 157.148 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish performance standards for all
land, land uses and improvements in the city in order to promote compatibility
among uses, protect and enhance the character of the city, and to protect the
health, safety and welfare of the city by minimizing offsite impacts related to
light and glare, noise, odor, vibration, and pollution.
(Ord. 15-002, passed 2-24-15)
§ 157.149 LIGHT AND GLARE.
   The purpose of this section is to provide standards for outdoor lighting and
glare which will provide for nighttime safety, security and utility while
reducing light pollution and light trespass.
   (A)   Applicability. The provisions of this section shall apply to any and
all exterior artificial light sources not having specific special regulations.
   (B)   Exemptions. The following are exempted from the requirements of this
section.
      (1)   Lighting fixtures and standards required by federal, state, county
or city agencies, including street lights within public rights-of-way.
      (2)   Outdoor lighting fixtures used or required by law enforcement, fire
and emergency services, transportation or similar governmental agencies to
perform emergency or construction repair work, or to perform nighttime road
construction on major thoroughfares.
   (C)   Lighting. Exterior lighting of buildings, properties, developments,
signs or other features, and for any use, including, but not limited to,
residential, commercial and industrial uses, shall meet the following
requirements.
      (1)   Exterior light fixtures shall be directed so that no light spills
over onto adjacent properties or rights-of-way.
      (2)   Because of their unique requirement for nighttime visibility and
their limited hours of operation, stadiums, ball fields, playing fields and
tennis courts are exempted from the general standards of this section. However,
lighting for these outdoor recreational uses shall be shielded to minimize
light and glare trespass onto adjacent and nearby properties.
      (3)   No flashing lights shall be permitted.
      (4)   No installation or erection of any lighting which may be confused
with warning signals, emergency signals or traffic signals shall be permitted.
      (5)   Pole heights that are appropriate to the lighting application shall
be used; however, under no circumstances shall light poles exceed 35 feet.
      (6)   Mounted fixtures shall not exceed the height of the building or
structure on which they are mounted.
      (7)   All on-site roadway intersections within a manufactured home park
or a multi-family residential, commercial or mixed-use development containing
two or more separate structures shall be provided with a street light and
street lights shall be provided along roadways in the interior of such
developments at not less than 400-foot intervals.
   (D)   Glare. No light source or direct or sky reflected glare, whether from
exterior lighting, high temperature processing, combustion, welding, or
otherwise, shall be visible from beyond any property line. Light sources shall
be arranged, hooded or otherwise controlled to deflect light (both direct and
reflected) away from adjoining property or public rights-of-way.
      (1)   Safety hazard. Any artificial light source which creates glare
observable within the normal range of vision from any public walk or
thoroughfare under normal weather conditions is considered a safety hazard and
is prohibited.
      (2)   Nuisance. Any artificial light source which creates glare
observable within the normal range of vision, under normal weather conditions,
from any property other than the property where the light source is located is
considered a nuisance and is prohibited.
(Ord. 15-002, passed 2-24-15)
§ 157.150 ODOR.
   There shall be no emission of odorous gases or other odorous matter in such
quantities as to be offensive to a person of normal sensibilities at the
property line of adjacent properties or rights-of-way.
(Ord. 15-002, passed 2-24-15)
§ 157.151 VIBRATION.
   A person, business or industry may not cause or permit, beyond the property
line of any such vibration source, vibration of sufficient intensity to cause
another person of normal sensibilities to be aware of the vibration by such
direct means as sensation of touch or visual observation of moving objects. The
observer shall be located at or within the property line of the receiving
property or right-of-way when vibration determinations are made. This standard
shall not apply to vibrations created during the process of construction
between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m.
(Ord. 15-002, passed 2-24-15)
§ 157.152 PERFORMANCE STANDARDS FOR MANUFACTURING, MINING, AND WASTE
COLLECTION, TREATMENT, DISPOSAL AND REMEDIATION.
   The following performance standards shall be applied, in addition to those
provided in §§
157.149 through
157.151, to ensure that all manufacturing uses (NAICS 311-339); mining (NAICS
211-213); and waste treatment, disposal and remediation systems (NAICS 5621,
5622 and 5529) shall produce no injurious or obnoxious conditions related to
the operation of such uses sufficient to create a nuisance beyond the premises.
Additionally, waste treatment, disposal and remediation systems, including
landfills, must be in compliance with DHEC requirements. Furthermore, the
Zoning Administrator may require that an engineer certify that the proposed
project will not violate the restrictions listed herein.
   (A)   Noise. All noise shall be muffled so as not to be offensive to a
person with normal sensibilities due to noise level, intermittence, beat
frequency or shrillness. In no event shall the sound pressure level of noise
radiated continuously from a facility exceed the values provided below where
measured at the property line of any such sound-emitting source. If sound
levels are suspected to be offensive to a person with normal sensibilities by
the Zoning Administrator through observation, the property owner will be
required to conduct and document noise level tests as needed to demonstrate
that the noise generated does not exceed the values provided for herein. Such
tests must be conducted at the cost of the property owner by a qualified
professional with proven expertise in the area of noise level measurement and
testing.
      (1)   The maximum permissible noise level at the property line of any
such sound-emitting source for noise radiated continuously from a facility
between the hours of 9:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. (night time) shall be 65 decibels
(dB), and between 7:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. (day time) shall be 70 dB. Where the
lot containing such use is adjacent to a residence or residential zoning
district, the permissible noise levels shall be ten dB less than those above.
      (2)   Such measurements are expressed in terms of the equivalent sound
level and all measurements taken shall compute the equivalent sound level.
      (3)   Noise levels shall be measured with a sound level meter that
conforms to the most current specifications as recommended by the American
Standards Institute (ANSI). The meter shall be set for a "slow" response when
taking measurements. An A-weighted filter constructed in accordance with the
specifications of ANSI, which automatically takes into account the varying
effect on the human ear of different pitches, shall be used on any sound level
meter taking measurements in relation to the requirements of this section.
      (4)   Impact noises, generated by sources that do not operate more than
one minute in any one-hour period, are permissible up to a level of ten dB in
excess of the figures listed in division (A)(1) of this section, except when
the lot containing such use is adjacent to a residence or a residential zoning
district.
      (5)   Noises emanating from construction activities between 7:00 a.m. and
9:00 p.m. shall be exempt from these requirements.
   (B)   Air pollution.
      (1)   The emission of visible smoke, dust, dirt, fly ash, particulate
matter from any pipes, vents, or other openings, or from any other source into
the air, shall comply with the regulations of the South Carolina Department of
Health and Environmental Control (DHEC).
      (2)   Air pollution emanating from construction activities between 7:00
a.m. and 9:00 p.m. shall be exempt from these requirements.
   (C)   Odor. There shall be no emission of odorous gases or other odorous
matter in such quantities as to be offensive to a person with normal
sensibilities at the property line. Any process which may involve the creation
or emission of any such odor shall be provided with both primary and a
secondary safeguard system so that control may be maintained in the event of
failure of the primary safeguard system.
   (D)   Fumes and vapors. There shall be no emission of any fumes or vapors of
a noxious, toxic or corrosive nature which can cause damage or irritation to
health, animals, vegetation, or to any form of property.
   (E)   Heat, cold, dampness or movement of air. Industrial activities which
could produce any adverse effect on the temperature, motion or humidity of the
atmosphere beyond the lot line shall not be permitted. Any use requiring an
operation producing an intense heat shall be performed with the necessary
shielding to prevent such heat from being detectable at the property line of
the site on which the use is located.
   (F)   Toxic matter. The measurement of toxic matter shall be at ground level
of habitable elevation and shall be the average of any 24-hour sampling period.
The release of any airborne toxic matter shall not exceed the quantities
permitted for those toxic materials currently listed in Threshold Limit Value,
adopted by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists. If a
toxic substance is not contained in said listing, the applicant shall satisfy
the Zoning Administrator that the proposed levels will be safe to the general
population.
   (G)   Exterior illumination.
      (1)   All operations, activities, and uses shall be conducted so as to
comply with the performance standards governing exterior illumination
prescribed in §
157.149 and below.
      (2)   Requirements for maximum intensity by light source and type of area
are provided in the following table. Illumination shall be measured from any
point outside the property. If illumination is found to be extending onto
neighboring properties by the Zoning Administrator, the property owner will be
required to conduct appropriate light/illumination level tests as needed.
Measurements are to be conducted by Illumination Engineering Society of North
American (IESNA) standards.
   Maximum Intensity of Light Sources
 
                          Light Sources Visible in:

   (H)   Radiation hazard standard. All operations, activities and uses shall
comply with the regulations of the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission set out in
Chapter 1 of Title 10 of the Code of Federal Regulations which apply to
byproduct material, source material and special nuclear material, as those
terms are defined by the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, (42 U.S.C. 2014
(e), (z), and (aa)). No activity, operation or use shall cause radiation
emissions which are in violation of the Radiation Health and Safety Act of 1968
(PL 90-602), as amended, or the implementing regulations of the SC Department
of Health and Environmental Control established pursuant thereto.
   (I)   Electromagnetic radiation and interference standard. No activity,
operation or use shall cause electromagnetic radiation interference that: (a)
adversely affects persons or the operation of any equipment across lot lines
and (b) is not in conformance with the regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission.
   (J)   Liquid and solid waste standard. Any activity, operation or device
which causes or tends to cause the discharge or other release of liquid or
solid waste into public sanitary sewers, storm drains or public waters shall
comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations governing such discharge or
release, including but not limited to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act
as well as state and local provisions regulating sewers and sewage disposal,
pollution of state waters, maintenance and cleanliness of storm drainage
facilities, garbage, trash and refuse, and erosion and sediment control.
   (K)   Compliance guarantee. The applicant of a permit for a manufacturing or
processing plant which would produce any of the elements as noted in this
division shall acknowledge in writing his understanding of the performance
standards applicable to the proposed use and shall submit with the permit
application an agreement to conform with such standards at all times. Any
violation of the agreement shall constitute a violation of this chapter and the
property owner shall be subject to any and all penalties or enforcement actions
permitted by this Zoning Ordinance.

§ 157.193 NONCONFORMITIES.
   Any parcel of land, use of land, easement, building or structure lawfully
existing on the date of any text change in this Zoning Ordinance, the time of
annexation into the city's jurisdiction, or on the date of a zoning map change
that does not conform to the use or dimensional requirements of the district in
which it is located may be continued and maintained in accordance with the
provisions of this section and other applicable provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance. Nonconformities may continue, but the provisions of this section are
designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconformities and to bring
about their eventual conformity or elimination.
   (A)   Nonconforming lots.
      (1)   Vacant lots. Vacant lots for which plats or deeds have been
recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds for Kershaw County, which fail
to comply with the minimum area or other dimensional requirements of the
districts in which they are located, may be used for any of the uses permitted
in the district in which it is located, provided that:
         (a)   Where the lot area is not more than 20% below the minimum
specified in this Zoning Ordinance, and other dimensional requirements are
otherwise complied with, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue a
certificate of zoning compliance.
         (b)   Where the lot area is more than 20% below the minimum specified
in this Zoning Ordinance, or other dimensional requirements cannot be met, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may, in its discretion, approve as a variance such
dimensions as shall conform as closely as possible to the required dimensions.
      (2)   Recombination of nonconforming vacant lots. When the owner of a
nonconforming vacant lot also owns land adjacent to the nonconforming lot, and
the adjacent land or portion thereof can be combined with the nonconforming
vacant lot to create a conforming lot or a more conforming lot (without
creating other nonconformities), such owner shall, before selling or beginning
any construction thereon, so combine the nonconforming lot and the adjacent
land to create such lot.
      (3)   Nonconforming occupied lots. Nonconforming lots occupied by
buildings or structures that fail to comply with the dimensional requirements
for the district in which they are located may continue to be used, provided
the specific nonconformity is not increased.
   (B)   Nonconforming uses.
      (1)   Nonconforming uses of land or structures may continue only in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   A nonconforming use shall not be expanded. Expansion shall include
an intensification of use, a physical expansion that results in increased
capacity or activity associated with the use, an extension of the hours of
operation or number of days of activity, and any similar change in activity or
location.
      (3)   A nonconforming use shall not be moved from one location on a site
to another location on the same site unless the property owner can demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the City Planner that the relocation of the use will not
increase the impacts of such use on the public, will not adversely affect
adjacent properties, and will not have the effect of making the nonconformity
more permanent.
      (4)   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use unless
the new use conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is
located. Once a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, a
nonconforming use shall not be re-established.
      (5)   Where a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period
of 180 days, then the use shall not be re-established or resumed and any
subsequent use of the land or structure shall conform to the requirements of
these regulations.
      (6)   No structural changes shall be made in any structure occupied by a
nonconforming use except as follows:
         (a)   Those structural changes ordered by an authorized official in
order to insure the safety of the structure shall be permitted.
         (b)   Maintenance and repairs to keep a structure in sound condition
shall be permitted.
         (c)   Structural changes necessary to convert the nonconforming use to
a conforming use shall be permitted.
         (d)   An existing nonconforming residential structure may be enlarged
or altered provided that no additional dwelling units result therefrom. Any
such enlargement or alterations shall be in compliance with all yard
requirements of the district and/or use.
         (e)   The structure and its accompanying use may be moved to another
location on the lot so long as the structure meets all applicable requirements
of the district.
         (f)   Expansion of a nonconforming use of a building or structure into
portions of the structure that, at the time the use became nonconforming, were
already erected and arranged or designed for such nonconforming use is
permissible.
   (C)   Nonconforming structures.
      (1)   A nonconforming structure, devoted to a use permitted in the zoning
district in which it is located, may continue only in accordance with the
provisions of this section.
      (2)   Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the
continuation of a nonconforming structure.
      (3)   Any nonconforming structure may be enlarged if the expansion does
not increase the nonconformity.
      (4)   Structural changes necessary to convert the nonconforming use to a
conforming use shall be permitted.
      (5)   A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless it thereafter
conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (6)   A nonconforming structure, destroyed or damaged so that more than
40% of the value of such structure remains, may be repaired or restored if:
         (a)   A building permit for the repair or restoration is issued within
six months of the date of the damage and remains valid until the repairs or
restoration are complete.
         (b)   The structure conforms to the standards of the regulations for
the zoning district in which it is located; however, if the structure is used
for the same purpose as before the destruction, the new structure may be
rebuilt using the same materials.
         (c)   The total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use is not
increased and the degree of nonconformity in the structure is not increased.
      (7)   If the Zoning Administrator determines the building or structure
has been damaged to such an extent that the repair costs will exceed 60% of the
fair market value of the damaged building or structure immediately before the
damage was incurred, future use of the building and site shall conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located. However, any building or
structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or any building
certified as a state historic building may be rebuilt or restored to its
original dimensions or the dimensions of the building or structure before such
damage occurred, provided such restoration conforms to the Secretary of
Interior Standards for Rehabilitation. For the purposes of this section, the
extent of damage or destruction shall be determined by comparing the estimated
cost of repair or restoration with the current assessed tax value.
      (8)   A nonconforming structure shall not be replaced with another
nonconforming structure regardless of the degree of nonconformity.
      (9)   Nonconforming signs.
         (a)   Nonconforming signs, if present anywhere on the site, shall be
removed prior to issuance of a change of use permit, issuance of a grading
permit, or commencement of new construction on the site.
         (b)   Nonconforming signs shall be brought into compliance with the
requirements of this section whenever one or more of the following occurs:
            1.   The name of the business is changed;
            2.   The occupancy classification of the business is changed; or
            3.   The cost of renovation or repair of the building or sign
exceeds 50% of its replacement cost.
   (D)   Nonconforming feature. A nonconforming feature is a physical
characteristic that was lawfully established (or for which a vested right had
been established) before the effective date of this subchapter or a subsequent
amendment thereto, but does not conform to the applicable standards set forth
in divisions (C) or (E) of this section. Nonconforming features include, but
are not limited to physical characteristics of development that exceed
allowable maximum standards (e.g. impervious surface and height), and those
that lack or fall short of required minimum standards (e.g. sight triangle,
off-street parking and loading spaces buffer width and lighting standards).
Nonconforming features may be continued subject to the following limitations:
      (1)   No action shall be taken which increases the degree or extent of
the nonconforming feature. Any enlargement, extension, structural alteration,
parking changes, and other changes to lot design and access shall conform to
all current requirements of this subchapter.
      (2)   For development existing (or for which a vested right had been
established) before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, as amended,
nonconforming features created by a change in regulations may continue to
exist, and structures with such nonconforming features may be reconstructed if
demolished or destroyed.
   (E)   Additional requirement for nonconforming accessory uses and
structures. No nonconforming accessory use or accessory structure shall
continue after the principal use or structure is terminated by abandonment,
discontinuance, damage, or destruction unless such accessory use or accessory
structure thereafter is made to conform to the standards for the zoning
district in which it is located.
   (F)   Additional requirements for manufactured home parks.  
      (1)   Nonconforming manufactured home parks may not be expanded or
increased in size which shall include adding spaces to the park; and
      (2)   When a site at a nonconforming manufactured home park is vacated,
another manufactured home may not be placed on that site.
   (G)   Changes of tenancy and/or ownership. There may be a change in tenancy
or ownership of an existing nonconforming use or structure provided there is no
change in the nature or character of such nonconforming use or structure except
as provided herein and all other applicable requirements of this Zoning
Ordinance are met (e.g., parking, screening, landscaping, etc.).
   (H)   Additional requirements for hotels and motels. Notwithstanding any
provision of this Zoning Ordinance to the contrary, a nonconforming hotel or
motel use, lawfully existing and lawfully operating in all respects under law
prior to the effective date of this division, may continue to operate until
July 31,2024, in order to make a reasonable recoupment of its investment in its
current location. On or before August 1, 2024, the use will no longer be
recognized as a lawful nonconforming use and must conform to the requirements
of this Zoning Ordinance.

permitted within the zoning district where the property in question is located
shall not be granted.
            3.   The fact that property may be used more profitably will not be

detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the
district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance.
         (d)   The Board, in granting a variance, may prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards in conformity with this Zoning Ordinance. Violation
of such conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under which a
variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this Zoning Ordinance.

            2.   Whether the proposed reclassification is consistent with the
overall character of existing development in the immediate vicinity of the
subject property.

serve the subject property, including but not limited to roadways, parks and
recreational facilities, police and fire protection, hospitals and medical

change the existing classification of the property, or any part of the property
covered by the petition, to the classification requested or to any other
classification or classifications permitted by this Zoning Ordinance.
         (g)   The Council may modify any proposed text amendment upon adoption
of an ordinance enacting the amendment, without the withdrawal or modification
of the petition or further public hearings, when, in the opinion of the
Council, such a change is not material so as to require a separate public
hearing.
      (10)   Effect of the denial of a petition.
         (a)   A petition for the reclassification of property that has been
denied in whole or in part shall not be re-submitted within one year of the

classification of an adjacent property.
            2.   The Council has adopted a new or amended plan for the area
that changes public policy regarding how the property affected by the amendment
should be developed.
            3.   Construction or expansion of a road, water line, sewer line,
or other infrastructure has occurred or is to occur in such a time frame as to
serve the property and comfortably accommodate the intensity of development
allowed under the proposed classification.
            4.   There has been a substantial change in conditions or
circumstances, outside the control of the petitioner, which justifies waiver of
the one-year restriction on a new petition. This shall not include a change in
the ownership of the subject property nor, in the case of a petition for
reclassification to a conditional or overlay district, a change in the scale or
features of the development proposed in the prior petition.

NOMINATIONS OF HISTORIC PLACES
§ 158.075 NOMINATIONS TO NATIONAL REGISTER OF HISTORIC PLACES.
   The Commission may recommend the nomination of buildings, structures, sites,
objects or districts to the State Review Board for listing on the National
Register of Historic Places after securing owner’s permission. When considering
whether a building, structure, site, object or district should be nominated,
the Commission should apply the following National Register criteria:
   (A)   The quality of significance in American history, architecture,
archeology, engineering and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings,
structures and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting,
materials, workmanship, feeling and association, and:
      (1)   That are associated with events that have made a significant
contribution to the broad patterns of our history;
      (2)   That are associated with the lives of persons significant in our
past;
      (3)   That embody the distinctive characteristics of a type, period or
method of construction, or that represent the work of a master, or that possess
high artistic values, or that represent a significant and distinguishable
entity whose components may lack individual distinction; or
      (4)   That have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important
in prehistory or history.
   (B)   The Commission shall conduct first review and evaluation of all
proposed National Register nominations within its jurisdiction, including any
which may have been submitted to the State Historic Preservation Office,
hereinafter SHPO, and shall forward all reviewed nominations to the SHPO with
recommendations for consideration by the State Board of Review. The Commission
shall not have the authority to nominate properties directly to the National
Register. Nomination for National Register status shall not be made to SHPO by
the Commission without the property owner’s permission.

§ 158.101 SUBSTANTIAL HARDSHIP.
   In the event an application for a certificate of appropriateness is denied,
the property owner may apply for an exception based on the substantial hardship
of maintaining the property according to the Commission’s guidelines.
Substantial hardship is to be considered by the Commission where there are
unusual and compelling circumstances as defined by:
   (A)   The property has little or no historic value;
   (B)   The property cannot be reasonably maintained in the manner dictated by
this chapter;
   (C)   There is no other reasonable means of saving the property from
deterioration or collapse; or

is the subject of the application is not financially or physically feasible in
order for the nonprofit organization to achieve its charitable purposes.

§ 158.102 INTENT.
   It is the intent of this chapter to ensure, insofar as possible, that
historic properties shall be in harmony with the architectural and historical
character of the city. In granting a certificate of appropriateness, the
Commission shall take into account the architectural and/or historical
significance of the structure under consideration and the exterior form and
appearance of any proposed additions or modifications to that structure as they
may be viewed from any public street, road or right-of-way as well as the
effect of such change or additions upon other structures in the vicinity.

§ 158.103 DEMOLITION.
   (A)   No Camden historic property shall be demolished or otherwise relocated
until the owner thereof has received a certificate of appropriateness from the
Commission. The Commission may postpone the granting of the certificate of
appropriateness for demolition for a period of up to 90 days from the time of
the filing of the application with the designated city official. The Commission
may extend this postponement for certificate of appropriateness with regard to
a request to demolish a structure for another 30 days after if the structure is
designated as a Camden historic landmark.
   (B)   Within the period of postponement of such demolition of any building,
the Commission shall take steps to ascertain what can be done to preserve such
buildings. Such steps shall include, but will not be limited to, consultation
with civic groups, interested citizens, and public boards and agencies.
   (C)   After the postponement period has elapsed and the Commission has been
unable to determine an adequate alternative to demolition, the certificate of
appropriateness shall be granted.
   (D)   If the Commission finds that a building proposed for demolition is of
no particular historical significance or value toward maintaining the
historical character of the city, it may issue the certificate of
appropriateness in the normal manner.

§ 158.104 NEW CONSTRUCTION, ALTERATION, REPAIR AND RESTORATION.
   When considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness for new
construction, alteration, repair, or restoration, the Commission shall use the
Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation together with the city
design guidelines described in §
158.105 hereof, as guidelines in making its decisions. These guidelines are to
serve as the basis for determining the approval, approval with modifications,
or denial for a certificate of appropriateness for new construction,
alterations or repair/restoration. These guidelines include:
   (A)   When replacing severely damaged or deteriorated historic materials and
features, the preferred treatment is always replacement in kind. A substitute
material should only be considered, however, if the form, detailing, and
overall appearance of the substitute material conveys the visual appearance of
the historic material, and the application of the substitute material does not
damage, destroy or obscure historic features.
   (B)   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for
a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its original intended
purpose.
   (C)   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterizes a building, structure or site shall be treated with
sensitivity.
   (D)   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or
alteration of any historical material or distinctive architectural features
should be avoided when possible.
   (E)   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and which seek to
create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
   (F)   Changes which have taken place in the course of time are evidence of
the history development of a building, structure, or site and its environment.
These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this
significance shall be recognized and respected.
   (G)   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match, whenever possible, the material being replaced in
composition, design, color, texture, and other visible qualities. Repair or
replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate
duplications of features, substantiated by history, physical or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
architectural elements from other buildings.
   (H)   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be allowed, unless substantial
hardship is shown pursuant to §
158.102 .
   (I)   Every reasonable effort should be made to protect and preserve
archeological resources affected by, or adjacent to the property as deemed by
the guidelines of the South Carolina Institute of Archeology and Anthropology.
   (J)   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the
property, neighborhood, or environment.
   (K)   Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be
done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed
in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be
unimpaired.

peril to life and property. In such case, proceedings may not be stayed except
by a restraining order which may be granted by the Commission or by a court of
record on application, upon notice to the Building Official, and on due cause
shown.
      (3)   The Commission shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of an
appeal or other matter referred to it, and give public notice of the hearing,
as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the appeal or
other matter within a reasonable time. At the hearing, any party may appear in

is established in a conditionally approved Site Specific Development Plan. When
a Site Specific Development Plan is conditionally approved, a vested right
shall only be established when approved by the Planning Commission and
authorized in writing by such body.
   (C)   The Planning Commission shall not approve the establishment of a
vested right in an approved Phased Development Plan but may approve and
establish a vested right in any phase of a Phased Development Plan which
conforms to, complies with and satisfies all state statutes and local codes and
ordinances including, but not limited to, planning, zoning, subdivisions,
stormwater management and control, building, fire, water and sewer, road and

Specific Development Plan shall be required for approval with respect to each
phase in an approved Phased Development Plan for which a vested right is
requested.
   (D)   No vested right in a Site Specific Development Plan shall attach or be
established until plan applications and required documents have been received,
all required approvals have been given or granted, and all fees have been paid
in accordance with the procedures outlined in this code of ordinances. No
vested right attaches or is established until a final decision has been
rendered favorable to the applicant on all administrative appeals.
   (E)   A vested right established in accordance with the provisions of this
subchapter shall be vested upon approval by the Planning Commission of the Site
Specific Development Plan or specific phase of a Phased Development Plan that
authorizes the developer or landowner to proceed with investment in grading,
installation of utilities, streets and other infrastructure and to undertake
other specific expenditures necessary to prepare for application for a building
permit. No developer or landowner shall proceed with investment in grading,
installation of utilities, streets or other infrastructure, or shall undertake
other significant expenditures necessary to prepare for application for a
building permit before a Site Specific Development Plan or Phased Development
Plan or phase thereof authorizing the improvements and expenditures has been
approved by the Planning Commission. No investment in grading, installation of
utilities, streets or other infrastructure, or other significant expenditures
shall give rise to or establish a vested right until the Planning Commission
has approved the Site Specific Development Plan, preliminary plat, or Phased
Development Plan or a phase thereof that authorizes the developer or landowner
to proceed with improvements or undertake other significant expenditures on the
real property which is proposed for development.
   (F)   A Site Specific Development Plan or Phased Development Plan for which
a variance, regulation, or special exception is necessary does not confer a
vested right until the variance, regulation, or special, exception is obtained.
(Ord. 13-008, passed 3-12-13)
§ 160.04 TERM; CONDITIONS; EXTENSIONS; CHANGES.
   (A)   Term. A right, which has been vested by the city, shall remain vested
for a period of two years from the date of approval. Modifications or
amendments to an approved plan do not extend the period of vesting unless
specifically so provided by the Planning Commission when it approves the
modification or amendment. A vested right obtained under this chapter is not a
personal right, but shall attach to and run with the subject property.
   (B)   Conditions. The Planning Commission may attach any reasonable and
appropriate conditions to the approval of a Site Specific Development Plan or
Phased Development Plan and may require that the conditions be met in order for
a vested right to be granted. However, the Planning Commission shall not
condition plan approval on a landowner waiving his or her vested rights.
   (C)   Revocation. A vested right may be revoked by the Planning Commission
upon its determination, after notice and public hearing, that there was a
material misrepresentation by the landowner or substantial noncompliance with
the terms and conditions of the original or amended approval.
   (D)   Termination by expiration. A right which has been vested under the
provisions of this chapter shall terminate at the end of the applicable vesting
period unless an application for an extension is made in accordance with §
160.04(E) below.
   (E)   Extensions. The landowner of real property with a vested right may
apply in writing before the end of the vesting period to the Planning
Commission for an annual one-year extension of the vested right. The Planning
Commission shall approve applications for up to five annual extensions of the
vested right if a timely and proper application has been filed with the
Planning Commission. If no timely and proper written application is made by the

§ 160.05 DECLARATION OF A VESTED RIGHT UPON ANNEXATION.
   A petition for annexation filed with the city shall contain a signed
statement declaring whether or not any zoning vested right with respect to the
properties subject to the petition has been established. A statement that
declares that no zoning vested right has been established pursuant to the
Vested Rights Act, or the failure to sign a statement declaring whether or not
a zoning vested right has been established, shall be binding on the landowner
and any zoning vested right, which may have existed, shall be terminated. If a
vested right is declared, the City Council shall determine, after notice and
public hearing in which the landowner is allowed to present evidence, if the
vested right is effective after the annexation.

§ 160.06 LIMITATION OF A VESTED RIGHT.
   (A)   Plan amendments. A vested plan may be amended if approved by the
Planning Commission pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. However, the
extent to which the amended plan is vested hereunder is subject to a decision
by the Planning Commission as to whether or not the original period of vesting
is extended and for how long, or the vested right term is begun anew.
   (B)   Zoning ordinance amendments. If the City Council later approves
overlay zoning that imposes site plan-related requirements on property covered
by a vested right, undeveloped portions of the property shall be required to
meet the new requirements to the extent that the changes does not affect
allowable types, height as it affects density or intensity of uses, or density
or intensity of uses as approved through the plan. A change in the zoning
district designation or land-use regulations made subsequent to vesting that
affect real property does not operate to affect, prevent, or delay development
of the real property under a vested Site Specific Development Plan or vested
Phased Development Plan without consent of the landowner.
   (C)   Other changes in law. A vested Site Specific Development Plan or
vested Phased Development Plan is subject to later enacted federal, state, or
local laws adopted to protect public health, safety, and welfare including, but
not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes and
nonconforming structure and use regulations which do not provide for the
grandfathering of the vested right. The issuance of a building permit vests the
specific construction project authorized by the building permit to the
building, fire, plumbing, electrical, and mechanical codes in force at the time
of the issuance of the building permit.
