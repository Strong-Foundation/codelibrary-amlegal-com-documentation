§ 34.046 LOCAL VENDOR PARTNERSHIP PROCUREMENT.
   Procurement of goods and non-professional services shall be solicited from
local vendors who avail themselves to the terms and conditions of the vendor
partnership program, which shall be conducted as follows.
   (A)   Local preference shall be given to those vendors who enter into a
partnership agreement with the town. To be eligible to execute the partnership
agreement, the vendor must have a principal place of business located within
the corporate limits of the town as registered in official documents filed with
the Secretary of State, the Internal Revenue Service or State Tax Commission. A
post office box or temporary construction or office trailer shall not be
considered a place of business to comply with the provisions of this
subchapter. Also, the local vendor must have a current town business license
and be in compliance with other local ordinance requirements.
   (B)   Local vendors must agree to and comply with the following provisions:
      (1)   Sell to the town the best product or service for the best price
available;
      (2)   Respond to the town’s needs in a timely fashion;
      (3)   Provide future maintenance and service; and
      (4)   Must agree to allow the town to audit the vendor’s records relating
to the town’s purchases at any time the town requests, in order to ensure that
the town is receiving the best product or service for the best price.
   (C)   Once the vendor has executed and has filed the partnership agreement
with the town, the town and its designated representatives shall solicit bids
or proposals for products or non-professional services, which shall be
evaluated on a percentage reduction basis. In evaluating the price of eligible
local vendor’s bids or proposals, the bids or proposals shall be evaluated as
though the prices proposed by local bidders were either 5%, 2% or 1% lower than
actually proposed in accordance with the following schedule:
      (1)   If the local bidder submits bids or proposals for products or non-
professional services costing less than $10,000, the business or individual
shall be evaluated on a 5% reduction basis;
      (2)   For products or services costing $10,000 or more, but less than
$50,000, the evaluation shall be based on a 2% reduction basis; and
      (3)   For products or services costing $50,000 or more, the evaluation
shall be based on a 1% reduction basis but will not exceed a total reduction of
more than $2,000.
   (D)   In the event of a tie bid, ties between one local vendor and one or
more non-local vendors meeting specifications, the bid shall be in favor of the
local vendor. Ties between two or more local vendors meeting specifications
will be broken through a coin toss method until the winner remains. However,
the local preference stated herein shall not apply if all vendors, bidders or
proposers are local, eligible, partnership vendors.
   (E)   For purposes of this section, non-professional services are
construction or renovation of facilities, janitorial services, general
maintenance including fleet management, landscaping and lawn or tree services,
tractor services, printing services, travel services, food services,
recreational services, training assistance and temporary job placement
services. Further decisions regarding the classification of items or services
as professional or non-professional shall be determined by the Mayor.
   (F)   Nothing herein shall be construed as increasing or decreasing the
actual price of a bid or proposal and the resulting contract in accordance with
their terms and conditions; this section is intended only to be used for the
purposes of comparing and evaluating bids and proposals for products and
services. Nothing within this section shall be construed to create any private
rights, claims or cause of actions on behalf of any person, including, but not
limited to, bidders, proposers and contractors.
   (G)   Should it be determined that any portion of this section is in
conflict with any federal and state laws, regulations or provisions, then that
portion of this section shall be invalid but shall not affect the remaining
portions of this section.
   (H)   The requirements of this section may be waived by Town Council upon a
formal finding that the best interest of the town would not be served by
adhering to the provisions as stated in this section.
   (I)   This section shall not apply in emergency, sensitive or critical
procurement situations.
   (J)   The town reserves the right to specify brand names based on its
experience, current inventory and other qualifications specified by the user
department.
   (K)   A principal place of business must be either owned or rented real
property used for business purposes.

of the contracts and based upon past record of performance for similar
contracts.

description of the physical quality or functional characteristics, or of the
nature of a supply, service or construction item. It may also include a
description of any requirements for inspecting, testing or preparing a supply,
service or construction item for delivery.
   (B)   Responsibility. It shall be the primary responsibility of the Bid and
Purchases Committee to furnish adequate specifications.
   (C)   Adequate specifications. Specifications should be adequately detailed,
precise, clear but simply worded, not unduly restrictive to permit competitive

   (D)   Changes in specifications.
      (1)   No changes in specifications shall be made to an invitation or any
solicitation unless all prospective offers shall be notified of any changes. In
the case of formal invitations, the changes in specifications shall be
accomplished by written addenda and delivered to all offerors known to have
received an invitation. In the case of informal solicitations, this may be
accomplished by telephone, verbally, by fax transmission or in writing,
depending on the complexity of the change. Whichever method is used, the
changes must be clear and precise assuring no misunderstanding by any offerer.
These changes shall be made available to all prospective offerors.
      (2)   Should it be determined after all bids, proposals or solicitations
have been received and reviewed, that a product or service with an alternate
specification would prove to better serve the town’s needs and best interest,
all such bids, proposals or solicitations may be rejected at the discretion of
the Bids and Purchases Committee.

was supplied by the person bringing suit. The obligee named in the bond need
not be joined as a party in any such suit.

contractor, who shall, within ten days of its receipt, release to the
subcontractor responsible for the completed work the full amount of any
retention previously withheld from that subcontractor by the prime contractor.

   Every person engaged or intending to engage in any business, calling,
occupation, profession or activity engaged in with the object of gain, benefit
or advantage, in whole or in part within the limits of the town, is required to
pay an annual license tax for the privilege of doing business and obtain a
business license as herein provided.
(Ord. passed 10-11-2021)
§ 110.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BUSINESS. Any business, calling, occupation, profession or activity engaged
in with the object of gain, benefit or advantage, either directly or
indirectly.
   CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION. An organization that is determined by the Internal
Revenue Service to be exempt from federal income taxes under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)
(3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (10) or (19).
   CHARITABLE PURPOSE. A benevolent, philanthropic, patriotic or eleemosynary
purpose that does not result in personal gain to a sponsor, organizer, officer,
director, trustee or person with ultimate control of the organization.
   CLASSIFICATION. The division of businesses by NAICS codes subject to the
same license rate as determined by a calculated index of ability to pay based
on national averages, benefits, equalization of tax burden, relationships of
services or other basis deemed appropriate by the Council.
   DOMICILE. A principal place from which the trade or business of a licensee
is conducted, directed or managed. For purposes of this chapter, a licensee may
be deemed to have more than one DOMICILE.
   GROSS INCOME. The gross receipts or gross revenue of a business, received or
accrued, for one calendar or fiscal year collected or to be collected from
business done within the town. If the licensee has a domicile within the town,
business done within the town shall include all gross receipts or revenue
received or accrued by such licensee. If the licensee does not have a domicile
within the town, business done within the town shall include only gross
receipts or revenue received or accrued within the town. In all cases, if the
licensee pays a business license tax to another county or municipality, then
the licensee’s GROSS INCOME for the purpose of computing the tax within the
town must be reduced by the amount of revenues or receipts taxed in the other
county or municipality and fully reported to the town. GROSS INCOME for
business license tax purposes shall not include taxes collected for a
governmental entity, escrow funds or funds that are the property of a third
party. The value of bartered goods or trade-in merchandise shall be included in
GROSS INCOME. The gross receipts or gross revenues for business license
purposes may be verified by inspection of returns and reports filed with the
Internal Revenue Service, the State Department of Revenue, the State Department
of Insurance or other government agencies. In calculating GROSS INCOME for
certain businesses, the following rules shall apply.
      (1)   GROSS INCOME for agents shall be calculated on gross commissions
received or retained, unless otherwise specified. If commissions are divided
with other brokers or agents, then only the amount retained by the broker or
agent is considered GROSS INCOME.
      (2)   Except as specifically required by S.C. Code § 38-7-20, GROSS
INCOME for insurance companies shall be calculated on gross premiums written.
      (3)   GROSS INCOME for manufacturers of goods or materials with a
location in the town shall be calculated on the lesser of gross revenues or
receipts received or accrued from business done at the location; the amount of
income allocated and apportioned to that location by the business for purposes
of the business’ state income tax return; or the amount of expenses
attributable to the location as a cost center of the business. Licensees
reporting GROSS INCOME under this provision shall have the burden to establish
the amount and method of calculation by satisfactory records and proof.
Manufacturers include those taxpayers reporting a manufacturing principal
business activity code on their federal income tax returns.
   LICENSE OFFICIAL. A person designated to administer this chapter.
Notwithstanding the designation of a primary LICENSE OFFICIAL, the town may
designate one or more alternate LICENSE OFFICIALS to administer particular
types of business licenses, including without limitation for business licenses
issued to businesses subject to business license taxes under S.C. Code Title
58, Chapter 9, Article 20 and Title 38, Chapters 7 and 45.

the absence of the principal.
(Ord. passed 10-11-2021)
§ 110.03 PURPOSE AND DURATION.
   The business license required by this chapter is for the purpose of
providing such regulation as may be required for the business subject thereto
and for the purpose of raising revenue for the General Fund through a privilege
tax. The 2021 license year shall extend to end on April 30, 2022. Thereafter,
the license periods shall be established as follows. Except as set forth below
for business licenses issued to contractors with respect to specific
construction projects, each yearly license shall be issued for the 12-month
period of May 1 to April 30. A business license issued for a construction
contract may, at the request of the licensee, be stated to expire at the
completion of the construction project; provided, any such business license may
require that the licensee file, by each April 30 during the continuation of the
construction project, a statement of compliance, including, but not limited to,
a revised estimate of the value of the contract. If any revised estimate of the
final value of such project exceeds the amount for which the business license
was issued, the licensee shall be required to pay a license fee at the then-
prevailing rate on the excess amount. The provisions of this chapter and the
rates herein shall remain in effect from year to year as amended by the
Council.
(Ord. passed 10-11-2021)
§ 110.04 BUSINESS LICENSE TAX; REFUND.
   (A)   The required business license tax shall be paid for each business
subject hereto according to the applicable rate classification on or before the
due date of April 30 in each year, except for those businesses in Rate Class 8
for which a different due date is specified. Late payments shall be subject to
penalties as set forth in §
110.12, except that admitted insurance companies may pay before June 1 without
penalty.
   (B)   A separate license shall be required for each place of business and
for each classification or business conducted at one place. If gross income
cannot be separated for classifications at one location, the business license
tax shall be computed on the combined gross income for the classification
requiring the highest rate. The business license tax must be computed based on
the licensee’s gross income for the calendar year preceding the due date, for
the licensee’s 12-month fiscal year preceding the due date or on a 12-month
projected income based on the monthly average for a business in operation for
less than one year. The business license tax for a new business must be
computed on the estimated probable gross income for the balance of the license
year. A business license related to construction contract projects may be
issued on a per project basis, at the option of the taxpayer. No refund shall
be made for a business that is discontinued.
   (C)   A licensee that submits a payment greater than the amount owed may
request a refund. To be considered, a refund request must be submitted in
writing to the town before June 1 immediately following the April 30 on which
the payment was due and must be supported by adequate documentation supporting
the refund request. The town shall approve or deny the refund request, and if
approved, shall issue the refund to the business, within 30 days after receipt
of the request.
(Ord. passed 10-11-2021)
§ 110.05 REGISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   The owner, agent or legal representative of every business subject to
this chapter, whether listed in the classification index or not, shall register
the business and make application for a business license on or before the due
date of each year; provided, a new business shall be required to have a
business license prior to operation within the town, and an annexed business
shall be required to have a business license within 30 days of the annexation.
A license for a bar (NAICS 722410) must be issued in the name of the individual
who has been issued the corresponding state alcohol, beer or wine permit or
license and will have actual control and management of the business.
   (B)   Application shall be on the then-current standard business license
application as established and provided by the Director of the State Revenue
and Fiscal Affairs Office and shall be accompanied by all information about the
applicant, the licensee and the business deemed appropriate to carry out the
purpose of this chapter by the license official. Applicants may be required to
submit copies of portions of state and federal income tax returns reflecting
gross receipts and gross revenue figures.
   (C)   The applicant shall certify under oath that the information given in
the application is true, that the gross income is accurately reported (or
estimated for a new business) without any unauthorized deductions and that all
assessments, personal property taxes on business property and other monies due
and payable to the town have been paid.
   (D)   The town shall allow application, reporting, calculation and payment
of business license taxes through the business license tax portal hosted and
managed by the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, subject to the
availability and capability thereof. Any limitations in portal availability or
capability do not relieve the applicant or licensee from existing business
license or business license tax obligations.
(Ord. passed 10-11-2021)
§ 110.06 DEDUCTIONS, EXEMPTIONS AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS.
   (A)   No deductions from gross income shall be made except income earned
outside of the town on which a license tax is paid by the business to some
other municipality or county and fully reported to the town, taxes collected
for a governmental entity or income which cannot be included for computation of
the tax pursuant to state or federal law. Properly apportioned income from
business in interstate commerce shall be included in the calculation of gross
income and is not exempted. The applicant shall have the burden to establish
the right to exempt income by satisfactory records and proof.
   (B)   No person shall be exempt from the requirements of this chapter by
reason of the lack of an established place of business within the town, unless
exempted by state or federal law. The license official shall determine the
appropriate classification for each business in accordance with the latest
issue of NAICS. No person shall be exempt from this chapter by reason of the
payment of any other tax, unless exempted by state law, and no person shall be
relieved of liability for payment of any other tax or fee by reason of
application of this chapter.
   (C)   Wholesalers are exempt from business license taxes unless they
maintain warehouses or distribution establishments within the town. A wholesale
transaction involves a sale to an individual who will resell the goods and
includes delivery of the goods to the reseller. It does not include a sale of
goods to a user or consumer.
   (D)   A charitable organization shall be exempt from the business license
tax on its gross income unless it is deemed a business subject to a business
license tax on all or part of its gross income as provided in this section. A
charitable organization, or any affiliate of a charitable organization, that
reports income from for-profit activities or unrelated business income for
federal income tax purposes to the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed a
business subject to a business license tax on the part of its gross income from
such for-profit activities or unrelated business income.
   (E)   A charitable organization shall be deemed a business subject to a
business license tax on its total gross income if any net proceeds of
operation, after necessary expenses of operation, inure to the benefit of any
individual or any entity that is not itself a charitable organization as
defined in this chapter; or any net proceeds of operation, after necessary
expenses of operation, are used for a purpose other than a charitable purpose
as defined in this chapter. Excess benefits or compensation in any form beyond
fair market value to a sponsor, organizer, officer, director, trustee or person
with ultimate control of the organization shall not be deemed a necessary
expense of operation.
(Ord. passed 10-11-2021)
§ 110.07 FALSE APPLICATION UNLAWFUL.
   It shall be unlawful for any person subject to the provisions of this
chapter to make a false application for a business license or to give or file,
or direct the giving or filing of, any false information with respect to the
license or tax required by this chapter.
(Ord. passed 10-11-2021) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.08 DISPLAY AND TRANSFER.
   (A)   All persons shall display the license issued to them on the original
form provided by the license official in a conspicuous place in the business
establishment at the address shown on the license. A transient or nonresident
shall carry the license upon his or her person or in a vehicle used in the
business readily available for inspection by any authorized agent of the town.
   (B)   A change of address must be reported to the license official within
ten days after removal of the business to a new location and the license will
be valid at the new address upon written notification by the license official
and compliance with Zoning and Building Codes. Failure to obtain the approval
of the license official for a change of address shall invalidate the license
and subject the licensee to prosecution for doing business without a license. A
business license shall not be transferable, and a transfer of controlling
interest shall be considered a termination of the old business and the
establishment of a new business requiring a new business license, based on old
business income.
(Ord. passed 10-11-2021)
§ 110.09 ADMINISTRATION OF CHAPTER.
   The license official shall administer the provisions of this chapter,
collect business license taxes, issue licenses, make or initiate investigations
and audits to ensure compliance, initiate denial or suspension and revocation
procedures, report violations to the municipal attorney, assist in prosecution
of violators, produce forms, undertake reasonable procedures relating to the
administration of this chapter and perform such other duties as may be duly
assigned.
(Ord. passed 10-11-2021)
§ 110.10 INSPECTION AND AUDITS.
   (A)   For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, the
license official or other authorized agent of the town is empowered to enter
upon the premises of any person subject to this chapter to make inspections and
to examine and audit books and records. It shall be unlawful for any such
person to fail or refuse to make available the necessary books and records. In
the event an audit or inspection reveals that the licensee has filed false
information, the costs of the audit shall be added to the correct business
license tax and late penalties in addition to other penalties provided herein.
Each day of failure to pay the proper amount of business license tax shall

business license tax remains unpaid for 60 days after its due date, the license
official shall report it to the municipal attorney for appropriate legal
action.

Class 8 Rates
   Each NAICS number designates a separate subclassification. The businesses in
this section are treated as separate and individual subclasses due to
provisions of state law, regulatory requirements, service burdens, tax
equalization considerations and other factors that are deemed sufficient to
require individually determined rates. In accordance with state law, the town
also may provide for reasonable subclassifications for rates, described by an
NAICS sector, subsector or industry, that are based on particularized
considerations as needed for economic stimulus or for the enhanced or
disproportionate demands on municipal services or infrastructure.
   Nonresident rates do not apply except where indicated.
8.1   NAICS 230000 - Contractors, Construction, All Types [nonresident rates
apply].
   Resident rates, for contractors having a permanent place of business within

business within the town. A trailer at the construction site or structure in
which the contractor temporarily resides is not a permanent place of business
under this chapter.

municipal qualification examination and trade license requirements have been
met. Each contractor shall post a sign in plain view on each job identifying
the contractor with the job.

contractors for the same job. No deductions shall be made by a general or prime

indemnity bonds required by the Building Code have been filed and approved.
Zoning permits must be obtained when required by the Zoning Ordinance.
   Each prime contractor shall file with the license official a list of

the contract shall be paid prior to commencement of work and shall entitle the
contractor to complete the job without regard to the normal license expiration
date. An amended report shall be filed for each new job and the appropriate
additional license fee per $1,000 of the contract amount shall be paid prior to
commencement of new work. Only one base tax shall be paid in a license year.
Licensees holding a per-job license shall file, by each April 30 during the
continuation of the construction project, a statement of compliance, including,
but not limited to, a revised estimate of the value of the contract. If any
revised estimate of the final value of such project exceeds the amount for
which the business license was issued, the licensee shall be required to pay a
license fee at the then-prevailing rate on the excess amount.

under the uniform system as provided in this subchapter.
   (B)   Such numbers shall be placed on existing buildings on or before the
effective date of this subchapter, and within 20 days after the assigning of
the proper number in the case of numbers assigned after the effective date of
this subchapter. The cost of the numbers shall be paid for the property owner.

   (C)   Whenever any house, building or structure shall be erected or located
in the county after the establishment of the uniform system of numbering
provided for herein has been completed, in order to preserve the continuity and

§ 153.011 NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Continuation of nonconforming use of land. The lawful use of land
existing at the time of adoption of this chapter, or of an amendment thereto,
although such use does not conform to the provisions thereof, may be continued;
but if such nonconforming use is discontinued, as evidenced by lack of use for
a period of at least one year or for 18 accumulative months during any three-
year period, or by substitution of a conforming use, any future use of said
land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Continuation of nonconforming use of structure. The lawful use of a
structure, existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter, or of an
amendment thereto, although such use does not conform to the provisions hereof,
may be continued and except for nonconforming signs, such use may be extended
throughout the structure; provided that no structural alterations are made,
other than those necessary to assure the safety of the structure; and provided,
further, that such extension does not displace a conforming use in a district
established by this chapter.
   (C)   Changing of a nonconforming use.
      (1)   A nonconforming use of a structure or lot may not be changed to
another nonconforming use except upon a finding of the Board of Zoning Appeals
that such other nonconforming use is likely to be less detrimental to adjacent
property in the same district than in the nonconforming use from which
permission to change is sought. Such finding shall not be made except upon
appeal. Such changed nonconforming use shall be subject to all the provisions
of this chapter.
      (2)   Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure has been changed to a
conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed back to a
nonconforming use.
      (3)   Existing nonconforming uses which become conforming through a
change in land classification shall be required to meet all off-street parking,
loading and screening as applicable to that district.
      (4)   When a conforming use becomes nonconforming through a change in
land classification submitted by the applicant, the nonconforming use shall
then be removed prior to the commencement of the conforming use.
   (D)   Nonconforming use not to be re-established. Whenever a nonconforming
use of a structure, or portion thereof, has been discontinued, as evidenced by
the lack of use, or vacancy for a period of at least one year, or for 18
accumulative months during any three-year period, or by substituting a
conforming use, such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be re-established
and the future use shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
   (E)   Extension of nonconforming structures. A nonconforming structure may
be occupied and maintained in a state of good repair. It shall not be expanded
unless it is nonconforming due to setbacks. In this case, it may be expanded
provided the addition complies with all provisions (including setbacks) of this
chapter.
   (F)   Extensions of nonconforming uses of land or activity. No nonconforming
use of land or activity thereon shall be extended or enlarged unless the
existing legal nonconforming use, when combined with the proposed extension,
will result in a conforming use in compliance with all requirements of the
zoning district in which it is located.
   (G)   Building permit issued. If, before the effective date of this chapter,
or amendment thereof, a building permit was lawfully issued for a structure not
in conformity to this chapter, or such amendment, the construction authorized
by such permit may not be started after such date.
   (H)   Uses nonconforming by virtue of performance standards. No uses which
are nonconforming by virtue of noncompliance with the applicable performance
standards of this chapter or as a result of a subsequent amendment thereto,
shall be changed or modified in such a way as to increase the degree of
noncompliance with said standards, and all additions to and expansions of such
use shall comply with said standards.
   (I)   Restoration and rebuilding.
      (1)   No building or structure utilized for residential use that is
damaged by fire or other causes shall be repaired or rebuilt if the cost of
repair is greater than 50% of its total physical replacement cost (which shall
consist of labor and materials only). Determination of physical replacement
costs shall be made by the County Director of Building Services or his or her
designee. Where such repairs are allowed to be made, they shall be in
conformity with all the regulations of this chapter.
      (2)   Where cost of repair is less than 50% of the total physical
replacement cost of a structure, repairs or rebuilding may occur within the
pre-existing structure boundaries (footprint and height); providing said
repairs and/or rebuilding do not increase in any fashion or to any extent the
previous
nonconforming status of the legal nonconforming structure.
   (J)   Nonconforming approved lots of record. If two or more lots or
combinations of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single
ownership are approved lots of record at the time of passage or amendment of
this chapter, and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements for
lot width and/or area as established by this chapter, the lands involved shall
be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this chapter, and no
portion of said parcel shall be used or sold which does not meet lot width and
area requirements established by this chapter, nor shall any division of the
parcel be made which leaves remaining any lot with width or area below the
requirements of this chapter.

PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ZONING DISTRICT PROVISIONS
§ 153.045 STATEMENT OF INTENT.
   Planned developments (PDs) are developments having a mix of uses that are
planned and developed under unified control and following more flexible
standards and procedures to achieve innovative site design, improved
appearance, greater compatibility of uses, increased preservation of natural
and scenic features, improved service by community facilities, better
functioning of vehicular access and circulation and otherwise higher quality
development than could be achieved through base zoning district regulations.
The purpose of this subchapter is to provide a uniform mechanism for amending
the official zoning map to establish any of the planned development zoning
districts established by this subchapter. The town wants to use these
sparingly.
   (A)   Support a higher quality of life and achieve a higher quality of
development, environmental sensitivity, energy efficiency and provision of
public services;
   (B)   Reduce the inflexibility of zoning district standards that sometimes
results from the strict application of the base district regulations and
development standards established in this subchapter;
   (C)   To achieve the objectives of the Comprehensive Plan by allowing
flexibility in development that will exhibit innovative site planning for a
mixture of residential, commercial and institutional uses as reflected in the
planned development map, which becomes the zoning district map for the
property;
   (D)   Allow greater freedom and flexibility in selecting:
      (1)   The form and design of development;
      (2)   The ways by which pedestrians, cyclists and vehicular traffic
circulate;
      (3)   How the development will be located and designed to respect the
natural features of the land and protect the environment;
      (4)   How to design amenities to be applied; and
      (5)   The location and integration of open space and civic space into the
development.
   (E)   Preserve natural and scenic features;
   (F)   Encourage a greater mix of land uses within the same development,
including a mix of nonresidential development, residential development, lot
sizes and densities and intensities;
   (G)   Allow more efficient use of land, with smaller networks of streets and
utilities;
   (H)   Provide pedestrian connections within the site and to the public
right-of-way;
   (I)   Encourage the provision of centrally-located open space amenities on
the site;
   (J)   Promote development forms and patterns that respect the character of
established surrounding neighborhoods and/or other types of land uses, and
promote development form that respects and takes advantage of a site’s natural
and human-made features, such as roadways, parks, ponds, wetlands, floodplains,
trees and historic resources; and
   (K)   Promote better site design principles to conserve natural areas,
including preservation of tree canopy, reduced use of impervious surfaces and
better managed urban runoff into the Intercoastal Waterway.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000; Ord. 23-05, passed 6-1-2023)
§ 153.046 APPLICABILITY.
   The procedures and standards in this section apply to the review of
applications to amend the official zoning map to establish a planned
development (PD) zoning district. A PD district is established by an amendment
to the official zoning map to PD zoning district that is defined by a PD plan
and a development agreement. Once the PD is approved, the applicant must
receive approval for any site plans or subdivisions before development to
ensure substantial compliance with the approved PD plan.
   (A)   Administrative procedures.
      (1)   Any request about the establishment of a planned development (PD)
zoning district or changes to an existing PD district shall be considered an
amendment to the Zoning Ordinance and be administered and processed accordingly
per the provisions of this subchapter.
      (2)   All data about the PD shall be submitted to the Planning Commission
for review, public hearing and recommendation, then forwarded to Town Council
for final action. If approved by the Council, all information about the
proposal shall be adopted as an amendment to the Zoning Ordinance, as the
standards of development for that particular planned development district. If
the owner or developer is not in agreement with the Planning Commission’s
findings, they may request approval from the Town Council. A building or zoning
permit shall not be issued for construction until a final plat for the PD phase
in which the permit is being requested has been submitted to and approved by
the Zoning Administrator.
   (B)   Standards for qualification as a planned development. Development
proposed for a planned development (PD) shall meet certain basic standards to
qualify for consistency with the intent of a planned development.
      (1)   Minimum size. The minimum size for a PD district shall be ten
acres.
      (2)   Minimum width. The PD site must have a minimum width between any
two opposite lines of 200 linear feet.
      (3)   Eligible street. The PD shall exit onto a major paved road or
arterial and have a minimum frontage width on said arterial of 80 feet. A PD
may not have the primary vehicular access point onto a local or unpaved street.
Eligible streets for a PD primary frontage include, but may not be limited to:
         (a)   Highway 17;
         (b)   Doar Road;
         (c)   Seewee Road;
         (d)   Bulls Island Road;

         (bb)   Clayfield Road; and
         (cc)   FS Road 260-B.
      (4)   Mixed use standard. A PD shall demonstrate a mixed-use concept. The
developer shall be responsible for illustrating how that shall be accomplished
in order to meet the standard requirement.
      (5)   Minimum centrally-located open space required. A PD shall contain a
minimum of 10% open space of net upland (developable) centrally-located open
space. The space must be large and useable by the residents of the PD. Drainage
ponds and wetlands may not qualify to meet this requirement.
      (6)   Minimum number of vehicular access points to the public road. The
minimum number of vehicular access points to the public road is one per 150
parcels. A second access point may be required by the Planning Commission if it
feels it will help alleviate a potential safety concern.
      (7)   Residential building types. A PD district may contain any mixture
of residential building types including, but not limited to:
         (a)   Single-family detached large lot;
         (b)   Single-family detached small lot; and
         (c)   Duplex units.
      (8)   Maximum residential density. Four dwelling units per acre except
within 300 feet of the OCRM critical line, where the maximum residential
density shall be one unit per acre.
      (9)   Term. A PD shall stay in effect for five years from the date of
Council adoption of the PD document.
      (10)   Minimum Intercoastal Waterway property impervious surface. Any PD
property that is located within the first 300 feet from the OCRM critical line
shall incorporate no more than 20% impervious surface, including roads,
buildings and parking lots and any other paved surfaces.
      (11)   Traffic impact analysis. Any PD proposing more than 80 dwelling
units shall prepare a traffic impact analysis.
      (12)   Clear cutting. Clear cutting of the existing pine tree canopy is
strongly discouraged but may be permitted on a case-by-case basis if a 25-foot
wide undisturbed buffer (except for required ingress and egress) is employed
along all project exterior property lines; otherwise, clear-cutting is not
allowed as part of the PD.
      (13)   Development impact fee. The town requires that a development
impact fee of $3,000 per dwelling unit be paid to the town upon the issuance of
a certificate of occupancy.
      (14)   Development agreement. The Town Council may require the execution
of a development agreement to establish other development conditions not
covered in a PD document.
      (15)   Other provisions. Any other provisions the Town Council determines
are relevant and necessary to the development of the planned development.

§ 153.091 COMMUNICATIONS TOWERS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. The regulations of this section are designed to
aid in the siting of communications towers in the town. It is the intent of
these regulations to allow for the harmonious co-existence of communications
towers and other land uses. It is also the intent of these regulations to
reduce the overall negative impact of communications towers by: reducing the
number of towers needed through a policy of encouraging co-location; and if co-
location is not feasible, encouraging either the clustering of towers (tower
farms), the disguising of towers through alternative designs or the location of
communications equipment on existing tall structures.
   (B)   Co-location exemption. Proposed communications equipment co-locating
on existing towers and structures without adding to their height shall require
only a zoning permit and shall not be subject to the requirements of this
section.
   (C)   Zoning permit approval criteria. No zoning permit shall be issued for
a communication tower until the Planning Director and the Board of Zoning
Appeals determines that the tower complies with the following criteria and
standards.
      (1)   The tower must be located no closer to a residential structure than
a distance equal to one and one-half feet for each one-foot in height of the
proposed tower plus 50 feet as measured from the center of the proposed tower.
At a minimum, there must be a 150-foot distance between the proposed tower and
a residential structure. This requirement may be waived by the owner of the
residential structure.
      (2)   If the proposed tower is in the CC District and it utilizes an
appropriate alternative design (as determined by the Planning Director) which
allows it to better blend with the surrounding environment or if the
communications equipment will be placed on a tall structure housing another use
without adding to its height, the proposed tower or tall structure need only
meet standard zoning setback, buffer and landscaping requirements. Setback
requirements from residential structures as detailed in division (C)(1) above
will not apply.
      (3)   A six-foot non-climbable fence must be placed around the tower
(except for those designed in a manner compatible with division (C)(2) above)
and any associated building. Guy wires may be fenced separately.
      (4)   The proposed tower must be located such that adequate setbacks are
provided on all sides to prevent the tower’s fall zone from encroaching onto
adjoining properties (the fall zone shall be determined by an engineer
certified by the state in a letter which includes the engineer’s signature and
seal).
      (5)   For the purposes of co-location review and review of efforts at
sitting a tower on the same lot near an existing tower, the applicant shall
submit satisfactory written evidence such as correspondence, agreements,
contracts and the like, that alternative towers, buildings or other tall
structures are not available for use within the applicant’s tower site search
area that are structurally capable of supporting the intended antenna or
meeting the applicant’s necessary height criteria; providing a location free of
interference from other communication towers, or available at the prevailing
market rate (as determined by staff communication with persons doing business
within the industry). Additionally, the applicant shall make every effort to
build the proposed tower in such a manner as may allow other telecommunication
users to co-locate.
      (6)   Proposed towers may not be located within 1,000 feet of the center
of an existing tower unless the applicant certifies that the existing tower
does not meet the applicant’s structural specifications and the applicant’s
technical design requirements, or that a co-location agreement could not be
obtained at a reasonable market rate. In the event of the above situation, the
clustering of new towers on the same parcel near existing towers is encouraged.
      (7)   The proposed tower shall only be illuminated as required by the
Federal Communications Commission or Federal Aviation Administration. Nighttime
strobe lighting shall not be incorporated unless required by the Federal
Communications Commission or Federal Aviation Administration.
      (8)   The proposed tower must not include signs of any nature on any
portion of the tower. This requirement does not apply if the communications
equipment is placed in a manner complying with division (C)(2) above.
      (9)   In granting a special exception for a communications tower, the BZA
must find the following:
         (a)   That the location and height of the proposed tower will not
substantially impact the character of property listed in or eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places, other significant environmental, cultural
or historical sites or roads which have been officially designated as scenic
roads and that the tower is designed to blend into the environment and minimize
visual impact;
         (b)   If a completely new tower is necessary, the staff must have
written proof that the applicant’s attempts at co-location and siting a tower
on the same lot near an existing tower were proven not feasible or practical;
and
         (c)   That the applicant has pursued any available publicly-owned
sites and privately-owned sites occupied by a compatible use, and if not
utilized, that these sites are unsuitable for operation of the facility under
applicable communications regulations and the applicant’s technical design
requirements.
      (10)   In instances in which a proposed communications tower is viewed by
the staff as having a substantially negative impact on a surrounding area or
adjoining property, the BZA shall have the discretion to deny a special
exception for the communications tower. This denial must be made in writing
with reasons specifically stated to the applicant.
      (11)   Provide documentation that a 25-foot buffer outside the perimeter
of the tower base fenced area exists or will be installed. The landscape plan
or existing vegetation shall provide an opaque screen from public rights-of-way
and adjacent property owners.
   (D)   Tower abandonment. A tower that is not used for communication purposes
for more than 120 days (with no new application on file for any communication
user) is presumed to be out of service and the owner of such tower must notify
the staff and remove the tower within 60 days. Towers which are not maintained
according to building codes by the owner shall be removed by the owner within
60 days. To assure the removal of towers which do not meet requirements for
continued use or proper maintenance, a statement of financial responsibility
shall be submitted for each tower over 100 feet and a performance bond for the
amount of anticipated removal costs shall be posted for each tower over 150
feet. Removal costs shall be charged to the tower owner.
   (E)   Zoning permit submittal requirements. Applications for communication
towers shall include the following information:
      (1)   A site, drawn to engineer’s scale, showing the location of the
tower guy anchors (if any), buildings and other structures or improvements,
parking, driveways, fences and protected and grand trees affected by the
proposed improvements. Adjacent land uses shall also be noted on the site plan,
with precise measurements noted between the proposed tower and any surrounding
residential structures;
      (2)   The height and typical design of the tower, typical materials to be
used, color and lighting shall be shown on elevation drawings;
      (3)   Documentation indicating that co-location on existing towers or
buildings in the vicinity of the proposed tower was attempted by the applicant
but found unfeasible, with specific reasons noted and verified. The Planning
Director may require additional information to determine that co-location was
unfeasible. Additionally, documentation showing the structural capability of
the proposed tower to accommodate co-location and the willingness of the tower
owner to allow co-location on the proposed tower is required;
      (4)   A copy of the tower’s search ring; and
      (5)   Any other information as requested by staff to allow adequate
review of approval criteria, including a line of sight analysis showing
potential visual and aesthetic impacts. For instance, the staff may request
photographs with the tower superimposed to assess visual impact. Additionally,
the proposed towers FAA study number may be required.

§ 153.100 GOLF COURSES.
   Golf courses shall be subject to the following standards and criteria.
   (A)   (1)   Impact analysis. An impact analysis must be submitted that
indicates the potential number of members, the characteristics of the golf
course membership, a traffic impact analysis and a complete site analysis as
detailed below.
      (2)   Required site analysis. The layout of any golf course shall be
determined after preparing the required site analysis. The detailed site
analysis will be done in order to identify the site’s most significant
environmental, historic, cultural and natural resources. The site analysis will
include the following.
         (a)   Vegetation. Characteristics of a vegetation survey related to
land use will describe principal, predominant and significant vegetation, by
type, condition, age, use and general or specific location. Features in the
survey will include trees and shrubs, agricultural fields, treelines, native
vegetation, orchards, groves, woodlots, pastures, wetlands, forests and
grasslands. The vegetation survey shall indicate any significantly large trees
or endangered plant or animal species that may reside on the site and is
protected by law.
         (b)   Historical, archaeological and cultural resources. Historical
resources located within the proposed golf course development must be
identified on the plat. Sources such as the County Historical Survey (1991),
state registers and federal registers such as the National Register of Historic
Places shall be utilized in identifying these resources. The historical survey
is important for noting structures and areas that must be protected as
designated landmarks.
         (c)   Adjacent land use patterns. Land use on adjacent properties
shall be identified. Features such as, but not limited to, roads, rice dams,
traditional settlement areas, cemeteries, clusters of structures, parks,
marinas and logging areas shall be shown.
         (d)   Hydrography.
            1.   All water features including streams and sensitive areas on
the site, such as wetlands and riparian corridors must be located. The purpose
of locating these features is to limit disturbance of soil and vegetation that
affect water quality features. Hydrography shall be used to determine where
water required wetland buffers and other requirements such as drainage
easements will be located.
            2.   Wetland buffers of 50 feet are required on all saltwater
marshes and 35 feet on all freshwater wetlands. All water bodies, rivers,
streams, drainage channels, marshes or wetlands, floodplains and aquifers must
be inventoried or identified.
         (e)   Wildlife habitat areas.
            1.   The purpose of identifying wildlife habitat areas is to assess
the ecological conditions of the landscape and to provide continuation of these
habitat areas.
            2.   Features of this survey shall include the presence of any
threatened or endangered species, natural areas vital to wildlife species and
habitat areas that are connected to larger undisturbed natural habitat
(connected habitat system). Through this method, the study will develop key
points or areas that should be left undeveloped, then define those areas most
suitable for development.
   (B)   Only Audubon International Signature Program golf courses will be
allowed.
   (C)   Potential sites should be selected which allow the golf course to be
routed in such a way as to minimize the need to alter, create or remove
existing native landscapes, trees and vegetation, and which provide
opportunities for restoration/enhancement of valuable habitat.
   (D)   Sites which have archaeologically or geologically significant, and
sensitive or critical habitat or environmental features shall be identified and
either relocated or preserved through careful golf course design. Permanent
open space easements or other techniques may be used, as appropriate, to effect
preservation. The site design shall identify areas for restoration, replanting
and enhancement of riparian and littoral habitat to re-establish wildlife
migration corridors and linkages between fragmented habitat areas. Protection
and planned restoration/enhancements for such areas during construction and
ongoing operation must be ensured. Native habitats and communities of special
value to threatened/endangered species shall be preserved to the greatest
extent possible, consistent with state and federal regulations.
   (E)   Each site selected for golf course development will likely have a
variety of habitat types present. These habitat types must be identified and
provisions made for routing of the course or relocation of the species.
   (F)   The site plan should protect drainage systems that support retained
vegetation. Ponds shall be developed which mimic conditions in terms of both
aesthetics and habitat.
   (G)   Structures and buildings should be located such that impacts to
habitats and significant natural areas are avoided.
   (H)   Design and construction standards are as follows.
      (1)   Marshes, creeks and wetlands.
         (a)   The golf course design must attempt to minimize the number of
marsh, creek or wetland crossings. Marsh, creek or wetland crossings must be
designed in such a way to minimize erosion and harmful effects of significant
habitat and migration corridors.
         (b)   Bridges must minimize alteration of the marsh, creek or wetland
environment.
         (c)   Design must create and restore riparian habitat, especially in
previously degraded habitat areas, and must reduce the impact of alterations
necessitated by design and construction of the course.
         (d)   The course design must employ vegetated buffer strips of
sufficient width to mitigate impacts to riparian corridors and other
significant habitat which may result from surface drainage of the golf course,
cart paths and other developed areas. In certain circumstances where riparian
vegetation has been degraded or does not exist, turf grass and rough areas may
be located in closer proximity to the marshes, creeks or wetlands.
         (e)   Cart paths must be graded such that runoff from them generally
does not flow directly into any marsh, creek or wetland.
         (f)   Construction fencing/siltation barriers must be utilized during
the construction phase where needed to protect habitat and marsh, creek or
wetland areas.
      (2)   Trees.
         (a)   The selected site must not be heavily forested (with more than
60% tree canopy coverage).
         (b)   The design of the course and related facilities must maximize
the preservation of clusters or significant stands of trees, particularly grand
trees, preferred specimen trees and otherwise preserve interior habitat areas.
         (c)   Irrigation systems shall be designed to avoid impacting existing
oaks or other sensitive vegetation.
         (d)   If required by the Planning Director, a certified professional
arborist, botanist or forester shall be employed by the applicant to evaluate
the status of the trees and related habitats on the site and provide direction
for restoration and/or enhancement of impacted trees.
         (e)   Cart paths within the driplines of trees slated for preservation
must be grated in such a way as to not damage or stress the tree.
         (f)   Barriers (curbs, fencing, vegetation and the like) should be
established to discourage cart and pedestrian travel off paths located within
or adjacent to sensitive habitat.
      (3)   Water quality.
         (a)   Lined artificial storage ponds must not be located in prime
groundwater recharge areas.
         (b)   Turf grass species and landscaping around buildings should be
selected which are drought resistant or tolerant and which are suited for any
special site characteristics or soil conditions.
         (c)   State-of-the-art irrigation systems with site meteorological
monitoring capability should be used to minimize water use.
         (d)   If on-site wells or ponds are to be used as the irrigation water
source, analysis will be required to determine the safe yield in order to
prevent aquifer, off-site wells and/or marsh, creek or wetland depletion. The
developer will be held responsible for any negative impact on water supplies to
adjacent or nearby properties.
         (e)   Paved areas should be limited in order to minimize impermeable
surfaces and thereby reduce surface runoff.
         (f)   The project should employ established best management practices
pursuant to the non-point source program guidelines to control non-point source
(stormwater) runoff pollution. For example, impervious liners for detention/
retention ponds and water hazards to protect ground and surface water quality;
buffer strips, oil/grease separators or other recommended techniques for

§ 153.257 RULES FOR COMPUTING PARKING AND LOADING REQUIREMENTS.
   The following rules apply when computing off-street parking and loading
requirements.
   (A)   Multiple uses. Lots containing more than one use must provide parking
and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirements for all uses.
   (B)   Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces result
in a fractional number, any fraction of one-half or less will be rounded down
to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than one-half will be
rounded up to the next higher whole number.
   (C)   Area measurements. Unless otherwise expressly stated, all square-
footage-based parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of
gross floor area.
   (D)   Occupancy-based standards. For the purpose of computing parking
requirements based on employees, students, residents or occupants, calculations
shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any single shift,
the maximum enrollment or the maximum fire-rated capacity, whichever is
applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces.
   (E)   Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use not
specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the Planning Director
shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the listed use that
is deemed most similar to the proposed use or require parking spaces in
accordance with a parking study prepared by the applicant.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.258 LOCATION OF REQUIRED PARKING.
   (A)   On-site parking.
      (1)   Except as expressly stated in this section, all required off-street
parking spaces must be located on the same lot as the principal use and shall
be arranged and laid out so as to ensure that no parked or maneuvering vehicle
will encroach upon a sidewalk, public right-of-way or property line.
      (2)   Parking lots in O and C Districts containing more than ten parking
spaces shall be located to the side or rear of the principal structure’s front
facade or within a courtyard surrounded by a structure on at least three sides.
      (3)   Private driveways serving a single-family detached residence must
be a minimum of ten feet in width. Driveways serving dwelling groups of three
or less dwellings and over 100 feet in length must provide a travel lane 18
feet in width, and driveways serving dwelling groups of three or less dwellings
and under 100 feet in length must provide a travel lane of 14 feet in width.
All driveways shall allow for an overhead clearance of 15 feet.
      (4)   Off-street parking spaces may be located on a separate lot from the
lot on which the principal use is located if approved in accordance with the
special exception procedures and if the off-site parking complies with the all
of the following standards.
   (B)   Ineligible activities. Off-site parking may not be used to satisfy the
off-street parking standards for residential uses (except for guest parking),
restaurants, convenience stores or other convenience-oriented uses. Required
parking spaces reserved for persons with disabilities shall not be located off-
site.
   (C)   Location. No off-site parking space may be located more than 600 feet
from the primary entrance of the use served unless shuttle bus service is
provided to the remote parking area. Off-site parking spaces may not be
separated from the use that it serves by a street right-of-way with a width of
more than 80 feet, unless a grade-separated pedestrian walkway is provided, or
other traffic-control or shuttle bus service is provided to the remote parking
area.
   (D)   Accessory use designation. Parking spaces located off-site in
accordance with this section shall be considered accessory to the primary use,
regardless of the fact that such accessory use is not located on the same
parcel as the principal use.
   (E)   Zoning classification. Off-site parking areas serving uses located in
nonresidential zoning districts must be located in nonresidential zoning
districts. Off-site parking areas serving uses located in residential or
agricultural zoning districts may be located in residential, agricultural or
nonresidential zoning districts.
   (F)   Agreement for off-site parking. In the event that an off-site parking
area is not under the same ownership as the principal use served, a written
agreement will be required. An attested copy of the agreement between the
owners of record must be submitted to the Planning Director for recordation on
forms made available in the Planning Department. Recordation of the agreement
with the Register of Mesne Conveyance must take place before issuance of a
zoning permit, building permit or certificate of occupancy for any use to be
served by the off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be
revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in
accordance with this subchapter.
   (G)   Shared parking. Developments or uses with different operating hours or
peak business periods may share off-street parking spaces if approved in
accordance with the special exception procedures and if the shared parking
complies with the all of following standards.
   (H)   Location. No shared parking spaces must be located within 600 feet of
the primary entrance of the use served unless shuttle bus service is provided
to the shared parking area. Shared parking may not be separated from the use
that it serves by a street right-of-way with a width of more than 80 feet,
unless a grade-separated pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic-
control or shuttle bus service is provided to the parking area.
   (I)   Zoning classification. Shared parking areas serving uses located in
nonresidential zoning districts must be located in nonresidential zoning
districts. Shared parking areas serving uses located in residential or
agricultural zoning districts may be located in residential, agricultural or
nonresidential zoning districts.
   (J)   Shared parking study. Those wishing to use shared parking as a means
of satisfying off-street parking requirements must submit a shared parking
analysis to the Planning Director that clearly demonstrates the feasibility of
shared parking. The study must be provided in a form established by the
Planning Director and made available to the public. It must address, at a
minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of
tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated peak
parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking
spaces.
   (K)   Agreement for shared parking. A shared parking plan will be enforced
through written agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the
agreement between the owners of record must be submitted to the Planning
Director for recordation on forms made available in the Planning Department.
Recordation of the agreement with the Register of Mesne Conveyance must take
place before issuance of a building permit or certificate of occupancy for any
use to be served by the off-site parking area. A shared parking agreement may
be revoked only if all required off-street parking spaces will be provided in
accordance with this subchapter.

applicable standards of this chapter and has been approved in accordance with
the procedures.
      (1)   All lots shown on plats whether subdivided or not, shall have the
Planning Commission stamp of either approval or exemption on said plat; the
Register of Mesne Conveyance shall not record any plat without such stamp. The
plat for an individual lot exempted by virtue of pre-existence must be
accompanied by a surveyor’s statement on the plat that the lot is a single,
individual lot and not newly created.
      (2)   Parcels that were recorded by deed or plat prior to the adoption of
the county’s original subdivision regulations on January 1, 1955, will receive
automatic approval under a grandfathers clause; providing the parcel involved
is still in the same size and shape as when recorded prior to 1955 and is
properly platted in accordance with present standards. The recorded information
must be provided and attested to by the surveyor or attorney involved.
   (B)   Standard specifications for road and drainage systems. The regulations
and standards of this chapter are intended to supplement the county’s standard

§ 153.297 OVERVIEW OF REVIEW AND APPROVAL PROCESS.
   (A)   Minor subdivisions. There is one required step in the minor
subdivision process: final plat review and approval. Applicants for minor
subdivision are strongly encouraged to schedule and attend a pre-application
conference prior to filing a minor subdivision.
   (B)   Major subdivisions. Applicants for major subdivisions are required to
schedule and attend a pre-application conference prior to filing a subdivision
application. After the pre-application conference, there are two required steps
in the process: preliminary plat review and approval; and final plat review and
approval. Each step of the process shall be completed before initiating the
next step.
   (C)   Pre-application conference. Pre-application conferences offer an
opportunity to familiarize applicants with applicable procedures, submittal
requirements, development standards and other pertinent matters before
finalizing the development proposal or laying out the proposed subdivision.
Applicants shall be responsible for scheduling pre-application conferences with
the Planning Director who shall be responsible for contacting the Public Works
Department and other affected agencies.

follows.
   (A)   The layout of any subdivision shall be determined after preparing the
required site analysis.
   (B)   The detailed site analysis will be done in order to identify the
site’s most significant environmental, historic, cultural and natural
resources. The site analysis will include the following.
      (1)   Vegetation. Characteristics of a vegetation survey related to land
use will describe principal, predominant and significant vegetation, by type,
condition, age, use and general or specific location. Features in the survey
will include trees and shrubs, agricultural fields, treelines, native
vegetation, orchards, groves, woodlots, pastures, wetlands, forests and
grasslands. The vegetation survey shall indicate any significantly large trees
or endangered plant or animal species that may reside on the site and is

be identified. Features such as, but not limited to, roads, rice dams,
traditional settlement areas, cemeteries, clusters of structures, parks,
marinas and logging areas shall be shown.
      (4)   Hydrography. All water features including streams and sensitive
areas on the site, such as wetlands and riparian corridors must be located. The
purpose of locating these features is to limit disturbance of soil and
vegetation that affect water quality features. Hydrography shall be used to
determine where water required wetland buffers and other requirements such as
drainage easements will be located. Wetland buffers of 50 feet are required on
all saltwater marshes, and 35 feet on all freshwater wetlands. All water
bodies, rivers, streams, drainage channels, marshes or wetlands, floodplains
and aquifers must be inventoried or identified.
      (5)   Wildlife habitat areas. The purpose of identifying wildlife habitat
areas is to assess the ecological conditions of the landscape and to provide
continuation of these habitat areas. Features of this survey shall include the
presence of any threatened or endangered species, natural areas vital to
wildlife species and habitat areas that are connected to larger undisturbed
natural habitat (connected habitat system). Through this method, the study will
develop key points or areas that should be left undeveloped, then define those
areas most suitable for development.

      (2)   When no public sewer is provided to the proposed lot, a
representative of State Department of Health and Environmental Control will
visit the site and test the soil for minimum septic system requirements.
      (3)   Where subdivision streets and/or drainageways are being
constructed, a Public Works Department inspector will make periodic visits to
the site at no cost to the developer to ensure construction compliance with
county-approved road and drainage plans. Public Works Department’s
certification that all roads and drainage systems have been constructed in
compliance with the plans is required prior to final approval of the
development. This approval is necessary for both public and private
developments.
      (4)   Fire protection and design to be approved by the Fire Department
prior to preliminary plat approval.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)

following statements to be placed upon the plat if the proposed roads and
drainage have not been constructed in conformance with standards and
specifications of the county’s standard specifications for road and drainage
systems.
            1.   “The approval of this plat does not obligate the town in any
way to accept for maintenance any of the roads or easements shown hereon.”
            2.   “WARNING! Approval of this plat does not indicate approval nor
adjudicate title of the access or right-of-way shown hereon.”
         (b)   The Planning Commission reserves the right to require additional
statements to be placed upon the plat if the proposed subdivision does not meet
all requirements of the subdivision regulations. These notes shall be included
in the approval of the final plat.
      (8)   Road rights-of-way or drainage easements. Where road rights-of-way
or drainage easements are being dedicated, whether public or private, a
certificate of ownership prepared by a licensed attorney and establishing the
complete and actual ownership of the property to be dedicated shall be
submitted.
   (D)   Planning Director review and decision. Within the 45 days of receipt
of a complete final plat application, the Planning Director shall review the
proposed final plat and the reports for the Public Works Department and other
affected agencies and act to approve, approve with conditions or deny the final
plat, based on whether it complies with the approved preliminary plat and all
applicable requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   Acceptance of dedications. Approval of a final plat shall not
constitute acceptance of any public improvements. Such acceptance will require
the town and/or County Council acceptance of dedication. Once approved, a
certificate of dedication acceptance shall be attached to copies of the

      (1)   Appeals of Planning Director’s decision. Any person with a
substantial interest in a final plat decision of the Planning Director may
appeal the decision to the Planning Commission by filing an appeal with the
Planning Director within 30 days of the date of the decision.
      (2)   Appeal powers. In exercising the appeal power, the Planning
Commission may reverse or affirm wholly or partly or may modify the decision
being appealed. If the Planning Commission determines that it is necessary to
obtain additional evidence in order to resolve the matter, it may remand the
matter to the Planning Director, with directions to obtain such evidence and to
reconsider the decision in light of such evidence.
      (3)   Consideration of evidence. The Planning Commission shall consider
only the same application, plans and related project materials that were the
subject of the original decision and only the issues raised by the appeal.
      (4)   Burden of persuasion or error. In acting on the appeal, the
Planning Commission shall grant to the Planning Director’s decision a
presumption of correctness, placing the burden of persuasion of error on the
appellant.
      (5)   Approval criteria. An appeal shall be sustained only if the
Planning Commission finds that the Planning Director erred.
      (6)   Appeals of Planning Commission’s decision. Any person with a
substantial interest in a final plat (appeal) decision of the Planning
Commission may appeal the Planning Commission decision to the Circuit Court of
the county. Appellants shall file with the Court Clerk a written petition
plainly and fully setting forth how such decision is contrary to law. Such
appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the date of the Planning Commission’s
decision.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.301 LOTS.
   (A)   Size.
      (1)   Lots shall comply with the lot size standards of the underlying
zoning district and all other applicable standards of this chapter.
      (2)   Depth of residential lots shall not exceed three times width of the
lot (a 1:3 ratio).
      (3)   The Planning Director may allow the lot width to depth ratio of 1:
3 to be exceeded when any of the following conditions occur:
         (a)   When attached dwellings are proposed;
         (b)   Where additional depth is provided for marsh frontage lots when
the lot width depth ratio is met and the property line is extended into the
marsh; and
         (c)   A minor subdivision of a parent tract into no more than two
lots; provided the following requirements are met:
            1.   The minimum lot frontage for each lot is not less than 300
feet;
            2.   In no case shall the average lot width be less than 300 feet
with the minimum lot width at any one point than 250 feet; and
            3.   At least one of the lots shall border a natural area, wetland
or marshland.
   (B)   Access.
      (1)   (a)   Double frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential
to provide separation of residential development from major roadways or to
overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation.
         (b)   An easement with a minimum width of ten feet may be required to
restrict access from the major street or other area.
      (2)   All lots shall be provided with access by means of streets that
have been constructed in conformance with the standards and specifications of
this chapter.
   (C)   Flag lots. Flag lots may be allowed in subdivisions established
pursuant to the standards of this chapter.
      (1)   Permitted use of flag lots.
         (a)   A flag lot may be utilized to facilitate subdivision of a long
narrow parcel that has sufficient area but insufficient width to be otherwise
subdivided.
         (b)   A flag lot may be used to eliminate multiple access points to
collector or arterial roads.
         (c)   A flag lot may be used when the buildable area of a parcel is
restricted due to the presence of a natural resource or the irregular shape of
a parcel.
      (2)   Prohibited use of flag lots.
         (a)   Flag lots shall not be used to avoid the development of streets
otherwise required by this chapter when the effect of such flag lots would be
to increase the number of access points (driveways) on a publicly dedicated
road right-of-way.
         (b)   Flag lots may be denied when an adjoining parcel also has
sufficient area but insufficient width to otherwise be subdivided. In such
cases, in lieu of platting a flag lot, a half-width road right-of-way may be
required to be platted along the common property line to facilitate the
platting of a full width road right-of-way when the adjoining property is
subdivided.
      (3)   Standards for flag lots.
         (a)   Flag lots shall take direct access to streets that comply with
the standards of this chapter.
         (b)   The area within the flagpole portion of a flag lot shall not be
counted as lot area for the purpose of meeting the minimum lot area
requirements of this chapter.
         (c)   As a condition of approval of a flag lot, decision-making bodies
may require an access easement to be placed on the flag lot to allow the
adjoining parcel to share access to the road.
         (d)   The flag pole portion of a flag lot shall have a minimum width
of 20 feet for its entire depth, and the depth, or length of the flag pole
shall not exceed 300 feet.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.302 STREETS.
   (A)   Principles and philosophy.
      (1)   Design philosophy. Streets are the links that provide the basis for
safe, efficient and economical access to commercial, industrial and residential
areas. Safe residential streets are attained by specifying street geometries
that discourage excessive speed and emphasize access. Residential streets
should therefore promote:
         (a)   Safe and efficient movement of vehicular and pedestrian traffic;
and
         (b)   Cost-effectiveness, that takes into consideration both initial
construction and future maintenance costs.
      (2)   Principles. Streets and roads shall be designed to:
         (a)   Provide safe, smooth and efficient vehicular flow;
         (b)   Provide acceptable sight distance visibility;
         (c)   Provide good roadway foundation and subgrade drainage;
         (d)   Provide acceptable environmental features;
         (e)   Provide space for utilities, if necessary;
         (f)   Provide drainage for adjacent properties, when practical;
         (g)   Consider a community or subdivision master plan;
         (h)   Follow natural contours and preserve natural features;
         (i)   Minimize traffic speed, volume and congestion; and
         (j)   Minimize the amount of paved area as a means of reducing
stormwater runoff.
   (B)   Street and road classifications.
      (1)   Parkways. Parkways are divided arterial streets with full or
partial access, usually located within a ribbon of park-like development.
      (2)   Arterial street. Arterial streets function to conduct traffic
between communities and activity centers, and to connect communities to major
state and interstate highways. Arterials are primary roads characterized by
high traffic volumes and high speeds.
      (3)   Collector street. Collector streets (in the town) serve as the
principal traffic arteries within residential and commercial areas. Collector
streets carry relatively high traffic volumes from arterial streets to lower
classification streets.
      (4)   Subcollector street.
         (a)   Subcollector streets provide passage to access streets and
convey traffic to collector streets. Subcollectors provide access to
residential lots and also carry some through traffic to lower classification
streets.
         (b)   Subcollector streets may provide access to 25 to 100 dwelling
units (lots).
      (5)   Access street. Access streets are designed to conduct traffic to up
to 25 dwelling units and subcollector streets.
   (C)   Urban/suburban street standards. Urban/suburban streets are those
streets near and around municipalities, shopping areas and commercial areas.
Urban/suburban streets shall be subject to the following standards:
Commercial Standards (Urban/Suburban Street Standards)
   StandaParkway Arterial Collector Subcollector Access

Note: Earth roads in new subdivision subdivisions are not accepted by town for
public maintenance.
1   Access street rights-of-way may be reduced to 40 feet in instances where
an existing flag lot has a 40-foot strip leading from existing public right-
of-way to a larger tract. A 40-foot right-of-way shall only be allowed when
the designer of the subdivision demonstrates that the reduced right-of-way
width can accommodate all required infrastructure.
2   Centerline grade of less than 0.3% is acceptable on causeways where land
areas on both sides of roadway embankments are jurisdictional wetlands or
critical area.
3   Divided roadways shall conform to the standard specifications for road
drainage systems.
4   May be reduced to 20 mph by Public Works Director if applicant meets all
applicable state laws and is posted accordingly.
 
   (D)   Rural road standards. Rural roads are located in low-density areas
away from commercial shopping areas. Rural roads are more informal and should
blend into the surrounding landscape. Rural access roads usually carry less
traffic than urban streets and may have a surface constructed of rock, pavement
or an alternative surface approved by the Public Works Director. Earth roads
may be allowed for cul-de-sacs with a length of 1,500 feet or less.
Additionally, earth roads may be allowed within open space developments if:
adequate drainage can be provided; soil conditions can accommodate the weight
of a pumper truck; and a maintenance bond is provided to ensure continuing
maintenance of the road.

Note: Earth roads in new subdivision developments are currently not accepted by
the town and/or county for public maintenance. Rock roads may be accepted for
public maintenance.
1Applicable to earth roads serving 10 or fewer lots or located within open
space developments.
2   The minimum allowable road right-of-way width shall be the required width
of traveled way (pavement), plus safety space (shoulders), plus drainage and
utilities areas. Variations of, but not exceptions to stated minimum
requirements may be approved by planning/public works staff.
3All state laws are to be met.
 
   (E)   Centerline radius of horizontal curves.
      (1)   Centerline radius for horizontal curves is dependent upon many
factors including type and condition of roadway surface, horizontal and
vertical sight distances, design speed and degree of curvature.
      (2)   The roadway designer is required to utilize appropriate design
techniques as outlined in American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) design publications in the design of
horizontal and vertical curvature of the town and/or county roads.
   (F)   Public maintenance of streets and roads. In order to be eligible for
public maintenance, streets and roads must comply with the town and/or county’s
standard specifications for road and drainage systems.
   (G)   Roadway drainage.
      (1)   Acceptable methods. The methods of roadway drainage shall be
acceptable, as detailed in the town and/or county’s standard specifications for
road and drainage systems:
         (a)   Roadside ditching; and
         (b)   Curb and gutter piped systems.
      (2)   Sheet flow. Sheet flow from roadways is acceptable only where
drainage discharges directly into a certified wetland area (such as at a
causeway). Where freshwater wetlands are considered, the applicant’s engineer
must provide drainage calculations showing runoff impact.
   (H)   Pavement/subgrade.
      (1)   The town’s standard nonindustrial asphalt pavement section is
minimum two inches hot plant mix asphaltic concrete with prime coat on minimum
six-inch compacted stabilized aggregate base course on prepared subgrade, in
accordance with County Transportation Commission standards. A prime coat is
recommended where FABC will not be paved within two weeks. Geotechnical data
shall be submitted to substantiate the design of all new arterial roads,
collector roads and parkways.
      (2)   The town/county standard earth roadway is identical to a town/
county standard paved road, except that on earth roadways, stabilizing material
shall be mixed into existing soil material for a depth of six inches. Crown
should be six inches. County/town inspectors will determine if the prepared
subgrade material and earth road overlay soil are acceptable.
      (3)   The town/county standard rock roadway is also identical to a county
standard paved road, except that on earth roadways, the subgrade is overlaid
with a minimum six inches compacted depth of stabilized aggregate base course
with a two-inch crusher run aggregate wearing course. Crown should be six
inches. County/town inspectors will determine if the prepared subgrade material
and the rock overlay are acceptable. Instead of conducting the inspection with
county/town staff, the Public Works Director shall be authorized to require
independent testing and inspections at the applicant’s expenses.
      (4)   As an acceptable alternative to the town/county standard subgrade/
pavement section, the developer may have a qualified independent testing
laboratory/engineer determine/sample/test representative soil materials and
design a base and pavement section in accordance with American State Highway
and Transportation standards and to supervise the construction. County/town
inspectors will test the completed subgrade prior to placement of base material
and be on-site to verify proper placement of base, paving and synthetic
materials.
      (5)   Coring samples will be conducted by the Public Works Department on
every newly constructed road to ensure compliance with the approved
construction plans. The number of samples and the location of testing sites
will be selected at random by the Public Works Department.
   (I)   Wetlands. It is the responsibility of the developer to locate and to
protect any wetlands (saltwater and freshwater). No development impacting any
wetland area can be approved by town without prior approval by appropriate
wetlands protection agencies. It is recommended that the developer contact U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers permit section and DHEC-OCRM for specific wetland
regulation information.
   (J)   Utilities.
      (1)   The developer shall arrange to install all necessary utilities
(water, sanitary sewer, electricity, telephone, street lighting or cable TV) as
part of the development, or appropriate space must be allocated for future
installation.
      (2)   Placement of utilities under the roadway surface will be considered
on a case-by-case basis by public works.
      (3)   Lawn sprinkler systems are acceptable only if the design and
installation is authorized by encroachment permit by public works.
   (K)   Encroachments. Encroachments into existing road rights-of-way and/or
drainage easement will be authorized if the following criteria are met:
      (1)   A permit authorizing the encroachment is acquired from the Public
Works Department;
      (2)   The encroachment meets safety requirements;
      (3)   The encroachment does not prevent normal maintenance operations and
the town/county is relieved of all damage liability resulting from maintenance;
      (4)   The encroachment will be properly maintained by the permittee; and
      (5)   The permittee agrees to temporarily or permanently relocate/remove
the encroachment when requested by the Public Works Director, at no cost to the
county and/or the town.
   (L)   Minimum offset of trees and shrubs from road pavement.
      (1)   Trees and shrubs shall be set back from street and road pavement in
accordance with the following minimum requirements.
Roadside Feature Speed (mph) Offset from Edge of Pavement (Feet)
                             Canopy Trees Understory Trees/Shrubs

*   Tree limbs hanging below 15 feet in height shall be trimmed so that they do
not encroach beyond the back of the curb. Minimum overhead clearance of 18 feet
should be maintained for safe passage. When a barrier curb or guiderail exists,
offset is measured from the face of the curb or guiderail to the face of the
tree at ground level.
 
      (2)   Understory trees may be located two feet from the edge of pavement
with the approval of the Planning Director and Public Works Director.
   (M)   Maintenance.
      (1)   All roads to be maintained by the town and/or county must first be
constructed (or upgraded) to meet current standards of this chapter and the
county’s standard specifications for road and drainage systems.
      (2)   Any subdivision required to meet the town and/or county standards,
but intended to be maintained privately, must be designed to meet all current
standards. With approval of the decision-making body, construction of a portion
of the facilities, such as removal of trees, can be deferred until such time as
the town and/or county is asked to maintain the facilities. In such situations,
the developer is required to submit a maintenance plan showing specifically
what work is to be accomplished, specific schedules, who is perform the work
and how payment for the work will be made. The potential owners of the
development, or portion of the development, must be made aware of those factors
through Homeowner’s Association bylaws and/or deed restrictions. The town and/
or county will not perform any maintenance services in such developments until
the roadway and/or drainageways have been brought up to then-current town and/
or county standards.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.303 STREET NAMES, STREET SIGNS AND STREET LIGHTS.
   (A)   Names. No street names shall be used that will duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets. Street names proposed by the
subdivider shall be subject to approval by the decision-making body.
   (B)   Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed by the
development in accordance with the State Uniform Manual on Traffic Control
Devices.
   (C)   Street lights. Street lights are encouraged within subdivisions.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.304 UNDERGROUND UTILITIES AND SERVICES.
   All electrical, telephone, cable television and similar distribution lines
providing service to a development site should be installed underground.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.305 WATER SUPPLY AND SEWAGE DISPOSAL.
   (A)   In accordance with State Department of Health and Environmental
Control regulations, all subdivisions shall be served by approved public water
and sewerage systems, if accessible for connection or, if in the opinion of the
State Department of Health and Environmental Control, the public’s health and
the environment would best be protected by the installation of such systems.
Where public sewer is not available, all buildable lots must meet minimum soil
requirements established by the State Department of Health and Environmental
Control.
   (B)   The developer shall install public water lines where public water
service is available within 500 feet of the property (measured along adjacent
rights-of-way); provided that this requirement shall not apply when the
decision-making body determines that the extension of public water service is
infeasible; or that the property owner would be required to consent to
annexation in order to obtain public water service.
   (C)   The developer shall install public sanitary sewer lines where public
sanitary sewer service is available within 500 feet of the property (measured
along adjacent rights-of-way), provided that this requirement shall not apply
when the decision-making body determines that the extension of public water
service is infeasible; or that the property owner would be required to consent
to annexation in order to obtain public sanitary sewer service.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.306 FIRE PROTECTION.
   In situations where public water systems with fire hydrants are not
available, developers may be required to provide dry hydrants which can utilize
ponded water from lakes, ponds, streams, detention/retention basins or other
sources. Dry hydrant design information may be obtained by contacting the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, Natural Resources Conservation Service.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.307 DRAINAGE AND STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   (A)   Applicable regulations and standards. Stormwater improvements shall
meet all applicable county, state and federal regulations. Those regulations
require that the stormwater system meet water quality and water quantity
standards and that no property be adversely affected by the stormwater runoff
from the development. In addition to the standards of this section, other
applicable stormwater regulations include the following:
      (1)   Town and/or county regulations:
         (a)   Stormwater management and sediment control ordinance;
         (b)   Standard specifications for road and drainage systems; and
         (c)   County Transportation Committee’s standard specifications for
roadway construction.
      (2)   State regulations:
         (a)   State Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Act, being
S.C. Code §§ 48-14-10 et seq.; and
         (b)   State Coastal Zone Management Act, being S.C. Code §§ 48-39-10
et seq.
      (3)   Federal regulations: EPA stormwater regulations and the Clean Water
Act, § 404, being 33 U.S.C. §§ 1344. Of particular interest to most developers
is the requirement to obtain a permit for land disturbance.
   (B)   Wetlands. It is the responsibility of the developer to locate and to
protect wetlands (saltwater and freshwater). No development affecting any
wetland area can be approved by town without prior approval by appropriate
wetlands protection agencies, including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.
   (C)   Drainage basin consideration.
      (1)   Careful consideration of the entire drainage basin must be made
when designing stormwater facilities for a given development.
      (2)   Runoff quantities from any land area depend on many factors
including land area, slopes, soil types, vegetation, channelization and
existing development, all of which must be considered by the stormwater
designer.
      (3)   Even though the development may be a minor segment of the entire
basin, the designer must consider the runoff from the development itself, any
upstream property whose runoff enters the development and also any downstream
property may be affected by the runoff from the development.
      (4)   Runoff from upstream properties can be determined by the existing
conditions. Any future development/redevelopment of those properties will be
addressed at the time that development/ redevelopment occurs. Runoff onto
downstream properties include the total runoff quantity from the development
including any runoff from upstream properties.
   (D)   Stormwater runoff.
      (1)   Stormwater runoff quantities are determined primarily by the amount
of rain that falls during any rainfall event. For the purposes of design, the
design storm shall be the ten-year, 24-hour rainfall event, SCS Type III
distribution and a rainfall intensity of 6.8” in a 24-hour period. For existing
channels passing through the development from upstream, the design storm is a
25-year, 24-hour rainfall event, SCS Type III distribution and a rainfall
intensity of 8.0” in a 24-hour period.
      (2)   Unless special detention facilities are provided, developers are
required to provide facilities designed for peak rate flow. That is, the pipe
channels must be large enough to handle the maximum rate of flow so that there
is no overflow at any time.
      (3)   Developers shall provide stormwater detention facilities in
accordance with all application federal, state and county regulations. The rate
of flow shall equal pre-development rates.
   (E)   Types of drainageways. The following types of drainageways shall be
allowed:
      (1)   Pipe structures. Pipe structures may be round, rectangular or oval.
Pipe material shall be appropriate for the situation and comply with the County
Transportation Commission standard specifications and the town’s standard
specifications for road and drainage systems.
      (2)   Earth channels. Earth channels are usually trapezoidal shaped, must
be 2:1 minimum side slopes. All disturbed areas shall be vegetated.
      (3)   Swales. Swales must be 5:1 minimum slope, with all disturbed areas
vegetated.
      (4)   Lined channels. Channels shall be lined with rock or other approved
material.
      (5)   Sheet flow. Sheet flow shall be acceptable only where routine
maintenance is not required, such as discharge into a designated wetland area.
   (F)   Drainage easements.
      (1)   All new developments shall have adequate drainage outfalls.
Drainage easements must be dedicated to use of the public, if maintenance will
be conducted by a public agency or private entity, such as an approved
Homeowner’s Association.
      (2)   One purpose of required drainage easements is to allow access to
drainage facilities by maintenance crews and equipment. The width and length of
the easements must be of sufficient dimension to allow space for appropriate
construction personnel and equipment to maneuver and to inspect, mow, regrade,
reshape and clean out the drainage easement. Although the land area designated
as easement is the property of the landowner, the landowner may not use it in
any way that adversely impacts or restricts access or maintenance by the
maintenance entity.
      (3)   In situations where the developer is required to provide drainage
easements, but is not required to construct the drainageway (such as when a
tract already having road frontage is subdivided), the easement area provided
shall:
         (a)   Be of sufficient width to allow future construction of the
drainageway (a dedication of a temporary construction easement in addition to
the permanent drainage easement is acceptable and may be required);
         (b)   Be of sufficient width to provide a channel with bottom width to
carry the stormwater (three-foot minimum), 2:1 side slopes, plus 20-foot
shoulder on one side, plus five-foot shoulder on the other side (both sides
must have 20-foot shoulders where top bank to top bank channel width exceeds 15
feet);
         (c)   Be free of obstructions (including trees) that would prevent the
construction or maintenance of the drainageway with heavy equipment; and
         (d)   Be located so that there is continuity with the drainageway/
existing drainage easements upstream and downstream. While it is not required
that the easement be located on or adjacent to a property, that method is
preferred since maintenance activities can be disruptive and somewhat
unsightly.
   (G)   Drainage rights-of-way. Drainage rights-of-way are similar to street
rights-of-way. The land area is not included in any tax lot and the developer/
lot owner does not pay taxes on the designated area nor do they have any rights
to use the land except as approved by the town and/or county. The developer
designs and constructs drainage facilities within the designated area just as
or he or she would normally do within a drainage easement area.
   (H)   Obstacles in drainageways. Existing obstacles (including trees,
buildings, utility poles or transformer structures, items of historical
significance) immediately adjacent to drainageways may be left in place
provided that all of the following criteria are met:
      (1)   The drainage system or the obstacle cannot be feasiblely relocated;
      (2)   Adequate and safe easement space for maintenance by motorized
equipment is provided;
      (3)   The drainage is not obstructed; and
      (4)   Drainage easement width is increased to accommodate obstructions.
   (I)   Detention storage. Detention is the temporary holding back of
stormwater and releasing it at a controlled rate. The entity responsible for
maintaining detention basins shall be identified at the time of preliminary
plat.
   (J)   Dry basin. An excavated area, within the stormwater system, that is
relatively dry at all times excepting during and immediately after a rainfall
event. All slopes must be gentle (maximum 3:1) with vegetation cover for
erosion control. Publicly dedicated basins shall not be used as a picnic or
recreation area. Trees may be located within the basin except where the
location would interfere with pond maintenance. Concrete or other lining is
acceptable. The basin and outlets must be properly designed to meet computed
quantity requirements. An emergency overflow spillway must be provided. Private
parking lots, for example, may be designed to function in this capacity upon
acknowledgment from the design engineer and applicant that flooding will occur.
   (K)   Wet basin (pond). Extending the detention basin down to groundwater
level will provide maximum detention storage. The pond must be excavated to
provide a minimum pond depth of six feet at time of lowest groundwater
elevation (drought conditions); be populated by fish to ensure mosquito
control; and meet all requirements of SCDHEC-Division of Mining and Solid Waste
Permitting. The developer shall be liable for any claims resulting from ponded
water, even if the town and/or county accepts the developer’s design.
   (L)   Soil information. Considerable information regarding town soils is
available in a manual entitled Soil Survey of Charleston County, South Carolina
prepared by the Soil Conservation Service (now called the Natural Resources
Conservation Service), U.S. Department of Agriculture, current edition.
   (M)   Soil erosion control. Considerable information regarding soil erosion
control is available in a manual entitled Erosion and Sediment Control
Practices for Developing Areas prepared by the State Land Resources
Conservation Commission. A certain acreage of land disturbing activities must
be approved by the State Land Resource Commission.
   (N)   Maintenance.
      (1)   All developments whose streets and drainageways are maintained by
the town and/or county must first be constructed (or upgraded) to meet the
current standards outlined in this guideline.
      (2)   Any development required to meet town standards but intended to be
maintained privately must be designed to meet all standards outlined in this
guideline and further described in the county’s standard specifications for
road and drainage systems. With approval of the decision-making body,
construction of a portion of the facilities, such as removal of trees, can be
deferred until such time as the town and/or county is asked to maintain the
facilities. In all such situations, the developer is required to submit a
maintenance plan showing specifically what work is to be accomplished,
schedules, who is to accomplish that work and how payment for that work will be
made. The potential owners of the development or portion of the development
must be made aware of those factors through Homeowner’s Association bylaws and/
or deed restrictions. The town and/or county will not perform any maintenance
services until the roadway and/or drainageways have been brought up to current
standards by others.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.308 BRIDGES AND CAUSEWAYS.
   (A)   Bridges.
      (1)   All bridges intended for public use shall comply with the most
recent edition of the American Association of Highway and Transportation
Officials’ Standard Specifications for Highway Bridges. All new bridges and
pilings intended for maintenance by the town and/or county shall be constructed
of reinforced concrete and shall comply with the county’s standard
specifications for road and drainage systems.
      (2)   Minimum bridge widths from curb face to curb face shall be the
total of the lane widths approaching the bridge plus one foot.
   (B)   Causeways. Streets or roads may be constructed on causeways provided
that:
      (1)   The roadway meets all other applicable regulations;
      (2)   The street centerline elevation at finish grade be minimum six and
one-half feet above mean sea level;
      (3)   The side slopes (vegetated earth) be minimum 2:1. Steeper slopes
may be used where acceptable stabilization material such as concrete cribbage
is provided; and
      (4)   Shoulder width shall be six feet in width with a guiderail or nine
feet in width without a guiderail.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.309 MARKERS.
   (A)   Placement. A marker shall be set on the right-of-way line at the ends
of the block for every block length of street. When blocks occur that have a
curve or curves in them, markers shall be set on both sides of the street at
the ends of tangents. Markers shall also be set on right-of-way line (on each
side of the centerline) at angle points when curves are not used. All interior
lot corners shall be marked.
The location and type of markers used shall be indicated on the final plat.
   (B)   Type. Markers shall be one of the following types.
      (1)   A reinforced concrete marker with a brass or copper pin in the top.
Concrete markers shall be a minimum of three feet long and have a minimum cross
sectional area of nine square inches. They shall protrude above the ground not
less than two inches and not more than six inches.
      (2)   An iron pipe or pins having a minimum diameter of three-fourths
inches hollow or one-half inches solid steel. Such iron pins will be a minimum
of two feet in length and shall extend above the ground at least one inch.
   (C)   Timing. Markers shall be installed prior to the submission of and
approval of the final plat.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.310 FINANCIAL GUARANTEES (SURETY).
   (A)   In lieu of completing the required subdivision improvements of this
chapter, a financial guarantee in the form of a no-contest, irrevocable bank
letter of credit, or performance and payment bond underwritten by an acceptable
state licensed corporate surety, or a cashier’s check may be accepted by the
decision-making body, subject to County Attorney approval of the guarantee to
determine that the interests of town are fully protected. Where a cashier’s
check is utilized, opinion of counsel may be waived.
   (B)   The amount of the financial guarantee shall be determined by the
appropriate governmental body that exercises operational control.
(Commissioners of public works for public water, commissioners of the
appropriate public service districts for street name signs and public sewer,
and the Public Works Director for all other improvements covered in this
chapter.) The amount shall be sufficient to guarantee completion of the
required improvement (125% of the actual cost of the improvement with a minimum
of $2,000) within a time period specified by the government agency, not to
exceed two years. The governmental agency determining the amount of financial
guarantee shall provide a letter to the Planning Commission (copy to the
subdivider) setting forth the amount of bond, conditions of acceptance and the
period covered. The Planning Commission staff will inform all interested
governmental agencies, particularly the town and/or County Building Inspection
Department.
   (C)   Developers making use of performance guarantees shall be required to
post required maintenance guarantees at the time that the performance guarantee
is posted.
   (D)   Upon completion of the improvements as required by this section,
written notice thereof shall be given by the subdivider to the bond holder, who
shall cause an inspection of the improvements to be made. The bond holder will,
within 30 days of the date of notice, authorize in writing the release of the
security given; provided improvements have been completed in accordance with
the required specifications. Should the improvements not be completed in
accordance with the required specifications by the date originally stipulated
in writing by the bond holder, the funds derived from said bond or cashier’s
check will be used by the bond holder to complete the improvements according to
required specifications, at the earliest reasonable time. Where it appears that
the bond was insufficient to finance the required improvements after the
subdivider has defaulted, the Town Council and\or County Council will assess
the individual subdivider the cost of the improvements over and above the
surety amount.
   (E)   In no instance will the bond holder be authorized to extend for the
subdivider the completion date originally stipulated.
   (F)   Pro-rated refunds based on a percentage of overall completion shall
not be authorized, with the exception of an irrevocable bank letter of credit.
   (G)   The decision-making body shall review and approve or reject each
acceptance of surety in lieu of completion of improvements. In making its
determination, the decision-making shall give due consideration to the
commitments made by the subdivider to individual purchasers.
   (H)   In lieu of completed subdivision improvements, the decision-making
body may accept the written guarantee of a governmental body to complete
required improvements within 90 days of the date of such acceptance by Town
Council and/or County Council.
   (I)   The acceptance of performance bonds or a cashier’s check in lieu of
completed performance is made possible only by the introduction of effective
occupancy control. This control will be coordinated with final approvals so as
to ensure that all conditions covered by one or more bonds are completely
fulfilled, except as specified in the town’s and/or county Building Code,
before an occupancy permit can be issued by the town and/or county Building
Inspection Department.
(Ord. 20-8, passed 12-7-2000)
§ 153.311 MAINTENANCE GUARANTEES.
   Street and stormwater management/drainage systems that are to be dedicated
to the town and/or county for public maintenance shall be under warranty for
all defects and failures for a period of three years. Prior to final plat
approval, the developer shall provide written verification of financial
responsibility for the correction of any defects and/or failures in those
related improvements that will be dedicated to the town and/or county. The
warranty (minimum 10% of the construction costs) shall be in a form
satisfactory to the Public Works Director and effective for a period of two
years after recording of the final plat. The Public Works Department shall
maintain surveillance over the system and provide written notification to the
developer if repair work is required during the warranty period. The Public
Works Department shall identify defects not considered to be public safety and
notify the developer of such defects. The developer shall then have 30 days to
prepare a schedule of corrective actions and begin such corrective actions. If
not complete with the approved schedule, the Public Works Department shall make
the repairs and bill the bonding company. Public safety defects shall be
addressed immediately by the Public Works Department, with reimbursement from
the bonding company.
