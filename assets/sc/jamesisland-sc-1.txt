p.m., and any pending order of business shall be deferred until such time as
the hearing has concluded. Unless otherwise required by law or Council motion,

without further action by the Council.
   (I)   New business. Items added to the agenda by the Town Administrator
after the Friday before the meeting but for which 24-hour public notification
has been provided may be considered by Council upon a majority vote. Items may
be added to the agenda at the meeting for reasons including concerns raised
during public comment or information reports by staff. Items may be added to
the agenda by the Mayor or members of the Council according to the following
rules:
      (1)   If the item is for discussion only and proposes no action by the
town or further vote by the Council at the meeting, it may be added by majority
vote.
      (2)   If the item requires action by the town, but not a final vote, such
that a final vote will occur at a future meeting that provides at least 24-hour
notice and an opportunity for public comment, it may be added by two-thirds
vote of the Council.
      (3)   If the item proposes action by the town and a vote by the Council
such that no further vote by the Council will be taken before the action is
carried out, so that there will be no 24-hour notice and opportunity for public
comment, it may be placed on the agenda by a two-thirds vote. The motion to add
the item to the agenda must state that the Council finds that an emergency or
an exigent circumstance exists if the item is not added to the agenda.

the invitation, together with the name of each bidder, shall be tabulated. The
tabulation shall be open to public inspection at that time.
      (7)   It shall be the responsibility of all bidders to provide adequate
means whereby their bids, whether mailed or hand carried, shall be received by

criteria may be used in the bid evaluation that is not set forth in the

      (9)   The town shall evaluate the bids solely using the information as
supplied by the bidder. However, it is sometimes determined that, for
clarification and more professional evaluation, additional information is
desirable and often necessary. Therefore, the town reserves the right to hold
discussions, review the specifications as believed offered, and request
clarification or any additional technical information which may provide a fair
and impartial evaluation by the town. All discussions shall be limited to the
bidder’s products, goods, or services, and no discussion shall be permitted

for any reason prior to the scheduled bid opening.
      (12)   After bid opening, no changes in bid prices or other provisions or
bids prejudicial to the interest of the town or fair competition shall be
permitted.

the bidder shall instruct the town in the amount that his or her bid is to be
increased or decreased by.

instruct the town in the amount that he or she desires a given item to be
increased or reduced, thereby requesting that his or her total bid be increased
or decreased in an equal amount. Changes shall only reflect the amount of
adjustment. Changes received which indicate or divulge openly the total amount
bid shall not be accepted.
      (14)   The bid shall be awarded with reasonable promptness by notice to
the most responsible bidder whose bid meets the requirements and specifications
and any other award criteria set forth in the invitation for bids, and in the
best interest of the town. The town reserves the right to reject any or all
submittals.
      (15)   The Mayor may authorize the purchasing agent, in situations where
the town’s best interest precludes re-solicitation of work, goods, or services
of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment in the bid price, including
change in the requirements, with the low, responsive, and responsible bidder.
      (16)   In the event that negotiations are unsuccessful in reaching a
price or scope of work or services which would be agreeable, the town, at its
discretion, may terminate all negotiations with the lowest bidder, and enter

sequential bidder should negotiations not be productive with the second lowest
offerer.

shall be conducted in like manner as with the first bidder. No changes or
reductions in scope of work or services shall be permitted during negotiations

information derived from bids submitted by competing bidders.

purchase orders in accordance with departmental procedures with supporting bid
award documents and source justification and/or written rationale as to why the
procurement may be considered under other procurement methods as provided
elsewhere within this chapter, or more specifically, considered as a sole
source procurement, sensitive procurement, emergency procurement, procurement
through the state or one of its agencies, the county, or procurement through an
existing town contract. Supporting bid award documents should include bid
tabulation and a concise statement as to the reasons for the bid award
recommendation. Purchase orders more than $25,000 must be approved by the Mayor
and Town Council.
   (E)   Nothing in this section shall prohibit a higher level, more stringent
procurement method being used if it is determined by the purchaser that the
town's best interest would be better served.
   (F)   Written contracts shall be executed by the Mayor.
   (G)   The purchasing agent may also authorize any budgeted expenditure
approved in the current fiscal year’s budget, where the price does not exceed

$25,000. The purchasing agent shall submit a report of the expenditure to the
Town Council, which shall be entered in the minutes of Council.

§ 32.05 AWARD TO OTHER THAN LOW BIDDER.
   (A)   When the award is not given to the lowest responsive bidder, a full
and complete list of the reasons therefor shall be filed with the purchase
order. Local vendor preference shall be given to those vendors who maintain a
principal place of business (owned or rented) within the town, as registered in
official documents filed with the Secretary of State, the Internal Revenue
Service, or State Tax Commission, and hold a valid town business license.
   (B)   In evaluating the price of eligible local vendor bids, the bids shall
be evaluated as though the prices proposed by local bidders were either 5%, 2%,

business or individual shall be evaluated on a 5% reduction basis;

business or individual shall be evaluated on a 2% reduction basis; and
      (3)   For bids $25,000 or more, the evaluation shall be based on a 1%
reduction basis, but will not exceed a total reduction of more than $2,000.
   (C)   Nothing herein shall be construed as increasing or decreasing the
actual price of a bid and the resulting contract; this section is intended only
to be used for the purposes of comparing and evaluating bids and proposals for
products and services. Nothing within this section shall be construed to create
any private rights claims, or cause of action on behalf of any person,
including but not limited to bidders.

§ 32.08 COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENT; EXCEPTIONS.
   Competitive quotes or bidding are required on all purchases exceeding$5,000
with the following exceptions.
   (A)   Emergency procurement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
procedure, the Mayor, or his or her designee, may make an emergency procurement
when there exists a threat to public health, welfare or safety under emergency
conditions or where normal daily operations are affected. The purchasing
limits, as provided for in the informal purchase procedures in division (C) and
(D) of this section, will be suspended during the emergency situation to
prevent an interruption or delay in emergency response. The maximum amount of
the emergency purchase will be limited to $150,000 for such emergency purpose.
Purchases above this amount will require approval by a quorum of Town Council.
   (B)   Procurement without competitive bidding. The state and its agencies,
including South Carolina counties and municipalities, write numerous
indefinite-delivery-type contracts yearly with manufacturers, service
providers, and contractors for regional and/or nationwide items, construction
projects, or services. In all cases, town procurement of equipment, goods, or
services may be made from suppliers which have current contracts in place
through the state or one of its agencies, including South Carolina counties or
municipalities, without seeking competitive bids or proposals. Also, the Mayor,
or his or her designee, may procure from the private or public sector supplies,
services, or construction items whenever such procurement may be obtained at or
below the price established by the state purchasing division for an identical
item.
   (C)   Sole source procurement. The purchase has been classified as sole
source procurement and documentation, approved by the Mayor, or his or her
designee, filed with any quote received by the vendor. As much competition
amongst providers shall be sought when possible. A purchase may be classified
as sole source for one of the following reasons:
      (1)   There is only one vendor that can provide a specific product or
service;
      (2)   A brand or make has been established for conformity, to standardize
equipment, improve maintenance, or other similar reasons; or
      (3)   A specific brand has been established based on reviews, testing,
availability, ability to work with other owned products, or other similar
reasons.
   (D)   Sensitive procurement. When it is determined that unlimited
solicitation may jeopardize sensitive operations, a limited solicitation shall
be authorized, with such competition as practicable under the circumstances.
Unless otherwise authorized by the Mayor, sensitive procurement shall be
limited to legal services, financial services to include financial advisors and
rate consultants, or administrative services. In all such cases, the Mayor must
approve prior to ordering.
   (E)   Professional services (architect/engineering services). It is the
policy of the town to publicly announce all requirements for architect-engineer
and surveying services and to negotiate such contracts based on demonstrated
competence and qualifications at fair and reasonable prices. In the procurement
of architect-engineer and land surveying services, the Mayor or his or her
designee shall request firms to submit a statement of qualifications and
performance data.
      (1)   The Mayor or his or her designee shall conduct discussions with no
less than three firms, except when fewer respond. The firm deemed most
qualified to provide the required services will be selected.
      (2)   The selection shall be made in order of preference, based on
criteria established and published by the purchasing agent. The Mayor or his or
her designee shall negotiate with the highest qualified firm for architect-
engineer or land surveying services at a compensation which is considered to be
fair and reasonable to the town. In making this decision, the Mayor or his or
her designee shall take into account the established value, the scope, the
complexity, and the professional nature of the services to be rendered.
      (3)   If the Mayor or his or her designee is unable to negotiate a
satisfactory contract with the firm considered to be most qualified,
negotiations with that firm shall be formally terminated. The Mayor or his or
her designee and a member of Council shall then undertake negotiations with the
second most qualified firm. Failing accord with the second most qualified firm,
the Mayor or his or her designee shall then undertake negotiations with the
third most qualified firm. If the Mayor or his or her designee is unable to
negotiate a contract with any of the selected firms, the Mayor or his or her
designee may select additional firms in order of their competence and
qualifications, and the Mayor or his or her designee shall continue
negotiations in accordance with this section until an agreement is reached.
   (F)   Professional services. The competitive procurement requirements of
this section shall not apply to the procurement of professional services where
the person employed is customarily employed on a fee basis rather than by
competitive bidding such as legal, medical, consulting, real estate, appraiser,
auditor or accounting services. The Mayor, or his or her designee, may secure
professional services by direct negotiation and selection, taking into account
the type of services required, the proximity (location) of the professional
providing the services, the capability of the professional to produce the
required service within a reasonable time, past performance, and the ability to
meet budget requirements. Nothing herein shall be deemed to prohibit the town
from using competitive procurement procedures for professional services if the
Mayor or his or her designee determines it is in the best interests of the
town.
   (G)   An expenditure may be made without competitive procurement when an
item is required for trial use or testing. The Mayor, or his or her designee,
shall set forth such determination and the basis therefor in a written
statement submitted to Town Council and entered in the minutes of Council.
   (H)   The following types of expenditures are exempt from the competitive
procurement requirements of this section;
      (1)   Utilities including gas, electric, water, and sewer;
      (2)   Information technology;
      (3)   Maintenance and repairs to vehicles, machinery or equipment
necessary in providing an essential town service;
      (4)   Maintenance or service contracts which are made with the
manufacturer or authorized service agent;
      (5)   Replacement parts of existing equipment supplied by the original
equipment manufacturer or authorized dealer;
      (6)   Routine, recurring purchases (e.g., office supplies);
      (7)   Works of art and holiday decorations for public display; and
      (8)   Competitive bidding including, but not limited to, reverse
auctions.

§ 32.09 LEASES.
   (A)   Lease defined. A LEASE is a contract for the use of equipment or other
supplies, or real property under which title does not pass to the town unless
there is a purchase option where title may pass to the town at some future
time. A lease period shall be restricted to a maximum of 20 years.
   (B)   Entering a lease. A lease may be entered into provided if:
      (1)   It is in the best interest of the town;
      (2)   All conditions for renewal and costs of termination are set forth
in the lease;
      (3)   The lease is not used to circumvent normal procurement procedures;
and
      (4)   The lease contains appropriate non-appropriation language.
   (C)   Lease with purchase option. A purchase option in a lease may be
exercised only if the lease containing the purchase option was awarded under
competitive sealed bidding or competitive sealed proposal, or the leased supply
or facility is the only supply or facility that can meet the town’s
requirements as determined in writing by the purchasing agent.
   (D)   Option provisions. When a contract is to contain an option for
renewal, extension, or purchase, notice of such provision shall be included in
the solicitation. Exercise of the option is always at the town’s discretion
only and not subject to agreement or acceptance by the contractor.

§ 32.10 SURPLUS STOCK.
   (A)   The Mayor or his or her designee shall have authority to transfer
stock or surplus supplies to other offices, departments, or agencies of the
town.

stock and supplies can be given to charity or to another public entity;
provided, however, that prior approval is given by the Town Administrator for
items with an estimated value up to $1,000 and by the Mayor for items with an
estimated value up to $10,000; and by Council for items with an estimated value
over $10,000, but less than $25,000.
   (C)   If deemed appropriate and approved by the Mayor and Town Council,
surplus stock and supplies may be auctioned off to the highest bidder at an
auction that has been noticed in a paper of general circulation. Written bids
will be accepted on all surplus stock and supplies that have been listed in the
auction bulletin. The auction bulletin shall describe each item and its fair
market value. Employees, Council members, and their immediate families are not
eligible to bid on auction items.
   (D)   Surplus stock and supplies with an estimated value exceeding $25,000
shall be sold by formal written contract to the highest responsible bidder,
after due notice inviting proposals.

material, supplies, or services; except when a majority of the Town Council
determines such exception is in the best interest of the town, provided that no
Council member whose interest is involved shall vote on the question. Any

(Ord. 2012-18, passed 11-15-2012)
STORMWATER MANAGEMENT UTILITY FEES
§ 51.025 FEE; CLASSIFICATION OF PROPERTY.
   (A)   Property classification. For purposes of determining the fee, all real
property in the town is classified as follows:
      (1)   Single-family residential;
      (2)   Vacant;
      (3)   Agricultural;
      (4)   Commercial.
   (B)   Base rate. The base rate shall be $48 annually. In no case shall a
Utility customer be billed a fee for less than one-half the base rate.
   (C)   Equivalent residential unit (ERU). The commonly accepted rate unit for
stormwater utilities is the equivalent residential unit (ERU). This is a
descriptive value based on the land classification type and the amount of
impervious surface. The ERU is used to relate a rate charged for a typical
residential property and this becomes the common denominator by which
commercial properties are evaluated. The ERU for Charleston County has been
determined to be 3,000 square feet.
   (D)   Annual fees. Annual fees for all property shall be as follows:
      (1)   Single-family residential property. Single-family residential
property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times one equivalent
residential unit (ERU), regardless of the size of the parcel or improvements
(impervious area).
      (2)   Agricultural property. Agricultural property shall be charged a fee
equal to the base rate times one equivalent residential unit (ERU), regardless
of the size of the parcel or improvements (impervious area).
      (3)   Vacant property. Vacant property shall be charged a fee equal to
the base rate times one-half equivalent residential unit (ERU), regardless of
the size of the parcel.
      (4)   Commercial property. Commercial property shall be charged the base
rate multiplied by the numerical factor obtained by dividing the total
impervious area of the property, as determined by the Stormwater Manager or an
authorized designee, by one ERU (3,000 square feet). The numerical factor will
be rounded to the nearest tenth of a unit. The minimum fee for any commercial
property shall be the base rate times one-half ERU. Those commercial properties
with impervious area greater than one-half ERU (1,500 square feet) and less
than one ERU (3,000 square feet) shall be charged the base rate times one ERU.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 11-15-2012; Ord. 2016-07, passed 7-21-2016; Ord. 2018-15,
passed 12-20-2018)
§ 51.026 DETERMINATION OF AMOUNT OF FEE.
   (A)   Computation of Stormwater Management Utility fee for commercial
properties:
      (1)   Determine base rate to assign ERU;
      (2)   Determine the impervious area on the property;
      (3)   Calculate the numerical factor for the property in question by
dividing the impervious area by one ERU (3,000 square feet); and
      (4)   Calculate the annual Stormwater Management Utility fee for
multiplying the numerical factor by the base rate, if the factor is greater
than one.
   (B)   Example calculation. Calculation of monthly fee for a one and one-half
acre commercial property with a determined impervious area of 32,500 square
feet.
      (1)   One ERU = 3,000 square feet.
      (2)   Property impervious area = 32,500 square feet.
      (3)   ERUs for example property = 32,500 square feet of impervious area/
1 ERU of 3,000 square feet = 10.8 ERUs.
      (4)   Utility fee = ERUs x base rate = 1.8 ERUs x example base rat of
$48.00 = $518.40/year.
   (C)   The classification of real property and the identification of the
Utility customer for the purpose of determining fees shall be determined from
the records of the Charleston County Tax Assessor. The Utility customer or
person charged the fee is based on the classification of the real property as
of January 1 of the year of billing and each year subsequently thereafter.
   (D)   Where the tax records are incomplete or ambiguous, a physical
inspection of the real property shall be made to determine the use of the
property. Upon development of the county’s database and review of the real
properties on a case-by-case basis, the classifications from the Charleston
County Tax Assessor do not preclude an adjustment to the data that the county
uses to determine the fee.
(Ord. 2012-20, passed 11-15-2012; Ord. 2016-07, passed 7-21-2016)
§ 51.027 ADJUSTMENT OF FEE.
   (A)   In cases where the Utility customer disputes the fee based on the
actual impervious area of the real property in which he or she has interest, a
notice of objection may be filed with the Stormwater Manager as outlined in the
Stormwater Management Utility subchapter, §
51.009, Written notice of objection; provided, however, that Town Council may
delegate the Stormwater Manager’s responsibilities hereunder to the county or
its duly authorized representatives pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement
providing for same.
   (B)   Where an adjustment of the fee is warranted, the Stormwater Manager
shall recalculate and re-determine the fee using equivalent ERUs that are based
on the total impervious and pervious areas of the real property at issue.
   (C)   Where deemed appropriate and at the discretion of the Stormwater
Manager, the gross acreage of the real property may be adjusted as a means of
recalculating and re-determining the fee. This method is applied in cases where
the property is large and the ratio of pervious area to impervious area is low.
The Stormwater Manager and the Utility customer shall mutually agree on the
general area of improvement. In cases where a mutual agreement cannot be
reached, the Utility customer may file a notice of objection as referenced
above.

§ 51.028 DURATION OF FEE.
   The fees established by this subchapter have been adopted by Town Council.
This fee will be reviewed, evaluated, and amended as necessary in order to
address stormwater program needs/deficiencies and small municipal separate
storm sewer system (SMS4) general permit requirements.

§ 51.029 BILLING; LATE CHARGES.
   (A)   The fee shall not be prorated. No refunds of the fee shall be made
except as set forth in this subchapter. The Utility fee shall be billed
annually with the bill mailed to each owner of record of real property, based
on the classification of property, to the owner of record of the real property,
as of January 1 of each year subsequently thereafter.
   (B)   For non-payment of all or any part of the Utility fee, the monetary
penalty shall be the same penalty set forth in S.C. Code § 12-45-180. If any
fee shall remain unpaid 60 days after the due date, the county may issue a lien
upon the parcel for the Stormwater Utility fee, penalty and costs of collection
and shall proceed to collect in the same manner as prescribed by law for the
collection of other fees and taxes.

§ 90.02 SEIZURE AND RIGHT OF ENTRY TO PROTECT ABANDONED, NEGLECTED OR CRUELLY
TREATED ANIMALS.
   (A)   Any animal control officer may lawfully take charge of any animal
found abandoned, neglected, or cruelly treated or unfit for use, and shall
petition any magistrates court in the jury area wherein the animal is found,
for a hearing which shall be a civil proceeding. The hearing shall be set not
more than ten days from the date of the seizure of the animal to determine
whether the owner, if known, is able to adequately provide for the animal and
is a fit person to own the animal. The animal control officer shall cause to be
served upon the owner, if known and residing within the jurisdiction wherein
the animal is found, written notice at least five days prior to the hearing of
the time and place of the hearing. If the owner is known but residing out of
the jurisdiction where such animal is found, written notice by any method or
service of process as is provided by South Carolina Code of Civil Procedure
shall be given. If the owner is unknown at the time of seizure, it shall be
considered a stray. The animal control officer may provide for such animal
until the owner is adjudged by the court able to adequately provide for such
animal and a fit person to own the animal, in which case the animal shall be
returned to the owner. If the owner is adjudged by the court unable to
adequately provide for the animal or not a fit person to own the animal, then
the court shall order that the animal be placed for adoption in a suitable
home, or humanely destroyed. The court, in determining whether the owner is
able to adequately provide for the animal or is a fit person to own the animal,
may take into consideration, among other things, the owner's past record of
convictions under this subchapter, or one similar thereto, and the owner's
mental and physical condition.
   (B)   If the magistrate's court determines that the owner is unable to care
for any animal or is not a fit person to own such animal, the owner may appeal
that decision to the court of common pleas (nonjury) of the county by serving a
copy of his/her notice of appeal on the magistrate within 30 days following the
decision together with an appeal bond in an amount equal to the contractual
daily rate charged to the county by the Charleston Animal Society, or other
designated animal shelter(s), which rate shall be established by adoption in
the county budget ordinance effective July 1 each year, multiplied by 90 days,
which is the typical time within which an appeal is heard. Should the hearing
on appeal be delayed beyond 90 days, the circuit judge, in his/her discretion,
may impose an additional bond amount on the owner. Should the appeal result in
a reversal of the magistrate's decision or a remand of the matter for a new
hearing, the bond will be returned to the owner. However, if the magistrate's
decision is affirmed, the bond shall be forfeited to the county sheriff’s
office for its use in reimbursing the animal shelter for its costs of care for
the animal. Should the owner appeal from the circuit court's decision,
additional bonds shall be assessed in an amount to be determined by the
appellate court.
   (C)   Nothing in the section shall be construed to prohibit the destruction
of a critically injured or ill animal or an animal identified as carrying or
having an infectious or contagious condition or disease or any unidentified
animal deemed to represent a physical danger to the public, animal control,
shelter staff, or other impounded animals may be humanely euthanized upon
agreement by animal control and shelter staff.

number and year as is on the certificate. The metal license tag shall bear the
name of the veterinarian and shall at all times be attached to a collar or
harness worn by the dog or cat for which the certificate and tag have been
issued. Note: These tags shall be issued in accordance with the recommendation
of the National Association of Public Health Veterinarians as to tag, shape and
color.
   (E)   The owner shall have a valid certificate of rabies vaccination readily
available at all times for inspection by an animal control officer or health

business building, single dwelling or multiple dwelling, or any property
improved for residential or commercial use, to allow weeds, grass or similar
vegetation to grow to a height of ten inches or more, and six feet in length
for uncultivated briars, vines, or other similar vegetation. Such height
constitutes a hazard or nuisance, real or potential, for harborage of vermin,
accumulation of litter and debris or other unsightly or injurious conditions.
Any lot which has been improved may not be allowed to revert to unimproved
status. An unimproved lot is a lot upon which clearing and grubbing has not
taken place. The following shall be exempt from this requirement:
      (1)   Any premises or part thereof on which such growth may be reasonably
demonstrated to be for agricultural or horticultural use and which is properly
attended;
      (2)   Wooded portions of rear or side yards where standard mowing
equipment cannot maneuver because of density, except that any 20-foot strip
adjacent to developed property or streets must have weeds, grass and vines
maintained below the height limitation and providing such lot is not otherwise
in violation of the provisions of this chapter; or
      (3)   Unimproved lots on which new permitted construction work is taking
place and during such time as the actual construction is in progress, except
for a ten-foot strip adjacent to any developed property, road or right-of-way.
   (B)   Unimproved property. An unimproved lot less than one acre that is in a
residential neighborhood shall be maintained in accordance with improved
properties outlined in division (A).
   (C)   Nuisances. Notwithstanding divisions (A) and (B) of this section, if
any of the following conditions exist on any portion of a lot or parcel of any
size, improved or unimproved, then such lot or parcel shall be deemed a
nuisance and a detriment to health and safety:
      (1)   The lot contains any accumulation of debris, rubbish, junk, tree
debris, tires or any type of refuse.
      (2)   The lot contains weeds or other growth which encroaches onto a
public sidewalk or roadway within ten feet above the level of the sidewalk or
14 feet above the level of the street.
      (3)   The lot contains evidence of the harboring of unlawful activity.
   (D)   It shall be the duty of the owner of any such lot or parcel in
violation of this section, including abutting owners of alleys in violation
thereof, to abate the unlawful condition. Owners and occupants of properties
which abut an alley shall be responsible up to the center point of such alley.
Owners and occupants of properties which include a public street right-of-way
shall be responsible up to and including the curb and gutter or street line.

§ 91.02 UNTREATED SEWAGE.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to dump untreated sewage on any land or in any
waterway under jurisdiction of the Town of James Island. All untreated sewage
must be disposed using a properly functioning septic system or sewer
connection. Each violation is subject to a $500 fine and each day in which land
remains contaminated shall count as a separate violation.
   (B)   It is the responsibility of a property owner to clean up and properly
dispose of any spill of untreated sewage. Each violation is subject to a $500
fine and each day in which land remains contaminated shall count as a separate
violation.
   (C)   Any dwelling unit is subject to having its water service disconnected
if its sewer service has been disconnected due to lack of payment or any other
reason. It shall be unlawful for anyone to tamper with his or her disconnected
sewer or water connection. Each violation is subject to a $500 fine and each
day of continued violation shall count as a separate violation.

and to connect such facilities directly with the sanitary server in accord with
the provisions of this section, JIPSD and SCDHEC.

the private sewage system is operated and maintained according to its designed
use and capacity.
      (3)   The property owner shall maintain the private sewage system so that
it is accessible for inspection and maintenance.

maintain any privy, privy vault, septic tank, cesspool, or other facility
intended or used for the disposal of sewage.
      (7)   When a public sewage system is not available for the premises,
which is defined as beyond 300 feet from the foundation of the building
premises containing a toilet to be so connected, the building sewer shall be
connected to a private sewerage system complying with the provisions of the
regulations imposed by JIPSD and SCDHEC. Any tree removal required for
compliance shall be performed in accordance with Chapter 153 et al. of the town
code.
      (8)   The owner of any improved property shall maintain the private

the public sewer, at the owner’s expense, and shall remove all trees, shrubs,
tree and shrub roots and other obstructions to the building drain and sanitary
sewage system. Any tree removal required for compliance shall be performed in
accordance with Chapter 153 et al. of the town code.
         (a)   In the event of a complaint or upon notice by the town, the Town
Code Enforcement Officer may inspect the sanitary sewerage system in its
entirety to determine the need for maintenance, or repair, including the
proximity of the building premises to the public sewer.
         (b)   All private sewerage systems must receive an inspection as
recommended by SCDHEC every three years, and the owner thereof shall provide
documentation of such inspection upon request by the Town Code Enforcement
Officer within ten calendar days of such request. Property owners shall provide

as referenced in division (C)(8)(b) evidencing a licensed inspection of the
private sewerage system within three years prior to such request, or within ten
days after such request, shall entitle the town to require an inspection

to the town and timeline for repair(s) must be approved by the Town Code
Enforcement Officer.
      (9)   In the event the owner has documentation or other acceptable proof
of an acceptable inspection with the time prescribed in division (C)(8)(b), yet
the Town Code Enforcement Officer has reason to believe additional inspection
is warranted, the town may perform such inspection as is required in the town’s
discretion at the town’s expense and impose the necessity of repair or
maintenance at the homeowner’s expense in accord with and pursuant to division
(C)(8)(a) and (d).
   (D)   In the event the owner fails to comply with the directive(s) of the
Town Code Enforcement Officer after notice pursuant to §

2022.
      (2)   A BASELINE INSPECTION means a thorough evaluation of an operating
private sewage system to determine whether the system is functioning as
designed, is not exhibiting signs of failure, and is being operated properly. A
pump out of the system is required for a baseline inspection to properly
examine the interior of the tank and to check for leaks from the house or
saturated conditions in the drainfield. All inspections and pump outs must be
performed by septic contractors with valid SCDHEC licenses.
      (3)   Town Council appropriates $150,000 to pay for baseline inspections
for septic systems in the James Island Creek TMDL under town jurisdiction from
unencumbered capital project funds in the 2021/2022 budget year.

owner from depositing litter on such private property as an enhancement if the
depositing does not violate applicable local or state health and safety
regulations.
   (C)   The responsibility for the removal of litter from property or
receptacles shall be upon the person responsible for littering the property or
receptacles. However, if the person responsible for littering the property or

GENERAL BUSINESS LICENSES
§ 110.01 LICENSE REQUIRED.
    Intending to engage in any business, calling, occupation, profession, or
activity engaged in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage, in whole or
in part within the limits of the town is required to pay an annual license tax
for the privilege of doing business and obtain a business license as herein
provided.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021)
§ 110.02 DEFINITIONS.
    For the purposes of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BUSINESS. Any business, calling, occupation, profession, or activity engaged
in with the object of gain, benefit, or advantage, either directly or
indirectly.
   CHARITABLE ORGANIZATION. An organization that is determined by the Internal
Revenue Service to be exempt from federal income taxes under 26 U.S.C. § 501(c)
(3), (4), (6), (7), (8), (10) or (19).
   CHARITABLE PURPOSE. A benevolent, philanthropic, patriotic, or eleemosynary
purpose that does not result in personal gain to a sponsor, organizer, officer,
director, trustee, or person with ultimate control of the organization.
   CLASSIFICATION. That division of businesses by NAICS codes subject to the
same license rate as determined by a calculated index of ability to pay based
on national averages, benefits, equalization of tax burden, relationships of
services, or other basis deemed appropriate by the Council.
   COUNCIL. The Town Council of the Town of James Island.
   DOMICILE." A principal place from which the trade or business of a licensee
is conducted, directed, or managed. For purposes of this subchapter, a licensee
may be deemed to have more than one DOMICILE.
   GROSS INCOME. The gross receipts or gross revenue of a business, received or
accrued, for one calendar or fiscal year collected or to be collected from
business done within the municipality. If the licensee has a domicile within
the municipality, business done within the municipality shall include all gross
receipts or revenue received or accrued by such licensee. If the licensee does
not have a domicile within the municipality, business done within the
municipality shall include only gross receipts or revenue received or accrued
within the municipality. In all cases, if the licensee pays a business license
tax to another county or municipality, then the licensee’s gross income for the
purpose of computing the tax within the municipality must be reduced by the
amount of revenues or receipts taxed in the other county or municipality and
fully reported to the municipality. GROSS INCOME for business license tax
purposes shall not include taxes collected for a governmental entity, escrow
funds, or funds that are the property of a third party. The value of bartered
goods or trade-in merchandise shall be included in gross income. The gross
receipts or gross revenues for business license purposes may be verified by
inspection of returns and reports filed with the Internal Revenue Service, the
South Carolina Department of Revenue, the South Carolina Department of
Insurance, or other government agencies, in calculating gross income for
certain businesses, the following rules shall apply:
      (1)   GROSS INCOME for agents shall be calculated on gross commissions
received or retained, unless otherwise specified. If commissions are divided
with other brokers or agents, then only the amount retained by the broker or
agent is considered GROSS INCOME.
      (2)   Except as specifically required by S.C. Code § 38-7-20, GROSS
INCOME for insurance companies shall be calculated on gross premiums written.
      (3)   GROSS INCOME for manufacturers of goods or materials with a
location in the town shall be calculated on the lesser of (a) gross revenues or
receipts received or accrued from business done at the location, (b) the amount
of income allocated and apportioned to that location by the business for
purposes of the business’ state income tax return, or (c) the amount of
expenses attributable to the location as a cost center of the business.
Licensees reporting gross income under this provision shall have the burden to
establish the amount and method of calculation by satisfactory records and
proof. Manufacturers include those taxpayers reporting a manufacturing
principal business activity code on their federal income tax returns.
   LICENSE OFFICIAL. A person designated to administer this subchapter.
Notwithstanding the designation of a primary license official, the municipality
may designate one or more alternate license officials to administer particular
types of business licenses, including without limitation for business licenses
issued to businesses subject to business license taxes under Article 20,
Chapter 9, Title 58, and Chapters 7 and 45, Title 38, of the South Carolina
Code.

business in the absence of the principal.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021)
§ 110.03 PURPOSE; DURATION.
    The business license required by this subchapter is for the purpose of
providing such regulation as may be required for the business subject thereto
and for the purpose of raising revenue for the general fund through a privilege
tax. The 2021 license year shall extend to end on April 30, 2022. Thereafter,
the license periods shall be established as follows. Except as set forth below
for business licenses issued to contractors with respect to specific
construction projects, each yearly license shall be issued for the 12-month
period of May 1 to April 30. A business license issued for a construction
contract may, at the request of the licensee, be stated to expire at the
completion of the construction project; provided, any such business license may
require that the licensee file, by each April 30 during the continuation of the
construction project, a statement of compliance, including but not limited to a
revised estimate of the value of the contract. If any revised estimate of the
final value of such project exceeds the amount for which the business license
was issued, the licensee shall be required to pay a license fee at the then-
prevailing rate on the excess amount. The provisions of this subchapter and the
rates herein shall remain in effect from year to year as amended by the
Council.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.04 BUSINESS LICENSE TAX; REFUND.
   (A)   The required business license tax shall be paid for each business
subject hereto according to the applicable rate classification on or before the
due date of the thirtieth day of April in each year, except for those
businesses in Rate Class 8 for which a different due date is specified. Late
payments shall be subject to penalties as set forth in §
110.12, except that admitted insurance companies may pay before June 1 without
penalty.
   (B)   A separate license shall be required for each place of business and
for each classification or business conducted at one place. If gross income
cannot be separated for classifications at one location, the business license
tax shall be computed on the combined gross income for the classification
requiring the highest rate. The business license tax must be computed based on
the licensee’s gross income for the calendar year preceding the due date, for
the licensee’s 12-month fiscal year preceding the due date, or on a 12-month
projected income based on the monthly average for a business in operation for
less than one year. The business license tax for a new business must be
computed on the estimated probable gross income for the balance of the license
year. A business license related to construction contract projects may be
issued on a per-project basis, at the option of the taxpayer. No refund shall
be made for a business that is discontinued.
   (C)   A licensee that submits a payment greater than the amount owed may
request a refund. To be considered, a refund request must be submitted in
writing to the municipality before the June 1 immediately following the April
30 on which the payment was due and must be supported by adequate documentation
supporting the refund request. The municipality shall approve or deny the
refund request, and if approved shall issue the refund to the business, within
30 days after receipt of the request.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.05 REGISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (A)    The owner, agent, or legal representative of every business subject
to this subchapter, whether listed in the classification index or not, shall
register the business and make application for a business license on or before
the due date of each year; provided, a new business shall be required to have a
business license prior to operation within the municipality, and an annexed
business shall be required to have a business license within 30 days of the
annexation. A license for a bar (NAICS 722410) must be issued in the name of
the individual who has been issued the corresponding state alcohol, beer, or
wine permit or license and will have actual control and management of the
business.
   (B)   Application shall be on the then-current standard business license
application as established and provided by the Director of the South Carolina
Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office and shall be accompanied by all information
about the applicant, the licensee, and the business deemed appropriate to carry
out the purpose of this subchapter by the license official. Applicants may be
required to submit copies of portions of state and federal income tax returns
reflecting gross receipts and gross revenue figures.
   (C)   The applicant shall certify under oath that the information given in
the application is true, that the gross income is accurately reported (or
estimated for a new business) without any unauthorized deductions, and that all
assessments, personal property taxes on business property, and other monies due
and payable to the municipality have been paid.
   (D)   The municipality shall allow application, reporting, calculation, and
payment of business license taxes through the business license tax portal
hosted and managed by the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office,
subject to the availability and capability thereof. Any limitations in portal
availability or capability do not relieve the applicant or licensee from
existing business license or business license tax obligations.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.06 DEDUCTIONS; EXEMPTIONS; CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS.
   (A)    No deductions from gross income shall be made except income earned
outside of the municipality on which a license tax is paid by the business to
some other municipality or county and fully reported to the municipality, taxes
collected for a governmental entity, or income which cannot be included for
computation of the tax pursuant to state or federal law. Properly apportioned
income from business in interstate commerce shall be included in the
calculation of gross income and is not exempted. The applicant shall have the
burden to establish the right to exempt income by satisfactory records and
proof.
   (B)   No person shall be exempt from the requirements of this subchapter by
reason of the lack of an established place of business within the municipality,
unless exempted by state or federal law. The license official shall determine
the appropriate classification for each business in accordance with the latest
issue of NAICS. No person shall be exempt from this subchapter by reason of the
payment of any other tax, unless exempted by state law, and no person shall be
relieved of liability for payment of any other tax or fee by reason of
application of this subchapter.
   (C)   Wholesalers are exempt from business license taxes unless they
maintain warehouses or distribution establishments within the municipality. A
wholesale transaction involves a sale to an individual who will resell the
goods and includes delivery of the goods to the reseller. It does not include a
sale of goods to a user or consumer.
   (D)   A charitable organization shall be exempt from the business license
tax on its gross income unless it is deemed a business subject to a business
license tax on all or part of its gross income as provided in this section. A
charitable organization, or any affiliate of a charitable organization, that
reports income from for-profit activities or unrelated business income for
federal income tax purposes to the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed a
business subject to a business license tax on the part of its gross income from
such for-profit activities or unrelated business income.
   (E)   A charitable organization shall be deemed a business subject to a
business license tax on its total gross income if (1) any net proceeds of
operation, after necessary expenses of operation, inure to the benefit of any
individual or any entity that is not itself a charitable organization as
defined in this subchapter, or (2) any net proceeds of operation, after
necessary expenses of operation, are used for a purpose other than a charitable
purpose as defined in this subchapter. Excess benefits or compensation in any
form beyond fair market value to a sponsor, organizer, officer, director,
trustee, or person with ultimate control of the organization shall not be
deemed a necessary expense of operation.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.07 FALSE APPLICATION UNLAWFUL.
    It shall be unlawful for any person subject to the provisions of this
subchapter to make a false application for a business license or to give or
file, or direct the giving or filing of, any false information with respect to
the license or tax required by this subchapter.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021)
§ 110.08 DISPLAY AND TRANSFER.
   (A)    All persons shall display the license issued to them on the original
form provided by the license official in a conspicuous place in the business
establishment at the address shown on the license. A transient or non-resident
shall carry the license upon his or her person or in a vehicle used in the
business readily available for inspection by any authorized agent of the
municipality.
   (B)   A change of address must be reported to the license official within
ten days after removal of the business to a new location and the license will
be valid at the new address upon written notification by the license official
and compliance with zoning and building codes. Failure to obtain the approval
of the license official for a change of address shall invalidate the license
and subject the licensee to prosecution for doing business without a license. A
business license shall not be transferable, and a transfer of controlling
interest shall be considered a termination of the old business and the
establishment of a new business requiring a new business license, based on old
business income.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.09 ADMINISTRATION OF SUBCHAPTER.
    The license official shall administer the provisions of this subchapter,
collect business license taxes, issue licenses, make or initiate investigations
and audits to ensure compliance, initiate denial or suspension and revocation
procedures, report violations to the municipal attorney, assist in prosecution
of violators, produce forms, undertake reasonable procedures relating to the
administration of this subchapter, and perform such other duties as may be duly
assigned.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021)
§ 110.10 INSPECTION AND AUDITS.
   (A)    For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this subchapter, the
license official or other authorized agent of the municipality is empowered to
enter upon the premises of any person subject to this subchapter to make
inspections and to examine and audit books and records. It shall be unlawful
for any such person to fail or refuse to make available the necessary books and
records. In the event an audit or inspection reveals that the licensee has
filed false information, the costs of the audit shall be added to the correct
business license tax and late penalties in addition to other penalties provided
herein. Each day of failure to pay the proper amount of business license tax
shall constitute a separate offense.
   (B)   The license official shall have the authority to make inspections and
conduct audits of businesses to ensure compliance with this subchapter.
Financial information obtained by inspections and audits shall not be deemed
public records, and the license official shall not release the amount of
business license taxes paid or the reported gross income of any person by name
without written permission of the licensee, except as authorized by this
subchapter, state or federal law, or proper judicial order. Statistics compiled
by classifications are public records.

§ 110.11 ASSESSMENTS; PAYMENT UNDER PROTEST; APPEAL.
   (A)    Assessments, payments under protest, and appeals of assessment shall
be allowed and conducted by the municipality pursuant to the provisions of S.C.
Code § 6-1-410, as amended. In preparing an assessment, the license official
may examine such records of the business or any other available records as may
be appropriate and conduct such investigations and statistical surveys as the
license official may deem appropriate to assess a business license tax and
penalties as provided herein.
   (B)   The license official shall establish a uniform local procedure
consistent with S.C. Code § 6-1-410 for hearing an application for adjustment
of assessment and issuing a notice of final assessment; provided that for
particular types of business licenses, including without limitation for
business licenses issued to businesses subject to business license taxes under
Article 20, Chapter 9, Title 58, and Chapters 7 and 45, Title 38, of the South
Carolina Code, the municipality, by separate ordinance, may establish a
different procedure and may delegate one or more rights, duties, and functions
hereunder to the Municipal Association of South Carolina.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.12 DELINQUENT LICENSE TAXES; PARTIAL PAYMENT.
   (A)    For non-payment of all or any part of the correct business license
tax, the license official shall impose and collect a late penalty of 5% of the
unpaid tax for each month or portion thereof after the due date until paid not
to exceed 100% of original license fee. Penalties shall not be waived. If any
business license tax remains unpaid for 60 days after its due date, the license
official shall report it to the municipal attorney for appropriate legal
action.
   (B)   Partial payment may be accepted by the license official to toll
imposition of penalties on the portion paid; provided, however, no business
license shall be issued or renewed until the full amount of the tax due, with
penalties, has been paid.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021) Penalty, see §
110.99
§ 110.13 NOTICES.
    The license official may, but shall not be required to, mail written
notices that business license taxes are due. If notices are not mailed, there
shall be published a notice of the due date in a newspaper of general
circulation within the municipality three times prior to the due date in each
year. Failure to receive notice shall not constitute a defense to prosecution
for failure to pay the tax due or grounds for waiver of penalties.
(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021)
§ 110.14 DENIAL OF LICENSE.
   (A)    The license official may deny a license to an applicant when the
license official determines:
      (1)   The application is incomplete or contains a misrepresentation,
false or misleading statement, or evasion or suppression of a material fact;
      (2)   The activity for which a license is sought is unlawful or
constitutes a public nuisance per se or per accidens;
      (3)   The applicant, licensee, prior licensee, or the person in control

premises and has not taken remedial measures necessary to correct such
activity; or
      (7)   The license for the business or for a similar business of the
licensee in the municipality or another jurisdiction has been denied,
suspended, or revoked in the previous license year.

      (5)   A licensee has engaged in an unlawful activity or nuisance related
to the business; or
      (6)   A licensee is delinquent in the payment to the municipality of any
tax or fee; the license official may give written notice to the licensee or the
person in control of the business within the municipality by personal service
or mail that the license is suspended pending a single hearing before Council
or its designee for the purpose of determining whether the suspension should be
upheld and the license should be revoked.
   (B)   The written notice of suspension and proposed revocation shall state
the time and place at which the hearing is to be held, and shall contain a
brief statement of the reasons for the suspension and proposed revocation and a
copy of the applicable provisions of this subchapter.

written decision based on findings of fact and conclusions on application of
the standards herein. The written decision shall be served, by personal service
or by mail, upon all parties or their representatives and shall constitute the
final decision of the municipality.
   (C)   Timely appeal of a decision of Council or its designee does not
effectuate a stay of that decision. The decision of the Council or its designee

(Ord. 2021-09, passed 11-18-2021)
§ 110.20 CLASSIFICATION AND RATES.
   (A)   The business license tax for each class of businesses subject to this
subchapter shall be computed in accordance with the current business license
rate schedule, designated as
Appendix A to this section, which may be amended from time to time by the
Council.
   (B)   The current business license class schedule is attached to this
section as Appendix B. Hereafter, no later than December 31 of each odd year,
the municipality shall adopt, by ordinance, the latest standardized business
license class schedule as recommended by the Municipal Association of South
Carolina and adopted by the Director of the South Carolina Revenue and Fiscal
Affairs Office. Upon adoption by the municipality, the revised business license
class schedule shall then be appended to this section as a replacement Appendix
B.
   (C)   The classifications included in each rate class are listed with NAICS
codes, by sector, sub-sector, group, or industry. The business license class
schedule (Appendix B) is a tool for classification and not a limitation on
businesses subject to a business license tax. The classification in the most
recent version of the business license class schedule adopted by the Council
that most specifically identifies the subject business shall be applied to the
business. The license official shall have the authority to make the
determination of the classification most specifically applicable to a subject
business.
   (D)   A copy of the class schedule and rate schedule shall be filed in the
office of the Town Clerk.

   Class 8 Rates
Each NAICS number designates a separate subclassification. The businesses in
this section are treated as separate and individual subclasses due to
provisions of state law, regulatory requirements, service burdens, tax
equalization considerations, and other factors that are deemed sufficient to
require individually determined rates. In accordance with state law, the
municipality also may provide for reasonable subclassifications for rates,
described by an NAICS sector, subsector, or industry, that are based on
particularized considerations as needed for economic stimulus or for the
enhanced or disproportionate demands on municipal services or infrastructure.
Non-resident rates do not apply except where indicated.
8.1      NAICS 230000 - Contractors, Construction, All Types (Non-resident
rates apply).
Resident rates, for contractors having a permanent place of business within the
municipality:
         Minimum on first $2,000   $45.00 plus
         Each additional $1,000   $1.50
Non-resident rates apply to contractors that do not have a permanent place of
business within the municipality. A trailer at the construction site or
structure in which the contractor temporarily resides is not a permanent place
of business under this subchapter.
No contractor shall be issued a business license until all state and municipal
qualification examination and trade license requirements have been met. Each
contractor shall post a sign in plain view on each job identifying the
contractor with the job.
Sub-contractors shall be licensed on the same basis as general or prime
contractors for the same job. No deductions shall be made by a general or prime
contractor for value of work performed by a sub-contractor.
No contractor shall be issued a business license until all performance and
indemnity bonds required by the Building Code have been filed and approved.
Zoning permits must be obtained when required by the Zoning Ordinance.
Each prime contractor shall file with the License Official a list of sub-
contractors furnishing labor or materials for each project.
For licenses issued on a per-job basis, the total tax for the full amount of
the contract shall be paid prior to commencement of work and shall entitle the
contractor to complete the job without regard to the normal license expiration
date. An amended report shall be filed for each new job and the appropriate
additional license fee per $1,000 of the contract amount shall be paid prior to
commencement of new work. Only one base tax shall be paid in a license year.
Licensees holding a per-job license shall file, by each April 30 during the
continuation of the construction project, a statement of compliance, including
but not limited to a revised estimate of the value of the contract. If any
revised estimate of the final value of such project exceeds the amount for
which the business license was issued, the licensee shall be required to pay a
license fee at the then-prevailing rate on the excess amount.

section the following terms shall have the meanings set forth below.
      AFFORDABLE. A compostable or recyclable product may cost up to l5% more
than the purchase cost of the non-compostable or nonrecyclable alternative(s)
and not be regarded, on balance, as exorbitant, overpriced, unreasonable or
invaluable.
      ASTM STANDARD. Meeting the standards of the American Society for Testing
and Materials (AS1M) International Standards D6400 or D6868 for compostable
plastics, as those standards may be amended.

license or registration of any building contractor who is found guilty of fraud
or deceit in obtaining a license, or gross negligence incompetence, or gross
misconduct in conducting his business as a contractor. Any person who alleges
gross negligence, incompetence, or gross misconduct against any contractor

can be reconsidered at six-month intervals thereafter.
         (c)   Probation. The Board may place any building contractor on

§ 153.004 APPLICABILITY; JURISDICTION.
   (A)   Generally. This chapter shall apply to all development, public and
private, on lands within the incorporated area of the town. All structures and
land uses constructed or commenced hereafter and all enlargements of, additions
to, changes in, and relocations of existing structures and uses occurring
hereafter shall be subject to this chapter and all other authorities pursuant
to S.C. Code Title 6, Chapter 29, as amended.
   (B)   New or moved structures. All structures built hereafter shall comply
with all of the regulations of this chapter. Any structure moved from one site
to another site, including movement within a zoning lot, shall be considered to

§ 153.006 COMMENTARY.
   Commentaries may be included in this chapter whenever a provision requires
additional explanation to clarify its intent. Commentaries have no regulatory
effect, but rather are intended solely as a guide for administrative officials
and the public to use in understanding and interpreting provisions of the
Zoning and Land Development Regulations.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 1.6, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2012-21, passed 12-20-2012)

contained in this chapter shall be construed according to the purpose and
intent set out in §
153.005.
   (B)   Headings, illustrations, and text. In case of any difference of
meaning or implication between the text of this chapter and any heading,
drawing, table, figure, or illustration, the text shall control.
   (C)   Lists and examples. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, lists of
terms or examples that use terms such as “including,” “such as,” or similar
language are intended to provide examples, not to be exhaustive lists of all
possibilities.
   (D)   Computation of time. All references to “days” are, to the town
government, work days unless otherwise expressly stated. The time in which an
act is to be done shall be computed by excluding the first day and including
the last day. If the last day is a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday observed by the
town government, that day shall be excluded.
   (E)   References to other regulations, publications, and documents. Whenever
reference is made to a resolution, ordinance, statute, regulation, or document,
that reference shall be construed as referring to the most recent editions of
such regulation (as amended), resolution, ordinance, statute, regulation, or
document or to the relevant document, unless otherwise expressly stated, except
for the Building Code, which has its edition mandated by the state.
   (F)   Delegation of authority. Authority to enforce the provisions of this
chapter falls to the Zoning Administrator or the designee for which the
responsibility of executing the provision falls.
   (G)   Technical and non-technical terms. Words and phrases shall be
construed according to the common and approved usage of the language, but
technical words and phrases that may have acquired a peculiar and appropriate
meaning in law shall be construed and understood according to such meaning.
Certain words and phrases are defined in §
153.013 of this code; those words and phrases shall be construed in accordance
with their definitions in §
153.013.
   (H)   Public officials and agencies. All public officials, bodies, and
agencies to which references are made are those of the town, unless otherwise
expressly provided. Whenever reference is made to a public official’s title or
name of a public agency, that reference shall be construed as referring to the
most up-to-date title or agency name, or to the relevant successor official or
agency.
   (I)   Mandatory and discretionary terms.
      (1)   The words SHALL, WILL, and MUST are mandatory.

events apply.
      (2)   OR indicates that one or more of the connected items, conditions,
provisions or events may apply.
   (K)   Tenses and plurals. Words used in one tense (past, present, or future)
include all other tenses, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary.
The singular includes the plural and the plural includes the singular.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 1.7, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2012-21, passed 12-20-2012)
§ 153.008 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS.
   The standards of this chapter are minimum requirements. The issuance of any
permit, certificate, or approval in accordance with the standards and
requirements of this chapter shall not relieve the recipient of responsibility
for complying with all other applicable requirements of any other town, state,
or federal agency.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 1.8, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2012-21, passed 12-20-2012)
§ 153.009 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Conflict with state or federal regulations. If the provisions of this
chapter are inconsistent with those of the state or federal government, the
more restrictive provision shall control, to the extent permitted by law.
   (B)   Conflict with other town regulations. If the provisions of this
chapter are inconsistent with one another, or if they conflict with provisions
found in other adopted ordinances or regulations of the town, the more
restrictive provision will control. No text amendment, zoning variance, or
condition of approval attached to any form of development approval under this
chapter shall have the effect of nullifying, abrogating, or diminishing the
provisions of any other town ordinance.
   (C)   Conflict with private easements, agreements, or covenants. This
chapter is not intended to abrogate, annul, or otherwise interfere with any
private easement, agreement, covenant, restriction, or other private legal
relationship. The town is responsible for enforcing this chapter; it does not
enforce private agreements, easements, covenants, or restrictions to which the
town is not a party. Restrictive covenant affidavit(s) shall be signed by the
applicant or current property owner(s) for all permit applications including
but not limited to zoning variance applications, applications for rezoning,
special exception applications, site plan review applications, subdivision
applications, and home occupation permits in compliance with S.C. Code § 6-29-
1145 that states:
      “A.   In an application for a permit, the local planning agency must
inquire in the application or by written instructions to an applicant whether
the tract or parcel of land is restricted by any recorded covenant that is
contrary to, conflicts with, or prohibits the permitted activity.
      B.   If a local planning agency has actual notice of a restrictive
covenant on a tract or parcel of land that is contrary to, conflicts with, or
prohibits the permitted activity:
      1.   In the application for the permit;
      2.   From materials or information submitted by the person or persons
requesting the permit; or
      3.   From any other source including, but not limited to, other property
holders, the local planning agency must not issue the permit unless the local
planning agency receives confirmation from the applicant that the restrictive
covenant has been released for the tract or parcel of land by action of the
appropriate authority or property holders or by court order.
      C.   As used in this section:
      1.   ‘actual notice’ is not constructive notice of documents filed in
local offices concerning the property, and does not require the local planning
agency to conduct searches in any records offices for filed restrictive
covenants;
      2.   ‘permit’ does not mean an authorization to build or place a
structure on a tract or parcel of land; and
      3.   ‘restrictive covenant’ does not mean a restriction concerning a type
of structure that may be built or placed on a tract or parcel of land.”
(Ord. 2012-06, § 1.9, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2012-21, passed 12-20-2012)
§ 153.010 ZONING MAP.
   (A)   Adoption. The town is hereby divided into zoning districts as shown on
the town’s official zoning map, which, together with all explanatory matter
thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
chapter.
   (B)   Format. The official zoning map is maintained in the form of a machine
readable representation of a geographic phenomenon stored for display or
analysis by a digital computer. The digital zoning database stored in the
Geographic Information System (GIS) is hereby designated, established, and
incorporated as a part of these regulations and originals thereof, which are on
file at the Planning/Zoning Department, shall be as much a part of these
regulations as if they were fully described in these regulations. Upon adoption
of this chapter and any amendment thereto, the Planning/Zoning Department may
produce a paper version of the official zoning map.
   (C)   Amendments. If amendments are made in zoning district boundaries in
accordance with the procedures of §
153.043, such amendments shall be effective upon final approval of the
ordinance by Town Council and shall be updated by the Planning/Zoning
Department on the zoning database promptly after the amendment has been
approved by Town Council.
   (D)   Location. The original version of the official zoning map shall be
stored in the office of the Planning/Zoning Department. The official zoning map
shall be updated at least annually. In case of any dispute regarding the zoning
classification of property subject to this chapter, the official zoning map
maintained by the Planning/Zoning Department shall control.
   (E)   Corrections and replacement. In the event that the official zoning map
becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, the Town Council may, by resolution, adopt a
new official zoning map, which shall supersede the prior official zoning map.
The new official zoning map may correct drafting and other errors or omissions
in the prior official zoning map, but no such correction shall have the effect
of amending the original official zoning map, as amended. The new official
zoning map shall be marked, “This Official Zoning Map, adopted by resolution of
the Town Council of the Town of James Island, South Carolina, on (date)
supersedes the Official Zoning Map adopted (date) of the Town of James Island,”
which statement shall be signed by the Mayor, attested by the Town Clerk, and
bear the seal of the town. Unless the prior official zoning map is lost or has
been totally destroyed, the map or any significant parts thereof remaining
after partial destruction shall be preserved, together with all records of the
town regarding its adoption and amendment.
   (F)   Interpretation of zoning district boundaries.  Where uncertainty
exists with respect to the boundary of any zoning district shown on the zoning
map, the following rules shall apply.
      (1)   Unless otherwise indicated, district boundaries follow lot lines;
center lines of streets, highways, alleys, or railroads; center lines of water
courses or impoundments of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water.
      (2)   Where so indicated, district boundaries are parallel to the center
lines of streets, highways, or railroads, or rights-of-way of same, or the
center lines of streams, reservoirs, or other bodies of water, or said lines
extended as such distances therefrom as indicated on the zoning map. If no
distance is given, distance shall be determined by the use of the scale on the
zoning map.
      (3)   Where any district boundary is indicated on the zoning map as
approximately following the town boundary line or the corporate limits line of
any incorporated place within the town, then such town boundary line or
corporate limits line shall be construed to be the actual district boundary.
   (G)   Marsh boundaries. With the exception of lands within the ownership of
national forests, swampland, wildlife refuges and any other publicly designated
areas, the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) shall
determine the boundaries and have jurisdiction over critical areas. Fresh water
wetlands shall have boundaries set by the Army Corps of Engineers.
   (H)   Zoning of additional land areas. It is the intent of this chapter that
every part of the land area of the incorporated town be included in one of the
zoning districts established by this chapter. Any land area that comes under
the jurisdiction of this chapter or does not appear to be included in a zoning
district shall be classified in the NRM-25 District unless an alternative
classification is approved by the Town Council in accordance with the zoning
map amendment procedures of §§
153.040 through
153.055. The Town Council reserves the right to annex property and such annexed
tracts, parcels, or lots of land may be annexed with zoning categories being
similar in use, planned use, or vested right.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 1.10, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2012-21, passed 12-20-2012)
§ 153.011 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Violations continue. Any violation of the previous zoning ordinance or
subdivision ordinance will continue to be a violation under this chapter and be
subject to penalties and enforcement under §§
153.375 through
153.383 and
153.999, unless the use, development, construction, or other activity complies
with the provisions of this chapter, in which case enforcement action shall
cease, except to the extent of collecting penalties for violations that
occurred before October 18, 2012.
   (B)   Legal nonconforming under prior ordinance. Any legal nonconformity
under the previous zoning ordinance will also be a legal nonconformity under
this chapter, as long as the situation that resulted in the nonconforming
status under the previous zoning ordinance continues to exist. If a
nonconformity under the previous zoning ordinance becomes conforming because of
the adoption of this chapter, then the situation will no longer be considered a
nonconformity.
   (C)   Approved projects.
      (1)   Variances and preliminary subdivision plats that have received
approval by the town shall remain valid until their expiration date.
Construction pursuant to such approval may be carried out in accordance with
the development standards in effect at the time that approval was granted,
provided that the permit or approval remains valid and has not lapsed. As of
October 18, 2012, all construction shall be subject to strict compliance with
the regulations of this chapter.
      (2)   No provision of this chapter shall require any change in the plans,
construction, or designated use of any structure for which a zoning permit or
building permit has been issued prior to October 18, 2012, provided that permit
does not lapse and remains valid.
      (3)   No previously approved lot shall be deemed an unusable lot under
the provisions of this chapter.
   (D)   Special exception uses.
      (1)   Any use that was legally established before October 18, 2012
without special exception use approval and which, after October 18, 2012, is
located in a zoning district that requires special exception approval for the
subject use shall not be considered nonconforming merely as a result of not
having secured special exception approval. Expansions and modifications of such
uses shall be subject to the nonconforming uses section of §§
153.355 through
153.361.
      (2)   Any use that was legally established before October 18, 2012, with
a conditional use permit and which, after October 18, 2012, is located within a
zoning district that requires special exception approval for the subject use
may continue to be operated under the terms of the original conditional use
permit. The use shall be subject to all applicable standards of this chapter.
Expansion and modifications of such uses shall be subject to the nonconforming
uses section of §§
153.355 through
153.361.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 1.11, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2012-21, passed 12-20-2012)
§ 153.012 SEVERABILITY.
   (A)   If any court of competent jurisdiction rules any provision of this
chapter invalid, that ruling shall not affect any provision not specifically
included in the judgment. If any court of competent jurisdiction rules invalid
the application of any provision of this chapter to a particular property,
building, or other structure or use, that ruling shall not affect the
application of the chapter provisions to any property, building, other
structure, or use not specifically included in the judgment.
   (B)   The provisions of this chapter are hereby declared to be valid and
enforceable, notwithstanding inadvertent and/or clerical error(s); such error
(s) as may exist shall not affect the validity or intent of the associated
provisions, nor that of the remainder of the chapter provisions hereunder.

an application within the time required, the decision-making body shall be free
to proceed with its own action on the matter without further awaiting the
recommendation of the review body.

      (1)   Time limit. If a final decision-making body denies an application
for a zoning map amendment, planned development, or special exception use, an
application for the same or more intensive zoning, development, or use on the

or reduced in area, shall not be accepted for 12 months from the date that the
decision-making body acted to deny the application.
      (2)   Waivers. The time limit of division (M)(1) above notwithstanding,
decision-making bodies may, after receipt of written petition by the property
owner, waive the waiting period requirement by a vote of members present and

written notice to the Zoning Administrator, directing staff to process the
application. All re-submissions shall be processed as new application, with
prescribed fees. All documents and fees required for the respective type of
application shall be included with the new application. Denial of the
application shall be final and the 12-month waiting period shall be met before
further consideration of a similar application on the subject property.
      (3)   Applications withdrawn before public hearing notice. Withdrawal of
an application by the applicant before advertisement of any public hearing and
before any required signs have been posted on the subject property shall be
considered a termination of the application. Although no fees shall be
refunded, re-application in such cases shall not be subject to the 12-month
waiting period.
      (4)   Applications withdrawn after public hearing notice. Postponement
requests and withdrawals of applications that occur after advertisement of any
public hearing or after any required signs have been posted on the subject
property shall be treated the same as a denied application. Application
processing shall terminate upon receipt of written notice from the applicant or
owner. Reapplication shall be subject to a 12-month waiting period unless a

made in writing and the letter must be signed by both the property owner(s) and

meet the ten-day provision, the applicant must submit a new application in
compliance with division (E) above, “Application completeness and submission
deadlines,” and all applicable fees must be paid. The Planning Commission may
waive the required fees when the request for postponement is made due to
extenuating circumstances as determined in the sole discretion of the Planning

unnecessary hardship if the Board of Zoning Appeals makes and explains in
writing the following findings:
         (a)   There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to
the particular piece of property;
         (b)   These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the
vicinity;
         (c)   Because of these conditions, the application of this chapter to
the particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably
restrict the utilization of the property;
         (d)   The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the
zoning district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance;
         (e)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall not grant a variance the
effect of which would be to allow the establishment of a use not otherwise
permitted in a zoning district, to extend physically a nonconforming use of
land, or to change the zoning district boundaries shown on the official zoning
map;
         (f)   The need for the variance is not the result of the applicant’s
own actions; and
         (g)   Granting of the variance does not substantially conflict with
the Comprehensive Plan or the purposes of this chapter.
      (3)   In granting a variance, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach to
it such conditions regarding the location, character, or other features of the
proposed building or structure as the Board may consider advisable to protect
established property values in the surrounding area or to promote the public
health, safety, or general welfare.
   (G)   Factors not to be considered. The fact that property may be utilized
more profitably if a zoning variance is granted shall not be considered grounds
for granting a zoning variance.

must be in writing and be filed in the Office of the Zoning Administrator as a
public record. Final decisions shall be available for public inspection during

§ 153.066 MEASUREMENTS, COMPUTATIONS AND EXCEPTIONS; DIMENSIONAL STANDARDS
DEFINED.
   (A)   Density.  
      (1)   DENSITY refers to the number of dwelling units per unit of land
area. Density is calculated by dividing the number of dwelling units on a site
by the gross area (in acres) of highland (including retention ponds) of the
site on which the dwelling units are located. The number of dwelling units
allowed on a site is based on the presumption  that all other applicable
standards of this chapter shall be met. The maximum density established for a
district is not a guarantee that such densities may be obtained, nor shall the
inability of a development to achieve the stated maximum density be considered
sufficient justification for varying or otherwise adjusting other density,
intensity, or dimensional standards of this chapter.
      (2)   Additional dwelling units. Additional dwelling units may be placed
on a lot in which a principal dwelling unit is existing, provided that the
additional dwelling unit complies with all dimensional standards of the
applicable zoning district, as contained in these chapters, including all
density, setback, buffer, building coverage, stormwater standards, height
requirements, and waterfront development standards.
   (B)   Lot area.
      (1)   Measurement.  LOT AREA refers to the horizontal land area within
lot lines, including retention ponds.
      (2)   Exceptions. No zoning permit, building permit, or development
approval may be issued for a lot that does not meet the minimum lot area
requirements of this chapter except in the following cases:
         (a)   Nonconforming lots may be used in accordance with the provisions
contained in §§ 153.355 through 153.361 of this code.
         (b)   Utilities using land or unoccupied buildings covering less than
1,000 square feet of site area shall be exempt from minimum lot area standards.
      (3)   Absence of sewer or water. In the absence of public water or public
sewer, no zoning permit or building permit shall be issued until the lot meets
all applicable requirements of this chapter and the State Department of Health
and Environmental Control (DHEC).
   (C)   Setbacks.  SETBACKS refer to the unobstructed, unoccupied open area
between the furthermost projection of a structure and the property line of the
lot on which the structure is located, except as modified by the standards of
this section.
      (1)   Exceptions to setbacks. Every part of a required setback must be
open and unobstructed from the ground to the sky except as set out in this
division.
         (a)   Trees, shrubbery, or other landscape features may be located
within any required setback; however, they shall be selected for site specific
conditions. Plant material to be located adjacent to public drainage easements
and rights-of- way shall be selected and placed not to impede future access.
Additionally, vegetation planted within utility easements shall be selected and
sited to minimize pruning for future maintenance and clearance of such
utilities. The Zoning Administrator may require modifications (substitutions
and relocation) of plant material on proposed landscape plans when necessary to
ensure access and ease of maintenance to any easements and rights-of-way and to
preserve the public health, safety, and welfare.
         (b)   1.   Fences and walls may be located within any required
setback, provided that in residential, office, and commercial districts no
fence, wall, or hedge shall exceed:
               a.   Four feet in height when located within any front or street
side setback with the exception of chain link chain link fences, which can be
six feet in height; or
               b.   Eight feet in height when located in an interior side or
rear setback.
            2.   In all zoning districts, fences, hedges, and walls may be
located within any required setback, provided that no fence, wall, or hedge
shall obstruct the view of vehicular access to any roadway between three and
ten feet in height above grade. For the safety of pedestrian and vehicular
traffic, in residential zoning districts, an unobstructed vision clearance
triangle shall be maintained along intersections of residential driveways with
adjacent roadways. The vision clearance triangle shall be formed by the
connection of a perpendicular line measuring 15 feet from the point of
intersection at the edge of the travelway into the driveway and a 15-foot
parallel line away from the point of intersection along the roadway (see Figure
153.066.1). Residential driveways along roadways with a classification of
collector or higher may be subject to a greater distance of measurement.

         (c)   Driveways may be located in front and side setbacks.
         (d)   Sidewalks may be located within any required setback.
         (e)   Utility lines, wires, and associated structures, such as power
poles, may be located within any required setback.
         (f)   Uncovered porches, uncovered steps to building entrances,
uncovered patio decks, and uncovered balconies may extend up to five feet into
any required front, rear, or street side setback.
         (g)   Openwork fire balconies and fire escapes may extend up to five
feet into any required side setback.
         (h)   Sills, belt courses, cornices, buttresses, eaves, and other
architectural features may extend up to two feet into any required setback.
         (i)   Chimneys and flues may extend up to two feet into any required
setback.
         (j)   Satellite dish antennas may be placed in required rear setbacks.
         (k)   Mechanical equipment, including heating ventilation and air
conditioning (HVAC) equipment may be extended up to five feet into required
side or rear setbacks in all zoning districts.
      (2)   Contextual setbacks. Notwithstanding the front setback requirements
of the underlying zoning district, the front building line of any structure or
addition to a structure may be as close to the street as the front building
line of a structure located on any lot that is immediately adjacent to the
subject lot. If the subject lot is located between two developed lots, the
front building line of the structure that is set back further from the street
shall apply to the subject lot.
      (3)   Front setbacks on narrow streets. Where a lot abuts a dedicated
street (that has been accepted for street maintenance) with a right-of-way
width of less than 50 feet, the required front setback shall be measured from
the center line of the right-of-way, provided all building code and fire/safety
requirements are met.
      (4)   Setbacks on corner and double-frontage lots. On corner and double-
frontage lots, front setback standards will apply to each lot line that borders
a street. The remaining lot lines will be subject to side setback standards.
There is no rear lot line.
      (5)   Reduction for public purpose. When an existing setback is affected
because of conveyance to a federal, state, or local government for a public
purpose and the remaining setback is at least 50% of the required minimum
setback for the district in which it is located, then that remaining setback
will be deemed to satisfy the minimum setback standards of this chapter.
      (6)   Front setbacks on narrow ingress/egress easements. Where a lot
abuts an ingress/egress easement (that has not been accepted for street
maintenance) with a width of less than 50 feet, and is used as a primary access
point to the lot as indicated on an approved plat recorded prior to October 18,
2012 (with dashed or solid lines), the required front setback shall be measured
from the center line of the easement, provided all building code and fire/
safety requirements are met. There shall be a minimum 25- foot setback between
the edge of the easement to the front of any structure.
   (D)   Building height.
      (1)   In general.  BUILDING HEIGHT refers to the vertical distance
between the base flood elevation and:
         (a)   The average height level between the eaves and ridge line of a
gable, hip, or gambrel roof;
         (b)   The highest point of a mansard roof; or
         (c)   The highest point of the coping of a flat roof.

      (2)   Fences or walls. Height shall be measured from ground level on the
higher side of the fence or wall.
      (3)   Exceptions to height limits. Unless otherwise expressly stated, the
height limitations of this chapter shall not apply to any of the following:
         (a)   Farm buildings in any agricultural zoning (A) district;
         (b)   Electrical power transmission lines;
         (c)   Belfries, cupolas, spires, domes, monuments, flagpoles,
chimneys, decorative fence post caps not to exceed 25% of the fence height,
radio/television receiving antennas, or chimney flues not for human habitation;
or
         (d)   Bulkhead, elevator, water tank, or any other similar structure
or necessary mechanical appurtenance extending above the roof of any building,
if such structure does not occupy more than 33% of the area of the roof.
   (E)   Building coverage.  BUILDING COVERAGE refers to the area of a lot
covered by buildings (principal and accessory) or roofed areas, as measured
along the outside wall at ground level, and including all projections, other
than open porches, fire escapes, canopies, and the first two feet of a roof
overhang.

§ 153.078 PD, PLANNED DEVELOPMENT ZONING DISTRICT.
   (A)   Authority.
      (1)   The state’s Local Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act of
1994, as amended, (“Planning Act”) authorizes local governments to utilize
zoning and planning techniques (not limited to those found in the Planning Act)
for implementation of the goals specified in S.C. Code § 6-29-720 (2007). The
Town Council hereby establishes a zoning and planning technique called a
“Planned Development” Zoning District. The Planned Development Zoning District
incorporates provisions of the planning technique called “planned development
district” referred to in the Planning Act and identified in this chapter and
the additional provisions found in this section that expands, varies, and/or
differs from the provisions found in the references to planned development
districts in the Planning Act. A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT, as applied herein, is a
type of zoning district (PD) and a type of development plan. PD zoning
districts are inextricably linked to planned development plans, in that no
rights of development apply to a PD zoning designation other than those of the
approved planned development plan.
      (2)   Planned development provisions are intended to encourage innovative
site planning for residential, commercial, institutional, and/or industrial
developments within planned developments. Planned developments may provide for
variations from other ordinances and the regulations of other established
zoning districts concerning use, setbacks, lot size, density, bulk, and other
requirements to accommodate flexibility in the arrangement of uses for the
general purpose of promoting and protecting the public health, safety, and
general welfare. A PLANNED DEVELOPMENT as used in this chapter is intended to
apply the flexibility and variation provisions of the Planning Act provided in
the planned development zoning district provision, along with the additional
regulatory and procedural provisions of this section.
   (B)   Purpose and intent. The town finds and determines that this section is
consistent with the following goals of the Comprehensive Plan:
      (1)   To preserve the essential character of this sea island (Residential
Land Use Goal 1);
      (2)   To encourage use of innovative site planning techniques to achieve
quality development that is sensitive to this unique environment (Residential
Land Use Goal 1);
      (3)   To support island commerce in serving the local market as the need
arises (Commercial Goal 1); and
      (4)   To ensure that if and when agricultural land is developed it is
done in a manner sensitive to the natural habitat and environment (Agricultural
Land Goal 1).
   (C)   Intent and results. The PD, Planned Development, Zoning District
regulations of this section are intended to encourage achievement of the goals
of the town’s Comprehensive Plan and to allow flexibility in development of
property that proposes a single or multiple use(s) that will result in improved
design, character, and quality of new or redesigned developments and preserve
natural and scenic features of open spaces. The following objectives may be
attained through the use of the planned development process:
      (1)   A maximum choice in the types of environment available to the
public by allowing a development that would not be possible under the strict
application of the standards of this chapter that were designated primarily for
development on individual lots;
      (2)   A greater freedom in selecting the means to provide access, light,
open space, and design amenities;
      (3)   Quality design and environmentally sensitive development by
allowing development to take advantage of special site characteristics,
locations, and land use arrangements;
      (4)   A development pattern in harmony with the applicable goals and
strategies of the Comprehensive Plan;
      (5)   The permanent preservation of common open space, recreation areas,
and facilities;
      (6)   An efficient use of the land resulting in more economical networks
of utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings, and other
facilities;
      (7)   A creative approach to the use of land and related physical
facilities that results in better development and design and the construction
of amenities; and
      (8)   A development pattern that incorporates adequate public safety and
transportation-related measures in its design and does not adversely affect
existing infrastructure and compliments the developed properties in the
vicinity and the natural features of the site.
   (D)   Applicability. There is a minimum three- acre lot size requirement
(combined) for a planned development as long as the planned development meets
all requirements of this section.
   (E)   Development standards.
      (1)   Dimensional standards.
         (a)   The waterfront development standards of the base zoning
district, as set forth in §
153.079 of this code, shall be applied to all waterfront lots within the
planned development.
         (b)   Each lot located on the perimeter of the planned development
shall maintain the rear yard setback requirements and any buffer requirements
of the adjacent zoning district.
      (2)   Architectural standards. The architectural design guidelines of §§
153.330 through
153.342 shall apply to all proposed planned developments. Modifications to the
architectural design guidelines may be proposed in a planned development
request where the Zoning Administrator determines that the architectural design
of the proposed development is compatible with the architectural design of
development on adjacent properties.
      (3)   Access.
         (a)   Streets within planned develop- ments should connect to
adjoining neighborhoods/ developments. Cul-de-sacs, T-turnarounds, and dead-end
streets are discouraged.
         (b)   Areas between structures shall be covered by easements where
necessary for access and to provide for maintenance and utility service.
         (c)   Primary vehicular access to office, commercial, or industrial
development shall be through limited access roads.
      (4)   Commercial areas.
         (a)   Commercial areas and adjacent residential, office, and
industrial areas shall be directly connected through paved sidewalks, trails,
or other pedestrian infrastructure.
         (b)   Commercial areas shall be planned as groups having common
parking areas and common ingress and egress points.
      (5)   Industrial areas.
         (a)   A minimum vegetated buffer of 40 feet shall be required where
industrial uses abut residential uses.
         (b)   All intervening spaces between the right-of-way line and project
building line and intervening spaces between buildings, drives, parking areas,
and improved areas shall be landscaped with trees and plantings and properly
maintained at all times.
      (6)   Areas designated for future use. All areas designated for future
expansion or not intended for immediate improvement or development shall remain
in a natural state until such time as development permits are approved.
      (7)   Signs. Specifications of size, type, height, setback, location,
design, illumination, and number of signs shall be included in the planned
development guidelines. Specifications shall be as restrictive or more
restrictive than the standards set forth in this chapter.
      (8)   Parking. Parking shall be provided in accordance with the standards
set forth in §§
153.330 through
153.342 of this code. Modifications to the parking standards of §§
153.330 through
153.342 may be proposed in a planned development request where the Zoning
Administrator determines that the amount of parking requested and its location
is sufficient for the use proposed.
      (9)   Resource areas.
         (a)   Planned developments shall protect any resources determined
significant by the Zoning Administrator, including, but not limited to:
agricultural soils and active farmland, buffer areas between active farmland
and existing/planned future non-farm development, wetlands, mature trees, land
adjacent to preserved farmland on neighboring properties, scenic views, water
access and shoreline buffers, and habitat of species designated as of federal,
state, and local concern.
         (b)   Planned developments shall comply with all provisions of §
153.334, tree protection and preservation, of this code.
   (F)   Planned development procedure. The procedure and criteria for planned
development applications is outlined below. Planned development applications
are comprised of planned development stipulations and sketch plans, referred to
herein as the PD development plan. All sketch plan(s) shall be drawn to scale.
      (1)   Pre-application conference. Before submitting a PD development plan
for a planned development, the applicant shall confer with the Zoning
Administrator and any other officials designated by the Zoning Administrator.

feedback purposes only and no action shall be taken on the conceptual PD
development plan at the workshop.
      (3)   Community workshop. After the pre-application conference, it is
recommended that the applicant hold one or more community workshops. The
purpose of a community workshop is to ensure early citizen participation in an
informal forum, in conjunction with the development applications and to provide
an applicant the opportunity to understand and try to mitigate any impacts an
application may have on an affected community. A community workshop is not
intended to produce complete consensus on all applications, but to encourage
applicants to be good neighbors.

Notes:
Ac = Acre
Min. = Minimum
[1]   Landscape buffer standards specified in §§
153.330 through
153.342 may require greater setbacks.
 
   (B)   Minimum lot width (feet). The minimum lot width (feet) is measured and
maintained from the front lot line through the entire parcel to the OCRM
critical line. All lots within a subdivision must meet the minimum lot width
average. (Exception: flag lots and lots served by cul-de-sacs.)
      (1)   Lots fronting on cul-de-sacs shall meet the minimum lot width at
the required minimum front setback. Flag lots are designed with a “flag pole”
area with a minimum width of 20 feet. The flag pole area is not required to
meet the minimum lot width nor does this area count towards the minimum lot
size or area. Flag lots must meet the minimum lot width at the end of the flag
pole area/base of lot. All lots within a subdivision must meet the required
minimum lot width average for the zoning district within this section,
Waterfront development standards.
      (2)   Reductions from minimum lot width average requirements for parcels
which contain or abut an OCRM critical line may be permitted if the Zoning
Administrator determines that one of the following criteria has been met:
         (a)   No more than three waterfront lots are being created from the
original parcel and that a reduction of no more than 10% of lot width average
is required for any resulting lot; or
         (b) Where two lots of record (lots existing prior to October 18, 2012)
have been combined, the resulting lot may be subdivided into the original
configuration shown on the previously approved, recorded plat of record, even
if the original lots do not meet the minimum lot width requirement of this
division (B), provided that the subdivision meets all other requirements of
this chapter.
   (C)   Minimum lot standards for dwelling groups on parcels which contain or
abut an OCRM critical line. The number of dwelling units shall not exceed the
maximum number permitted by the density, intensity, and dimensional standards
of the underlying base zoning district. In addition, the dwelling groups shall
comply with the requirements of this section, Waterfront development standards,
including the minimum lot area and lot width requirements.

parcels within these overlay zoning districts to be developed in compliance
with the overlay zoning district regulations, including but not limited to the
use regulations and density, intensity, and dimensional standards of the
overlay zoning districts. Development of parcels within the overlay zoning
districts shall comply with all other applicable requirements and processes of
this chapter, including but not limited to the site plan review process, the
zoning permit process, and the subdivision process.
      (2)   If the land use recommendation for a parcel in an overlay zoning
district, as shown on the overlay zoning district map, is not utilized, the
regulations of the underlying zoning district shall apply.
      (3)   The provisions of this division (D) do not apply to special purpose
districts and floating zones, where compliance with §
153.043, Zoning map amendments (rezonings), and all other applicable sections
of this chapter, may be required.

§ 153.093 FRC-O, FOLLY ROAD CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT.
   (A)   Statement of findings. The Folly Road Corridor Overlay Zoning District
(FRC-O) fronts on the east and west sides of Folly Road from its intersection
with Tatum Road south to Folly River, as shown on the map titled “Folly Road
Corridor Overlay Zoning District.” Folly Road is the main thoroughfare on James
Island and the only route leading to Folly Beach. As such, it carries a large
number of vehicles each day. Moreover, some of the properties along Folly Road
are located within the jurisdictional limits of the town, the City of Folly
Beach, the City of Charleston, and unincorporated Charleston County. The FRC-
O District was adopted to implement traffic safety measures, to improve the
visual character of the corridor, and to create consistency between the town,
the City of Folly Beach, the City of Charleston, and unincorporated Charleston
County concerning land use and design standards.
   (B)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of the FRC-O, Folly Road Corridor
Overlay Zoning District, is to create a corridor that is well-planned and
attractive through the implementation of consistent land use and design
standards with adjacent jurisdictions and utilizing traffic safety measures and
access management for vehicles and pedestrians to ensure safe and efficient
traffic movement.
   (C)   Effect of overlay zoning district. The FRC-O Folly Road Corridor
Overlay Zoning District regulations of this section apply in addition to the
underlying (base) zoning district and all other applicable regulations of this
chapter to impose different development rules for properties within the overlay
zoning district. In case of conflict between the regulations of this section
and other regulations in this chapter, the regulations of this section shall
control. These district regulations are intended to be consistent with similar
regulations adopted by the county and the City of Charleston. Legally
established existing development that does not meet the requirements as
described in this section shall be considered legal nonconforming and shall be
subject to the legal nonconforming requirements of this chapter.
   (D)   Applicability. The standards of this section shall apply to all
development within the FRC-O District, as shown on the maps titled “Folly Road
Corridor Overlay Zoning District,” “North Village Area,” “Commercial Core
Area,” “South Village Area,” “Neighborhood Preservation Area,” and
“Conservation Area,” except single-family residential development.
   (E)   Coordination with adjacent jurisdictions. A letter of coordination
from the town, the county, City of Charleston, and City of Folly Beach
(dependent upon jurisdiction) shall be required as part of all land development
applications with the exception of applications for single-family detached
residential uses. The purpose of the letter of coordination is to ensure that
each jurisdiction is aware of proposed development and that there is
consistency in land use, density/intensity and dimensional standards, and
design and development standards adopted by the jurisdictions. Coordination
with applicable town, city, or county: Council, Planning Commission, staff,
Design Review Board, or other review, recommendation, or decision-making bodies
may be required.
   (F)   Development standards and requirements (all areas). The following
development standards and requirements apply to all parcels within the Folly
Road Corridor Overlay District in addition to the requirements described in
each of the five areas. All non-single-family detached development applications
shall, at the time application is made, provide proof that the following
requirements will be met:
      (1)   Vehicle access.
         (a)   All parcels in this overlay with a future land use designation
of OR (Office Residential) are allowed one curb cut per 150 feet of road
frontage; all other commercial uses are allowed one curb cut every 250 feet.
Single-family detached residentially zoned parcels and parcels containing
single-family detached residential uses shall be exempt from this requirement.
         (b)   The minimum distance from a street intersection for new
residential or commercial use access is 75 feet measured from the edge of the
intersecting roadway to the beginning of the driveway radius. These minimum
spacing requirements will be increased if a right-turn deceleration lane is
required and shall equal the length of the turn lane and taper plus an
additional distance of 50 feet.
         (c)   As a condition of nonresidential use zoning/rezoning, a suitable
access management plan must be submitted demonstrating that the driveway
separation requirements can be met. The following techniques may be employed to
achieve this result, but the burden of accomplishing the desired effect remains
with the developer of the property:
            1.   Aggregation of parcels;
            2.   Parallel frontage or “backage” roads;
            3.   Shared curb cuts between adjoining properties; and
            4.   Shared access easements between parcels.
      (2)   Traffic study. A traffic impact analysis shall be required in all
instances in which the proposed developmental area exceeds five acres or 100
peak hour vehicle trips. Such traffic impact analysis shall be prepared by an
independent planning or engineering firm and shall be provided to the
municipality or jurisdiction for review simultaneous with submission of the
preliminary site plan for consideration.
      (3)   Pedestrian access. Bike and pedestrian ways shall be included in
site design and shall provide a continual link access to adjacent parcels, as
well as within the development area. Grade-separated pedestrian walkways must
provide a direct connection from the street to the main entrance, and to
abutting properties. Pedestrian walkways must be designed and located in a
manner that does not require pedestrians to walk through parking lots or cross
driveways and sidewalks may be allowed in right-of-way buffers.
      (4)   Building height. Maximum 35-foot height, excluding previously
approved planned developments.
      (5)   Signs. In addition to the requirements in §
153.341, all free-standing signs shall meet the following requirements:
         (a)   Reserved;
         (b)   Maximum six-foot height and 40 square feet in the North/South
Village, Neighborhood Preservation, and Conservation Areas;
         (c)   Maximum eight-foot height and 50 square feet in the Commercial
Core Area;
         (d)   Shared shopping center signs shall be allowed with a maximum
ten-foot height and 100 square feet;
         (e)   Internal illumination shall be allowed for all areas except the
Neighborhood Preservation and Conservation Areas which shall utilize external
illumination;
         (f)    Electronic message board signs shall be prohibited (except for
civic/institutional uses when approved by Zoning Administrator); and
         (g)   All legal nonconforming signs located in the Folly Road Corridor
Overlay Zoning District shall remain legal nonconforming until removed or
replaced.
      (6)   Rethink Folly Road Standards. The following development standards
and requirements apply to all parcels within the Folly Road Corridor Overlay
District in addition to the requirements described in each of the five Areas.
All non-single family detached development applications shall, at the time
application is made, provide proof that the following requirements will be met:
         (a)   A separated 12-foot multi-use path along the frontage of the
parcel shall be installed. Required ROW buffer plantings can be reduced to
accommodate the path if space is limited. The Zoning Administrator shall be
authorized to reduce the width of the required multi-use path if conditions
exist that would render the required width unfeasible.
         (b)    Required bicycle parking shall be installed in accordance with
§
153.332(J).
   (G)   North Village Area. (City of Charleston and Charleston County). The
North Village Area extends from Crosscreek/Tatum Street to Oakpoint Road (Ellis
Creek Area) as illustrated on the FRC-O map entitled “North Village.” Parcels
in this area are within the jurisdiction of the City of Charleston and
unincorporated Charleston County. This area currently consists of mixed medium
and low intensity commercial such as shopping centers, professional office, and
vehicle services. There are also higher intensity residential uses such as
apartment complexes. This area is intended to have less intense commercial uses
than the commercial uses found in the Commercial Core Area, particularly along
the north side of Central Park Road and west side of Folly Road. This area is
not intended for large scale commercial development such as big box stores or
mega-shopping centers. Future development in this area is to be a mix of medium
to lower intensity commercial, office, and residential uses with increased
buffers along Folly Road for more intensive commercial uses. The following
commercial recommendations apply to parcels within the North Village Area as
indicated on the map. All development applications shall, at the time
application is made, provide proof that the following requirements will be met:
      (1)   Permitted uses. Shall include those allowed in the Residential
Office (OR), General Office (OG), and Neighborhood Commercial (CN) Zoning
Districts as indicated on the overlay map and as described in
Table 153.110, Use Table.
         (a)   Prohibited uses. Vehicle sales (new or used), hotels and motels.
      (2)   Buffers.
         (a)   A minimum 25-foot vegetated right-of-way buffer shall be
required along Folly Road in the CN or OG designated areas;
         (b)   A minimum 15-foot vegetated right-of-way buffer shall be
required along Folly Road in the OR designated areas;
         (c)   In the CN or OG designated use areas, a minimum 20-foot rear
vegetated buffer shall be required adjacent to residential uses;
         (d)   In the OR designated use areas, a minimum 15-foot vegetated rear
buffer shall be required adjacent to residential uses; and
         (e)   Where appropriate, fencing may be required to screen adjacent or
surrounding residential uses. When a minimum six-foot height, opaque fence or
wall is utilized, the Zoning Administrator may reduce the land use buffer by up
to half its required depth when deemed appropriate; however, no required
vegetated buffer shall be less than ten feet in depth.
   (H)   Commercial Core Area. (Town of James Island and City of Charleston).
This area is the gateway and commercial center to the town and extends from Oak
Point Road (Ellis Creek Area) to Prescott Street as shown on the FRC-O map
entitled “Commercial Core.” Parcels in this area are primarily within the town
with a few parcels within the City of Charleston. This area consists of higher
intensity commercial uses such as chain type restaurants, vehicle service and
repair, drug stores, and shopping centers with minimal buffering along Folly
Road. Future development in this area is intended for higher intensity
commercial uses than those found in the other areas of the corridor. Future
development in this area should place high priority on pedestrian connectivity
between businesses and neighborhoods with attractive planted streetscapes and
building architecture. The following commercial recommendations apply to
parcels along Folly Road as indicated on the map. All development applications
shall, at the time application is made, provide proof that the following
requirements will be met:
      (1)   Permitted uses. Shall include those allowed in the Community
Commercial (CC) Zoning District as indicated on the overlay map and as

restaurant, gasoline service stations (with or without convenience stores),
indoor recreation and entertainment, vehicle service.
      (3)   Buffers.
         (a)   A minimum of a 15-foot vegetated right-of-way buffer shall be
required along Folly Road.
         (b)   A minimum of a 25-foot rear vegetated buffer shall be required
adjacent to residential uses; and
         (c)   Fencing may be required to screen adjacent or surrounding
residential uses. When a minimum six-foot height, opaque fence or wall is
utilized, the Zoning Administrator may reduce the land use buffer by up to half
its required depth when deemed appropriate; however, no required vegetated
buffer shall be less than ten feet in depth.
   (I)   South Village Area. (City of Charleston, Town of James Island,
Charleston County). The South Village Area extends from Prescott Street to
Rafael Lane as illustrated on the FRC-O map entitled “South Village.” Parcels
in this area are within the jurisdiction of the town and the City of
Charleston, with a few parcels in unincorporated Charleston County. This area
currently consists of mixed high to medium intensity commercial development
along the west side of Folly Road such as shopping centers, big box stores, and
consumer services, and small scale offices and residential uses along the east
side of Folly Road. This area is intended to be developed similar to the North
Village Area with less intense commercial development than the Commercial Core
Area. This area is intended to have a mix of high to medium intensity uses
along the west side of Folly and low intensive development on the east side of
Folly Road. Future development in this area is to be a mix of commercial and
residential uses with increased right-of-way buffers along the west side of
Folly Road increased land use buffers on both sides of Folly Road when
commercial development occurs adjacent to single-family detached residential
uses. The following commercial recommendations apply to parcels within the
South Village Area as indicated on the map. All development applications shall,
at the time application is made, provide proof that the following requirements
will be met:

   (J)   Neighborhood Preservation Area. (Charleston County, City of
Charleston). The Neighborhood Preservation Area extends from Rafael Lane to
Battery Island Drive as illustrated on the FRC-O map entitled “Neighborhood
Preservation.” This area consists primarily of low-intensity residential uses
with some commercial development primarily along the northwest area of Folly
Road. This portion of the overlay district is to provide an appropriate
transition from the more intense commercial development on James Island before
entering the Conservation Area and the City of Folly Beach by preserving the
existing low density residential character. The following commercial and
residential recommendations apply to parcels along Folly Road as indicated on
the map. All development applications shall, at the time application is made,
provide proof that the following requirements will be met:
      (1)   Permitted uses. Shall include those allowed in the Special
Management (S3) and Neighborhood Commercial (CN) Zoning Districts as indicated
on the overlay map and as described in
Table 153.110, Use Table.

square feet.
      (4)   Buffers.
         (a)   A minimum of a 25-foot vegetated right-of-way buffer shall be
required along Folly Road in the commercial area which may be reduced to 15
feet when there is no parking or vehicular use area between buildings and
right-of-way.
         (b)   A minimum of a 20-foot vegetated rear buffer shall be required
adjacent to residential uses.
         (c)   Fencing may be required to screen adjacent or surrounding
residential uses. When a minimum six-foot height, opaque fence or wall is
utilized, the Zoning Administrator may reduce the land use buffer by up to half
its required depth when deemed appropriate; however, no required vegetated
buffer shall be less than ten feet in depth.
   (K)   Conservation Area. (Charleston County, City of Folly Beach). The
Conservation Area extends from Battery Island Drive to Folly River as
illustrated on the FRC-O map entitled “Conservation.” This area is intended to
be the least intensely developed area of the overlay zoning district and is to
provide a natural scenic open space before entering the City of Folly Beach by
preserving the marsh views and vistas of this area. The following commercial
and residential recommendations apply to parcels along Folly Road as indicated
on the map. All development applications shall, at the time application is
made, provide proof that the following requirements will be met:
      (1)   Permitted uses. Shall include those allowed in the Neighborhood
Commercial (CN) and the Special Management (S3) Zoning District.
         (a)   Prohibited uses. Vehicle sales (new or used), hotels and motels.

utilized, the Zoning Administrator may reduce the land use buffer by up to one-
half its required depth when deemed appropriate; however, no required vegetated
buffer shall be less than ten feet in depth.

Table 153.110, Use Table. The top of
Table 153.110 contains the zoning districts and left side of the table contains
the use types. Under the hierarchy established by this chapter, the NRM-25
District is the least intensive base zoning district, while the I District is
the most intensive base zoning district. The uses listed in
Table 153.110 are permitted or not permitted in each zoning district according
to the letter coding described in divisions (C)(1) through (C)(5) below.
      (1)   A; uses allowed by right. An “A” indicates that a use type is
allowed by right in the respective zoning district, subject to compliance with
all other applicable regulations of this chapter. A use allowed by right is
defined in §
153.013 of this code as a principal use allowed without the requirement of a
special exception.
      (2)   C; uses subject to conditions. A “C” indicates that a use type is
allowed in the respective zoning district only if it complies with use-specific
conditions and all other applicable regulations of this chapter. A cross-
reference to the applicable conditions can be found in the “condition” column
of
Table 153.110. The number provides a cross-reference to the use-specific
conditions contained in §§

153.230 through
153.234, and
153.250 through
153.255.
      (3)   S; special exception uses. An “S” indicates that a use type is
allowed only if reviewed and approved in accordance with the special exception
procedures of this chapter, subject to compliance with use-specific conditions
and all other applicable regulations of this chapter. A cross-reference to the
applicable conditions can be found in the “condition” column of
Table 153.110. The number provides a cross-reference to the use-specific
conditions contained in §§

153.250 through
153.255.
         (a)   Any use that was legally established before October 18, 2012
without special exception approval and which after October 18, 2012 is located
in a zoning district that requires special exception approval for the subject
use and which presently continues as an allowable use, shall not be considered
a nonconforming use and shall not require a special exception. Such uses shall
be deemed uses permitted by right, as defined in §
153.013 of this code.
         (b)   Any use that was legally established before October 18, 2012
with a conditional use permit and which after October 18, 2012 is located in a
zoning district that requires special exception approval for the subject use
and which presently continues as an allowable use, shall not be considered a
nonconforming use and shall not require a special exception. Such uses shall be
deemed uses permitted by right, as defined in §
153.013 of this code.
      (4)   Uses not allowed. A blank cell indicates that a use type is not
allowed in the respective zoning district, unless it is otherwise expressly
allowed by other regulations of this chapter.
      (5)   New or unlisted uses and use interpretation. The Zoning
Administrator shall be authorized to make use determination whenever there is a
question regarding the category of use based on the definitions contained in §
153.013 of this code or may require that the use be process in accordance with
the planned development (PD) procedures of this chapter.

§ 153.125 COMMUNICATION TOWERS.
   (A)   Purpose and legislative intent. The Federal Telecommunications Act of
1996 affirmed the town’s authority concerning the placement, construction, and
modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. The regulations of this
section are designed to site communications towers in the town. It is the
intent of these regulations to allow for the harmonious coexistence of
communications towers and other land uses. It is also the intent of these
regulations to reduce the overall negative impact of communications towers by:
      (1)   Reducing the number of towers needed through a policy of
encouraging co-location; and
      (2)   If co-location is not feasible, encouraging the following:
         (a)   The use of stealth tower design, as defined in division (C)(1)
below;
         (b)   The clustering of towers (“tower farms”);
         (c)   The placement of towers away from roadways;
         (d)   The provision of effective screening; and
         (e)   The location of communications equipment on existing structures
or within existing utility substations or uses.
   (B)   Co-location exemption. Proposed communications equipment co-locating
on existing towers and structures without adding to their height shall require
only a zoning permit and shall not be subject to the requirements of this
section.
   (C)   Stealth tower provision.
      (1)   For the purposes of this section, the term STEALTH TOWER shall mean
a communications tower designed to unobtrusively blend into its existing
surrounding so as not to have the appearance of a communications tower.
Examples of STEALTH TOWERS include, but are not limited to, antenna tower
alternative structures, architecturally screened roof-mounted antennas,
building-mounted antennas painted to match the existing or proposed trees and
landscaping, and antenna structures designed to look like light poles.
      (2)   All proposed stealth tower designs must be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
      (3)   A complete zoning permit application for a stealth tower that meets
all requirements of this chapter shall be approved.
   (D)   Tower abandonment. A tower that is not used for communication purposes
for more than 120 days (with no new application on file for any communication
user) is presumed to be out of service and the owner of such tower must notify
the staff and remove the tower within 50 days. Towers which are not maintained
by the owner according to the Building Code shall be removed by the owner
within 60 days. To ensure the removal of towers which do not meet requirements
for continued use or proper maintenance, a statement of financial
responsibility shall be submitted for each tower over 100 feet and a
performance bond for the amount of anticipated removal costs shall be posted
for each tower over 150 feet. Removal costs shall be charged to the tower
owner. The bond must be renewed as necessary to ensure that it is maintained at
all times during the existence of the tower.
   (E)   Pre-application meeting. Prior to submitting a formal application for
a zoning permit for communications tower the applicant is required to attend
one or more pre-application meetings. The purpose of the pre-application
meeting is to address key issues which will help to expedite the review and
permitting process. The Zoning Administrator may conduct a site visit at the
pre-application meeting.
   (F)   Zoning permit submittal requirements. Prior to zoning permit approval,
all applications for communications towers shall complete the site plan review
process as provided in §§
153.040 through
153.055 of this code. In addition to any site plan review requirements, the
application must contain the following items:
      (1)   A site plan, drawn to engineer’s scale, showing the location of the
tower guy anchors (if any), existing or proposed buildings and structures or
improvements, including parking, driveways, or access roads, fences, and
protected and grand trees affected by the proposed construction. If there are
no grand trees affected, a surveyor’s statement on the site plan must be shown.
Adjacent land uses shall also be noted on the site plan, with precise
measurements noted between the proposed tower and any residential structures on
surrounding properties.
      (2)   The site plan must show a vegetated buffer, either existing or
installed, that provides an effective screen from public rights-of-way and
adjacent property owners. If a buffer is to be installed, its placement on the
site will vary in order to provide the most effective screening from public
view. Required materials will be based on installation of a 25-foot buffer
around the fenced area.
      (3)   The height and typical design of the tower, typical materials to be
used, color, and lighting shall be shown on elevation drawings. The applicant
shall submit documentation justifying the total height of any communications
towers, facility and/or antenna and the basis therefor. Additionally, color and
material samples shall be provided.
      (4)   The tower must be located no closer to a residential structure than
a distance equal to one and one-half feet for each one foot in height of the
proposed tower plus 50 feet as measured from the center of the proposed tower.
At a minimum, there must be a 150-foot distance between the proposed tower and
a residential structure.
      (5)   A six-foot non-climbable fence must be placed around the tower
(except for those designed in a manner compatible with division (A)(2) above,
Stealth exemption) and any associated building. Guy wires may be fenced
separately.
      (6)   The proposed tower shall only be illuminated as required by the
Federal Communications Commission or Federal Aviation Administration. Nighttime
strobe lighting shall not be incorporated unless required by the Federal
Communications Commission or Federal Aviation Administration. If lighting is
required, the applicant shall provide a detailed plan for sufficient lighting
that shall be as unobtrusive and inoffensive as permissible under state and
federal regulations, and an artist’s rendering or other visual representation
showing the effect of light emanating from the site on neighboring habitable
structures within 1,500 feet of all property lines of the parcel on which the
communications towers are located.
      (7)   Communications towers shall contain a sign no larger than four
square feet to provide adequate notification to persons in the immediate area
of the presence of an antenna that has transmission capabilities. The sign
shall contain the name(s) of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the antenna(s) as
well as emergency phone number(s). The sign shall be located so as to be
visible from the access point of the site. No other signage, including
advertising, shall be permitted on any facilities, antennas, antenna supporting
structures, or antenna towers, unless required by law.
      (8)   The proposed tower must be located such that adequate setbacks are
provided on all sides to prevent the tower’s fall zone from encroaching onto
adjoining properties. The fall zone shall be determined by an engineer
certified by the state in a letter which includes the engineer’s signature and
seal.
      (9)   Proposed towers may not be located within 1,000 feet of the center
of an existing tower unless the applicant certifies that the existing tower
does not meet the applicant’s structural specifications and the applicant’s
technical design requirements, or that a co-location agreement could not be
obtained at a reasonable market rate. In the event of the above situation, the
clustering of new towers on the same parcel near existing towers is permitted.
      (10)   A copy of the tower’s search ring.
      (11)   The applicant shall supply the FAA study number for the proposed
tower.
      (12)   For the purposes of co-location review and review of efforts at
siting a tower on the same lot near an existing tower, the applicant shall
submit satisfactory written evidence such as correspondence, agreements,
contracts, and the like, that alternative towers, buildings, or other
structures are not available or suitable for use within the applicant’s tower
site search area that are structurally capable of supporting the intended
antenna or meeting the applicant’s necessary height criteria, providing a
location free of interference from other communication towers, or available at
the prevailing market rate (as determined by staff communication with persons
doing business within the industry). Additionally, the applicant shall build
the proposed tower in such a manner as may allow other telecommunication users
to co-locate.
      (13)   The tower shall be designed with excess capacity for future needs.
      (14)   A statement of financial responsibility shall be submitted for
each tower over 100 feet and a performance bond for the amount of anticipated
removal costs shall be posted for each tower over 150 feet. The bond must be
renewed as necessary to ensure that it is maintained at all times during the
existence of the tower.
      (15)   The applicant shall furnish a visual impact assessment which shall
include:
         (a)   A “zone visibility map” which shall be provided in order to
determine locations where the tower may be seen.
         (b)   Pictorial representations of “before and after” view from key
viewpoints both inside and outside the county, including but not limited to
major highways and roads; state and local parks; historic districts; preserves
and historic sites normally open to the public; and from any other location
where the site is visible to a large number of visitors, travelers, or
residents.
         (c)   An assessment of the visual impact of the tower base, guy wires,
and accessory buildings from abutting and adjacent properties and streets.
   (G)   Retention of expert assistance and reimbursement by applicant.
      (1)   The town may hire any consultant and/or expert necessary to assist
the town in reviewing and evaluating the application, including the
construction and modification of the site, once permitted, and any requests for
recertification.
      (2)   For towers proposed to be 100 feet or higher, the applicant shall
deposit with the town funds sufficient to reimburse the town for all reasonable
costs of the consultant and expert evaluation and consultation to the town in
connection with the review of any application including the construction and
modification of the site, once permitted. The initial deposit shall be $5,000.
The application will not be processed until receipt of this initial deposit.
The town will maintain a separate account for all such funds. The town’s
consultants/experts shall invoice the county for all its services in reviewing
the application, including the construction and modification the site, once
permitted. If at any time during the process this account has a balance less
than $1,000, the applicant shall immediately, upon notification by the town,
replenish said account so that it has a balance of at least $5,000. Such
additional account funds shall be deposited with the town before any further
action or consideration is taken on the application. In the event that the
amount held in the account by the town is more than the amount of the actual
invoicing at the conclusion of the project, the remaining balance shall be
promptly refunded to the applicant. The applicant shall not be entitled to
receive any interest earnings on unused funds.
      (3)   The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in division (G)
(2) above may vary with the scope and complexity of the project, the
completeness of the application and other information as may be needed to
complete the necessary review, analysis, and inspection of any construction or
modification.
      (4)   Additional fees may be required if additional hearings before the
Board of Zoning Appeals are caused by or requested by the applicant.
   (H)   Surrounding property owner notification.
      (1)   In order to better inform the public, in the case of a new
communications tower, the applicant shall hold a “balloon test” as follows: the
applicant shall arrange to fly, or raise upon a temporary mast, a minimum of
three foot diameter brightly colored balloon at the maximum height of the
proposed new tower. The dates (including a second date, in case of poor
visibility on the initial date) shall be provided to the Zoning Administrator
ten days after receipt of the complete application notice. The dates shall be
set a minimum of 15 days prior to the Zoning Administrator making a final
decision on the zoning permit. The balloons shall be flown for ten consecutive
hours between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m.
      (2)   Once the application is deemed complete by the Zoning Administrator
for a communications tower zoning permit, the Planning/Zoning Department shall
provide parties in interest, neighbor, posted and newspaper notice in
accordance with the requirements of §
153.040(G) of this code. The public notice shall include the dates of the
balloon tests as provided by the applicant and the date the Zoning
Administrator must make a final decision on the zoning permit.
   (I)   Time limit for staff review. Upon receipt of an application deemed
complete by the Zoning Administrator for a communications tower zoning permit,
the Zoning Administrator shall have a maximum of 45 days to act on the
application. The 45 days begins from the date the applicant is sent written
notice of a complete application from the Zoning Administrator. Failure to act
on the application within 45 days will result in the applicant being granted a
zoning permit.
   (J)   Zoning permit approval criteria.
      (1)   A complete zoning permit application for a stealth tower that meets
all requirements of this chapter shall be approved.
      (2)   Upon review of a complete application, no zoning permit shall be
issued for a communications tower until the Zoning Administrator determines
that the proposed tower complies with the following criteria and standards:
         (a)   That the location and height of the proposed tower will not
substantially impact the character of property listed in or eligible for the
National Register of Historic Places, other significant environmental,
cultural, or historical sites, officially designated scenic roads, or rivers,
and that the tower is designed to blend into the environment and minimize
visual impact;
         (b)   If a completely new tower is necessary, the applicant must
provide written proof of attempts at co-location and siting a tower on the same
lot near an existing tower were proven not feasible or practical;
         (c)   That the applicant has pursued any available publicly owned
sites and privately owned sites occupied by a compatible use, and if not
utilized, that these sites are unsuitable for operation of the facility under
applicable communications regulations and the applicant’s technical design
requirements; and
         (d)   Staff shall review and approve the color and materials to be
used for the proposed tower.
      (3)   If the Zoning Administrator finds a proposed communications tower
will have a substantially negative impact on a surrounding area or adjoining
property, the use shall fall under the special exception (S) provisions of this
chapter. In determining whether the use shall fall under the special exception
(S) provisions, the Zoning Administrator may consider one or more of the
following items:
         (a)   The proposed use will be detrimental to adjacent land uses
including historical sites;
         (b)   The proposed use will have a negative aesthetic visual impact;
         (c)   The proposed use will have an adverse effect on the environment
(not including radio frequency emissions); and/or
         (d)   The proposed use is contrary to the public health, safety, or
welfare.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 6.4.5, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2013-02, passed 4-18-2013)
§ 153.126 DRIVE-IN THEATERS.
   Drive-in theaters shall be subject to the following standards.
   (A)   A use for this purpose shall have a setback 200 feet from any
agricultural, residential, or office zoning district. Adult drive-in theaters
are subject to §
153.138 of this code.
   (B)   Such use shall be located as to draw a minimum of vehicular traffic to
and through local streets in nearby residential areas.
   (C)   The principal vehicular access for such use shall be on a major
thoroughfare or collector street having a right-of-way at least 60 feet wide.
   (D)   Vehicular entrances and exits shall be provided separately and not
less than 100 feet apart.
   (E)   Between the street entrance and the ticket gate there shall be an area
for vehicles waiting to pass the gate. Said area shall have such capacity as
will make it ordinarily unnecessary for entering vehicles to wait in the
street.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 6.4.6, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2013-02, passed 4-18-2013)
§ 153.127 DWELLING GROUPS.
   (A)   General. The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to make
recommendations to the Planning Commission who has the authority to allow the
use of dwelling groups for two or more residential structures on the same
zoning lot when it is deemed necessary to facilitate random grouping of
buildings to preserve trees and other natural features, mitigate development
constraints due to irregular shaped parcels or for the conversion of

§ 153.138 SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS.
   (A)   Purpose and intent. It is the purpose of the regulations of this
section to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to promote the
health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the town, and to
establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the continued
deleterious locating and concentration of sexually oriented businesses within
the town. The provisions of this section have neither the purpose nor effect of
imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative
materials including sexually oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the
intent or effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to
sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access
by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment to their
intended market. Neither is it the intent or effect of this section to condone
or legitimize any use or act which is otherwise prohibited or punishable by
law.
   (B)   Findings of fact.
      (1)   There are no sexually oriented businesses in the town. However,
should such a business open, it is in the interests of the health, safety, and
welfare of the patrons of such businesses, as well as the citizens of the town,
to provide certain minimum standards and regulations for sexually oriented
businesses, as well as the operators and employees of such businesses.
      (2)   Sexually oriented businesses generate secondary effects that are
detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare. Additionally, sexually
oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities,
including public sexual indecency, prostitution, and sexual encounters of a
casual nature. Such businesses are of particular concern to the community when
they are located in close proximity to each other, or close to schools,
churches, or parks and playgrounds.
      (3)   The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate
health concern of the town which demands reasonable regulation of sexually
oriented businesses in order to protect the health and well-being of our
citizens.
      (4)   Live entertainment presented by some sexually oriented businesses
involves a considerable amount of bodily contact between patrons and semi-nude
and nude employees and dancers, including physical contact, such as hugging,
kissing, and sexual fondling of employees and patrons. Many sexually oriented
businesses have “couch” or “straddle” dancing, and in these “dances,” employees
sometimes do such things as sit in a patron’s lap, place their breasts against
the patron’s face while physical contact is maintained, and gyrate in such a
manner as to simulate sexual intercourse. Such behavior can lead to
prostitution. The Town Council recognizes that preventing prostitution and the
spread of sexually transmitted diseases are clearly within its police powers:
Southeastern Promotions, Inc. v. Conrad, 341 F. Supp. 465, 477 (E.D. Tenn.
1972), rev’d on other grounds, 420 U.S. 546 (1975). The Town Council believes
that prohibiting physical contact between performers and patrons at a sexually
oriented business establishment is a reasonable and effective means of
addressing these legitimate governmental interests.
      (5)   Licensing is a legitimate and reasonable means of accountability to
ensure that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable
regulations, to facilitate the enforcement of legitimate location and
distancing requirements, and to ensure that operators do not knowingly allow
their establishments to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or
solicitation.
      (6)   The location of sexually oriented businesses close to residential
areas diminishes property values and leads to conditions that give rise to
crime in residential neighborhoods. Many studies performed in other communities
indicate conclusively that property crimes and sexual crimes increase
significantly in neighborhoods in which a sexually oriented business is
located.
      (7)   It is not the intent of this section to suppress any speech
activities protected by the First Amendment or to place any impermissible
burden on any constitutionally-protected expression or expressive conduct by
the enactment or enforcement of this chapter. Rather, it is the intent of the
Town Council to enact a “content neutral regulation” that addresses the
secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

         (b)   Evidence that a sleeping room in a hotel, motel, or a similar

business without the issuance of sexually oriented business regulatory license
for each use and every expansion.
      (4)   For the purpose of this section, measurement shall be made in a

where a sexually oriented business is conducted, to the nearest property line

car washes must not be able to be seen from any public right-of-way or

order to ensure that patrons can only view the employees once the patrons are
inside the establishment.
   (O)   No fondling or caressing. It is a misdemeanor for any nude or semi-
nude employee or dancer to fondle or caress any patron, and no patron shall
fondle or caress any nude or semi-nude employee or dancer.
   (P)   Nonconforming sexually oriented business.
      (1)   Any sexually oriented business operating on the date the original
sexually oriented business regulations were enacted by the Town Council, that

above, shall be deemed a nonconforming use, and upon written notification by
the Zoning Administrator, must obtain a certificate of nonconformity from the
Planning/Zoning Department. A certified nonconforming use will be permitted to
continue to operate for a period not to exceed one year before being licensed.
      (2)   If the sexually oriented business does not, within six months of
notification by the Zoning Administrator, obtain a certificate of
nonconformity, then the business will be deemed in violation of the chapter,
and will not be permitted to continue to operate more than six months after the
date that the regulations of this section first became effective.
      (3)   No nonconforming use shall be increased, enlarged, extended, or

particular location is the conforming use and the later-established business is
the nonconforming use.
      (5)   Any sexually oriented business lawfully operating as a conforming
use is not rendered a nonconforming use due to the subsequent location of a
church, public or private elementary or secondary school, public park,
residential district, or a residential lot within 1,000 feet of the sexually
oriented business. This provision applies only to the renewal of a valid
sexually oriented business regulatory license, and does not apply when an

hotel, motel, or similar commercial establishment, commits a misdemeanor if he
or she rents or sub-rents a sleeping room to a person, and then, within eight
hours from the time the room is rented, rents or sub-rents the same sleeping
room again, as such creates a rebuttable presumption that the establishment is
an adult motel as that term is defined in this section. For purposes of this
section, RENT or SUB-RENT means the act of permitting a room to be occupied for
any form of consideration.
   (R)   Six-foot distance rule.

adult car washes, the six-foot distance rule necessitates that patrons get out
of their vehicles, and watch the vehicles being washed no less than six feet
away from the nude or semi-nude employees.

employees. In the alternative sexually oriented businesses could charge a cover
charge, and prohibit all gratuities.

sexually oriented business shall solicit or accept any pay or gratuity
personally from a patron.
      (3)   Sexually oriented businesses with nude or semi-nude dancers or nude
or semi-nude employees shall conspicuously post a sign that advises patrons

this section, which exhibits on the premises in a viewing room of less than 150

drawn to a designated scale or with marked dimensions sufficient to show the
various internal dimensions of all areas of the interior of the premises to an

foregoing diagram for renewal applications if the applicant adopts a diagram
that was previously submitted and certifies that the configuration of the
premises has not been altered since it was prepared.

applicant.
      (3)   No alteration in the configuration or location of a manager’s

§ 153.170 GOLF COURSES.
   Golf courses shall be subject to the following standards and criteria.
   (A)   An impact analysis must be submitted that indicates the potential
number of members, the characteristics of the golf course membership, a traffic
impact analysis, and a complete site analysis as detailed below.
      (1)   Required site analysis. The layout of any golf course shall be
determined after preparing the required site analysis. The detailed site
analysis will be done in order to identify the site’s most significant
environmental, historic, cultural, and natural resources.
      (2)   Content. The site analysis will include:
         (a)   Vegetation. Characteristics of a vegetation survey related to
land use will describe principal, predominant, and significant vegetation, by
type, condition, age, use, and general or specific location. Features in the
survey will include trees and shrubs, agricultural fields, treelines, native
vegetation, orchards, groves, woodlots, pastures, wetlands, forests, and
grasslands. The vegetation survey shall indicate any significantly large trees
or endangered plant or animal species that may reside on the site and is
protected by law;
         (b)   Historical, archaeological, and cultural resources. Historical
resources located within the proposed golf course development must be
identified on the plat. Sources such as the County Historical Survey (1991),
state registers, and federal registers such as the National Register of
Historic Places shall be utilized in identifying these resources. The
historical survey is important for noting structures and areas that must be
protected as designated landmarks;
         (c)   Adjacent land use patterns. Land use on adjacent properties
shall be identified. Features such as, but not limited to, roads, rice dams,
traditional settlement areas, cemeteries, clusters of structures, parks,
marinas, and logging areas shall be shown;
         (d)   Hydrography. All water features including streams and sensitive
areas on the site, such as wetlands and riparian corridors, must be located.
The purpose of locating these features is to limit disturbance of soil and
vegetation that affect water quality features. Hydrography shall be used to
determine where water required wetland buffers and other requirements such as
drainage easements will be located. Wetland buffers of 50 feet are required on
all saltwater marshes, and 35 feet on all protected freshwater wetlands. All
water bodies – rivers, streams, drainage channels, marshes or wetland,
floodplains, and aquifers – must be inventoried or identified; and
         (e)   Wildlife habitat areas. The purpose of identifying wildlife
areas is to assess the ecological conditions of the landscape and to provide
continuation of these habitat areas. Features of this survey shall include the
presence of any threatened or endangered species, natural areas vital to
wildlife species, habitat areas that are connected to larger undisturbed
natural habitat (connected habitat system). Through this method the study will
develop key points or areas that should be left undeveloped, then define those
areas most suitable for development.
   (B)   Within the NRM-25, AG-5, AGR, and RSL Zoning Districts, only Audubon
International “Signature Program” golf courses will be allowed.
   (C)   Potential sites should be selected which allow the golf course to be
routed in such a way as to minimize the need to alter, create, or remove
existing native landscapes, trees, and vegetation, and which provide
opportunities for restoration/enhancement of valuable habitat.
   (D)   Sites which have archaeological or geological significance and
sensitive or critical habitat or environmental features shall be identified and
either relocated or preserved through careful golf course design. Permanent
open space easements or other techniques may be used, as appropriate, to effect
preservation. The site design shall identify areas for restoration, replanting,
and enhancement of riparian and littoral habitat to re-establish wildlife
migration corridors and lineages between fragmented habitat areas. Protection
and planned restoration and/or enhancements for such areas during construction
and ongoing operation must be ensured. Native habitats and communities of
special value to threatened and/or endangered species shall be preserved to the
greatest extent possible, consistent with state and federal regulation.
   (E)   Each site selected as a golf course development will likely have a
variety of habitat types present. These habitat types must be identified and
provisions made for routing of the course or relocation of the species.
   (F)   The site plan should protect drainage systems that support retained
vegetation. Ponds shall be developed which mimic conditions in terms of both
aesthetics and habitat.
   (G)   Structures and buildings should be located such that impacts to
habitats and significant natural areas are avoided.
   (H)   Design and construction standards:
      (1)   Marshes, creeks, and wetlands.
         (a)   The golf course design must attempt to minimize the number of
marsh, creek, or wetland crossings. Marsh, creek, or wetland crossings must be
designed in such a way to minimize erosion and harmful effects of significant
habitat and migration corridors.
         (b)   Bridges must minimize alteration of the marsh, creek, or wetland
environment.
         (c)   Design must create and restore riparian habitat, especially in
previously degraded habitat areas, and must reduce the impact of alterations
necessitated by design and construction of the course.
         (d)   The course design must employ vegetated buffer strips of
sufficient width to mitigate impacts to riparian corridors and other
significant habitat which may result from surface drainage of the golf course,
cart paths, and other developed areas. In certain circumstances where riparian
vegetation has been degraded or does not exist, turf grass and rough areas may
be located in closer proximity to the marshes, creeks, and wetlands.
         (e)   Cart paths must be graded such that runoff from them generally
does not flow directly into any marsh, creek, or wetland.
         (f)   Construction fencing/siltation barriers must be utilized during
the construction phase where needed to protect habitat and marsh, creek, or
wetland areas.
      (2)   Trees.
         (a)   The selected site must not be heavily forested (with more than
60% tree canopy coverage).
         (b)   The design of the course and related facilities must maximize
the preservation of clusters or significant stands of trees, particularly grand
trees, and otherwise preserve “interior” habitat areas.
         (c)   Irrigation systems shall be designated to avoid impacting
existing oaks or other sensitive vegetation.
         (d)   If required by the Zoning Administrator, a certified
professional arborist, botanist, or forester shall be employed by the applicant
to evaluate the status of the trees and related habitats on the site and
provide direction for restoration and/or enhancement of impacted trees.
         (e)   Cart paths within the drip lines of trees slated for
preservation must be grated in such a way as to not damage or stress the tree.
         (f)   Barriers (curbs, fencing, vegetation, and the like) should be
established to discourage cart and pedestrian travel off paths located within
or adjacent to sensitive habitat.
      (3)   Water quality.
         (a)   Lined artificial storage ponds must not be located in prime
groundwater recharge areas.
         (b)   Turf grass species and landscaping around buildings should be
selected which are drought resistant or tolerant and which are suited for any
special site characteristics or soil conditions.
         (c)   State-of-the-art irrigation systems with site meteorological
monitoring capability should be used to minimize water use.
         (d)   If on-site wells or ponds are to be used as the irrigation water
source, analysis will be required to determine the safe yield in order to
prevent aquifer, off-site wells, and/or marsh, creek, or wetland depletion. The
developer will be held responsible for any negative impact on water supplies to
adjacent or nearby properties.
         (e)   Paved areas should be limited in order to minimize impermeable
surfaces, and thereby reduce surface runoff.
         (f)   The project should employ established best management practices
pursuant to the non-point source program guidelines to control non-point source
(stormwater) runoff pollution. For example: impervious liners for detention/
retention ponds and water hazards to protect ground and surface water quality;
buffer strips, oil/grease separators, or other recommended techniques for
parking area drainage systems; grease traps and other recommended technologies
for facilities such as golf cart maintenance or wash areas to prevent untreated
runoff from entering the natural aquatic environment; berms, vegetative strips,
grease traps, or other recommended technologies in parking areas for drainage
controls to minimize pollution to nearby riparian areas and surface waters.
         (g)   The overall drainage system should be designed to ensure that
there is no increase in the velocity or amount of off-site flows during major
storm events.
      (4)   Archaeology.
         (a)   The design of the course must preserve significant
archaeological areas and/or historical features present on the site.
         (b)   Significant archaeological sites must be staked, flagged, or
fenced off to ensure their protection.
      (5)   Noise.
         (a)   Where possible, clubhouse facilities and other noise-generating
uses and facilities should be located away from neighbors who might be
impacted.
         (b)   Roads must be sited such that traffic noise is minimized for
adjacent areas.
      (6)   Growth-inducing impacts.
         (a)   The project should not provide infrastructure improvements that
would be capable of serving new development other than the proposed project.
         (b)   The project should not stimulate economic expansion or growth
(e.g., major changes in tax revenue base, employment expansion, and the like)
other than that necessary to serve the proposed project.
         (c)   The project should not establish a precedent for significant
change in current Comprehensive Plan policy.
         (d)   In cases where the golf course developer owns lands adjacent to
the project site, a plan for the potential development of those adjacent lands
should be submitted for evaluation.
         (e)   Deed restrictions, open space easements, or other appropriate
techniques must be used to mitigate or prevent growth-inducing impacts inside
the development.
   (I)   Notification. Upon the receipt of a complete application for a golf
course, the Planning/Zoning Department shall notify neighbors within a 300-foot
radius, parties in interest, and place notification in the newspaper within ten
days. All notifications shall be done in accordance with the provisions
contained in §§
153.040 through
153.055 of this code.
   (J)   Time limit for staff review. Upon the receipt of a complete
application for a golf course, the Planning/Zoning Department shall have a
maximum of 45 days to act on the application. Staff’s failure to act on the
application within 45 days will result in the applicant being granted a zoning
permit.

      (2)   The Public Works Director does not require a preliminary plat for a
drainage easement;
      (3)   The lots meet State Department of Health and Environmental Control
(DHEC) requirements for an acceptable sewage disposal system, including systems
deemed to be properly functioning by DHEC and those grandfathered by DHEC
regulations; off-site sewage disposal systems must be approved by DHEC and an
off-site utility easement must be shown along with the lots served by the off-
site system; and/or the town PSD;
      (4)   Off-site sewerage disposal systems must be approved by DHEC and/or
the public provider and an off-site utility easement must be shown along with
all lots served by the off-site system if public sewer is (accessible and is
provided to each lot) provided, then sewer lateral connection will be provided
to each lot; and
      (5)   No new or residual parcels will be created that do not comply with
all applicable requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Minor subdivision process. Applications for minor subdivisions shall
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator on forms available in the Planning/
Zoning Department. There is one required step in the minor subdivision process
which is final plat review and approval. Generally, minor subdivisions are
reviewed in the Planning/Zoning Department and approved by the Zoning
Administrator. However, the Zoning Administrator may send minor subdivisions
applications to the Planning Commission for approval in order to determine
whether or not the proposed subdivision is consistent with the goals and
objective of the Comprehensive Plan. Applicants for minor subdivisions are
strongly encouraged to schedule and attend a pre-application conference prior
to filing a minor subdivision.
(Ord. 2012-06, §§ 8.3.1 and 8.3.2, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2013-06, passed 10-

ordinance requirements and town standards.
      (2)   Prior to submitting a preliminary plat where no public sewer is
provided to any proposed lot, the applicant shall contact a representative of
the State Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) and arrange for
a test of the soil on any proposed lot. DHEC staff will inspect the proposed
lot(s) in order to identify areas that meet minimum septic system requirements
required by the state. The results of this test shall be submitted by the
applicant at the same time of the preliminary plat application.
      (3)   Where subdivision streets and/or drainageways are being
constructed, the Public Works Director or the authorized representative will
make periodic visits to the site as indicated in the town road construction
standards, Appendix A of Ordinance 2012-06, as amended, to ensure construction
compliance with the town-approved road and drainage plans. The Public Works
Director’s or the authorized representative’s certification that all roads and
drainage systems have been constructed in compliance with the plans is required

1:5 to be exceeded when any of the following conditions occur:
         (a)   When attached dwellings are proposed;
         (b)   Where additional depth is provided for marsh frontage lots when
the lot width depth ratio is met and the property line is extended into the
marsh or the property is bisected by or fronts on freshwater wetlands; or
         (c)   A minor subdivision of a parent tract, provided the following
requirements are met:
            1.   The minimum lot frontage for each lot is not less than 250
feet;
            2.   In no case shall the average lot width be less than 250 feet
with the minimum lot width at any one point less than 200 feet;
            3.   The property to be subdivided is located in an NRM or
agricultural zoning district; and
            4.   Prescribed lot width requirements shall be for at least two-
thirds of the depth of the lot.
   (C)   Access.
      (1)   Double-frontage lots shall be avoided except where essential to

street or other area.
      (2)   All lots shall be provided with a means of access in conformance
with the standards and specifications of this chapter.
      (3)   The minimum frontage of any flag lot or cul-de-sac lot access shall
be 20 feet.

configurations are necessary to address development constraints that are
present on the site, e.g., lot width or wetland issues.
      (1)   Permitted use of flag lots. Flag lots may be authorized when the
Zoning Administrator determines that they will:
         (a)   Facilitate subdivision of a long narrow parcel that has
sufficient area but insufficient width to be otherwise subdivided;
         (b)   Eliminate multiple access points to collector or arterial roads;
and/or
         (c)   Allow reasonable development when the buildable area of a parcel
is restricted due to the presence of a natural resource or the irregular shape
of a parcel.
      (2)   Prohibited use of flag lots.
         (a)   Flag lots shall not be used to avoid the development of streets
otherwise required by this chapter when the effect of such flag lots would be
to increase the number of access points (driveways) on a publicly dedicated
road right-of-way.
         (b)   Flag lots may be denied when an adjoining parcel also has
sufficient area but insufficient width to otherwise be subdivided. In such
cases, platting can be accomplished by landowners of adjoining parcels joining
together to provide a full width right-of-way and road section.
      (3)   Standards for flag lots.
         (a)   Flag lots shall take direct access to streets that comply with
this chapter.

permit must be obtained from the appropriate agency governing access, and an
access easement agreement for shared access between the owner of the flag lot
and the lot from which the flag lot was created is recorded in the Office of
the County Register of Mesne Conveyance.

and sewer systems, (if accessible for connection), public water and sewer
lateral connection are provided to each lot, or if in the opinion of DHEC, the
public’s health and the environment would best be protected by the installation
of such systems. Where public sewer is not available, all new lots must meet
minimum soil requirements established by DHEC for the installation of an
individual on-site wastewater system. This provision shall not be interpreted
to require that subdivisions be annexed in order to obtain public water or
sewer service. All new lots created are to have a means of wastewater disposal,
either by individual wastewater systems or physical sewer lateral connection to
each lot.

Council. The financial warranty shall be in the form of a no-contest,
irrevocable bank letter of credit, a performance and payment bond, underwritten
by an acceptable state licensed corporate surety, or a cashier’s check. Payment
is subject to Town Attorney approval of the guarantee to determine that the
interests of the town are fully protected, except when a cashier’s check is
utilized, opinion of counsel may be waived. The Public Works Director shall
identify defects not considered to be a public safety issue and notify the
developer of such defects. The developer shall then have 30 days to prepare a
schedule of corrective actions and begin such corrective actions. If not
completed within the approved schedule, the Public Works Director shall make
the repairs and bill the bonding company. Public safety defects shall be
addressed immediately by the Public Works Director, with reimbursement from the
bonding company. The town is not required to accept for maintenance any road,
street, or drainage element.

   (C)   Rules for computing parking and loading requirements. The following
rules apply when computing off-street parking and loading requirements.
      (1)   Multiple uses. Lots containing more than one use must provide
parking and loading in an amount equal to the total of the requirement for all
use.
      (2)   Fractions. When measurements of the number of required spaces
result in a fractional number, any fraction of one-half or less will be rounded
down to the next lower whole number and any fraction of more than one-half will
be rounded up to the next higher whole number.
      (3)   Area measurements. Unless otherwise expressly stated, all square-
footage-based parking and loading standards must be computed on the basis of
gross floor area. Storage areas or common areas incidental to the principal use
shall be exempt from this measurement when the following conditions are met.
         (a)   The storage area or common area is a minimum of 250 square feet.
         (b)   The applicant has provided documentation that such areas will
not be used as space for employees, customers, or residents.
      (4)   Occupancy-based standards. For the purpose of computing parking
requirements based on employees, students, residents, or occupants,
calculations shall be based on the largest number of persons working on any
single shift, the maximum enrollment, or the maximum fire-rated capacity,
whichever is applicable and whichever results in the greater number of spaces.
      (5)   Unlisted uses. Upon receiving a development application for a use
not specifically listed in an off-street parking schedule, the Zoning
Administrator shall apply the off-street parking standard specified for the
listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or require parking
spaced in accordance with a parking study prepared by the applicant.
   (D)   Location of required parking.
      (1)   On-site parking.
         (a)   Except as expressly stated in this division (D), all required
off-street parking spaces must be located on the same lot as the principal use
and shall be arranged and laid out so as to ensure that no parked or
maneuvering vehicle will encroach upon a sidewalk, public right-of-way, or
property line.
         (b)   Parking lots in office (O) and commercial (C) districts
containing more than ten parking spaces shall be located to the side or rear of
the principal structure’s front facade or within a courtyard surrounded by a
structure on at least three sides.
      (2)   Off-site parking.
         (a)   OFF-SITE PARKING is defined as the required parking not located
on the parcel which the principal use is located. SHARED PARKING is parking for
uses with different operating hours or peak business periods that share
required off-street parking spaces. Shared parking may or may not be off-site
parking. Off-site and shared parking are allowed provided they meet the
following standards. If any one of the following applicable standards cannot be
met, special exception approval shall be required.
         (b)    A maximum of 50% of the required parking spaces may be off-
site, except for Civic/Institutional Uses that may have a maximum of 75% of the
required parking spaces off-site; however, off-site parking may not be used to
satisfy the off-street parking standards for residential uses (except for guest
parking), restaurants, convenience stores, or other convenience-oriented uses
unless approved as part of a mixed use development. Required parking spaces
reserved for persons with disabilities shall not be located off site.
            1.   Shared or off-site parking must be located within 600 feet
from the primary entrance of the use served, unless shuttle bus service is
provided to the remote parking area. Shared or off-site parking spaces may not
be separated from the use that it serves they serve by a street right-of-way
with a width of more than 80 feet, unless a grade-separated pedestrian walkway
is provided, or other traffic control or shuttle bus service is provided to the
remote parking area.
            2.   An applicant requesting shared parking shall submit a shared
parking analysis to the Zoning Administrator that clearly demonstrates the
feasibility of shared parking. The shared parking analysis must be approved by
the Zoning Administrator and made available to the public. It must address, at
a minimum, the size and type of the proposed development, the composition of
tenants, the anticipated rate of parking turnover, and the anticipated peak
parking and traffic loads for all uses that will be sharing off-street parking
spaces. Approvals will only pertain to the specific uses addressed in the
analysis and any change in use(s) will require a new shared parking analysis.
            3.   Off-site parking areas serving uses located in nonresidential
zoning districts must be located in nonresidential zoning districts. Off-site
parking areas serving uses located in residential or agricultural zoning
districts may be located in residential, agricultural, or nonresidential zoning
districts.
            4.   In the event that an off-site parking area is not under the
same ownership as the principal use served, a written agreement will be
required. An attested copy of the agreement between the owners of record must
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for recording on forms made available
in the Planning/Zoning Department. Recording of the agreement with the Register
of Mesne Conveyance must take place before issuance of a zoning permit,
building permit, or certificate of occupancy for any use to be served by the
off-site parking area. An off-site parking agreement may be revoked only if all
required off-site parking spaces will be provided in accordance with this
section.
            5.   Shared parking areas must be connected by a continuous network
of sidewalks and pedestrian crosswalks.
   (E)   Accessible parking for physically disabled persons. The parking
standards of this section are intended to ensure compliance with the Americans
with Disabilities Act (ADA), being 42 U.S.C. §§ 1201 et seq. A portion of the
total number of required off-street parking spaces in each off-street parking
area shall be specifically designated, located, and reserved for use by persons
with physical disabilities.
      (1)   Number of spaces. The minimum number of accessible spaces to be
provided shall be a portion of the total number of off-street parking spaces
required, as determined by the following schedule. Parking spaces reserved for
persons with disabilities shall be counted toward fulfilling off-street parking
standards.

      (3)   Parking lot landscaping. See §
153.335 of this code.
      (4)   Markings.
         (a)   In paved parking areas, each off-street parking space shall be
identified by surface markings at least four inches in width. Markings shall be
visible at all times. Such markings shall be arranged to provide for orderly
and safe loading, unloading, parking, and storage of vehicles. In unpaved
parking lots, all parking spaces must have a curb stop (minimum height of four
inches) to delineate the location of the space and to prevent the encroachment
of parking onto adjoining properties, rights-of-way, or landscaped areas.
         (b)   One-way and two-way accesses into required parking facilities
shall be identified by directional arrows.
         (c)   Unpaved parking lots must have an all-weather surface, such as
gravel, slag, or other pervious surface, not including asphalt shingles.
Entrance and exit drives serving unpaved parking lots accessed from a paved
street must be paved from the edge of the street pavement to a distance of 20
feet into the property. No more than 120% of the required number of off-street
parking spaces may be paved and no more than 70% of all developable land within
parcels may be paved, unless approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   Access.
         (a)   Required parking spaces shall not have direct access to a street
or highway. Access to required parking spaces shall be provided by on-site
driveways. Off-street parking spaces shall be accessible without backing into
or otherwise re-entering a public right-of-way.
         (b)   Parking lot entrance and exit drive curb cuts will not be more
than 30 feet in width. Entrances or exits which include a median strip to
separate traffic flow in opposite directions may be expanded to 60 feet. Curb
cuts shall be allowed in accordance with the following table:
 
Length of Frontage     Maximum Number of Driveways
250 feet or less       1 *
251 feet to 1,500 feet 2
1,500 feet or more     3
*On frontages of 250 feet or less, a pair of one-way driveways may be
substituted only if the internal circulation on the site is compatible with
the one-way driveways and wrong-way movements on the driveways are rendered
impossible or extremely difficult for motorists. Refer to the State Department
of Transportation’s Access and Roadside Management Standards Manual for
recommended spacing of driveways based on speed of traffic.
 
         (c)   Entrance and exit drives shall be located at least 100 feet from
the edge of the right-of- way of any street intersection. If the subject lot
has less than 100 feet of frontage, the Zoning Administrator shall be
authorized to alter these requirements. Suitable provisions will be made to
prevent ingress or egress at other than designated entrance or exit drives.
         (d)   The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to require that
driveways providing access to dwelling units provide a minimum vertical
clearance of up to 13-1/2 feet when deemed necessary to ensure emergency
vehicle access.
         (e)   Shared access between parcels may be allowed with written
agreement among all owners of record. An attested copy of the access agreement
between the owners of record must be submitted to the Zoning Administrator for
recording on forms made available in the Planning/Zoning Department. Recording
of the agreement with the Register of Mesne Conveyance must take place before
issuance of a zoning permit or certificate of occupancy for any use to be
served by shared access. Any shared access must meet all dimensional
requirements of this chapter and any applicable SCDOT requirements.
   (G)   Use of required parking spaces. Required off-street parking areas
shall be used solely for the parking of licensed motor vehicles in operating
condition. Required spaces may not be used for the display of goods for sale or
lease, for motor vehicle repair or service work of any kind, or for long-term
storage of vehicles, boats, motor homes, campers, manufactured housing units,
or building materials.
   (H)   Vehicle stacking areas.
      (1)   Minimum number of spaces. Off-street stacking spaces shall be
provided as follows:
Activity Type Minimum Spaces Measured From
Activity Type               Minimum Spaces Measured From
Automated teller machine    3              Teller
Bank teller lane            4              Teller or window
Carwash stall, automatic    6              Entrance
Carwash stall, self-service 3              Entrance
Gasoline pump island        2              Pump island
Restaurant drive-through    6              Order box
Restaurant drive-through    4              Order box to pickup window
Other                       Determined by Zoning Administrator
 
      (2)   Parking area design and layout. Required stacking spaces are
subject to the following design and layout standards.
         (a)   Stacking spaces must be a minimum of eight feet by 20 feet in
size.
         (b)   Stacking spaces may not impede on or off-site traffic movements
or movements into or out of off-street parking spaces.
         (c)   Stacking spaces must be separated from other internal driveways
by raised medians if deemed necessary by the Public Works Director for traffic
movement and safety.
         (d)   The Zoning Administrator may require pick-up and drop-off loop
drives with sufficient vehicle stacking lanes to prevent vehicle backups into
internal travel lanes and parking lots for school uses, adult and child day
care facility uses, public assembly uses, and conference facility uses.
   (I)   Off-street loading.
      (1)   Spaces required. For every retail sales, service, wholesaling,
warehousing, or manufacturing establishment and each bus or truck terminal,
there shall be provided sufficient space to accommodate the maximum number of
trucks that will be loading, unloading, or standing at any one time.
      (2)   Size of space. Each off-street loading space shall be of a size
commensurate with the building to be accommodated. In no case shall required
off-street loading space encroach upon off-street parking space required under
this section.
      (3)   Location. All required off-street loading spaces shall be located
on the same lot as the building which they are intended to serve.
      (4)   Entrances and exits. Off-street loading entrance and exit drives
shall be located at least 25 feet from any street intersection.
      (5)   Loading spaces adjacent to sidewalks. Where a loading space is
adjacent to a public sidewalk or other public pedestrian way, it shall be so
located, arranged, and improved with curbs or other barriers, as to provide
adequate protection for pedestrians.
      (6)   Maneuvering areas. All off-street loading spaces shall be provided
with adequate off-street maneuvering areas.
      (7)   Landscaping, buffers, and screening. See §
153.335 of this code.
   (J)   Bicycle parking.
      (1)   Purpose. Bicycle parking encourages customers, employees, and other
visitors to use bicycles by providing a convenient, safe and readily accessible
place to park bicycles. Bicycle parking should serve the main entrance of a
building and should be visible to pedestrians and bicyclists.
      (2)   Rate of provision. One bicycle parking space shall be required per
every ten off-street required parking spaces, rounding bicycle parking spaces
up when the number is not a of multiple of ten. (Six automobile parking spots
required = one bicycle parking space: 12 automobile parking spots required =
two bicycle parking spaces.)
      (3)   Standards. Required bicycle parking must meet the following
standards:
         (a)   Location. Bicycle parking must be:
            1.   Outside a building; and within 50 feet of the main entrance to
the building as measured along the most direct pedestrian access route, or no
further from the building's main entrance than the closest automobile parking
space, whichever is closer;
            2.   At the same grade as the sidewalk or at a location that can be
reached by an accessible route; and
            3.   If required bicycle parking is not visible from the street or
main building entrance, a sign must be posted at the main building entrance or
in a highly visible and used location indicating the location of the parking.
         (b)   Design. Bicycle parking must meet the following standards:
            1.   Bicycle lockers. Where required bicycle parking is provided in
lockers, the lockers must be securely anchored.
            2.   Required bicycle parking may be provided in floor, wall, or
ceiling racks. Where required bicycle parking is provided in racks the racks
must meet the following standards:
               A.   The bicycle frame and one wheel can be locked to the rack
with a high security, U-shaped shackle lock if both wheels are left on the
bicycle;
               B.   A space two feet by six feet must be provided for each
required bicycle parking space, so that a bicycle six feet long can be securely
held with its frame supported so that the bicycle cannot be pushed or fall in a
manner that will damage the wheels or components; and
               C.   The rack must be securely anchored and coated in a material
that will not damage the bicycle.
            3.   Parking and maneuvering areas.
               A.   Each required bicycle parking space must be accessible
without moving another bicycle;
               B.   There must be an aisle at least five feet wide in front and
behind all required bicycle parking to allow room for bicycle maneuvering.
Where the bicycle parking is adjacent to a sidewalk, the maneuvering area may
extend into the right-of-way; and
               C.   The area devoted to bicycle parking must be permeable hard
surface.
            4.   Covered bicycle parking. Covered bicycle parking, as required
by this section, can be provided inside buildings, under roof overhangs or
awnings, in bicycle lockers, or within or under other structures. Where
required covered bicycle parking is not within a building or locker, the cover
must be:
               A.   Permanent;
               B.   Designed to protect the bicycle from rainfall; and
               C.   At least seven feet above the floor or ground.

§ 153.334 TREE PROTECTION AND PRESERVATION.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   Findings. Trees are an essential natural resource, an invaluable
economic resource, and a priceless aesthetic resource. Trees play a critical
role in purifying air and water, providing wildlife habitat, and enhancing
natural drainage of storm water and sediment control. They also help conserve
energy by providing shade and shield against noise and glare. Trees promote
commerce and tourism by buffering different land uses and beautifying the
landscape. The tree protection and preservation regulations of this section are
intended to enhance the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the
town.
      (2)   Applicability and exemptions.
         (a)   Applicability. The provisions of this section in their entirety
shall apply to all real property in the town, except as expressly exempted.
         (b)   Exemptions.
            1.   Single-family detached residential lots of record shall be
exempt from all provisions in this section except for the grand tree
documentation, protection, and replacement provisions. This exemption does not
include protected trees in major subdivisions or applications for major or
minor subdivisions for which landscape buffers may be required per § 153.335
(D).
            2.   The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to modify or
reduce the standards of this section for commercial nursery operations.
            3.   This section shall not restrict public utilities and electric
suppliers from maintaining safe clearance around existing utility lines and
existing easements in accordance with applicable state laws. Siting and
construction of future and existing gas, telephone, communications, electrical
line, or other easements shall not be exempt from any provisions of this
section.
            4.   Removal of trees for the purpose of conducting bona fide
forestry operations shall be exempt from the provisions of this section except
for removal of live oak species of grand trees.
            5.   Removal of trees for the purpose of establishing bona fide
agricultural uses, as specified in §
153.047(B)(1) of this code, shall be exempt from the provisions of this section
except for the grand tree documentation, protection, and replacement
provisions.
            6.   Removal of trees for the purposes of maintaining safe
clearance for aircraft as required by federal law or the establishment of
facilities exclusively dedicated to aviation operations on property owned or
leased and in use by the County Aviation Authority will be exempt from the
provisions of this section.
            7.   All invasive tree species as referred by Clemson Extension and
the South Carolina Exotic Pest Plant Council shall be exempt from all
provisions of this section.
      (3)   Definition of tree removal. For the purpose of this section, the
term TREE REMOVAL shall include, but not be limited to, damage inflicted to the
root system by machinery, girding, storage of materials and soil compaction,
changing the natural grade above or below the root system or around the trunk;
damage inflicted on the tree permitting fungus infection or pest infestation;
excessive pruning; excessive thinning; paving with concrete, asphalt, or other
impervious material within such proximity as to be harmful to the tree; or any
act of malicious damage to a tree. Excessive pruning or thinning shall be
pruning or thinning that exceeds more than 25% of the leaf surface on both the
lateral branch and the overall foliage of a mature tree that is pruned within a
growing season. Additionally, one-half of the foliage of a mature tree is to
remain evenly distributed in the lower two-thirds of the crown and individual
limbs upon completion of any pruning.
      (4)   Measurements and definitions. For the purpose of this section, the
following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or
requires a different meaning.
         CALIPER. The diameter of a tree trunk measured six inches above the
ground on trees with calipers of four inches or less. For trees between four
inches and 12 inches caliper, the trunk is measured 12 inches above the ground.
         DIAMETER BREAST HEIGHT (DBH). The DIAMETER BREAST HEIGHT (DBH) of a
tree is the total diameter, in inches, of a tree trunk or trunks measured four
and one-half feet above existing grade (at the base of the tree). In measuring
DBH, the circumference of the tree shall be measured with a standard diameter
meter, and the circumference shall be divided by 3.14. If a tree trunk splits
at ground level and does not share a common base (separated by earth at natural
base), then each trunk shall be measured as a separate tree. If a multi-trunk
tree splits below the four and one-half foot mark, all
trunks shall be measured separately added together and count as one tree. Any
trunk measuring less than eight inches DBH is not included in the calculation.
         GRAND TREE. Any species of tree measuring 18 inches or greater
diameter breast height (DBH) except pine and sweet gum. All GRAND TREES are
prohibited from removal unless a grand tree removal permit is issued.
         PROTECTED TREES. Any tree on a parcel with a diameter breast height of
eight inches or greater prior to development and all trees within required
buffers or required landscape areas. Limited removal is allowed only when
specified by the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Administration.
      (1)   Zoning permit required.
         (a)   Tree removal. Removal of required trees is prohibited prior to
the issuance of a zoning permit by the Zoning Administrator. Zoning permits
will be issued only after a tree plan is approved by the Zoning Administrator
as outlined below.
         (b)   Excess canopy (limb) removal.
            1.   Removal of three or more limbs with an individual diameter of
six inches or greater shall require a zoning permit.
            2.   Removal of any size limbs which contribute to more than 100
continuous linear feet of canopy over public roadways shall require variance
approval from the Board of Zoning Appeals. This requirement shall not preclude
the SCDOT, CCPW, or other entities from maintaining height clearances of 14
feet or less and width clearances within designated travel ways and from
removing unprotected trees along rights-of-way for road widening projects.
      (2)   Documentation. Tree plans, prepared by licensed registered
surveyor, civil engineer, or landscape architect, shall be required on all non-
exempt parcels before any permits are issued.
   (C)   Tree plans and surveys.
      (1)   General. Tree plans of the same scale as, and superimposed on, a
development plan or preliminary plat shall include location, number, size (DBH
or caliper), and species with a scaled graphic representation of each grand
tree, canopy size and shape, and the trunk location. All required tree surveys
shall include the name, address, signature, and seal of a licensed surveyor,
landscape architect, or civil engineer registered in the state. The survey
shall include all trees to be protected or preserved and those scheduled to be
removed, including dead and damaged trees. In cases where a landscape
architect, civil engineer, forester, or surveyor utilizes previously approved
recorded plats prepared by surveyors for the purpose of showing a tree plan,
the name, address, signature, and seal of the licensed landscape architect,
civil engineer, forester, or surveyor registered in the state, who shall be
responsible for the accuracy of the information provided, shall be included on
the tree survey. A scaled infrared or high resolution black and white aerial
photograph or print of equal quality may be substituted in cases where the
Zoning Administrator determines that it would provide the same information as a
tree plan. However, all grand trees within 40 feet of proposed construction and
land disturbance areas and trees within required buffers must be surveyed and
mapped.
      (2)   Major and minor subdivisions preliminary plats. Refer to §
153.305(B)(4), Preliminary plat application, in the subdivision regulations of
this chapter.
      (3)   Commercial, industrial, multi- family and major subdivisions. All
tree surveys must show the location, number, size, and species of all trees
eight inches or greater DBH (diameter breast height), including those scheduled
to be removed. When there are no trees eight inches or greater DBH,
documentation of this fact shall be provided from a registered surveyor,
engineer, or landscape architect.
 
COMMENTARY:
Assistance in tree identification and condition should be provided by a
forester or qualified arborist.
 
      (4)   Single-family detached residential parcels. Single-family detached
residential parcels shall show all grand trees within the area of construction
and land disturbance and in conjunction with the subdivision regulations of
this chapter at the time a zoning or building permit application is made.
   (D)   Required tree protection.
      (1)   General.
         (a)   All grand trees and any other trees required to remain on a site
as outlined in this chapter must be protected during construction and
development of the parcel. Tree protection must be shown on all development
plans prior to site plan approval. A site inspection of the tree barricades
must be scheduled by the applicant with the Planning/Zoning Department for
approval prior to the issuance of permits or the start of development
activities.
         (b)   Prior to commencement of development activities, a pre-
construction planning conference for tree preservation shall be held on-site
with the Zoning Administrator’s representative, the applicants, and any parties
deemed appropriate for the purpose of determining if there is a need for
additional tree protection techniques and for designating placement of tree
barricades, construction employee parking, temporary construction office, and
dumpster.
      (2)   Tree protection during development and construction. Protective
barricades shall be placed around all required trees in or near development
areas on all zoning parcels, including residential, as approved by the Zoning
Administrator, prior to the start of development activities. These barricades,
constructed of wood or plastic fencing or other approved materials, shall be
erected in accordance with standards provided by the Zoning Administrator and
placed beneath the canopy drip-line or 1.5 feet times the DBH of the tree.
Other protective devices or construction techniques may be used as approved by
the Zoning Administrator. The barricades shall remain in place until
development activities are complete. The area within the protective barricade
shall remain free of all building materials, dirt, fill, or other construction
debris, vehicles, and development activities. All required trees are also
subject to the provisions of §
153.335(F) of this code and subject to the enforcement criteria of §§
153.375 through
153.383 and
153.999.
      (3)   Partial exception for limited clearing. Limited clearing and
grubbing may be authorized by the Zoning Administrator prior to the
installation of protective tree barricades on sites that exhibit unusually
heavy undergrowth where access to the interior of the site and its protected
trees would be otherwise highly impractical; if permitted, this clearing shall
be done by hand with hand tools or gas powered push type or walk behind
equipment designed for brush and undergrowth clearing. Under no circumstances
will metal tracked bulldozers, loaders, or similar rider/operator types of
equipment be allowed on the site until the protective barricades are erected
and a zoning permit is issued.
      (4)   Separation of trees from pavement, grading, and structures. Paved
areas shall be separated from trees by a minimum distance of the drip-line or
one and one-half times the DBH or as modified by the Zoning Administrator as
deemed necessary to protect the root system of the tree. Paved areas shall not
constitute more than 25% of the protected area beneath a tree. Any paving,
grading, trenching, or filling within the remaining 75% of the protected area
must be approved by the Zoning Administrator and may require specific
construction techniques be used in order to preserve the health of the tree.
Refer to §
153.343 for examples. When grading and construction within the protected area
of
a tree has been approved, all damaged roots shall be severed clean and
inspected by the Town Landscape Architect or Inspector prior to the receipt of
a zoning permit.
      (5)   Quantity and location of trees to be protected.
         (a)   Before the issuance of a zoning permit for commercial,
industrial, multi-family, civic/institutional uses and major subdivisions, the
following number of trees with a diameter breast height of eight inches or
greater shall be preserved and protected in accordance with the provisions of
division (D)(2) above. All trees located within required buffers as outlined in
§ 153.335.
            1.   Twenty trees per acre; or
            2.   Any number of trees with a combined diameter breast height of
at least 160 inches per acre.
         (b)   Required drainage improvements such as detention and retention
ponds and wetlands may be subtracted from the area used to calculate tree
preservation requirements.
   (E)   Tree removal.
      (1)   Generally. Permits for tree removal may be approved where one or
more of the following conditions are deemed to exist by the Zoning
Administrator:
         (a)   Trees are not required to be retained by the provisions of this
section;
         (b)   Trees are diseased, dead, or dying (as determined by the Zoning
Administrator or a qualified arborist);
         (c)   Trees pose a safety hazard to nearby buildings or pedestrian or
vehicular traffic (as determined by the Zoning Administrator or a qualified
arborist); and/or
         (d)   Removal of grand trees has been approved by the Board of Zoning
Appeals.
         (e)   The location and configuration of protected trees required by
this section create an unreasonable burden on the use of the parcel and
protected trees removed will be replaced and/or mitigated according to a
schedule determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   Variances. Grand trees that do not meet the above criteria may be
removed only where approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals, and shall be
replaced according to a schedule determined by the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Emergency provisions. In the event that a tree poses a serious and
imminent threat to public safety due to death, disease, or damage resulting
from emergencies including, but not limited to, fires, flooding, storms, and
natural disasters, the Zoning Administrator may waive requirements of this
section. Documentation must later be submitted for review outlining the threat
to public safety which initiated the removal. Documentation must include any
written findings by a qualified arborist and photographs supporting the tree
removal emergency. The Zoning Administrator may require replacement of required
trees that are removed where it is determined that death or disease resulted
from negligence.
      (4)   Violations and penalties. Violations and penalties are specified in
§§ 153.375 through 153.383 and 153.999 of this code.
   (F)   Tree replacement.
      (1)   Generally. Tree replacement shall be required accompanying
development on all non-exempt properties in the manner described below.
         (a)   When replacement canopy trees are required in fulfillment on the
requirements of this section, they shall be no smaller than two inches caliper.
         (b)   The Zoning Administrator is empowered to require trees of larger
caliper as determined appropriate for site-specific conditions and the
circumstances, lawful or illegal, under which removal occurred.
      (2)   Protected trees removed in violation. When trees of eight inches
DBH or greater have been removed in violation of this chapter, the trees shall
be replaced and/or mitigated according to a replacement schedule approved by
the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Sites with less than 160 inches per acre combined DBH. When lots
lack a sufficient number of trees to meet the requirement for DBH/number of
trees per acre, all trees six inches DBH or greater shall be preserved and
protected in accordance with division (D)(2) above during development and must
equal no less than 40 inches per acre combined DBH. On lots with less than 40
inches per acre combined DBH, additional trees shall be planted on the lot
equaling or exceeding 40 inches per acre combined DBH. Planting schedules shall
be approved by the Zoning Administrator.
      (4)   Previously cleared sites. Where sites were completely cleared of
trees prior to adoption of this section or have been cleared subsequently for
activities exempted from this section, replacement trees shall be planted, the
combined caliper of which equals or exceeds 40 inches per acre. Replacement
schedules, including number, species, caliper, and placement shall be approved
by the Zoning Administrator.
      (5)   Tree Fund. The Tree Fund is a fund established to receive monies
exacted from tree removal violations fines to include, but not limited to,
removal, damage, destruction, or as defined in division (A)(4) above, and as a
form of mitigation when planting of the required trees is determined to be
detrimental to the overall health of existing trees or impractical for the
intended site design. The Zoning Administrator shall impose a tree mitigation
fee based on the current market retail value of two- to three-inch caliper
trees installed to the American Association of Nurserymen Standards. If the
applicant disagrees with the amount of the tree mitigation fee imposed, he or
she may file appeal with the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with the
provisions contained in this chapter. All tree mitigation fees collected shall
be paid to the town and placed in an account established for public
beautification through the planting and maintenance of trees on James Island.
      (6)   Bankruptcy or abandonment of site. When trees have been removed
through an approved mitigation program and the project will not be completed
for any reason, i.e., bankruptcy, abandonment, change in ownership, and the
like, the owners of the subject property are responsible for the mitigation of
the removed trees as outlined and agreed or subject to division (F)(5) above.

§ 153.335 LANDSCAPING, SCREENING, AND BUFFERS.
   (A)   Applicability. Unless expressly exempted, the landscaping, screening,
and buffering standards of this section shall apply to all nonresidential
development and all new major roadways that serve residential major
subdivisions (four or more lots). Minor subdivisions (those with fewer than ten
lots) may be required to provide landscaping, screening, or buffering on major
roadways when the Zoning Administrator determines that such landscaping,
screening, or buffering is necessary to ensure that the purposes of this
chapter are met. When modifications or additions are being made to an existing
nonresidential building or site, the standards of this section shall apply to
those portions of the subject parcel that are directly affected by the proposed
improvements as determined by the Zoning Administrator, provided that when
modifications or additions are proposed that would increase the number of
parking spaces, the area of vehicular use areas or gross floor area of
buildings by more than 25% (above existing), then the entire parcel shall be
brought into compliance with all applicable standards of this section. Before
calculating the percentage of area for re-development and improvement, any
proposed demolition of structures and parking is subtracted from the existing
gross floor area of buildings and number of parking spaces.
   (B)   Exhibits. Drawings included as exhibits §
153.343 are meant to compliment the language of the chapter. In the event of a
conflict with the text of the chapter, the text shall apply.
   (C)   Parking, loading, and vehicular use area landscaping.
      (1)   Parking, loading, and vehicular area perimeters. Unless otherwise
expressly stated, perimeter landscaping shall be required around the outer
perimeter of all off-street, surface parking, loading, and vehicular use areas.
Parking areas for the exclusive use of single-family or agricultural uses shall
be exempt from these requirements. Any off-street parking, loading, or
vehicular use area that will be entirely screened from view by an intervening
building or structure or by a buffer provided to satisfy the standards of this
subchapter shall also be exempt from these (parking, loading, and vehicular use
area) perimeter landscaping requirements.
         (a)   A perimeter landscape area at least eight feet in depth shall be
provided at the perimeter of all off-street parking, loading, and vehicular use
areas, except when permitted driveway openings are to be provided. Where
drainage or other utility easements exist along property lines, the perimeter
landscape area shall be located adjacent to the easement.
         (b)   Required perimeter landscape areas shall be planted in
accordance with the following minimum standards:
            1.   One canopy tree shall be provided for each 50 linear feet of
parking, loading, or vehicular use area perimeter. These trees may be used to
satisfy the interior parking lot landscaping requirements;
            2.   A hedge or other landscape material of at least three feet in
height, at maturity, shall be planted within the perimeter landscape area to
provide a continuous landscape element or a combination of trees, hedge, other
durable landscape material or approved wall, fence, or earth berm may be used
to form the continuous landscape element;
            3.   All portions of the perimeter landscape area not planted with
shrubs or trees or covered by a wall or fence barrier shall be planted in grass
or ground cover; and
            4.   Parked vehicles may overhang a landscaped area if curbing or
wheel stops are installed to prevent any damage to plants within the required
perimeter landscape area. Landscaping, walls, fences, and earth berms will be
so located as to prevent their damage and/or destruction by overhanging
vehicles.
      (2)   Interior areas. The following interior parking lot landscaping
requirements shall apply to all parking lots except those exclusively serving
single- family residential or agricultural uses:
         (a)   A minimum of one landscape island shall be provided for each ten
parking spaces within an off-street parking area. Required landscape islands
shall have a minimum of 325 square feet, variably dependent upon the species of
the canopy tree proposed by the designer. Each parking lot bay must terminate
with a tree island.
         (b)   Each required landscaping island shall contain at least one
canopy tree and there shall be no more than ten parking spaces in a row between
tree islands. Interior parking landscape islands that separate double loaded
parking bays shall be a minimum of nine feet wide. Canopy trees planted in
these islands must be planted in line with the parking stripes (between
vehicles) and may be used to satisfy the parking lot tree requirements;
however, all parking lot bays must terminate with a tree island. Example shown
in §
153.343.
         (c)   Curbs, wheel stops, or other approved protective barriers shall
be installed around all required landscape islands, as approved the Zoning
Administrator.
         (d)   Landscaping provided to meet the right-of-way buffer standards
of division (D) below may not be used to satisfy interior parking lot
landscaping requirements. Canopy trees provided to meet perimeter adjacent use
buffer landscaping requirements may be counted to satisfy interior parking lot
landscaping requirements.
   (D)   Landscape buffers.
      (1)   Right-of-way buffers.
         (a)   Applicability. Right-of-way buffers shall be required adjacent
to road rights-of-way for all uses except for the agricultural and existing
residential uses. Minor subdivisions may not have to comply with the
requirements of this section if the Zoning Administrator determines that
compliance is not necessary to satisfy the purposes of this chapter.
         (b)   Buffer reductions. The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized
to reduce the depth of a required right-of-way buffer as follows:
            1.   General. A required right-of- way buffer may be reduced by up
to one-third its depth when the following circumstances exist:
               a.   The parcel is located on a corner lot with required right-
of-way buffers of 35 feet or more; or
               b.   The area of all the required buffers, including land use
buffers and tree protection area, exceeds 30% of the site.
            2.   Folly Road. A required right- of-way buffer not located within
the Folly Road Overlay District may be reduced as follows.
               a.   When no parking or vehicular use area is located between
the building and the right-of-way, the required buffer may be reduced to no
less than eight feet (type A land use buffer) provided there is a direct
connection with the street and the front entrance with a pedestrian way.
               b.   When no more than ten parking spaces are located between
the building and the right-of-way, the required buffer may be reduced to no
less than 15 feet (S2 buffer) provided there is a direct connection with the
street and the front entrance with a pedestrian way.
               c.   Buffers required on parcels that are part of redevelopment
that preserves existing structures may be reduced up to a depth no less than
ten feet (type A land use buffer) in order to meet the parking and tree
preservation requirements of this chapter.
         (c)   Buffer types by roadway. Landscape buffers shall be required
along roadways in accordance with the following table. Streets and roads not
indicated in the table shall comply with the S2 buffer requirements. This
division (D) describes buffer types and planting requirements.
         (d)   Development within buffer areas.
            1.   No development may occur within required buffer areas; with
the exception of sidewalks, bus stops, and permitted drives and signs;
            2.   All buffer areas shall accommodate required plant material
within the buffer;
            3.   Drainage swales and stormwater detention ponds may be placed
in the buffer only when trees are not endangered and only when they meander
through the buffer in a natural manner; and
            4.   Stormwater detention ponds may not occupy more than 25% of the
buffer area.

All trees with a diameter breast height (DBH) of six inches or greater within
buffers shall be preserved.
[1] Buffers may be traversed by permitted driveways and pedestrian ways.
[2] The retention of natural buffers shall be required along designated scenic
roadways and encouraged along all other roadways. The Zoning Administrator
shall be authorized to waive/modify minimum buffer planting requirements when
an undisturbed natural buffer exists that is the same depth as that which is
required.
[3] Bradford pears cannot be used to fulfill any of the tree requirements of
this chapter. Any exotic species which are proposed by the designer are subject
to the approval of the Zoning Administrator.
[4] When existing overhead utility lines are located such that they may pose
interference with required canopy trees, Palmetto trees may be substituted to
fulfill the canopy tree requirement. These trees are to be planted at a ratio
of three Palmetto trees to one canopy tree and are to be planted in groupings
of three.
Note: The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to require the installation
of berms within required buffers where deemed necessary to protect the visual
quality of a road corridor or ensure land use compatibility.
 
      (2)   Land use buffers.
         (a)   Applicability.  
            1.   Land use buffers shall be provided in accordance with the
standards of this section, provided that the Zoning Administrator shall be
authorized to modify or waive buffer or landscape planting requirements if it
is determined that:
               a.   Buffers will not serve any useful purpose due to the fact
that fences, walls, berms, or landscaping of at least equivalent height,
opacity, and maintenance already exist on the adjacent parcel;
               b.   Buffers will not serve any useful purpose due to the
location of uses, vehicles, buildings, structures, or storage, loading,
display, or service areas; or
               c.   The area of required buffers would exceed 25% of the site
proposed for development.
            2.   When landscape buffer requirements are modified or waived, the
Zoning Administrator may require that additional plant material be added within
remaining buffers or elsewhere on the site.
         (b)   Exemptions. Single-family development on individual lots shall
be exempt from the land use buffer requirements of this section.
         (c)   Determination of required buffers. The following procedure shall
be used in determining which of the buffer types in the land use buffer table
in division (D)(2)(d) below apply:
            1.   Determine the type of use proposed for the site that is being
developed. This is the “proposed use” (column 1);
            2.   Determine the residential use type that exists on the adjacent
parcel (if residential) or the zoning district classification that applies to
the adjacent parcel. This is the “adjacent site’s use or zoning;”
            3.   Identify the type of landscape buffer required along the
developing site’s boundary (A, B, C, D, E, or F); and
            4.   Refer to division (D)(2)(e) below to identify the buffer depth
and landscaping standards for the required buffer type.
         (d)   Land use buffer table. Land use buffers shall be provided
alongside and rear yards in accordance with the following minimum requirements.

[1] The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to require the installation
of fences, walls, or berms within required buffers where deemed necessary to
ensure land use compatibility or otherwise protect the visual quality of an
area.
[2] All trees with a diameter breast height (DBH) eight inches or greater
within buffers shall be preserved.
 
      (3)   General.
         (a)   Location of buffers. Buffers shall be located along the
perimeter of a lot or parcel and shall extend to the boundary of the lot or
parcel. They shall not be located on any portion of public right-of-way. Where
drainage or other utility easements exist along property lines, required
landscape buffers shall be located adjacent to the easement and may be reduced
in width by the width of the easement, but in no case shall the buffer be less
than ten feet. Required buffers shall be noted on all plats, plans, and permit
requests submitted for review and approval under this chapter.
         (b)   Use of buffers. The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to
allow on-premises signs, fences, walls, berms, mailboxes, access to community
boat ramps, permitted driveways, and sidewalks within required buffers. Other
improvements maybe allowed within buffers if the Zoning Administrator
determines that such improvements will not detract from the intended purpose
and function of the buffer or have any adverse effect on adjacent property.
         (c)   Plant material within buffers. Plant material within required
buffers shall be selected and spaced properly to allow plant material to thrive
considering site specific conditions. Plant material to be located adjacent to
public drainage easements and rights-of-way shall be selected and placed to not
create future access or maintenance impediments including low lying lateral
branches. Additionally, plant material within required buffers that contain
utility easements shall be selected and sited to minimize pruning for future
maintenance and clearance of such utilities. The Zoning Administrator must
approve all selections and may require modifications (substitutions and
relocation) of plant material on proposed landscape plans when necessary to
ensure access and ease of maintenance to any easements and rights-of-way and to
preserve the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (E)   Landscape plans. Landscape and planting plans submitted to meet the
requirements of the chapter are to be drawn to the same scale as the site plan
depicting proposed shrubs and trees at maturity. It is strongly encouraged that
all landscape plans be prepared by a licensed registered landscape architect or
landscape designer familiar with the growth habits and characteristics of plant
material available in the town’s area. Landscape plans shall be prepared by a
licensed, registered landscape architect whenever the area of land disturbance
or
development activity exceeds one acre or when the total area of proposed
building footprint exceeds 5,000 square feet.
   (F)   Landscape material standards. Landscape and plant material used to
satisfy the standards of this chapter shall comply with the minimum standards
of this section.
      (1)   Plant material.
         (a)   Existing plant material. Vegetation and plant material that
exists on a parcel prior to its development may be used to satisfy the
landscaping standards of this division (F) provided that it meets the size and
locational requirements of this section.
         (b)   Size. Unless otherwise expressly stated, all plant materials
used to satisfy the requirements of this chapter shall meet the following
minimum size standards:
 
Plant Type                   Minimum Size
Canopy tree                  2-1/2 inches caliper and 12 feet in height
Evergreen/conifer tree       5 feet (height)
Shrubs                       3 gallon and 18 to 24 inches in height or spread
Understory/ ornamental trees 8 feet (height)
Note: At least 50% of required understory trees shall be evergreens. Any plant
material that grows to an ultimate height of less than 18 inches shall be
considered a groundcover and cannot be used to fulfill any of the shrub
requirements of this chapter.
 
         (c)   Species. Species of plant material used to satisfy the
requirements of this section shall be indigenous to the town’s area or are
cultivated to survive in the climate of this area. No single plant species
shall represent more than 40% of total landscape plantings, except for projects
whose landscape requirements for canopy trees are lower than ten.
         (d)   Quality. Plants installed to satisfy the requirements of this
division (F) shall meet or exceed the plant quality standards of the most
recent edition of American Standard for Nursery Stock, published by the
American Association of Nurserymen. Plants shall be nursery-grown and balled
and burlapped or container-grown.
         (e)   Additional landscape treatment. All required landscape areas,
including drainage ways and detention/retention ponds, and buffers not
dedicated to trees, shrubs, or preservation of existing vegetation shall be
landscaped with grass, ground cover, or other landscape treatment, not
including sand, rock, or pavement. All grass areas are to be installed using
proper and accepted landscape methods to ensure germination and erosion
control.
      (2)   Berms and landscape structures. Berms and landscape structures
shall comply with the following minimum standards:
         (a)   Fences and walls. Fences and walls used as a screen shall be at
least 95% opaque with a minimum height of six feet.
         (b)   Berms. Earthen berms shall have a minimum height of three feet
with a slope not to exceed 3:1, variable dependent upon the plant materials and
soil type used. The toe of any berm shall be located at least three feet from
the ultimate right-of-way or property line.
   (G)   Installation, maintenance, and replacement.
      (1)   Installation. All landscaping shall be installed according to
American Association of Nurserymen Standards and sound nursery practices in a
manner designed to encourage vigorous growth. Site for plant material shall be
repaired or improved in accordance with American Association of Nurserymen
Standards for soil preparation and drainage. Subsurface drainage shall be
provided where berms, elevated planting areas, or other suitable means for
providing proper drainage do not exist.
      (2)   Irrigation. The Zoning Administrator shall be authorized to require
the installation of automatic irrigation (sprinkler) systems when deemed
necessary to ensure plant survival and proper growth.
      (3)   Maintenance and replacement.  Required trees, shrubs, walls, and
other landscape features shall be considered as elements of the project in the
same manner as parking, building materials, and other details are elements of
the plan.
         (a)   The land owner or successors in interest shall be jointly and
severally responsible for the following:
            1.   Regular maintenance of all landscaping in good condition and
in a way that presents a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance. All landscaping
shall be maintained free from disease, pests, weeds, and litter. This
maintenance shall include weeding, watering, fertilizing, pruning, mowing,
edging, mulching, or other maintenance, as needed and in accordance with
acceptable horticultural practices, including ANSI Standards for Tree Care
Operations and American Association of Nurserymen Standards;
            2.   The repair or replacement of required landscape structures
(e.g., fences) to a structurally sound condition;
            3.   The regular maintenance, repair, or replacement, where
necessary, of any landscaping required by this section; and
            4.   Continuous maintenance of the site as a whole.
         (b)   When replacement of trees, plant material, or other landscape
features is required, such replacement shall be accomplished within one growing
season, one year or such time-frame as required by the Zoning Administrator,
whichever is shorter.

§ 153.336 ARCHITECTURAL AND LANDSCAPE DESIGN GUIDELINES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of these standards is to promote attractive,
well-designed development that is built to human scale; to promote and protect
the appearance, character, and economic value of new development; to encourage
creativity in new development (as opposed to homogeneity or “look-alike”
projects); and to foster attractive streetscapes and pedestrian environments,
while accommodating safe vehicular movements and access.
   (B)   Applicability. These standards shall apply to all developments that
are subject to site plan review (see §
153.046).
   (C)   Architectural design guidelines. The intent of the architectural
design guidelines is to ensure respect for the character, integrity, and
quality of the built and natural environments of the town; it is not intended
to stifle innovative architecture. The following criteria shall be used in
evaluating applications:
      (1)   General design.
         (a)   Single, large building masses shall be avoided. Structures with
walls of more than 1,500 square feet shall incorporate fascias, canopies,
arcades, building setbacks of three feet or more, or other multi-dimensional
design features to break up large wall surfaces on their street-facing
elevations. Wall structures shall be visually divided by such features into
areas of 750 square feet or less.
         (b)   All elevations of a structure shall be in harmony, one with
another, in terms of scale, proportion, detail, material, color, and high
design quality.
         (c)   The side and rear elevations of buildings shall be as visually
attractive as the front elevation, especially where those side or rear
elevations are most often viewed by the public. Rooflines and architectural
detailing shall present a consistency in quality design.
         (d)   All structures within a proposed development, including gasoline
canopies, shall utilize a uniform architectural theme and shall be designed to
create a harmonious whole. It is not to be inferred that buildings must look
alike to achieve a harmony of style. Harmony of style can be created through
property considerations of scale, proportion, detail, materials, color, site
planning, and landscaping.
         (e)   The scale of buildings and accessory structures, including
canopies, shall be appropriate to the scale of structures located in the
surrounding area. Canopies designed as domineering or overpowering
architectural features are strongly discouraged.
         (f)   Long, monotonous facade design, including, but not limited to,
those characterized by unrelieved repetition of shape or form or by unbroken
extension of line, shall not be permitted.
         (g)   The architectural design and material finish of buildings,
signage, gasoline pump canopies, and other necessary structures shall be
compatible with one another and with adjacent and surrounding structures where
such structures are substantially in compliance with these requirements.
         (h)   Structures which are of symbolic design for reasons of
advertising shall not be permitted. A symbol or symbols attached to a building
shall not be allowed unless it is secondary in appearance to the structure and
landscape and is an aesthetic asset to the building and surrounding area.
         (i)   The location and dimension of wall signs shall be indicated upon
the architectural elevations of proposed structures and shall maintain
compatibility with the architectural features of the structure.
      (2)   Building materials.
         (a)   Concrete finishes or pre-cast concrete panels (tilt wall) that
are not exposed aggregate, hammered, sandblasted, or covered with a cement-
based acrylic coating shall be prohibited as an exterior building material
along any building elevation visible from public rights-of-way.
         (b)   Unpainted or bare metal panels, regardless of depth or
thickness, shall be prohibited as an exterior building material.
         (c)   Corrugated of sheet metal, except stainless steel, copper, or
galvanized metal shall be prohibited as an exterior building material along any
building elevation visible from public rights-of-way.
         (d)   Mirrored glass with a reflectance greater than 40% shall be
prohibited from covering more than 40% of the exterior walls of any building.
         (e)   Materials shall express their function clearly and honestly and
shall not appear as materials which are foreign to the character of the rest of
the building.
         (f)   Any building exterior elevation shall consist of architectural
materials which are equal in quality, appearance, and detail to all other
exterior elevations of the same structure. Nothing in this section shall
preclude the use of different materials on different exterior elevations of the
same structure so long as those materials maintain the architectural unity and
integrity of the entire structure.
         (g)   Shingles, metal standing seam, tile, or other roofing materials
with similar appropriate texture and appearance shall be utilized. Flat roofs
will not be discouraged where they are appropriate to the design theme of a
structure.
      (3)   Building color.
         (a)   Color shades shall be used to unify the development.
         (b)   Color combinations of paints shall be complimentary. In no case
shall garish colors be permitted. In general, no more than three different
colors per building shall be allowed.
      (4)   Multiple building developments. Each individual building within a
development shall feature predominant characteristics including, but not
limited to, consistent rooflines, use of compatible proportions in building
mass and outdoor spaced, complementary relationships to the street, similar
window and door patterns, and the use of complimentary building materials in
terms of color, shades, and textures. Monotony of identically designed multiple
building projects shall be avoided. Variation of detail, form, and siting shall
be used to provide visual interest. The use of different textures, shadow
lines, and contrasting shapes may also be used to provide visual interest.
      (5)   Building orientation.
         (a)   Facades and entries. To the maximum extent feasible, primary
facades and entries should face the adjacent street or a connecting walkway
with a direct pedestrian connection to the street without requiring pedestrians
to walk through parking lots or cross driveways.
         (b)   Views. Where it is reasonably practical, proposed structures
shall not impede scenic rural views from the main road, from existing
structures, or from natural settings.
         (c)   Loading areas. Structures shall be oriented so that loading
areas are in no manner visible from residential districts, from existing
rights-of-way, or from planned future public rights-of-way. Loading areas may
be oriented toward adjoining developed properties which are commercially zoned
or toward adjoining properties eligible for future commercial development if
and only if they are entirely screened from view by the use of fencing which is
compatible with the overall architectural scheme of the project and/or are
appropriately landscaped.
         (d)   Corners. All corner developments shall have buildings located
close to the corner with majority of parking to the side and rear.
         (e)   Siting. All buildings shall be sited so that a direct
relationship with the primary street is established. The architecture,
landscaping, and building siting must work in concert to create a unified
appearance.
         (f)   Gas stations. Buildings shall be sited so that gasoline pump
dispensers are located to the side of the building or located behind the
buildings so that the building is between the pumps and the primary street
frontage. If located on a corner lot, the building would have to be situated in
the corner of the lot at the intersection.
      (6)   Mechanical equipment and trash receptacle screening. Locations of
all mechanical equipment and dumpsters shall be shown on all site plans. All
mechanical equipment and trash receptacles shall be shielded and screened from
public view, Mechanical equipment shall be shielded with walls, fencing, or
landscaping that screens the equipment entirely. Dumpsters shall be screened
with a minimum six-foot opaque fence or wall on all four sides and located
toward the side or rear of the principal structure.
      (7)   Drive-through services. All order boxes, menu stands, pickup
windows, service/teller windows, and required vehicle stacking associated with
drive-through services shall be located to the side or rear of buildings. For
the purpose of this section, the SIDE OR REAR shall mean the area behind a
projected line running parallel from the front (street facing) side(s) of the
structure to the side property lines. This concept is depicted in the graphic
below:
   (D)   Landscaping design guidelines. The purpose and intent of landscaping
design guidelines is to reduce the visibility of paved areas from adjacent
properties and streets, moderate climatic effects, minimize noise and glare,
and enhance public safety by defining spaces to influence traffic movement.
Landscaping will reduce the amount of stormwater runoff and provide transition
between neighboring properties. The following criteria shall be used in
evaluating applications:
      (1)   General design.
         (a)   Landscaping shall be required between buildings and sidewalks
and parking lots and driveways. The scale of the proposed landscaping shall be
in proportion to the building.
         (b)   Landscaping does not only include trees and plantings but also
paving, benches, fountains, exterior lighting fixtures, fences, and any other
item of exterior furniture. All items of the landscape are to be selected not
only for their functional value but for their aesthetic value and must
compliment the whole.
         (c)   All utility lines in the suburban areas such as electric,
telephone, CATV, or other similar lines serving individual sites, as well as
all utility lines necessary within the property, shall be placed underground.
All junction and access boxes shall be screened with appropriate landscaping.
All utility pad fixtures and meters should be shown on the site plan. The
necessity for utility connections, meter boxes, and the like should be
recognized and integrated with the architectural elements of the site plan. All
properties shall comply with the town’s right-of-way management ordinance where
applicable.
         (d)   Ease of pedestrian access between proposed developments and
adjacent developments shall be a required consideration in the development of a
proposed project’s site and circulation plans.
      (2)   Parking; drives.
         (a)   Parking areas and driveways shall be paved with material which
is appropriate to the comprehensive design scheme of the project and to the
intensity of use to which parking areas and driveways will be subject.
         (b)   Buildings shall be sited so that the majority of parking is
located to the side and rear of the building. The placement of the major
portion of a proposed development’s parking area to the rear of a main
structure’s corridor facade or within a courtyard surrounded on three sides by
a proposed structure is strongly encouraged. The rationale for this guideline
is to promote good proportional spatial definition for the corridors to be
accomplished through a reduction in the distance required for a building’s
setback.
         (c)   Drive-through access shall be integrally designed with the
building and not dominate the design. Only single lane drive-throughs are
allowed. Multi-lane drive-throughs are only allowed for banks (or similar
financial institutions), post office, or utilities.
      (3)   Site lighting. Site lighting shall be from a concealed light source
fixture and shall not interfere with the vision of vehicular traffic. A
lighting plan with photo-metrics shall be stamped and signed by a registered
professional engineer and comply with the following criteria:
         (a)   Maximum average foot-candles shall not exceed five foot candles
as depicted on photometric plans with a maximum not to exceed 12 foot candles
close to light sources. Maximum foot candles under gasoline canopies and
outdoor sales lots shall not exceed 30 foot candles.
         (b)   All exterior lights shall be arranged and installed so that the
direct of reflected illumination does not exceed 0.5 foot candles above the
background measured at the lot line of any adjoining residential or
agricultural parcel and public right-of-way.
         (c)   Lighting shall enhance the overall aesthetics of the site.
         (d)   Security lighting shall be provided, particularly at pedestrian
walkways.
         (e)   Lighting shall be integrated with the architectural design of
the buildings.
         (f)   Light sources (light bulbs) shall not be visible. They shall be
shielded to reflect down onto the ground and not out onto the streets or
neighboring property.

§ 153.337 WETLANDS, WATERWAYS, AND OCRM CRITICAL LINE.
   (A)   Wetland buffers and setbacks.
      (1)   Intent. The buffer standards of this section are intended to
provide a natural vegetated area between the furthermost projection of a
structure, parking or driveway area, or any other building elements and all
saltwater wetlands, waterways, and OCRM (saltwater) critical lines. The purpose
of these required buffers is to provide a visual, spatial, and ecological
transition zone between development and the town’s saltwater wetlands and
waterways and to protect water quality and wildlife habitat.

      (2)   Measurement. Required OCRM critical line buffers and setbacks shall
be measured from the OCRM critical line, whether the critical line or wetland/
waterway is located on, adjacent to, or near the subject parcel.
      (3)   Lot width. The minimum lot width standards of the underlying zoning
district shall apply at the required buffer or setback line.
   (B)   Prohibited activities. The following activities are specifically
prohibited in a buffer area:
      (1)   Removal excavation or disturbance of the soil, except for minimal
disturbance associated with the planting of shrubs or trees for landscaping;
      (2)   Grassed lawns requiring regular maintenance such as herbicides,
pesticides, fertilizers, and frequent mowing;
      (3)   Gardens, fences or structures, except for permitted crossings;
      (4)   Paved or other impervious surfaces; and

(existing and future) listed on the National Register of Historic Places.
   (C)   Demolition. No demolition of a historic structure or site may occur
until a special exception has been approved in accordance with the provisions
of this chapter.
   (D)   Moving. No relocation of a historic structure or site may occur until
a special exception has been approved in accordance with the provisions of this
chapter. Relocation should not be considered, except as a final alternative to
demolition.
   (E)   New construction; exterior alterations. No new construction located on
a historic structure or site or significant exterior alteration of a historic
structure of site may occur until a special exception has been approved in
accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The applicant must demonstrate
that all proposed renovations are consistent with the National Register of
Historic Places (NRHP) such that the structure shall remain listed on the NRHP
following the completion of the proposed new construction and exterior
alterations.
   (F)   Nearby development. Subdivision plats for multi-family, office,
commercial, or industrial development or residential subdivisions proposed to
be located within 300 feet of a historic structure or site should be reviewed
to determine their impact on the historic site. The Zoning Administrator shall
require that potential negative impacts be minimized through the location of
vehicular access points, screening, buffering, and other site design tools.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 9.8, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2013-07, passed 10-17-2013)
§ 153.339 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDIES.
   (A)   Applicability. A traffic impact study shall be required with
applications for zoning map amendments, preliminary plats, and planned
developments that are projected to generate 20 or more peak hour vehicle trips,
based on trip generation rates from the latest edition of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers trip generation manual. The Planning or Public Works
Director shall also be authorized to require traffic impact studies when it is
determined that a proposed development is likely to have a significant impact
on transportation capacity, transportation levels of service, or traffic safety
in the vicinity of the proposed development.
   (B)   Study scope. When a traffic impact study is required, the type and
scope of the study shall be determined during a scoping meeting with the
Planning and Public Works Directors. The meeting may also involve
representatives of or request assessments from other agencies and departments.
The elements to be determined during the scoping session shall include:
      (1)   Type of study. The possible types of reports include: a letter
report, full traffic impact analysis report, or special report (e.g., sight
distance survey);
      (2)   Definition of impact area. The points of access and key streets and
intersections that may be affected by development of the subject tract
constitute the impact area. Traffic recorder and turning movement assessment
locations shall be determined;
      (3)   Period of analysis. Periods of analysis may include: daily traffic,
a.m., p.m., or weekend peak hour;
      (4)   Analysis scenarios. Scenarios for analysis include: existing
conditions, opening year conditions with and without development, and ten years
after opening with and without development;
      (5)   Process. Process for determining trip generation and distribution
including: trip generation category, diversion assumptions, and distribution
assumptions;
      (6)   Growth rate assumption. The rate of growth assumed in background
traffic assumptions; and

including geometric features, lane usage, traffic control, signage, sight
distances and adjacent uses, and curb cuts.
         (b)   Traffic volumes. Existing traffic volumes shall be provided for
the impact area including both AADT (average annual daily traffic) and “design”
peak hour volumes. AADT may be derived from current counts of the State
Department of Transportation (if available) and peak hour volumes shall be
determined from field counts. Data shall be adjusted for daily and seasonal
variations. Turning movement counts for the peak hour shall be provided for
critical intersections. Peak hour periods shall be as determined at the scoping
meeting.
         (c)   Capacity analysis. Existing capacity of signalized and
unsignalized intersections.
         (d)   Other. Other items may be required at the discretion of the
Public Works Director depending upon the type and scale of the project. These
may include, but are not limited to: queue length analysis, pedestrian counts,
accident data, traffic speeds (both fiftieth and eighty-fifth percentile) and
stopping sight distance.
      (2)   Future without development. Capacity analysis is to be provided for
opening year and plus ten-year for key intersections (and roadway segments
where appropriate) without the development but including any planned
developments. The analysis shall be based upon the Highway Capacity Manual or
other methodologies approved in advance by the Public Works Director.
      (3)   Future with development.
         (a)   Projection of the daily and peak hour traffic generation of the
project shall be made using the latest edition of the Institute of
Transportation Engineers trip generation manual unless the Public Works
Director determines that locally derived data will provide more accurate
forecasts. Data from similar facilities may be used where the information is
not available from the Institute of Transportation Engineers.
         (b)   The projected trips shall be distributed onto the road network
as agreed in the scoping meeting.
         (c)   Capacity analysis for opening year and plus ten-year for key

signalization, minimum safe sight distances, gap analysis, turning radius
requirements, queue length analysis, turning lane length analysis, curb cut
locations, or similar requirements.
      (4)   Mitigation plan. Where the analysis indicates that the project will
create deficiencies in the impact area, improvements shall be recommended which
shall include projected cost estimates. The design of improvements shall be in
accordance with specifications of the Public Works Director and, where
appropriate, the State Department of Transportation. Where a decision-making
body determines that a mitigation plan is not adequate to address the traffic
impacts of the project, it may serve as a basis for denial of the rezoning,
preliminary plat, or planned development request.
      (5)   Consultants. The Public Works Director may require that a mutually
agreed upon independent consultant be hired by the town to perform required
traffic impact studies or to review all or part of a study prepared by the
applicant’s consultants. The Public Works Director is authorized to administer
the contract for such consultants.
         (a)   The Public Works Director shall determine the scope of services
to be performed by the independent consultant and receive a cost estimate of
such services.
         (b)   The applicant shall provide an amount equal to the estimate to
the Public Works Director, who will deposit the amount in an escrow or special
account set up for this purpose. Any funds not used for the independent
consultant shall be returned to the applicant in a timely manner without
interest.
         (c)   The Public Works Director may require additional fees for the
independent review if: the decision-making body expands the scope of the
required review; the applicant substantially amends the application; additional
meetings involving the consultants are requested by the applicant; the
consultant’s appearance is requested at Planning Commission or Town Council
meetings beyond what was initially anticipated; or the consultant’s attendance
is required at meetings with regional, state, or federal agencies or boards
which were not anticipated in the earlier scope of services.

NONCONFORMITIES
§ 153.355 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the general policy of the town to allow uses, structures, lots,
signs, and other situations that came into existence legally – in conformance
with then-applicable requirements – to continue to exist and to be put to
productive use, but to bring as many aspects of such situations into compliance
with existing regulations as is reasonably possible. This subchapter
establishes regulations governing uses, structures, lots, and signs that were
legally established but that do not comply with one or more existing
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The regulations of the subchapter are intended to:
      (1)   Recognize the interests of property owners in continuing to use
their property;
      (2)   Promote reuse and rehabilitation of existing buildings; and
      (3)   Place reasonable limits on the expansion of nonconformities that
have the potential to adversely affect surrounding properties and the town as a
whole.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 10.1.1, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2013-09, passed 8-15-2013)
§ 153.356 EXISTING NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   Authority to continue. Any nonconformity that legally existed on
October 18, 2012 or that becomes nonconforming upon the adoption of any
amendment of this chapter may be continued in accordance with the provisions of
this subchapter.
   (B)   Determination of nonconformity status. The burden of establishing that
a nonconformity is a legal nonconformity shall, in all cases, rest solely upon
the owner of such nonconformity.
   (C)   Repairs and maintenance. Incidental repairs and normal maintenance of
nonconformities shall be permitted unless such repairs are otherwise expressly
prohibited by this chapter. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to
prevent structures from being structurally strengthened or restored to a safe
condition, in accordance with an official order of the Director of Building
Inspection or his or her designee.
   (D)   Change of tenancy or ownership. The status of nonconformity is not
affected by changes of tenancy, ownership, or management.

passed 8-15-2013)
§ 153.357 NONCONFORMITIES CREATED BY PUBLIC ACTION.
   When lot area or setbacks are reduced as a result of conveyance to a
federal, state, or local government for a public purpose and the remaining area
is at least 50% of the otherwise applicable minimum standard, then that lot
shall be deemed to be in compliance with the minimum lot area and setback
standards of this chapter.

§ 153.358 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Definition. A NONCONFORMING USE is a use that was legally established
but which is no longer allowed by the use regulations of the zoning district in
which it is located.
   (B)   Expansion. A nonconforming commercial or industrial use shall not be
enlarged or expanded unless one of the following conditions exists:
      (1)   Such expansion eliminates or reduces the nonconforming aspects of
the situation; or
      (2)   The expansion is into a part of the building or structure that was
lawfully and manifestly designed or arranged for such use, provided that no
such expansions shall be allowed if displaces a conforming use.
   (C)   Change of use.
      (1)   A nonconforming use may not be changed to any use other than a use
allowed in the zoning district in which it is located, provided that the Board
of Zoning Appeals shall be authorized to approve a change to another
nonconforming use in accordance with the special exception procedures of this
chapter. In acting upon such requests, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall not be
guided by the special exception approval criteria of this chapter, but rather
shall approve the change of use only upon a finding that the new use will be
less detrimental to adjacent property and general area than the existing
nonconforming use.
      (2)   When a conforming use becomes nonconforming as result of a zoning
map amendment initiated by the applicant, the nonconforming use shall then be
removed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the conforming
use.
   (D)   Loss of legal nonconforming status.
      (1)   Abandonment. If a nonconforming use is replaced with another use or
is discontinued for any reason for a period of more than 12 consecutive months
or 18 months in cumulative total within any three-year period, the use shall be
considered abandoned. Once abandoned, the use’s legal nonconforming status
shall be lost and re-establishment of a nonconforming use shall be prohibited.
Any subsequent use of the property shall comply with the regulations of the
zoning district in which it is located.
      (2)   Damage or destruction.
         (a)   No nonconforming commercial or industrial use that is damaged by
fire or any other cause shall be restored if the cost of the repair equals 50%
or more of the use’s total physical replacement cost, which shall consist
solely of labor and materials. Determination of physical replacement costs
shall be made by the Director of Building Inspection. When such repairs are
allowed to be made, they shall be in full compliance with the regulations of
this chapter.
         (b)   A nonconforming residential use that is damaged by fire or any
other cause may be restored. In such cases, the use may be re-established to
the extent that existed before the time of damage, within the pre-existing
structure boundaries (footprint and height), provided that the repairs or
rebuilding do not increase the degree of nonconformity and provided that such
repairs, restoration, or reconstruction begin within 12 months of the date of
such damage.
   (E)   Accessory uses and structures. No use or structure that is accessory
to a principal nonconforming use or structure shall continue after such
principal use or structure shall have ceased or terminated, unless it complies
with all regulations of this chapter.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 10.2, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2013-09, passed 8-15-2013)
§ 153.359 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Definition. A NONCONFORMING STRUCTURE is any building or structure
that was legally established but which no longer complies with the density,
intensity, and dimensional standards of the underlying zoning district.
   (B)   Use. A nonconforming structure may be used for any use allowed in the
underlying zoning district.
   (C)   Expansion. A nonconforming residential structure may be enlarged or
expanded if such residential expansion follows the outside wall at ground
level, other than porches, decks, or canopies. The outside wall (other than
porches, decks, or canopies) of a nonconforming residential structure that does
not meet current dimensional standards (setbacks), shall only be allowed to
expand vertically from ground level provided that such expansion does not
exceed the maximum building height requirements for that zoning district or
encroach into any setback. All other expansion shall meet all other applicable
portions of the chapter including density, intensity, and dimensional
standards.
   (D)   Moving. A nonconforming structure may be moved in whole or in part to
another location if the movement or relocation does not increase the extent of
nonconformity.
   (E)   Subdivision. If a lot is occupied by a nonconforming structure, it may
be subdivided provided that subdividing does not create a new nonconformity or
increase the degree of nonconformance of the structure.
   (F)   Loss of legal nonconforming status; damage or destruction.
      (1)   No nonconforming commercial or industrial structure that is damaged
by fire or any other cause shall be restored if the cost of the repair work
equals 50% or more of the structure’s total physical replacement cost.
Determination of physical replacement costs shall be made by the Director of
Building Inspection. When such repairs are allowed to be made, they shall be in
full compliance with the regulations of this chapter.
      (2)   A nonconforming residential structure that is damaged by fire or
any other cause may be restored. In such cases, the structure may be re-
established to the extent that existed before the time of damage, within the
pre-existing structure boundaries (footprint and height), provided that the
repairs or rebuilding do not increase the degree of nonconformity and provided
that such repairs, restoration, and reconstruction begin within 12 months of
the date of such damage.
      (3)   Nothing in this section shall conflict with the requirements of the
Federal Emergency Management Agency’s Flood Plain Management Regulations.

§ 153.360 NONCONFORMING LOTS.
   (A)   Definition. A NONCONFORMING LOT is a tract of land, designated on a
duly recorded subdivision plat, by a duly recorded deed or by other lawful
means, that complied with the lot area, lot width, and lot depth standards of
the zoning district in which it was located at the time of its creation, but
which does not comply with the minimum lot area, lot width, or lot depth
requirements of the zoning district in which it is now located.
   (B)   Vacant lots. If a nonconforming lot or parcel was vacant on the date
on which this chapter became applicable to it, then the owner may use the
property for uses allowed by the underlying zoning district, provided that the
use shall comply with the applicable setback to the maximum extent possible. If
the underlying zoning district permits a variety of uses or a variety or
intensities or uses and one or more uses or intensities would comply with
setback standards, while others would not, then only the uses or intensities
that would comply with the applicable setback standards shall be permitted.
   (C)   Lot with building or structure. If a nonconforming lot or parcel
contains a building or structure on the date on which this chapter became
applicable to it, then the owner may continue the use of that building or
structure and may reasonably expand the structure in any way that does not
increase the degree of nonconformity; an increase in building size shall not be
deemed to increase the degree of nonconformity unless it increases the
encroachment on a required setback.

processed when the property owner(s) has been notified, pursuant to §
153.377(B), that a violation of this chapter exists on or in the use of land
that is the subject of the requested change. The Zoning Administrator may,
however, after consideration of the specific case, waive this requirement and
direct staff to process the application if it is found that a zoning map
amendment serves to remedy the violation. However, this waiver does not release
the property owner, applicant, and/or designated agent from compliance with
this subchapter nor does it guarantee approval of the requested zoning map
amendment. If the zoning map amendment is disapproved by Town Council, the
property owner, applicant, and/or designated agent has a maximum of 30 calendar
days from the date of disapproval to bring the subject property into
compliance.
   (B)   Board of Zoning Appeals requests. An application (along with related
documents and fees) to go before the Board of Zoning Appeals (BZA) shall not be
accepted or processed when the property owner(s) has been notified that a
violation of this chapter exists on or in the use of land that is the subject
of the request. The Zoning Administrator may, after consideration of the
specific case, waive this requirement and direct staff to process the
application, if the BZA request serves as a remedy for the violation. However,
this waiver does not release the property owner, applicant, and/or designated
agent from compliance with this subchapter.
   (C)   Contempt before the Board of Zoning Appeals. In case of contempt by
any party, witness, or other person before the Board of Zoning Appeals, such
Board may certify such fact to the Circuit Court of the town wherein such
contempt occurs and the judge of the court, after hearing, may impose such
penalty as the facts authorize or require.
   (D)   Other actions. Nothing herein shall prevent the town from taking such
other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation.
(Ord. 2012-06, § 11.9, passed 10-18-2012; Ord. 2013-10, passed 8-15-2013)
§ 153.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   General. Any person violating any provision of this chapter for which
no specific penalty is provided shall be subject to the penalty provisions in §
10.99.
   (B)   Tree protection and preservation violations. Any person, firm,
organization, society, association, corporation, or any agent or representative
thereof who commits, participates, or assists in a violation of the tree
protection and preservation standards of this chapter may each be found guilty
of a separate offense and suffer the penalties herein provided. Each
unauthorized removal, destruction, or failure to replace a tree shall
constitute a separate offense. Failure to pay all or any part of the Tree Fund
mitigation fee within 30 days of the fee’s imposition is a violation of the
Tree Fund provision of this chapter. Failure to pay fees may result in a
collection action in the same manner as prescribed by law for the collection of
other fees. Failure to pay the mitigation fee may also result in a criminal
proceeding. If a matter is brought in criminal court, upon conviction, the
maximum penalty is $500 per violation and/or 30 days imprisonment and
restitution of the Tree Fund mitigation fee. Restitution shall be paid to the
Finance Officer who will place all funds in the Tree Fund Account.

   (H)   Road construction.
      (1)   Soil testing.
         (a)   The Public Works Director will determine the quality of
foundation soils by visual observations and adequate soil testing provided by
the design professional. Without such testing, the Public Works Director will
utilize judgment and experience to determine the quality of the foundation
material and shall require appropriate action including, but not limited to,
undercutting or mucking and replacing the excavated material with suitable
earth materials. The soil-testing program shall be presented to, and approved
by, the Public Works Director prior to the beginning of the testing. The
testing program shall show the number and approximate locations of borings,
sampling depths, and type of test to be made. Ample notice of testing schedules
shall be given and a copy of all results, including recommendations, shall be
provided upon completion of the tests.
         (b)   The testing program may establish levels or degrees of testing.
For example, the testing program may call for a minimum number of tests for
determination of general soil classifications and water table data for
preliminary site evaluation. For the design of pavement, the testing program
shall include, but is not limited to, the determination of the maximum
elevation of the groundwater table, the soil classification according to the
Unified Soil Classification System (laboratory test determination), and the
California Bearing Ratio (CBR) (laboratory test determination utilizing 96-hour
saturation). Proctor testing for determination of optimum moisture and maximum
density using the modified Proctor-Test ASTM D l557 Method A, and field
moisture and density tests may be required by the Public Works Director.
      (2)   Grading.
         (a)   Streets shall be graded to the designed typical section in
accordance with the approved plans and profiles. Grade stakes shall be set on
centerlines at intervals of not more than 100' on tangent grades and not more

otherwise, shall be in accordance with the requirements of the CTC (SS) or the
SCDOT (SS).
         (c)   No base or surfacing materials shall be placed before the
subgrade is inspected and approved by the Public Works Director.
         (d)   In general, soils classified lower than "SC," according to the
Unified Soil Classification System, are not acceptable for the upper 24" of the
subgrade.
         (e)   The compacted subgrade shall be proof-rolled prior to placement
of any base or surfacing materials. Testing shall be performed in the presence
of the Public Works Director. The testing procedure shall consist of driving a
loaded tandem truck (10 cubic yard minimum load capacity, 3,035 ton minimum
total weight), or other equivalent vehicle (as determined by the Public Works
Director) at slow-walking speed longitudinally along the length of the roadway
test area. Any areas exhibiting pumping or breaking of the surface shall be
stabilized or removed to appropriate depth and replaced with suitable material,
recompacted, and retested.
      (3)   Subgrade.
         (a)   Work shall consist of the construction and preparation of the
subgrade – that part of the roadway intended to receive the base course,
pavement, pedestrian way, curb, curb and gutter, and/or shoulders.
      (b)   Roads shall be graded to the designed typical section in accordance
with the approved plan and profile, and shall be free of roots, trash, and
other unsuitable materials for a minimum depth of 24" below the finished
subgrade.
      (c)   A suitable soil is required for a minimum depth of 18" immediately
below the base course to provide a road that will serve the traffic needs in
extremely dry, normal, and in wet weather. Where necessary, a stabilizing type
soil shall be added and properly mixed with the soil in place for a depth of
not less than 6".
      (d)   When unstable material is encountered and it is necessary to
perform mucking work, the roadway shall be mucked for its entire width, ditch
line to ditch line or extending 2' beyond the backs of curbs; backfilled with a
suitable, stable-type soil; and properly compacted. All objectionable loose
rock or boulders shall be removed or broken off to a depth of not less than 24"
below the surface of the subgrade.
      (e)   The subgrade is to be sufficiently wetted and shall be compacted
for a width extending 2' outside the edges of the proposed pavement before the
base course is placed.
      (f)   The subgrade, from a distance of 24" outside the area to be
occupied by the pavement or curb and gutter, shall be compacted to not less
than 95% of maximum density. The compaction shall be accomplished by using
suitable construction procedures with the subgrade at optimum construction
moisture content. Sprinkling to secure proper compaction may wet the subgrade.
ASTM D 1557 Method A will determine maximum densities.
      (g)   The subgrade shall be maintained in a smooth and compacted
condition, free from ruts and depressions, and shall be adequately drained. In
no case shall any base, surface course or pavement be placed on a frozen,
muddy, or unstable subgrade. Storing or stockpiling of materials directly on
the subgrade will not be permitted except with the approval of the Public Works
Director.
      (4)   Seeding and mulching. All unpaved areas within the right-of-way
shall be seeded and mulched. The developer shall be responsible for maintenance
of such seeded and mulched areas as described in the CTC (SS) or the SCDOT (SS)
until the street and/or drainage system is accepted into the town maintenance
system.

ARTICLE A.5 - ENCROACHMENTS
§ A.5.1 ENCROACHMENTS AND WORK WITHIN RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND DRAINAGE EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Introduction. This section is intended to provide a general guideline
for the design and construction of structures that may be located within
rights-of-way or drainage easements that have been, or will be, accepted into
the Town of James Island maintenance system. No work shall be commenced until
an encroachment permit for such work has been obtained from the Public Works
Director.
   (B)   Encroachment permits; general.
      (1)   Any permanent or temporary construction or placement of any
structure or object (sign, fence, etc.) within a Town of James Island drainage
easement or road right-of-way must receive an encroachment permit from the
Public Works Director prior to the beginning of work or emplacement of
structure or object.
      (2)   The encroaching entity will submit all permit requests on the Town
of James Island Application for Encroachment Permit Form for review.
Application fees will be in accordance with current Town of James Island User
Fee schedules. Permits will be approved or denied by the Public Works Director
within 30 days of receipt.
      (3)   If, in the opinion of the Town of James Island, the South Carolina
Department of Transportation, or any other public agency, it should ever become
necessary to relocate or remove the encroachment, or any part thereof, due to
the improvement, relocation, or widening of the road, street, or drainage
system, or for any other reason, such moving or removing will be done on demand
of the Public Works Director at the expense of the permittee.
      (4)   Adequate provisions shall be made for the protection of the
traveling public at all times when performing work under an encroachment
permit. During the progress of the work, all necessary detours, barricades,
warning signs, and flagmen will be provided by, and at the expense of, the
permittee to ensure safety.
      (5)   Restoration work shall be immediately accomplished to return the
road and/or drainage system to prior condition or better. The liability of the
permittee will not be released until all work is inspected and approved by the
Public Works Director.
   (C)   Types of encroachments within public rights-of-way and easements.
      (1)   Sprinkler systems. Water-sprinkling systems shall not be permitted
within the right-of-way except as specified herein. Sprinkler systems may be

shall be located so that they will not interfere with the proper functioning of
the drainage system. For streets where the curb and gutter section is used,
underground utility main lines shall be a minimum of 5' behind the back of the
curb. For streets where the swale ditch section is used, utility main lines
shall be installed not less than 15' from the centerline of the street and not
less than 5' from the edge of the pavement.
         (b)   The minimum allowable cover over the top of the utility
encroachment or other apparatus shall be 36". Deviations to the 36" cover
requirement must be presented in the cross-section format along with a written
justification and submitted to the Public Works Director for approval.
         (c)   No work on utility lines within the limits of the proposed
publicly maintained rights-of-way shall commence until the street plans showing
the proposed locations of the utility lines have been approved. In case any
utility location is not provided, the developer shall be responsible for
notifying the utility that installation work within the proposed publicly
maintained right-of-way or drainage easement will require the approval of the
Public Works Director.
         (d)   Unapproved utility work within the right-of-way or drainage
easement will result in an immediate supervision of inspections until such time
as the utility plans have been reviewed and approved by the Public Works
Director.
         (e)   Ditches and trenches dug within the street right-of-way for
utilities and/or other purposes shall be properly backfilled. Backfill material
shall be select material, mechanically compacted in 6" layers. Backfill
material shall be mixed or wetted as required by the Public Works Director.
Backfill under areas to be paved or areas within 5' of pavement shall be
compacted to no less than 95% of maximum density. Remaining areas shall be
compacted to 90% of maximum density. ASTM D 1557 Method A will determine
maximum densities.
         (f)   Where utilities have been designed to be placed at a depth or
location such that the repair of that utility would adversely impact the flow
of vehicular traffic, the design professional shall either address such
concerns to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director or redesign the
utility layout.
         (g)   Utilities crossing under the street shall be at an angle of not
more than 30 degrees from the perpendicular to the street.
         (h)   The jetting or uncontrolled tunneling of utility lines under a
paved street is not permitted. The cutting of the pavement is not permitted
except under extreme circumstances and only as permitted by the Public Works
Director.
         (i)   Where utilities are designed to be placed at a depth or location
such that the repair of that utility would adversely impact the flow of
vehicular traffic, the Design Professional shall either address such concerns
to the satisfaction of the Public Works Director or redesign the utility
layout.
         (j)   Proposed street lighting facilities shall be shown on the street
construction plans submitted to the Department of Public Works for approval.

at the edge of the right-of-way within a few feet of the property corner of two
adjoining lots, or located as otherwise approved by the Public Works Director.
         (l)   When dry fire hydrants are required, permanent access shall be
shown on the construction plans. Access design must provide adequate space and
suitable surface materials for emergency vehicle maneuverability. The design
professional shall submit written approval of the design from the local fire
service provider.
         (m)   The Public Works Director will only permit utilities other than
drainage facilities within drainage easements upon specific written
authorization.
   (D)   Zoning permits. The Town of James Island Zoning Administrator will
review encroachment permit applications for signs or structures within public
rights-of-way for compliance with this ordinance. No encroachment permits for
signs, other than traffic control, will be issued without the written approval
of the Zoning Administrator. Approval by the Zoning Administrator does not
ensure approval by the Public Works Director.
   (E)   Restoration of roads.
      (1)   Restoration is intended to aid proper town road maintenance. Any
entity performing work within a town right-of-way that will damage an existing
road, drainage system, or structure must ensure that the systems will be
returned to a condition equal to or better than that prior to proposed/current
construction work.
      (2)   Any utility, public agency, or other entity or person performing
work in a town right-of-way or easement must obtain an encroachment permit
prior to beginning any construction. The applicant shall furnish information on
the encroachment permit application detailing all work. Details on restoration
of all disturbed areas or utilities will also be provided on the encroachment
permit application.
      (3)   Restoration work will return the road, drainage system, and any
impacted utilities to prior condition or better. The liability of the permittee
will not be released until all work is inspected and approved by the Public
Works Director.
