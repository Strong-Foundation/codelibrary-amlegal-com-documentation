property taxes on such vehicle due and owing to the city.

Treasurer to obtain his license tag from the State Highway Department when

attempt to evade the payment of taxes due by him to the city on such motor
vehicle.

PROCUREMENT POLICY
§ 34.15 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose; policies. The underlying purposes and policies of these
procedures are to adopt for the City of Easley procurement practices that are
appropriately competitive.
   (B)   Application of procedures.
      (1)   General application. These procedures apply only to contracts
solicited or entered into after April 14, 2008.
      (2)   Purchases under $5,000. These procedures do not apply to any
procurement under $5,000 where funds for such purchases are included within the
budget approved by City Council.
      (3)   Real property. These procedures do not apply to real property.
   (C)   Definitions. For purposes of this subchapter, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      DESIGN-BUILD SERVICES. Approaches to construction contract management
that allow for the selection of a single firm to perform and/or manage the
complete design and construction of a project.
      DIRECTOR. The City Administrator or his or her designee.
      PROCUREMENT. Buying, purchasing, renting, leasing or otherwise acquiring
any supplies, services, equipment or construction.
      PUBLIC PROCUREMENT UNIT. Any county, city, town, and any other
subdivisions of the State or public agency of any such subdivision, public
authority, educational, health, or other institution, and any other entity
which expends public funds for procurement of property, supplies, services, or
construction.
      RESPONSIBLE/RESPONSIVE BIDDER. A person or entity who or which:
         (a)   Has the capability in all respects to perform fully the contract
requirements, and has the integrity and reliability which, as substantiated by
past performance and reputation, will assure good faith quality performance,
and
         (b)   Has submitted a bid or proposal which conforms in all material
aspects to the invitation for bids or request for proposals.
   (D)   Purchasing authority. The Director shall have authority to make all

are being used it is required to have an independent cost analysis prior to
beginning the procurement process. The independent cost analysis performed will
vary based on the type of project, but should be maintained with all grant
documents.
   (G)   Women and minority owned businesses. The city recognizes the value of
diversity in our community and is, therefore, committed to actively developing
supplier diversity by supporting Minority Business Enterprises (MBE) and Women

services.
(Ord. 2008-10, passed 4-14-08; Am. Ord. 2016-13, passed 11-14-16)
§ 34.16 SOURCE SELECTION; CONTRACT FORMATION.
   (A)   Methods of source selection. Except where noted herein, all city
contracts shall be awarded by one of the following methods:
      (1)   Invitation for bids (see division (B) below);
      (2)   Request for proposals (see division (C) below);
      (3)   Emergency procurement (see division (D) below);
      (4)   Small purchases (see division (E) below);
      (5)   Sole source (see division (F) below).
   (B)   Invitation for bids.
      (1)   Notice of invitation for bids. An invitation for bids shall include
(or state where such information is to be made available) a project
description, and all contractual terms and conditions applicable to the
procurement. The invitation for bids shall be publicly announced.
      (2)   Receipt and opening of bids. All bids (whether or not sealed )
received prior to the bid opening shall be kept secure and unopened. Bids shall
be opened publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and
place designated in the invitation for bids. The amount of each bid, and such
other relevant information as may be deemed appropriate by the Director,
together with the name of each bidder, shall be tabulated by the Director. The
ranking of each bidder shall be made available to all bidders after contract
award.
      (3)   Bid acceptance and bid evaluation. Subject to the city’s right not
to accept any bid, the selected bid shall be accepted unconditionally without
alteration or correction, except as otherwise authorized in these procedures or
by the Director. The invitation for bids shall set forth the evaluation
criteria to be used. No criteria may be used in bid evaluation that is not set
forth in the invitation for bids or addenda to such bids. Bids shall be
evaluated based on the requirements set forth in the invitation for bids and
addenda.
      (4)   Correction or withdrawal of bids; cancellation of awards.
Correction or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before bid opening,
withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids after award, or cancellation of
awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes, may be permitted within the
Director’s discretion. After bid opening no changes in bid prices or other
provisions of bids prejudicial to the interest of the city or fair competition
shall be permitted.
      (5)   Award. If an award is to be made, the contract shall be awarded by
written notice to the lowest responsible/responsive bidder. In the event two or
more bidders are tied in price while otherwise meeting all of the required
conditions, the contract shall be awarded to the local bidder. If two or more
of such bids are submitted by local bidders, the Director shall award the
contract to one of the local tie bidders by drawing lots in public. If local
bidders are not involved in the tie bids, the Director shall award the contract
to one of the outside tie bidders by drawing lots in public.
      (6)   Right of rejection and re-solicitation. The Director has the right,
prior to award of the contract, to reject any and all bids for cause, or
without cause, as it deems appropriate. The city has the right to determine not
to award the contract to any bidder or to determine to re-solicit bids based
upon modified terms and conditions.
   (C)   Request for proposals.
      (1)   Selection committee. For each project in which the request for
proposal procurement selection method is used, the Director will establish a
selection committee (the “committee”). The Director may be a member of that
committee.
      (2)   Notice of request for proposals. The request for proposals shall be
publicly announced and shall include a description of the project, enumerating
all required professional services for the project (or state where such
information is to be made available).
      (3)   Receipt and safeguarding of proposals. All proposals (whether or
not sealed) received prior to the proposal opening shall be kept secure and
unopened.
      (4)   Evaluation factors. The request for proposals shall state the
relative importance of each evaluation factor but need not require numerical
weightings for each factor. No other factors or criteria shall be used in
evaluation and there shall be adherence to any weightings (if such are used)
for each factor in the request for proposals. The contract file shall contain
the basis on which the award is made. A determination of responsibility shall
be made before award.
      (5)   Negotiation. The committee will review all submissions, may hold
interviews with those responding persons who are deemed by the committee to be
most qualified, determine the most qualified proposer, and negotiate a contract
with the most qualified proposer. In the event a satisfactory contract cannot
be negotiated with the most qualified proposer, the committee will negotiate a
contract with the next most qualified proposer, and so on, until a satisfactory
contract can be negotiated. Nothing contained herein will require the committee
to negotiate a contract with an unqualified proposer or with a proposer who
submits an unresponsive proposal.
      (6)   Right to withdraw and re-solicit. Until award, the Director has the
right to determine not to award the contract to any proposer or to determine to
re-solicit proposals based upon modified terms and conditions.
   (D)   Emergency procurement. Notwithstanding any other provision of these
procedures, the Director may make or authorize others to make emergency
procurements when there exists an immediate threat to public health, welfare,
critical economy and efficiency, or safety under emergency conditions and
provided that such emergency procurements shall be made with as much
competition as is practicable under the circumstances. A written determination
of the basis for the emergency and for the selection of the particular
contractor shall be included in the contract file. However, such written
determination shall not be deemed to be a condition precedent to an award under
this section.
   (E)   Small purchases. Any procurement not exceeding $25,000 may be made by
the Director by the solicitation of written quotations from a minimum of three
qualified sources (or, if in the Director’s judgment, there are fewer than
three qualified sources, from all qualified sources), and the award shall be
made to the lowest responsible/responsive bidder.
   (F)   Sole source. Any request by an agency or department head that a
procurement be restricted to one potential source shall be accompanied by a
letter from the using department signed by the department head stating why no
other source will be suitable or acceptable to meet the needs. A contract may
be awarded for a property, supply, service, or construction item without
competition when the Director determines in writing that there is only one
source for the required property, supply, service, or construction item or that
the proposed award to a single source is a permitted, non-competitive
procurement as established herein. After verification of a sole source vendor,
or the justification of a sole source purchase is warranted, the Director has
the authority to negotiate the price, terms, and conditions of the procurement.
Examples of a permissible, non-competitive procurement include, but are not
limited to, those situations where the Director and the department head have
deemed the compatibility of equipment, accessories, services, systems, software
or replacement parts is of paramount importance.
   (G)   Design-build services. The Director may use design-build services as
an alternative method for construction contracting administration. Except where
provided by these procedures, request for proposals must be used for the
procurement of design-build services.
   (H)   Pre-qualification of bidders.
      (1)   The Director may pre-qualify all prospective bidders or proposers.
      (2)   Notice of pre-qualification shall be publicly announced and shall
set forth the criteria (or state where such criteria are to be made available)
by which the qualifications and appropriateness of prospective bidders shall be
determined. Only those criteria set forth in the pre-qualification notice may
be considered in pre-qualifying bidders. The Director shall make all pre-
qualification decisions in the exercise of his or her reasonable discretion,
and shall make a written record of the basis for its pre-qualification
determinations. Prior to issuance of the invitation for bids or request for
proposals, all prospective bidders or proposers that were provided with pre-
qualification notice will be notified of the Director’s decisions relating to
pre-qualification.
   (I)   Bond; security.
      (1)   Bid security shall be required for all competitive sealed bidding
for construction contracts entered into pursuant to division (B) above. Bid
security shall be one or more bonds provided by one or more surety companies
meeting the criteria established by the Director. Bid security shall be in an
amount equal to at least 5% of the bid unless a higher percentage is specified
in the invitation for bids. Any bid which does not comply with the bid security
requirements shall be rejected.
      (2)   When a construction contract or other contract to improve real
property is awarded and such contract exceeds $50,000, the city shall require
the contractor to provide a performance bond and a labor and material payment
bond in the full amount of the contract.
         (a)   The bond must be secured by cash or must be issued by a surety
company licensed in the State of South Carolina with an “A” minimum rating of
performance as stated in the most current publication of “Best Key Rating
Guide, Property Liability.”
         (b)   If the contract is for less than $100,000, the city may in its
discretion permit the use of a “Bae” rated bond in lieu of an “A” rated bond if
the Director justifies that use in writing.
      (3)   Nothing in division (I)(2) above shall be construed to limit the
authority of the city to require a bond or other security in addition to the
bonds specified above.
      (4)   Bonding requirements may be temporarily waived for any emergency
procurement.
   (J)   Exempted items.
      (1)   City Council, upon recommendation of the Director, may exempt by
ordinance specific items, services, or projects from the purchasing procedures
required in this policy when Council finds that such exemption is in the
interest of the city and its citizens.
      (2)   The following services and/or procurements shall be exempt from the
provisions of this policy.
         (a)   Works of art for museum and public display.

pamphlets.

transparencies.

and other charges billed to the city by any of the foregoing service providers
where such expenses and charges are of the type usually billed to the client by
such type of service provider.
      (4)   Nothing herein shall preclude the Director from selecting any item
or services listed in division (J)(2) above pursuant to a competitive selection
process.
      (5)   Cooperative purchasing. The Director may either participate in,
sponsor, conduct, or administer a cooperative purchasing agreement for the
procurement of products, supplies or services with one or more public
procurement units in accordance with an agreement entered into between the
participants. Such cooperative procurement may include, but is not limited to,
joint or multi-party contracts between public procurement units.

      (2)   Authority to resolve protests. The Director shall have the
authority to settle and resolve a protest of an aggrieved bidder, proposer or

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 52.001 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   It is hereby determined that:
      (1)   All land disturbing activities described as development projects,
land use conversions, and their associated changes to land cover, permanently
alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, which in turn increase flooding, stream channel
erosion, and sediment transport and deposition, and decrease groundwater
recharge;
      (2)   Land disturbing activities also contribute to increased nonpoint
source pollution and degradation of receiving waters;
      (3)   The impacts of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from land
disturbing activities can adversely affect public safety, public and private
property, surface water drinking water supplies, groundwater resources,
drinking water supplies, recreation, aquatic habitats, fish and other aquatic
life, property values and other uses of lands and waters;
      (4)   These adverse impacts can be controlled and minimized through the
regulation of stormwater runoff quantity and quality from new development and
redevelopment, by the use of both structural and nonstructural best management
practices;
      (5)   Communities designated by the NPDES Phase II rule are required to
comply with a number of both state and federal laws, regulations and permits
which require designated entities to address the impacts of post-development
stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint source pollution.
   (B)   Therefore, the City of Easley has established this stormwater
management ordinance to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of land
disturbing activity and post-development stormwater runoff for the purpose of
protecting local water resources from degradation. This chapter regulates the
post-construction stormwater controls for both new and re-development projects.
   (C)   It has been determined that it is in the public interest to regulate
land disturbing activities and post-development stormwater runoff discharges in
order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
post-construction soil erosion and sedimentation, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with post-development stormwater runoff.
(Ord. 2008-06, passed 4-14-08)
§ 52.002 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to:
   (A)   Protect, maintain, and enhance the environment of the City of Easley
and the public health, safety and the general welfare of the community, by
controlling discharges of pollutants to the city’s stormwater system and to
maintain and improve the quality of the receiving waters into which the
stormwater outfalls flow, including, without limitation, lakes, rivers,
streams, ponds, wetlands, and groundwater of the city.
   (B)   Enable the City of Easley to comply with the National Pollution
Discharge Elimination System permit (NPDES) and applicable regulations, R.61-9
(122.26) for stormwater discharges.
   (C)   Allow the City of Easley to exercise the powers granted in South
Carolina Stormwater Management and Sediment Reduction Regulations 72-300, that
provides, among the other powers the City of Easley has with respect to
stormwater facilities, the power by ordinance or resolution to:
      (1)   Exercise general regulation over the planning, location,
construction, and operation and maintenance of stormwater facilities in the
city, whether or not owned and operated by the city;
      (2)   Adopt any rules and regulations deemed necessary to accomplish the
purposes of this statute, including the adoption of a system of fees for
services and permits;
      (3)   Establish standards to regulate the quantity of stormwater
discharged and to regulate stormwater contaminants as may be necessary to
protect water quality;
      (4)   Review and approve plans and plats for stormwater management in
proposed new developments and redevelopment;
      (5)   Issue permits for stormwater discharges, or for the construction,
alteration, extension, or repair of stormwater facilities;
      (6)   Suspend or revoke permits when it is determined that the permittee
has violated any applicable ordinance, resolution, or condition of the permit;
      (7)   Regulate and prohibit discharges into stormwater facilities of
sanitary, industrial, or commercial sewage or waters that have otherwise been
contaminated.

§ 52.041 GENERAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR STORMWATER MANAGEMENT.
   Unless granted a waiver or variance by the Director of Public Works, the
following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at
all sites:
   (A)   All site designs shall control the peak flow rates of stormwater
discharge associated with design storms specified in this chapter or in the
city’s LDRs or state regulations, and reduce the generation of post
construction stormwater runoff rates to pre-construction levels. These
practices should seek to utilize pervious areas for stormwater treatment and to
infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots,
and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for
both water quality and quantity. Low-impact development (LID) is encouraged.
   (B)   To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel
protection criteria as prescribed in the city’s LDRs shall be met.
   (C)   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources
(i.e., cold water fisheries, swimming beaches, recharge areas, water supply
reservoirs) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to
utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices.
   (D)   Stormwater that discharges from hotspots may require the application
of specific structural BMPs and pollution prevention practices.
   (E)   For construction projects that disturb 25 acres or more and discharge
the pollutant or pollutants of concern to a water on the South Carolina 303(d)
List of Impaired Waters, the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP)
prepared by the applicant must contain a written quantitative and qualitative
assessment showing that the BMPs selected will control the construction and
post construction stormwater discharges so that the stormwater discharges will
not cause or contribute to a violation of water quality standards. A copy of
the most current 303(d) List of Impaired Waters can be downloaded at the
following DHEC Website: www.sedhec.gov/water/html/tmdl.html.
   (F)   All site designs are required to show appropriate erosion and sediment
control BMPs accompanied by design calculations to support chosen controls.
   (G)   All site designs are required to exhibit control of waste such as
discarded building materials, concrete truck washout, chemicals, litter, and
sanitary waste at the construction site that may cause adverse impacts to water
quality.
(Ord. 2008-06, passed 4-14-08) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.042 MINIMUM CONTROL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Stormwater designs shall meet the multi-stage storm frequency storage
requirements as identified in the city’s LDRs.
   (B)   If hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than
that provided by the minimum control requirements, the city’s Stormwater
Management Division (SWMD) may impose any and all additional requirements
deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff.
   (C)   A 25-foot undisturbed no-build buffer zone is required to be left from
top of bank on both sides for the entire length of streams that the City of
Easley SWMD determines to be a perennial or intermittent stream. This is
required for areas of new development and redevelopment. BUFFER means a
vegetated area, including trees and shrubs which exists or is established to
protect a stream system, lake or reservoir area. This buffer also applies to
other sensitive areas such as springs, wetlands, and sinkholes.
   (D)   Stream destruction or relocation is prohibited.
   (E)   Sediment and erosion control measures shall be designed to control the
rainfall and runoff from a two-year, 24-hour storm, as a minimum.
   (F)   Stabilization measures must be performed as soon as practicable in
portions of the site where construction activities have temporarily or
permanently ceased, but in no case more than 14 days after work has ceased.
Where construction activity on a portion of the site is temporarily ceased, and
earth-disturbing activities will be resumed within 14 days, temporary
stabilization measures do not have to be initiated on that portion of the site.
   (G)   Litter, construction debris, oils, fuels, sanitary waste, and building
products with significant potential for impact (such as stockpiles of freshly
treated lumber) and construction chemicals that could be exposed to stormwater
must be prevented from becoming a pollutant source in stormwater discharges by
use of proper site design controls.
   (H)   For common drainage locations that serve an area with ten or more
acres disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment basin that
provides storage for a calculated volume of runoff from the drainage are from
at least a ten-year, 24-hour storm, or equivalent control measures, must be
provided where attainable until final stabilization of the site. Where no such
calculation has been performed, a temporary (or permanent) sediment basin
providing at least 3,600 cubic feet of storage per acre drained, or equivalent
control measure, must be provided where attainable until final stabilization of
the site. (Refer to NPDES General Permit for Storm Water Discharges From Large
and Small Construction Activities, SCR100000 for more information pertaining to

§ 52.060 RECHARGE.
   (A)   Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained, by promoting
infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods. At a
minimum, annual recharge from the post-development site shall mimic the annual
recharge from pre-development site conditions.
   (B)   The stormwater runoff volume to be recharged to groundwater should be
determined using the methods prescribed in the latest version of the City of
Easley’s Land Development Regulations and or the SCDHEC Storm Water BMP
Handbook. The recharge requirements shall apply to all activities within the
jurisdiction of this chapter except as noted, and unless specifically waived by
the SWMD or the City of Easley’s Director of Public Works. The recharge
criterion is not required for any portion of a site designated as a stormwater
hotspot (see §

52.999
§ 52.061 STRUCTURAL PRACTICES FOR WATER QUALITY.
   (A)   Presumed compliance with SCDHEC water quality standards. All
structural stormwater management facilities shall be selected and designed
using the appropriate criteria from the most recent version of the City of
Easley’s Land Development Regulations and or the SCDHEC BMP Manual. For other
structural stormwater controls not included in these manuals, or for which
pollutant removal rates have not been provided, the effectiveness and pollutant
removal of the structural control must be documented through prior studies,
literature reviews, or other means and receive approval from the SWMD before
being included in the design of a stormwater management system. Structural best
management practices (BMPs) must be designed to remove 80% of the average
annual post development total suspended solids (TSS). It is presumed that a BMP
complies with this performance goal if it is:
      (1)   Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume;
      (2)   Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in
the City of Easley’s Land Development Regulations and or the SCDHEC BMP Manual;
      (3)   Constructed properly; and
      (4)   Maintained regularly.
   (B)   Pollutant loading calculation assessment.
      (1)   For subdivisions of 30 lots or more, any commercial project with a
building 10,000 square feet or more, or any project in an area designated by
the SWMD as a sensitive/critical area, a pollutant loading calculation shall be
conducted to document compliance with water quality standards by calculating
pre-development loads, calculating uncontrolled post-development loads and then
applying a prescribed pollutant removal efficiency to selected practices to
arrive at a net pollutant load delivery. The post-developed load must be equal
to or less than the pre-developed load.
      (2)   The methodology for this calculation shall be in accordance with
method provided in Appendix A of Ord. 2008-06, a copy of which is available for
public inspection during normal business hours in the office of the City Clerk.
(See Appendix A for an example methodology for calculating pollutant load and
assessing compliance.)

§ 52.062 WATER QUALITY VOLUME.
   The prescribed water quality volume required in the sizing of a structural
stormwater practice shall be [calculated as 1.2 x total watershed area x runoff
coefficient (Rv), where Rv = 0.05 + 0.009 (I%) and I% = percent of impervious
area] (default option - optimal) or [0.50 inches x the total impervious area of
the drainage area and 1.0 inches x the total impervious area of the drainage
area in critical areas.
(Ord. 2008-06, passed 4-14-08) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.063 HYDROLOGIC BASIS FOR DESIGN OF STRUCTURAL PRACTICES.
   For facility sizing criteria, the basis for hydrologic and hydraulic
evaluation of development sites are as follows:
   (A)   Impervious cover is measured from the site plan and includes any
material or structure on or above the ground that prevents water from
infiltrating through the underlying soil. IMPERVIOUS SURFACE is defined to
include, without limitation: paved parking lots, sidewalks, roof tops,
driveways, patios, and paved, compacted gravel and compacted dirt surfaced
roads.
   (B)   Off-site areas shall be assessed based on their “pre-developed
condition” for computing the water quality volume (i.e, treatment of only on-
site areas is required). However, if an offsite area drains to a proposed BMP,
flow from that area must be accounted for in the sizing of a specific practice.
   (C)   Off-site areas draining to a proposed facility should be modeled as
“present condition” for peak-flow attenuation requirements.
   (D)   The length of sheet flow used in time of concentration calculations is
limited to no more than 50 feet for predevelopment conditions and 50 feet for
post development conditions.
   (E)   Detention time for the one-year storm is defined as the center of mass
of the inflow hydrograph and the center of mass of the outflow hydrograph.
   (F)   The models TR-55 and TR-20 (or approved equivalent) will be used for
determining peak discharge rates.
   (G)   The standard for characterizing pre-development land use for on-site
areas shall be woods.
   (H)   For purposes of computing runoff, all pervious lands in the site shall
be assumed prior to development to be in good condition regardless of
conditions existing at the time of computation.
   (I)   If an off-site area drains to a facility, off-site areas should be
modeled, assuming an “ultimate buildout condition” upstream.
   (J)   Determination of flooding and channel erosion impacts to receiving
streams due to land development projects shall be measured at each point of
discharge from the development project and such determination shall include any
runoff from the balance of the watershed which also contributes to that point
of discharge.
   (K)   The specified design storms shall be defined as a 24-hour storm using
the latest published rainfall distribution for Pickens County by National
Oceanic and Atmosphere Administration (NOAA) on their website; http://
hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/hdsc/pfds/orb/sc_pfds.html.
   (L)   Proposed residential, commercial, or industrial subdivisions shall
apply these stormwater management criteria to the land development as a whole.
Individual lots in new subdivisions shall not be considered separate land
development projects, but rather the entire subdivision shall be considered a
single land development project. Hydrologic parameters shall reflect the
ultimate land development and shall be used in all engineering calculations.
   (M)   Detention must be addressed whenever there is an increase in
stormwater runoff resulting from the proposed development. This can be achieved
by appropriate detention facilities including wet or dry bottom reservoirs,
flat or green roofs, parking lots, underground storage, and appropriate LID
techniques such as rain gardens. The following shall govern the design of
detention facilities:
      (1)   Storm volume. The volume of storage potential provided in detention
facilities shall be sufficient to control the excess stormwater runoff, as
determined to be the difference between the stormwater quantity from the site
in its developed state for a ten-year, 24-hour frequency rainfall less the ten-
year runoff quantity from the site prior to development.
      (2)   Release velocity. Detention facilities shall release stormwater at
a nonerosive velocity. Protected channels receiving detention discharge shall
incorporate features to reduce velocity to nonerosive levels at the point where
such discharge enters the unprotected channel. If release is into a subsurface
conduit the energy gradient in the receiving facility shall not be increased
beyond the slope of the conduit.
      (3)   Spillway. Emergency spillways shall be provided to permit the safe
passage of runoff generated from a 100-year, 24-hour storm.
      (4)   Freeboard. Detention facilities shall have adequate capacity to
contain the storage volume of tributary stormwater runoff with at least one
foot of freeboard above the water surface of flow in the emergency spillway in
a 100-year storm event.
      (5)   Fencing. Ground reservoir detention facilities with a depth greater
than 24 inches shall be enclosed within a permanent six-foot high fence. Wet
ponds do not have to be fenced when they are also used for an aesthetic reason.
All detention facilities shall be landscaped on the outside of the fence or
reservoir by a screen of the owner’s choosing, including berms, trees,
shrubbery, and the like.

§ 52.064 SENSITIVE AREAS.
   Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e.,
aquifer recharge areas, water supply reservoirs, wetlands, buffer areas) may be
subject to additional criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain
stormwater management practices at the discretion of the SWMD. The SWMD may
designate sensitive areas and specific criteria for these areas after
conducting a public hearing in accordance with the provisions of §
52.004.
(Ord. 2008-06, passed 4-14-08)
§ 52.065 HOTSPOTS.
   Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential
pollutant loadings, known as “hotspots,” as defined in §
52.003, require the use of specific stormwater management BMPs as specified in
the most recent version of the Land Development Regulations and SCDHEC BMP
Manual. The use of infiltration practices without pretreatment is prohibited.
(Ord. 2008-06, passed 4-14-08) Penalty, see §
52.999
§ 52.066 STORMWATER CREDITS.
   The use of better site design and nonstructural stormwater management
measures is encouraged to minimize reliance on structural stormwater management
measures. The use of one or more site design measures by the applicant may
allow for a reduction in the water quality treatment volume required and the
stream channel protection volume required. The applicant may, if approved by
the SWMD, take credit for the use of stormwater better site design practices to
reduce some of the requirements specified in the criteria section of these
regulations. The site design practices that qualify for these credits and
procedures for applying and calculating the credits are identified in Appendix
B of Ord. 2008-06, a copy of which is available for public inspection during
normal business hours in the office of the City Clerk.

§ 52.068 EASEMENTS.
   Stormwater management facilities located outside of existing or proposed
right-of-ways shall be located within and accessible by easement as follows:
   (A)   Where a tract is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway, channel or
stream, there shall be provided a drainage easement paralleling the line of
such watercourse, drainageway, channel or stream. The width of the drainage
easement will be adequate to preserve the unimpeded flow of natural drainage of
the 100-year frequency storm event.
   (B)   Drainage easements shall provide for occasional maintenance and for
the purpose of widening, deepening, improving or protecting such drainage
facilities.
   (C)   Easements shall stipulate that no trees, shrubs, structures,
excavation, or fill be placed, and no regarding be performed within the area of
the easement without written approval from the City of Easley, upon review by
the SWMD and/or City Engineer. Such landscaping may be placed in maintenance
easement, provided it does not impede access.
   (D)   Whenever practicable, easements shall be parallel with and conjunctive
to property lines of the subdivision.
   (E)   All easement agreements shall be recorded with a reference to the
recorded easement indicated on the site plan. The format and content of the
easement agreement shall be reviewed and approved by the Public Works Director,
SWMD personnel, and/or the City Engineer prior to the issuance of a certificate
of occupancy.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 53.01 FINDINGS.
   It is hereby determined that:
   (A)   Discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system that are not
composed entirely of stormwater runoff contribute to an increase in nonpoint
source pollution and result in degradation of receiving bodies of water waters.
   (B)   These non-stormwater discharges occur due to spills, dumping, and
improper connections to the municipal separate storm sewer system from
residential, industrial, commercial or institutional establishments.
   (C)   These non-stormwater discharges not only impact waterways
individually, but geographically dispersed, small volume, non-stormwater
discharges can have cumulative impacts on receiving bodies of water waters.
   (D)   The impacts of these discharges adversely affect public health and
safety, drinking water supplies, recreation, aquatic life, property values, and
other uses of lands and waters.
   (E)   These impacts can be minimized through the regulation of spills,
dumping and discharges into the municipal separate storm sewer system.
   (F)   Localities in the State of South Carolina are required to comply with
a number of state and federal laws, regulations and permits, which require a
locality to address the impacts of stormwater runoff quality and nonpoint
source pollution due to improper non-stormwater discharges to the municipal
separate storm sewer system.
   (G)   (1)   Therefore, the city adopts this chapter to prohibit such non-
stormwater discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system.
      (2)   It is determined that the regulation of spills, improper dumping
and discharges to the municipal separate storm sewer system is in the public
interest, and will prevent threats to public health and safety, and the
environment.

§ 53.02 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety,
environment and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the
regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the city’s separate storm sewer
system, to the maximum extent practicable as required by federal law.
   (B)   In order to comply with requirements of the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit process, this chapter establishes
methods for controlling the introduction of pollutants into the municipal
separate storm sewer system (MS4).
   (C)   The objectives of this chapter are to:
      (1)   Regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate
storm sewer system by any person;
      (2)   Prohibit illicit discharges and illegal connections to the
municipal separate storm sewer system;
      (3)   Prevent non-stormwater discharges, generated as a result of spills,
inappropriate dumping or disposal, to the municipal separate storm sewer
system;
      (4)   To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection,
monitoring and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure compliance with this
chapter; and
      (5)   To ensure the proper installation, operation and maintenance of
construction site Best Management Practices (BMPs) for silt, water quantity,
and water quality control.

('90 Code, § 16.1-4) (Ord. passed 9-12-77)
SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES AND PLACES OF EMPLOYMENT
§ 94.30 FINDINGS; DETERMINATIONS.
   The City Council of the City of Easley, South Carolina, hereby finds and
determines:
   (A)   The City of Easley, South Carolina (the “city”), is an incorporated
municipality located in Pickens County, South Carolina, and as such possesses
all powers granted to municipalities by the Constitution and the laws of the
State of South Carolina, including the powers enumerated in S.C. Code § 5-7-30
(2005 Supp) relating to regulating streets, markets, and public health.
   (B)   Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor
to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as
environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers,
including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer. The
National Cancer Institute has determined that secondhand smoke is responsible
for the early deaths of up to 65,000 Americans annually. (National Cancer
Institute (NCI) “Health effects of exposure to environmental tobacco smoke: the
report of the California Environmental Protection Agency, Smoking and Tobacco
Control Monograph 10,” Bethesda, MD: National Institutes of Health, National
Cancer Institute (NCI), August 1999). The Surgeon General has declared that:
      (1)   Secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in nonsmokers
exposed to smoke;
      (2)   Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for
sudden death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more
severe asthma;
      (3)   Adults exposed to secondary smoke have a higher risk of coronary
heart disease and lung cancer;
      (4)   There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and
      (5)   Separating smoking and nonsmoking sections of indoor areas does not
sufficiently remove the threats of secondhand smoke in enclosed areas.
   (C)   A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the
workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25-50% risk
of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular disease and
cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and measurable decrease
in lung function. (Pitsavos, C.; Panagiotakos, D.B.; Chrysohoou, C.; Skoumas,
J.; Tzioumis, K.; Stefanadis, C.; Toutouzas, P., “Association between exposure
to environmental tobacco smoke and the development of acute coronary syndromes:
the CARDIO2000 case-control study,” Tobacco Control 11 (3): 220-225, September
2002.)
   (D)   Smoke-filled workplaces result in higher worker absenteeism due to
respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher cleaning and maintenance costs,
increased health insurance rates, and increased liability claims for diseases
related to exposure to secondhand smoke. (“The high price of cigarette
smoking,” Business & Health 15(8), Supplement A: 6-9, August 1997.)
   (E)   Certain outdoor events, such as parades, festivals, and other public
gatherings, result in nonsmokers finding themselves in close proximity to
persons who are smoking which can be reasonably seen to have the same effects
of exposure as when nonsmokers are exposed to smoke in the same enclosed space.
Lighted cigarettes, cigars, and pipes of people standing or sitting in close
proximity have the potential of burning those with whom they inadvertently come
into direct contact and making the air quality and peaceful enjoyment of
outdoor events unreasonably restricted for nonsmokers.
   (F)   When there is a presence of secondhand smoke in enclosed spaces or in
outside areas where there is a public gathering resulting in people being in
close proximity in places that are otherwise open to the public at large
inevitably results in person who do not smoke being forced to bear unwarranted
health risks and inappropriate deprivation of peaceful enjoyment of the
premises to which they have been invited or permitted to enter, even when steps
have been taken to separate “smoking” and “nonsmoking” areas within the
confined space.
   (G)   The city recognizes that smoke creates a danger to the health and
safety of the public at large and that, in order to protect the health and
welfare of the public, it is necessary to restrict smoking in the manner
provided for in this subchapter.

CHAPTER 99: CONTROLLED ACCESS TO CITY PROPERTY
Section
   
99.01   Control of access to city-owned, controlled and leased property
§ 99.01 CONTROL OF ACCESS TO CITY-OWNED, CONTROLLED AND LEASED PROPERTY.
   (A)   Consistent with decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court, public access to
areas within enclosed facilities owned, controlled and leased by the City of
Easley may be restricted depending upon whether such areas are classified as
“designated public forum”, “limited designated public forum”, or “nonpublic
forum”. How areas within enclosed facilities owned, controlled, and leased by
the city are classified is based upon their intended use. For example, there
are certain areas which are intended primarily for the use of city employees in
the conduct of their business; there are certain areas which while primarily
intended for the use of city employees in the conduct of their business, may
from time to time be utilized for the convening of public meetings; there are
certain limited areas which may be open to the public while engaging in
legitimate business with city officers or employees; and there may be certain
areas which are primarily intended for the convening of public meetings.
   (B)   The Mayor is hereby authorized to manage public access to enclosed
city owned, controlled, and leased property. In the performance of such
responsibilities, the Mayor shall have the authority to identify which areas
are to be considered designated public forum, limited designated public forum,
or nonpublic forum.
   (C)   Upon the classification of areas within enclosed city-owned,
controlled and leased property, the Mayor is hereby authorized, subject to the
availability of appropriated funds, to employ whatever means he/she deems
necessary and appropriate to separate designated public forums from nonpublic
forums, including, but not limited to the use of physical barriers and signage.
The Mayor shall also have the authority to develop and implement procedures to
regulate and control public access within city-owned, controlled, and leased
property to provide for the security and privacy of public visitors; to provide
for the security and privacy of city employees and officers; and to minimize
potential disruptions to the work of city government. Any person who engages in
conduct that causes disruptions to the work of city government shall be deemed
to no longer be present within the city-owned, controlled, or leased property
on legitimate public business.
   (D)   The City Council Chambers and conference rooms in the City Hall and
City Hall Annex are hereby declared to be nonpublic forums unless or until a
public meeting is convened in such areas pursuant to public notice. All city
employee work areas within City Hall and the City Hall Annex which are
designated by appropriate signage as work areas shall be considered as
nonpublic forums. Members of the public are prohibited from entering city
employee work areas without being escorted by a city employee. All other areas
of the City Hall and City Hall Annex are hereby designated as limited public
forums and only persons who are present to engage in legitimate public business
with city officers or employees shall be authorized. It shall be a violation of
this section to be within a nonpublic forum or a limited public forum without
authorization, Unauthorized persons found by the Mayor or his designee to be
within a nonpublic forum or a limited public forum and who refuse to leave the
premises upon request, shall be considered a trespasser. Law enforcement, at
its option, at the request of the city may issue a trespass warning notice for
this conduct.
   (E)   Except within the City Council Chambers, conference rooms, and other
locations in which a public meeting is being conducted pursuant to a public
notice, it shall be unlawful and a violation of this section, to record video
and/or sound within city-owned, controlled, and leased property, without the
consent of all persons whose voice or image is being recorded. This prohibition
shall not apply to any law enforcement activities. In addition to being a
violation of this section, if anyone who is observed to be recording video and/
or sound within city-owned, controlled, or leased property, without the consent
of all persons whose voice or image is being recorded, and such person refuses
to cease activity after being advised that such activity is prohibited under
this section, such refusal shall be considered to be a disruption to the work
of city government. Therefore, such persons shall be deemed to no longer be
present within the city-owned, controlled, or leased property on legitimate
public business. The Mayor and his designees are hereby authorized on behalf of
the city to request any person who refuses to cease the unconsented video and/
or sound recording to immediately leave the premises. Any person who refuses to
cease to video and/or sound recording of the unconsenting person, and refuses
to immediately leave the premises following the request of the Mayor or his
designee, shall be considered as a trespasser. Law enforcement, at its option
at the request of the city may issue a trespass warning notice for this
conduct.
   (F)   (1)   The Mayor and his designees may have cause to remove any person
they determine:
         (a)   Acts in any manner which violates or is reasonably suspected to
violate any federal, state, or local law, ordinance, rule, or regulation; or
         (b)   Acts in any manner which violates any city rules or policy,
including but not limited to the facility rules; or any directive on any sign
or notice at the public property.
      (2)   The Mayor and his designees are hereby authorized on behalf of the
city to warn persons of this prohibited activity and request such activity to
cease. Law enforcement at its option, at the request of the city may issue a
trespass warning notice for these violations of conduct.
   (G)   The Mayor and his designees are hereby authorized on behalf of the
city to warn persons who have entered into or remain in areas where they are
not authorized to be, and to request such persons to depart. The Mayor and his
designees, are hereby authorized to call upon law enforcement to treat as
trespassers any persons who refuse to depart after such a request has been
made. Law enforcement, at its option, may enforce and charge any person's
refusal to depart by means of Section 16-11620 of the S.C. Code of Laws, 1976,
as amended, or issue a trespass warning notice.

      (3)   To develop the incentive areas into a "downtown" that provides the
city with a "sense of place."
   INCENTIVE. A grant of any inducement having monetary value by the city that
is offered to a person, firm, or corporation to pursue a development that
encourages private investment and/or the creation/retention of jobs. The
incentive may also include grants from other entities that the city may be able

(Ord. 2018-10, passed 7-9-18)
§ 122.04 AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   Authorization to grant incentives. The Council, at its discretion and
on a case-by-case basis, but subject to the general eligibility criteria
provided for in §
122.06 herein, may enter into an incentive agreement (as defined in §

to encourage and support the development of real property within the incentive
area.
   (B)   Incentive agreements.

         (a)   The particulars of the development;
         (b)   The incentives to be provided; and

any period of time within the thresholds provided for herein or within the time
periods and thresholds provided for in any applicable statutory authorization.
(Ord. 2018-10, passed 7-9-18)
§ 122.05 AUTHORIZED INCENTIVES.
   (A)   Multiple incentives. The Council may provide to an incentive recipient
any combination of incentives provided for herein; provided, however, that the
total amount of incentives given to a development must be in keeping with the
goals, and the value of the benefits accruing to the city (and its citizens)
must be greater than the financial value of the incentives to an incentive
recipient.
   (B)   Incentives of the city. All direct incentives of the city shall be
granted in the form of reimbursements and refunds of fees and taxes that have
been duly paid to the city. No up-front abatements of fees or taxes shall be
permitted. Where incentives continue for a period of more than one year, such
incentives may be graduated to increase or decrease year-to-year as the Council
sees fit, but subject to monitoring by the city to ensure compliance with the
terms of any incentive agreement. The Council may, at its discretion and on a
case-by-case basis, enter into an incentive agreement to reimburse or give a
refund to any person, firm or corporation the following fees and taxes up to

agreement;
      (5)   Such other incentives that the Council, at its discretion on a
case-by-case basis, determines are appropriate given the amount or type of
investment made by the incentive recipient in the investment area.
   (C)   State incentive programs. The state programs that may be considered by
Council to be included within any package of incentives or as a stand-alone set
of incentives for in-city projects located outside of the development area,
include the following:
      (1)   Property tax credits authorized by the provisions of the South
Carolina Abandoned Buildings Revitalization Act, codified at S.C. Code §§ 12-

shall submit an Abandoned Building Act Application in a form to be provided by

(Ord. 2018-10, passed 7-9-18)
§ 122 .06 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA.
   (A)   Incentive area eligibility criteria. Except for those incentives
discussed in §
122.05(C) above as authorized by the state and which are intended by the terms
of this chapter to be applied city-wide, in order for a development to be
eligible to receive incentives, the Council must determine that the development
meets, or upon completion will meet, each of the following criteria:
      (1)   The development is consistent with the City of Easley Comprehensive
Plan (as may be amended) and the City of Easley Strategic Plan (as may be
amended) (together, the " Plans") as well as the goals.
      (2)   Absent the provision of incentives, the development would be
unlikely to occur or unlikely to occur at the level or scale contemplated by
the developer.
      (3)   The development must be located within the incentive area, as
defined in §
122.03.
      (4)   (a)   The development must have a minimum threshold investment of
$500,000 (as applicable to the incentive area, the "minimum investment"). The
minimum investment may be comprised of any combination of:
            1.   Real property acquisition costs;
            2.   The costs of physical improvements to real property; or
            3.   The costs of capital improvements to city infrastructure.
         (b)   The minimum investment may be calculated based upon investment
in a single property or the cumulative investment in multiple properties, each
within the incentive area. Where multiple uses or businesses are to be located
within a single development as separate businesses, the Council may, at its
discretion on a case-by-case basis, allocate appropriate portions of the total
investment in the development to such separate business in order to allow such
business to meet the minimum investment eligibility requirement. In order to
meet the threshold for the minimum investment, a development may be given a
credit towards the minimum investment of $50,000 for each job (as defined on §
122.03) that will be created by the development.
      (5)   The intended use of the development must be for one or more of the
following business purposes:
         (a)   Retail uses;
         (b)   Tourism-related business or activities;
         (c)   Cultural arts activities and associated businesses
         (d)   Corporate headquarters;
         (e)   Research and development;
         (f)   High technology growth businesses;
         (g)   Full service restaurants; and
         (h)   Other uses, as may be determined by the Council, that are
consistent with the goals, and the Plans.
   (B)   Specific criteria. The Council may, at its discretion and on a case-
by-case basis, include within incentive agreement any other eligibility
criteria that must be met upon completion of a development in order to ensure
that the goals are met, and that the development provides benefits to the city
(and its citizens) in amounts that warrant the implementation of incentives.
(Ord. 2018-10, passed 7-9-18)
§ 122.07 ADMINISTRATION AND TERMS OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   Application for incentives. Except where an applicant seeks only
incentives authorized by the state incentive programs listed in §
122.05(C), in order to be eligible for incentives, a person, firm or
corporation must submit to the City Administrator a proposed set of incentives
for a development (a "proposal"), in a form provided by the city. The proposal
must include a sufficient description of the development, to include, without
limitation, the following information:
      (1)   Identification of the property or properties on which the
development is to be located and any acquisition costs thereof;
      (2)   The estimated start date and completion date for any work to be
performed with respect to the development;
      (3)   A list of any physical improvements that are to be made with
respect to the development, including a good-faith estimate of the costs
thereof;
      (4)   The then-current value of the property on which the development is
to be located and a good-faith estimate of the value of the property upon
completion of the improvements thereto;
      (5)   A good-faith estimate of the number of jobs that the development is
projected to create, including an estimate of the date upon which the estimated
number of jobs will have been created;
      (6)   A statement affirming that, based upon any acquisition costs for
the property on which the development is to be located, along with good-faith
estimates for the costs of physical improvements and the number of jobs
created, the development will meet or exceed the minimum investment;
      (7)   A good-faith estimate of other revenue for the city that will be
created as a direct result of the development, including anticipated business
license fees, additional property tax revenue, capital improvements to city-
owned infrastructure and utilities revenue; and
      (8)   Any other additional information that the incentive recipient or
the City Administrator deems may be necessary and, helpful for the Council to
evaluate and give due consideration to the proposal.
   (B)   Determination of incentive amounts. The amount of incentives granted
to a development shall be based upon the amount of the capital investment in
the development, the amount of new revenue for the city directly created by the
development and the number of new jobs that will be directly created by the
development. The amount of incentives granted to a development shall in no case
exceed the value of the direct and indirect benefits of the development to the
city. These amounts shall be expressly included within any incentive agreement.
   (C)   Certification, commencement and continuation of incentives.

GENERAL STANDARDS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code of Laws,
Title 5 and Title 6, and amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to
local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Mayor and
City Council of Easley, South Carolina does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The special flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic
inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health,
minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that
uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the
floodplain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are
restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of
natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are
involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling, grading,
dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion.
Additionally, the chapter prevents or regulates the construction of flood
barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood
hazards to other lands.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health,
to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight
areas, and to insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a flood area. The provisions of the chapter are intended to minimize damage
to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric,
telephone, and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in the floodplain, and
prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important floodplain management
objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly
flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding.
   (C)   Floodplains are an important asset to the community. They perform
vital natural functions such as temporary storage of floodwaters, moderation of
peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality, groundwater recharge,
prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural wildlife populations,
recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality. These functions are best
served if floodplains are kept in their natural state. Wherever possible, the
natural characteristics of floodplains and their associated wetlands and water
bodies should be preserved and enhanced. Decisions to alter floodplains,
especially floodways and stream channels, should be the result of careful
planning processes that evaluate resource conditions and human needs.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.04 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   (A)   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the city as identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study, dated December 21, 2017 with
accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
   (B)   Upon annexation any special flood hazard areas identified by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its Flood Insurance Study for the
unincorporated areas of Pickens County, with accompanying map and other data
are adopted by reference and declared part of this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15; Am. Ord. 2021-03, passed 4-12-21)
§ 152.05 ESTABLISHMENT OF DEVELOPMENT PERMIT.
   A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of
this chapter prior to the commencement of any development activities.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.06 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted, or
structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and
other applicable regulations.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.07 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter all provisions shall
be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the
governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions, shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.08 PARTIAL INVALIDITY AND SEVERABILITY.
   If any part of this chapter is declared invalid, the remainder of the
chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in force.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of the city or by any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.10 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE). Structures that are located on
the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is
incidental to the use of the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should

   CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT. Development that is critical to the community's public
health and safety, is essential to the orderly functioning of a community,
store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials, or house
occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or injury.
Examples of CRITICAL DEVELOPMENT include jails, hospitals, schools, fire
stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, water plants, and
gas/oil/propane storage facilities.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging,
filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of

(including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of
streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is
completed before June 14, 1982.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete slabs).
   FLOOD. A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters, or the
unusual and rapid accumulation of runoff of surface waters from any source.

areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
   FREEBOARD. A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a flood level
for purposes of flood plain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of
the watershed.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term
includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the
loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair

Interior; or
         (b)   Directly by the Secretary of Interior in states without approved
programs.
Some structures or districts listed on the state or local inventories MAY NOT
be HISTORIC as cited above, but have been included on the inventories because
it was believed that the structures or districts have the potentiator meeting
the HISTORIC STRUCTURE criteria of the DOI. In order for these structures to
meet NFIP historic structure criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced
that the South Carolina Department of Archives and History has individually
determined that the structure or district meets DOI historic structure
criteria.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). Applies to all new and renewed flood
insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable
the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and
control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the
payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with state or community
floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a
building has been declared substantially or repetitively damaged.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items that can withstand exposure to the elements and have low flood
damage potential. Such an area must be of flood-resistant or breakaway
material, void of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be
temperature controlled. If the area is located below the base flood elevation
in an A, AE and A1 -A30 zone it must meet the requirements of §
152.30(D). If the area is located below the base flood elevation in a V, VE and
V1 - V30 zone it must meet the requirements of this chapter.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE (LAG). An elevation of the lowest ground surface that
touches any deck support, exterior walls of a building or proposed building
walls.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided, that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. MANUFACTURED
HOME does not include a RECREATIONAL VEHICLE.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. The Nations Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North

   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Structure for which the start of construction commenced on
or after June 14, 1982. The term also includes any subsequent improvements to
such structure.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete slabs) is completed on or after June
14,1982.
   PRIMARY FRONTAL DUNE. A continuous or nearly continuous mound or ridge of
sand with relatively steep seaward and landward slopes immediately landward and
subject to erosion and overtopping from high tides and waves during coastal
storms. The inland limit of the primary frontal dune occurs at the point where
there is a distinct change from a relatively steep slope to a relatively mild
slope.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;

the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.
   SECTION 1316 OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968. The Act provides
that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local
authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances.
   STABLE NATURAL VEGETATION. The first place on the oceanfront where plants
such as sea oats hold sand in place.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. 97-348), includes
substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of
slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for footings, piers or
foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds
not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the
building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted
cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equais or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred repetitive loss
or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
      (2)   Permits shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the
improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated
with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be
utilized to determine whether substantial improvement will occur.
   SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. Where
the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets,
utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the streets, utilities
and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement commenced.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from a term or terms of this chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

values served by floodplains. Proposed developments must go through an eight-
step review process. Evidence of compliance with the executive order must be
submitted as part of the permit review process.
   (Q)   Substantial damage determination. Perform an assessment of damage from
any origin to the structure using FEMA's Residential Substantial Damage
Estimator (RSDE) software to determine if the damage equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   (R)   Substantial improvement determinations.
      (1)   Perform an assessment of permit applications for improvements or
repairs to be made to a building or structure that equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction. Cost of work
counted for determining if and when substantial improvement to a structure
occurs shall be cumulative for a period of five years. If the improvement
project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated with each
phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be utilized to
determine whether substantial improvement will occur.
      (2)   The market values shall be determined by one of the following
methods:
         (a)   The current assessed building value as determined by the
county's assessor's office or the value of an appraisal performed by a licensed

progresses, the Local Floodplain Administrator shall make as many inspections
of the work as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according
to the provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In
exercising this power, the Floodplain Administrator has a right, upon
presentation of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the
territorial jurisdiction at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection
or other enforcement action.
   (B)   Stop-work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being
constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this chapter,
the Floodplain Administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The
stop-work order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work.
The stop-work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific
reasons for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be
resumed. Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor.
   (C)   Revocation of permits. The Local Floodplain Administrator may revoke
and require the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder
in writing, stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for
any substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or
specifications; for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state
or local laws; or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing
the permit. Any permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or
local law may also be revoked.
   (D)   Periodic inspections. The Local Floodplain Administrator and each
member of his/her Inspections Department shall have a right, upon presentation
of proper credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial
jurisdiction of the Department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of

      (2)   A hearing will be held before the Local Floodplain Administrator at
a designated place and time, not later than ten days after the date of the
notice, at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by
counsel and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
      (3)   Following the hearing, the Local Floodplain Administrator may issue
such order to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as
appears appropriate.
   (G)   Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the Floodplain Administrator shall find that the
building or development is in violation of this chapter, he/she shall make an
order in writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation
within such period, not less than 60 days, the Floodplain Administrator may
prescribe; provided that where the Floodplain Administrator finds that there is
imminent danger to life or other property, he may order that corrective action
be taken in such lesser period as may be feasible.
   (H)   Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice
of appeal in writing to the Floodplain Administrator and the Clerk within ten
days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 152.30 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   Development may not occur in the special flood hazard area (SFHA) where
alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved.
Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures
cannot be located out of the SFHA and that encroachments onto the SFHA are
minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are
required.
   (A)   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure.
   (B)   Flood-resistant materials and equipment. All new construction and
substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood-resistant materials
and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in accordance with Technical
Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and
available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (C)   Minimize flood damage. All new construction and substantial
improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages,
   (D)   Critical development. Shall be elevated to the 500-year flood
elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where
records are available), whichever is greater, if no data exists establishing
the 500 year-flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation,
the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
that generates 500-year flood elevation data.
   (E)   Utilities. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air
conditioning equipment (including duct work), and other service facilities
shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within the components during conditions of the base flood plus two
feet (freeboard).
   (F)   Water supply systems. All new and replacement water supply systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
system,
   (G)   Sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the
systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters, On-site waste
disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them
or contamination from them during flooding,
   (H)   Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either
located aboveground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent floatation and
lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (I)   Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure that is in compliance
with the provisions of this chapter, shall meet the requirements of new
construction as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM development
and structures.
   (J)   Non-conforming buildings or uses. Non-conforming buildings or uses may
not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless such enlargement or reconstruction
is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Provided,
however, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially
within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below
base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased and provided that such
repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of
this chapter.
   (K)   American with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the
specific standards for floodplain construction outlined in §
152.31, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not
justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements.
Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be
included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial
improvement.
   (L)   Reasonably safe from flooding. Review all permit applications to
determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding.

§ 152.31 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard (Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1 - A30, V, and
VE) where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in §
152.04 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the Local Floodplain
Administrator in §
152.23, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
lowest floor elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood elevation. No
basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated
buildings requirements in division (D) below.
   (B)   Non-residential construction.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or non-residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall
have the lowest floor elevated no lower than two feet above the level of the
base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated
buildings requirements in division (D) below. No basements are permitted.
Structures located in A-Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided
that all areas of the structure below the required elevation are watertight
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, using structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effect of buoyancy.
      (2)   A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be
provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification
requirements in §
152.22(B)(1). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural
structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in §
152.44. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of §
152.44 must meet the non-residential construction standards and all other
applicable provisions of this chapter. Structures that are floodproofed are
required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The
Local Floodplain Administrator must approve the maintenance plan and
notification of the annual exercise shall be provided to it.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on
sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a
flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of
the manufactured home is elevated no lower than two feet above the base flood
elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system
to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
      (2)   Manufactured homes that are to be placed or substantially improved
on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that are not
subject to the provisions for residential construction in division (A) above
must be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated
no lower two feet than above the base flood elevation, and be securely anchored
to an adequately anchored foundation to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement.
      (3)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, and lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement,
manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement in accordance with Section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured
Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation
requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis 36 inches or less above
the grade at the site, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or
engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36 inches in
height an engineering certification is required.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the Local Floodplain Administrator and
the local Emergency Preparedness Coordinator.
   (D)   Elevated buildings. New construction and substantial improvements of
elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited
storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding
shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters.
      (1)   Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the
following minimum criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of two openings on different walls having a
total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding;
         (b)   The bottom of each opening must be no more than one foot above
the higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening;
         (c)   Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood
elevation (BFE) can be counted towards the required net open area;
         (d)   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions;
         (e)   Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the
grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade
outside the building on at least one side of the building.
      (2)   Hazardous velocities. Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in
the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for
debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than five feet
per second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be
considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized.
      (3)   Enclosures below lowest floor.
         (a)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises
(standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).

elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in divisions (A), (B),
(C), and (D) above should be of flood-resistant materials.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
152.04 are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters that carry debris and
potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall
apply within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data
shall be presented to the Local Floodplain Administrator.
         (b)   A Conditional Letter of Map revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A Letter of Map Revision must be obtained upon completion of the
proposed development.
      (2)   If division (E)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this subchapter.
      (3)   No manufactured homes shall be permitted, except in an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home may be
placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided
the anchoring and the elevation standards of division (C) above and the
encroachment standards of division (E)(1) above are met.
      (4)   Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming,
pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary,
game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also,
lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding
trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or
fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact
certification. The uses listed in this subdivision are permissible only if and
to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or
changes to the floodway configuration.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles.
      (1)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is:
         (a)   On wheels or jacking system;
         (b)   Attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and
security devices; and
         (c)   Has no permanently attached additions.
      (2)   Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be:
         (a)   On site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
         (c)   Meet the development permit and certification requirements of §
152.23, general standards outlined in §
152.30, and manufactured homes standards in divisions (C) and (D) above.
   (G)   Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures
that flood maps, studies and other data identified in §
152.04 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data. The following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.
         (a)   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical or
scientific data reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA as soon as
practicable , but no later than six months of the date such information becomes
available. These development proposals include; but not limited to:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with §
152.32(A).
         (b)   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical
data, required in accordance with this division, prepared in a format required
for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and
submitted to FEMA. Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions shall
also be the responsibility of the applicant.

§ 152.32 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS AND
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard (Zones A and V) established
in §
152.04 are small streams where no base flood data has been provided and where
no floodways have been identified. The following provisions apply within such
areas.
   (A)   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data
are not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analysis that generates base flood elevations for all subdivision
proposals and other proposed developments containing at least 50 lots or five
acres, whichever is less.
   (B)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and new development shall be permitted within 100 feet of the
stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (C)   If division (A) above is satisfied and base flood elevation data is
available from other sources, all new construction and substantia! improvements
within such areas shall comply with all applicable provisions of this
subchapter and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations
established in accordance with §
152.24(K).
   (D)   Data from preliminary, draft, and final Flood Insurance Studies
constitutes best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical
Bulletin 1-98 Use of Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Data as Available Data. If an
appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and
67.6, the data does not have to be used.
   (E)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal,
state, or other source one of the following methods may be used to determine a
BFE For further information regarding the methods for determining BFEs listed
below, refer to FEMA's manual Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate
Zone A Areas:
      (1)   Contour interpolation:
         (a)   Superimpose approximate Zone A boundaries onto a topographic map
and estimate a BFE.
         (b)   Add one-half of the contour interval of the topographic map that
is used to the BFE.
      (2)   Data extrapolation. A BFE can be determined if a site within 500
feet upstream of a reach of a stream reach for which a 100-year profile has
been computed by detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope
characteristics are relatively similar to the downstream reaches. No hydraulic
structures shall be present.
      (3)   Hydrologic and hydraulic calculations. Perform hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations to determine BFEs using FEMA approved methods and
software.

   The Easley Board of Appeals as established by the city shall hear and decide
requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.41 RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   Any person aggrieved by the decision of the Appeal Board or any taxpayer may
appeal such decision to the Court.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.42 HISTORIC STRUCTURES.
   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon the determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation
will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic
structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.43 FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USES.
   Variances may be issued for development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use, provided the criteria of this subchapter are met,
no reasonable alternative exist, and the development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damage and create no additional threat to public safety.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.44 AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURES.
   Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure provided
it is used solely for agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages
during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure
must meet all of the conditions and considerations of §
152.48, this section, and the following standards:
   (A)   Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as
listed below:
      (1)   Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for
the storage of farm machinery and equipment;
      (2)   Steel grain bins and steel frame corncribs;
      (3)   General-purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock that
are open on at least one side;
      (4)   For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy
operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be issued for
structures that were substantially damaged. New construction or substantial
improvement of such structures must meet the elevation requirements of §

existing building that is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials
for the exterior and interior building components and elements below the base
flood elevation.
   (C)   The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components
must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including
hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood
velocities exceed five feet per second, fast-flowing fioodwaters can exert
considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls.
   (D)   The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of §
152.31(D).
   (E)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located

   (F)   The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment
provisions of §
152.31(E).
   (G)   Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such
protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the
building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents,
permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood
elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents
without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site
out of the floodplain.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-14)
§ 152.45 CONSIDERATIONS.
   In passing upon such applications, the Appeal Board shall consider all
technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all standards specified in other
sections of this chapter, and:
   (A)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury
of others;
   (B)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage, and
the safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and
emergency vehicles;
   (C)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
   (D)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
   (E)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
   (F)   The availability of alternative locations, not subject to flooding or
erosion damage, for the proposed use;
   (G)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development, and the relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
   (H)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable,
expected at the site;
   (I)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood
conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges; and
   (J)   Agricultural structures must be located in wide, expansive floodplain
areas, where no other alternative location for the agricultural structure
exists. The applicant must demonstrate that the entire farm acreage, consisting
of a contiguous parcel of land on which the structure is to be located, must be
in the special flood hazard area and no other alternative locations for the
structure are available.

Department of Natural Resources, Land, Water and Conservation Division, State
Coordinator's Office, must be taken into account and included in the permit
file.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.47 FLOODWAYS.
   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase
in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result unless a CLOMR is
obtained prior to issuance of the variance. In order to ensure the project is
built in compliance with the CLOMR for which the variance is granted the
applicant must provide a bond for 100% of the cost to perform the development.
(Ord. 2015-14, passed 11-9-15)
§ 152.48 CONDITIONS.
   Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this
chapter, the Appeal Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. The
following conditions shall apply to all variances.
   (A)   Variances may not be issued when the variance will make the structure
in violation of other federal, state, or local laws, regulations, or
ordinances.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (C)   Variances shall only be issued upon a showing of good and sufficient
cause, a determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship, and a determination that the granting of a variance will
not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (D)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation (BFE) and the
elevation to which the structure is to be built and a written statement that
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk. Such
notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
   (E)   The Local Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) upon request.
   (F)   Variances shall not be issued for unpermitted development or other
development that is not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
Violations must be corrected in accordance with §
152.24.

§ 153.05 UNFIT DWELLINGS PROCEDURES.
   The following procedures concerning unfit dwellings shall be used:
   (A)   Whenever a petition is filed with the public officer by a public
authority, or by at least five residents of the municipality, charging that any
dwelling is unfit for human habitation, or whenever it appears to the public
officer on his own motion that any dwelling is unfit for human habitation, the
public officer shall if his preliminary investigation discloses a basis for
charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner of and all parties in such
dwelling a complaint, stating the charges in that respect and containing a
notice that a hearing will be held before the public officer at a place therein
fixed, not less than ten days nor more than 30 days after the serving of such
complaint. The owner and parties in interest shall be given the right to file
an answer to the complaint and to appear, in person or otherwise, and give
testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint, and the rules of
evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in
hearings before the public officer.
   (B)   If, after such notice and hearing, the public officer determines that
the dwelling under consideration is unfit for human habitation, he shall state
in writing his findings of fact in support of such determination and shall
issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof an order, giving the owner
60 days within which to comply by repairing, altering, improving, vacating or
demolishing the building.
   (C)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, alter, improve
or vacate and close the dwelling, the public officer may cause such dwelling to
be repaired, altered or improved and cause to be posted on the main entrance of
any dwelling so closed a placard with the following words: “THIS BUILDING IS
UNFIT FOR HUMAN HABITATION: THE USE OR OCCUPATION OF THIS BUILDING FOR HUMAN
HABITATION IS PROHIBITED AND UNLAWFUL.”
   (D)   If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair, remove or
demolish the dwelling, the public officer may cause such dwelling to be
repaired, removed or demolished.
   (E)   The amount of the cost of such repairs, alterations or improvements,
vacating and closing or removal or demolition by the public officer shall be a
lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred.
   (F)   Complaints or orders issued by a public officer pursuant to this code
shall be served upon persons either personally or by registered mail, but if
the whereabouts of such person are unknown and cannot be ascertained by the
public officer in the exercise of reasonable diligence, and the public officer
shall make an affidavit to that effect, the serving of such complaint or order
upon such person may be made by publishing it once each week for two
consecutive weeks in a newspaper printed and published in the county and
circulating in the city. A copy of such complaint or order shall be posted in a
conspicuous place on the premises affected by the complaint or order. A copy of
such complaint or order shall also be filed with the clerk of court for the
county, and such filing of the complaint or order shall have the same force and
effect as other lis pendens notices provided by law.
   (G)   If it shall appear to the public officer that the provisions of the
code as pertaining to the time limits for compliance with orders of the
official may cause an undue hardship, the public officer may waive deadlines as
may be just and proper, but in no event shall the failure of the official to
act be deemed as a waiver of any provision. It is further provided that any
such waiver for compliance shall be for one month intervals; provided that no
such extension shall be granted for more than eight months from the date of
such notice. It is further provided that the provisions of this section on
waiver are applicable only in the case of condemnation for repair and that
there shall not be any waiver whatsoever for the provisions of condemnation for

of the order, and the court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary
injunction restraining the public officer pending the final disposition of the
case. Hearing shall be had by the court on such petition within 20 days, or as
soon thereafter as possible, and shall be given preference over other matters
on the court's calendar. The court shall hear and determine the issues raised
and shall enter such final order or decree as law and justice may require. In

supported by evidence, shall be conclusive. Costs shall be in the discretion of
the court. The remedies herein provided shall be exclusive remedies, and no
person affected by an order of the public officer shall be entitled to recover

to the appellants and a copy shall be kept on file in the records of the Board.
('90 Code, § 7-46.21)
   (B)   The Board shall, in every case, reach a decision without unreasonable

nondiscriminatory terms and conditions subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   Within ten days of receiving an application, the city must
determine and notify the applicant whether the application is complete; or if
an application is incomplete, the city must specifically identify the missing
information.
      (2)   Make its final decision to approve or deny the application within
60 days of submission of a completed application.
      (3)   Notify the applicant in writing of its final decision, and if the
application is denied, specify the basis for a denial, including citations to
federal, state or local code provisions and/or statutes on which the denial was
based.
      (4)   Notwithstanding an initial denial, the applicant may cure the
deficiencies identified by the city and resubmit the application within 30 days
of the denial, and the city shall approve or deny the revised application
within 30 days of receipt of it. The subsequent review by the city shall be
limited to the deficiencies cited in the original denial.
   (B)   Review deadline. If the city fails to act on an application within the
60 day review period (or within the 30 day review period for an amended
application), the applicant may provide notice that the time period for acting
has lapsed and the application is then deemed approved.
   (C)   Review of eligible facilities requests. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this chapter, the city shall approve and may not deny
applications that constitute eligible facilities requests for modification of
an eligible support structure that does not substantially change the physical
dimensions of such structure as provided in 47 CFR 1.40001, within sixty 60

imposed on other businesses within the city.
(Ord. 2019-06, passed 4-8-19)
§ 156.05 REQUIREMENTS FOR SMALL WIRELESS FACILITIES IN COVERED AREAS.
   (A)   Administrative review. The city shall perform an administrative review
of permit applications including the location or installation of new, modified,
or replacement utility poles and/or wireless support structures and the
attachment of wireless facilities and equipment on utility poles or wireless
support structures. Review factors, in addition to location, shall include the
size, shape, color, texture, and materials of the structures and attachments.
      (1)   The city may require a proposed wireless facility be designed to
not be significantly more readily apparent or plainly visible (to a reasonable
person of ordinary sensibilities) from covered areas than existing utility
structures, poles and equipment located within 500 linear feet on the same
covered area as the subject utility pole or wireless support structure.
      (2)   Where small wireless facilities are determined to be appropriate,
the use of reasonable stealth and concealment treatments, low profile equipment
and control boxes, and screening may be required to avoid significant negative
impacts on the character and visual aesthetics of the area. However, such
requirements may be waived by the city upon a showing that the particular
location of a small wireless facility does not warrant stealth or concealment
treatments or imposes an excessive expense. The waiver shall be granted or
denied within 45 days after the date of the request.
      (3)   Supplemental review districts identified in §
156.05(C) and listed in Appendix A may be subject to a higher level of review.
   (B)   Maximum size of permitted use.
      (1)   The height of an antenna of a collocated small wireless facility
shall be limited to the greater of ten feet above:
         (a)   The height of an existing or modified utility pole or wireless
support structure; or
         (b)   The height of a new utility pole or wireless support structure
as provided in division (2) below.
      (2)   The height of a new or modified utility pole or wireless support
structure is limited to the greater of:
         (a)   The tallest utility pole, excluding transmission poles, or
wireless support structure located in the same covered area, measured from
grade, in place within 500 linear feet on the same covered area as the subject
utility pole or wireless support structure as of the effective date of this
chapter; or
         (b)   In the absence of any such utility pole or wireless support
structure, either:
            1.   Forty feet in any area zoned exclusively for single family
residential use, unless a waiver is granted for good cause shown; or
            2.   Fifty feet in any other area.
      (3)   Collocation is not allowed on a decorative pole less than 20 feet
in height.
   (C)   Supplemental review districts. Collocated small wireless facilities
and new or modified utility poles or wireless support structures located in
supplemental review districts shall be a conditional use and subject to the
design and aesthetic requirements and review processes for structures specified
in this chapter establishing the supplemental review district(s) in addition to
the requirement of this chapter, provided that the city will work in good faith
with the applicant to accommodate the installation of collocated small wireless
facilities and new or modified utility poles or wireless support structures in
supplemental review districts to the fullest extent practicable. The city
reserves its right to maintain and implement the following types of
supplemental review districts.
      (1)   Underground districts. A wireless services provider or a wireless
infrastructure provider shall comply with nondiscriminatory requirements that
prohibit electric utilities, telecommunications or cable providers from
installing above-ground structures in the covered area in these districts.
Nothing in this section shall prohibit the use or replacement of existing
utility poles or wireless support structures in underground districts for the
collocation of small wireless facilities subject to administrative review by
the zoning administrator, appropriate design and concealment and a finding that
such use does not increase the height by more than three feet.
      (2)   Historic and design districts. As a condition for approval of new
small wireless facilities or new wireless support structure, in a historic
district or a design district, the city may require that a wireless services
provider or a wireless infrastructure provider comply with the design and
aesthetic standards of the historic district or design district to minimize the
impact to the aesthetics in a historic district or on a design district's
decorative poles. If design and concealment treatments are determined on review
by the city to be insufficient to mitigate harm to the historic district or
design district, the application may be denied.
   (D)   This section may not be construed to limit a municipality's authority
to enforce historic preservation zoning regulations consistent with the
preservation of local zoning authority under 47 U.S.C. § 332(C)(7), the
requirements for facility modifications under 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a), or the
National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 (54 U.S.C. § 300101 et seq.), and
the regulations adopted to implement those laws.
   (E)   Appeals, special exceptions and variance requirements. Appeals of
administrative decisions and requests for special exceptions and variances from
the provisions of this chapter, when strict application would result in an
unnecessary hardship or in the inability to deploy needed small wireless
facilities, shall be heard and decided by the Board of Zoning Appeals or
equivalent board for architectural, design or historical district reviews. An
applicant seeking a special exception to construct a new decorative pole,
utility pole or other wireless support structure to collocate a small wireless
facility in an underground district shall demonstrate, including certification
through an engineer, that it has diligently attempted to locate the proposed
decorative pole, utility pole, wireless support structure, or small wireless
facility outside of the underground district and that placement of the
decorative pole, utility pole, wireless support structure, or small wireless
facility within the underground district is necessary to provide the needed
wireless coverage or capacity, and one or more of the following conditions
exist supporting a special exception:
      (1)   No existing utility pole or wireless support structure is located
within the location search radius or to the extent a utility pole or wireless
support structure is located within the search radius, such utility pole or
wireless support structure:
         (a)   Is not available for collocation under commercially reasonable
rates, terms, and conditions;
         (b)   Cannot accommodate the collocation of the small wireless
facility and meet the technical requirements necessary to deliver adequate
wireless service coverage or capacity; or
         (c)   Would require modifications exceeding the three feet height
limitation imposed in §
156.05(C)(1).
      (2)   The only available option to deliver adequate wireless service
coverage or capacity in the search radius requires modifications to an existing
utility pole or wireless support structure exceeding the three feet height
limitation imposed in §
156.05(C)(1) or the installation of a new utility pole or wireless support
structure for collocation of a small wireless facility; or
      (3)   The applicant has demonstrated other circumstances that, in the
reasonable discretion of the [board, etc.], warrant a special exception or
variance. The applicant shall abide by the design, stealth and concealment
treatments imposed as conditions of the special exception.
   (F)   Existing supplemental review districts. Supplemental review districts
approved by the city as of the effective date of this chapter are listed in
Appendix A. The code provisions authorizing the district, applicable design
guidelines or manual, review authority and appeal jurisdiction are specified in
Appendix A. Nothing in this chapter shall prohibit or otherwise limit the city
from establishing additional supplemental review districts, provided however,
that facilities and structures for which a permit was approved or deemed
approved pursuant to this chapter prior to the establishment of the additional
supplemental review district remain subject to the provisions of this chapter,
including routine maintenance and replacement of those facilities and
structures as set out in §§
156.03(E)(1) and
156.03(E)(2) of this chapter, and not to any provisions otherwise applicable to
the additional supplemental review district. If a wireless services provider or
a wireless infrastructure provider voluntarily replaces such facilities in a
manner that does not comply with §
156.03(E)(2) of this chapter, or if a wireless services provider or a wireless
infrastructure provider voluntarily relocates such facilities, such replacement
or relocation is subject to the then-existing provisions and requirements of
the additional supplemental review district.
   (G)   Repair of damage. A wireless services provider or a wireless
infrastructure provider shall repair all damage to a city right-of-way directly
caused by the activities of the wireless services provider or the wireless
infrastructure provider, while occupying, installing, repairing, or maintaining
wireless facilities, wireless support structures, city utility poles, or
utility poles and to return the right-of-way to its functional equivalence
before the damage. If the wireless services provider or the wireless
infrastructure provider fails to make the repairs required by the city within
45 days after written notice, unless the city and the wireless services
provider or the wireless infrastructure provider agree in writing to a longer
time period, the city may undertake those repairs and charge the applicable
party the reasonable and documented cost of the repairs. The city may maintain
an action to recover the costs of the repairs.
(Ord. 2019-06, passed 4-8-19)
§ 156.06 EFFECT OF PERMIT.
   (A)   Authority granted; no property right or other interest created. A
permit from the city authorizes an applicant to undertake only certain
activities in accordance with the chapter and does not create a property right
or grant any authority whatsoever to the applicant to impinge upon the rights
of others who may already have an interest in the covered area.
   (B)   Duration. Unless construction has actually begun and is diligently
pursued to completion at that point, no permit for construction issued under
this chapter shall be valid for a period longer than 12 months unless both city
and applicant agree to a reasonable extension and all required fees are paid
for the term regardless of construction. The inability of the applicant to
obtain electrical power or backhaul transport services to serve the wireless
facility such that it is operational within the 12 months due to the action or
inaction of third-party utility providers shall not result in the invalidity of
the permit.
(Ord. 2019-06, passed 4-8-19)
§ 156.07 REMOVAL, RELOCATION OR MODIFICATION OF A SMALL WIRELESS FACILITY IN
THE ROW.
   (A)   Notice. Within 90 days following written notice from the city, a
wireless services provider or a wireless infrastructure provider shall, at its
own expense, protect, support, temporarily or permanently disconnect, remove,
relocate, change or alter the position of any wireless facilities or wireless
support structures within the rights-of-way whenever the city, in its
reasonable discretion, has determined that such removal, relocation, change or
alteration, is reasonably necessary for the construction, repair, maintenance,
or installation of any city improvement in or upon, or the operations of the
city in or upon, the rights-of-way.
   (B)   Emergency removal or relocation of facilities. The city retains the
right to cut or move any wireless facility or wireless support structure
located within its rights-of-way as the city, in its reasonable discretion, may
determine to be necessary, appropriate, or useful in response to any public
health or safety emergency. If circumstances permit, the city shall notify the
wireless services provider or the wireless infrastructure provider and provide
opportunity to move its own wireless facilities or wireless support structure
prior to the city cutting or removing a wireless facility or wireless support
structure and the city shall notify the wireless services provider or the
wireless infrastructure provider after cutting or removing a wireless facility.
   (C)   Abandonment of facilities. Upon abandonment of a wireless facility or
wireless support structure within the city rights-of-way, the wireless services
provider or the wireless infrastructure provider shall notify the city within
90 days of such abandonment. Following receipt of such notice the city may
direct the wireless services provider or the wireless infrastructure provider
to remove all or any portion of the wireless facility or wireless support
structure if the city, in its sole discretion, determines that such removal
will be in the best interests of the public health, safety, and welfare.
   (D)   Abandonment by inaction. At any point when a wireless services
provider or a wireless infrastructure provider fails to pay any required fee,
or annual payment to the city, and fails to respond within 60 days to a written
inquiry from the city as to whether the wireless services provider or the
wireless infrastructure provider intends to continue to operate a wireless
facility or wireless support structure, for whatever reason, the wireless
facility shall be deemed abandoned and the city may, at its sole option, remove
all or any portion of the wireless facility or wireless support structure, or
take other action as authorized by law, including recovery of actual costs
incurred in removing the wireless facility or wireless support structure.
(Ord. 2019-06, passed 4-8-19)
§ 156.08 ATTACHMENT TO CITY-OWNED UTILITY POLES IN THE COVERED AREAS.
   (A)   Annual rate. The rate to place a small wireless facility on a city-
owned pole in covered areas shall be $50 per year per wooden pole or $200 per
year for all other city-owned poles. This rate is in addition to reimbursement
to the city for any expenses for make-ready work. The city reserves the right
to require a pole attachment agreement to further define the terms and
conditions of attachments to city-owned poles. The rates specified in this
section shall not apply to poles owned, or operated and accounted for as an
asset of, a municipal electric utility.
   (B)   Cease payment. A wireless services provider or a wireless
infrastructure provider is authorized to remove its facilities at any time from
a city-owned pole in covered areas and cease paying the annual rate to the city
as of the next due date for payment following the removal.
   (C)   Make-ready. For city-owned utility poles in covered areas, the
applicant shall reimburse the city for expenses for any reasonable make-ready
work. The city shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work
necessary to enable the pole to support the requested small wireless facility,
including pole replacement if necessary, within 60 days after receipt of a
completed request. Make-ready work including any pole replacement shall be
completed within 60 days of written acceptance of the good faith estimate by
the wireless services provider or the wireless infrastructure provider.
   (D)   Municipal utilities excluded. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to affect the authority of a municipal electric utility to deny,
limit, restrict, or determine the rates, fees, terms, and conditions for the
use of or attachment to a utility pole owned, or operated and accounted for as
an asset of, a municipal electric utility.

CHAPTER 159: PERMIT AND OTHER LAND USAGE FEES
Section
   
159.01   Building permit fees
§ 159.01 BUILDING PERMIT FEES.
   (A)   Building permit fees are based on the contracted construction cost. If
the construction is by the owner, or cost is otherwise unknown, then the cost
is estimated by the building official based on square footage and current
average cost per square foot for the type of construction being permitted. Fees
are as follows:
 
Construction Cost    Permit Fee
$0 to $5,000         $40
$5,001 to $100,000   $40 plus $5 per $1,000
$100,001 to $500,000 $515 plus $4 per $1,000
$500,001 up          $2,115 plus $3 per $1,000
 
   (B)   A $50 fee will be charged for re-inspections in every area where
permits are required. "Re-inspection" is defined as any trip in addition to
those specifically named on the building permit job card or any trip made as
the result of condemned or disapproved work; calling for inspections prior to
the work being ready for inspection; and additional trips made because access
to the structure is not provided. Re-inspection fees shall be paid at the
Building Official's office at the time of inspection. An exception is when the
re-inspection is a result of an error on the part of the inspector.
   (C)   Where work for which a permit is required by this code is started or
proceeded with prior to obtaining such permit, the fees herein specified shall
be doubled, but the payment of such double fee shall not relieve any person
from fully complying with the requirements of this code in the execution of the
work or from any other penalties prescribed herein.
      Site plan review fee . . . . . . . . . . . $100
      Rezoning fee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $100
      Variance fee . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $50
