Code or by Town Council or the Town Administrator. The bond amount for
violations shall be prescribed by a Municipal Court Judge. Town law enforcement
or code enforcement officers are prohibited from accepting bonds. The uniform
ordinance summons shall not be used to perform a custodial arrest.

      (3)   The time, date, and location of the hearing;

shall be borne by the recipient of this favorable option.
         (d)   Based on all of the specifics involved with monitoring and
follow-up in a deferred prosecution, $50 is a fair and reasonable cost to
charge each accused/recipient involved.
      (2)   A deferred prosecution fee for the deferred prosecution program is
hereby established for the Municipal Court in the amount of $50. This fee shall
apply to any charge or charges deferred for an accused based on certain
conditions being accomplished. The Municipal Court shall promulgate paperwork,
procedures and policies to administer this program and fee.
   (B)   Administrative service fee.

date.
         (b)   Record checks for other agencies and for employment purposes.

         (e)   Processing warrants for non- sufficient checks. Takes staff away

staff going to the Charleston County Clerk of Court’s office to have tickets
signed off, which verifies that specific cases were disposed of.
         (g)   Sending notices to offenders by certified mail to insure
individuals are notified. This is done to avoid having offenders tried in their

notifying them of pending bench warrants. This letter is to advise them that
they have ten days in which to pay their fine in order to avoid a formal
arrest.

         (j)   Requests for copies of tickets, letters, and the like are made

charge all guilty offenders in the Municipal Court.

the Municipal Court is hereby established for the Municipal Court in the amount
of $10. The Municipal Court shall promulgate paperwork, procedures and policies

provision supersedes any and all other provisions in this code.

appropriate, including restitution and/or community service. The Municipal
Judge is further specifically authorized in criminal cases to order a defendant

(Ord. 18010, passed 2-14-18)
§ 38.02 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted pursuant to and in compliance with South
Carolina law and with the authority of Town Council. The Bids and Purchases
Committee (“Committee”), as appointed by the Mayor, shall act as the principal
public procurement governing authority of the town, unless the full Town
Council, by majority vote of a quorum of Council, decides a matter otherwise in
advance of any final decision by the Committee. Final actions by the Committee
must be by the majority vote of a quorum of the Committee. In the event of a
tie vote the matter under consideration will be referred to the full Town
Council for resolution. In other words, normally the Committee shall act with
full and final authority relative to all procurement matters, pursuant to the
specific requirements of this chapter; however, Town Council herein reserves
the right to exercise such authority, as deemed appropriate. Specifically, Town
Council has the right to assume full and final authority in any procurement
matter, but only before a final, majority decision and vote by a quorum of the
Committee is placed on the public record. This section is not intended to
contravene the appeals process requirement identified in this chapter, when
applicable.
   (B)   As used in this chapter, PROCUREMENT is defined as the process and
procedure for obtaining goods and services, including all activities from the
planning steps including the preparation and processing of a requisition,
through receipt and acceptance of delivery and processing of a final invoice
for payment. However, Committee authority in procurement does not include the
authority to materially alter or amend any contract or agreement approved by a
majority vote of Town Council; material alteration and amendment of such
contracts and agreements is reserved solely to the Town Council.
   (C)   The Committee of the town delegates to the Town Administrator, or
designee, the duties and responsibilities for administering the procurement of
all supplies, services, and construction, as well as the management and
disposal of surplus supplies and equipment in accordance with this chapter.
   (D)   The Procurement Officer or authorized designee, shall provide for
implementation and compliance with all requirements of this chapter in order to
maximize the purchasing value of public funds, providing safeguards for
maintaining quality and integrity within the procurement system, yet providing
for the fair and equitable treatment of all involved in public procurement. The

(State Ethics Act), 1976, as amended, shall be complied with and observed.
Every contract or duty imposes an obligation of good faith in the negotiation,
performance, or enforcement by town staff. GOOD FAITH means honesty in fact in
the conduct or transaction concerned and the observance of reasonable
commercial standards of fair dealing. All procurement activities shall be
performed in an ethical manner. No member of Town Council or any officer or
employee of the town, shall have a financial interest in any contract or in the
sale to the town or to a contractor supplying the town of any land or rights or
interest in any land, material supplies or services; except when a majority of
the Town Council determines such exception in the best interest of the town,
provided, that no Councilperson whose interest is involved shall vote on the
question. Any willful violation of this section shall constitute malfeasance in
office, and any officer or employee of the town found guilty thereof shall
thereby forfeit his or her office or position. Any violation of this section
with the knowledge, expressed or implied, of the person or corporation
contracting with the town shall render the contract voidable by the Town
Administrator or the Town Council.
   (B)   The following actions are prohibited and shall be avoided by all those
involved in the procurement activities of the town:
      (1)   Not obligate the town financially or otherwise by any means,
including but not limited to purchase orders and contracts, when the employee
or Councilmember has a personal, financial, or other interest in the
obligation;
      (2)   Prohibited from directly or indirectly soliciting or accepting any
rebate, kickback, gift, gratuity, or favor for personal gain from any
individual, corporation, organization, or group. Doing so may lead to
disciplinary action, up to termination of employment.
      (3)   Prohibited from accepting any form of gratuities, with the
exception of non-consumable marketing or promotional mementos valued at $25 or
less which may be accepted but shared with all town employees (i.e., pens,
paper clips, pencils, cups, etc.). Accepting any other such form of gratuities,
may lead to disciplinary action, up to termination of employment.
(Ord. 18010, passed 2-14-18)
§ 38.05 PROCUREMENT LIMITATIONS AND AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   It is the town’s policy to develop competition to ensure maximum
purchasing value for all procurements and to make awards based on the lowest,
responsive, responsible bid/offer received. Nothing in this section shall
prohibit a higher level, more stringent procurement method being used if it is
determined that the town’s best interest would be better served. No contract or
purchase shall be subdivided to avoid the requirements of this section.
   (B)   Upon verification of adequate monies, procurement of goods and/or
services shall be executed as follows:
      (1)   $1 to $9,999 - Administrative Process “Delegated Authority.”
Competitive bidding is not required. The department initiating the purchase
should exercise good judgement in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   $10,000 to $24,999 - Written Quotations.
         (a)   Competitive pricing is required. The departments will request
written quotations from vendors in order to obtain competitive pricing. At
minimum, three written quotes shall be solicited.
         (b)   The department manager, the Procurement Officer, and the Chief
Financial Officer, or designees, must approve before the purchase is made.
         (c)   Purchases inclusive of grants and those with federal funds shall
be referred to the Procurement Division for processing.
      (3)   $25,000 to $99,999 - Informal Solicitations for Bids or Proposals.
         (a)   Competitive bidding is required. The Procurement Division will
issue a written Invitation for Bids (IFB), Request for Proposals (RFP), or
Request for Qualifications (RFQ) depending on the type of procurement. At
minimum, three written bids or responses should be solicited.
         (b)   The department manager, the Procurement Officer, the Chief
Financial Officer, or designees shall approve the purchase.
      (4)   $100,000 - Formal Solicitations for Bids or Proposals.
         (a)   Competitive, sealed bidding is required; however, approval by
the Committee is required before the purchase is made.
         (b)   Procurements involving construction may use a construction
contracting administration method which is most advantageous to the town and
will result in the most timely, acceptable quality, economical, and successful
completion of the construction project. The Town Administrator and Chief
Financial Officer or designees, shall make a determination regarding the
appropriate method of construction contracting administration for a particular
construction project.
         (c)   When it is determined that competitive, sealed bidding is either
not practical, appropriate, or advantageous, competitive, formal sealed
proposals shall be used. Approval by the Committee is required before the
purchase is made.

emergency procurements, purchasing cooperatives, and critical procurements as
defined below.
      (1)   SOLE SOURCE.
         (a)   Sole source procurement is acceptable when, after a good faith
review of all possible sources, it is determined there is only one viable
source for material, supply, or service. Sole source requests should not be
made unless town staff is confident the request is reasonable and appropriately
justified.
         (b)   For sole source procurements between $10,000 and $24,999, the
department manager, Procurement Officer, and the Chief Financial Officer, or
their designees, must approve the written sole source justification prior to
the purchase being made. Additional approval by the Town Administrator, or
designee is required for procurements between $25,000 to $99,999.
      (2)   PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. Professional services shall be advertised
formally when the services are expected to be $100,000 or greater.
      (3)   EMERGENCY PROCUREMENTS. The Town Administrator, or designee, may
make or authorize others to make emergency procurements when there exists a
threat to public health, welfare, or safety under emergency conditions or where
normal daily operations are affected or in jeopardy.
      (4)   PURCHASING COOPERATIVES. The State of South Carolina and its
agencies, Charleston County and other South Carolina counties, similarly sized
South Carolina municipalities or purchasing cooperatives write numerous
indefinite-delivery-type contracts yearly with manufacturers, service providers
and contractors for regional and/or nationwide items or services. In all cases,
town procurement of equipment, goods or services may be made from suppliers
which have contracts in place through the State of South Carolina or one of its
agencies, or Charleston County or other South Carolina county, or a similarly
sized South Carolina municipality, or the U.S. General Services Administration,
or purchasing cooperative, without seeking competitive bids or proposals.
      (5)   CRITICAL PROCUREMENT. The Town Administrator, or designee, may make
or authorize procurements that in nature are critical to the town, and time
does not permit for solicitation or re-solicitation, and that the procurement
may be accomplished in such a method that provides the town’s best interest be
served.

§ 38.06 LOCAL VENDOR PARTNERSHIP PROCUREMENT.

vendor must have a principal place of business located within the corporate

available;
      (2)   Respond to the town’s needs in a timely fashion;
      (3)   Provide future maintenance and services for the products they sell;
and
      (4)   Must also agree to allow the town to audit the vendor’s records
relating to the town’s purchases at any time the town requests, in order to
ensure the town is receiving the best product or service for the best price.
   (C)   Once the vendor has executed and has filed the partnership agreement
with the town, the town and its designated representatives shall solicit bids
or proposals for products or non-professional services which shall be evaluated
on a percentage-reduction basis. In evaluating the price of eligible local
vendor’s bids or proposals, the bids or proposals shall be evaluated as though
the prices proposed by local bidders were either 5%, 2% or 1% lower than
actually proposed in accordance with the following schedule:
      (1)   If the local bidder submits bids or proposals for products or non-
professional services costing less than $10,000, the business or individual
shall be evaluated on a 5% reduction basis;
      (2)   For products or services costing between $ 10,000 and $50,000, the
evaluation shall be based on a 2% reduction basis;
      (3)   For products or services costing $50,000 or more, the evaluation
shall be based on a 1% reduction basis, but will not exceed a total reduction
of more than $2,000.
   (D)   In the event of a tie bid, ties between one local vendor and one or
more non-local vendors meeting specifications, shall be broken in favor of the
local vendor. Ties between two or more local vendors meeting specifications,
will be broken through a coin toss method until the winner remains. However,
the local preference stated herein shall not apply if all vendors, bidders, or
proposers are local, eligible, partnership vendors.
   (E)   For purposes of this section, NON-PROFESSIONAL SERVICES are
construction or renovation of facilities, janitorial services, general
maintenance, including fleet management, landscaping, and lawn or tree
services, vector services, printing services, travel services, food services,
recreational services, training assistance, and temporary job placement
services. Further decisions regarding the classification of items or services
as professional or non-professional shall be determined by the Town
Administrator, or designee.
   (F)   Nothing herein shall be construed as increasing or decreasing the
actual price of a bid or proposal and the resulting contract in accordance with
their terms and conditions; this section is intended only to be used for
purposes of comparing and evaluating bids and proposals for products and
services. Nothing within this section shall be construed to create any private
rights, claims, or cause of actions on behalf of any person, including but not
limited to, bidders, proposers, and contractors.
   (G)   Should it be determined that any portion of this section is in
conflict with any federal and state laws, regulations, or provisions, then that
portion of this section shall be invalid but should not affect the remaining
portions of this section.
   (H)   The requirements of this section may be waived by Town Council upon a
formal finding that the best interest of the town would not be served by
adhering to the provisions as stated in this section.

CHAPTER 43: TOWN POLICIES
Section
   
43.01   Freedom of Information Act policy
   
43.02   Memorials and monuments policy
§ 43.01 FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT POLICY.
   Policy regarding requests for public records under the Freedom of
Information Act:
   (A)   Policy statement. It shall be the policy of the Town of Mount
Pleasant, South Carolina (the "Town") to comply with both the letter and the
spirit of the Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA"), as codified at S.C. §§ 30-4-
10 et seq., as amended, in regards to the processing of requests for access to
public records. This policy is applicable to all departments under the
supervision of the Town Administrator, and to any board or commission whose
members are appointed by the Town Council, the governing body of the town (the
“Council”).
   (B)   Making a FOIA request. All requests for public documents pursuant to
FOIA, except for those described below, must be made in writing, and preferably
submitted via email to the Town Administrator by this link. Requests made to
Council Members or Department Heads may be forwarded to the Legal Department,
but the requester should not assume they have been forwarded to the appropriate
party. If the requester does not receive an acknowledgement of receipt of the
FOIA request within 24 hours from the Town Attorney, the requester should
assume the FOIA request has not been properly submitted and should make their
request again. Requests may be made in person at the Town Hall, 100 Ann Edwards
Lane, Mount Pleasant, SC, 29464; by mail to Town of Mount Pleasant, Attn: Legal
Department; or by email to TownFOIA@tompsc.com.
   (C)   Ideally, requests should be made using the Freedom of Information Act
Request Form (the “request form”) provided by the town and made available to
the public, a copy of which is attached hereto. Requests made by letter or in
some other written form shall contain substantially the same information
provided for on the request form. In order to ensure the most accurate and
prompt response, requests should be as detailed, specific, and descriptive as
possible.
   (D)   Requests to inspect the following public records need not be in
writing, provided the requestor appears at the appropriate town office in-
person and within normal town business hours:
      (1)   Reports from the preceding 14 days which disclose the nature,
substance, and location of any crime or alleged crime reported as having been
committed (with the exception of records regarding juveniles);
      (2)   Documents identifying persons confined in any jail, detention
center, or prison for the preceding three months (with the exception of records
regarding juveniles); and
      (3)   Copy of any document distributed to or reviewed by members of a
public body during a public meeting within the last six months.
   (E)   The town's agendas and minutes are immediately available on our
website free of charge.
   (F)   Processing FOIA requests. Where any town employee or Council member
receives any written request for public records, the request should be stamped
with the date of receipt and immediately delivered to the Legal Department.
“Routine FOIA requests” may be handled directly by the respective Department
Head. All Department Heads shall consult with the Town Attorney on non-routine
FOIA requests and on any questions of law involving FOIA. Where an exemption,
restriction or limitation to FOIA possibly exists, the Town Attorney should be
consulted to determine if an exemption, restriction or limitation applies and
whether the town should decline to disclose or request a hearing for
declaratory judgment or injunctive relief based upon any perceived exemption,
restriction or limitation.
   (G)   As required by FOIA, the Town Administrator must respond to all FOIA
requests within ten business days of receipt of the request. It shall be the
policy of the town to respond to FOIA requests as quickly as possible. Where
possible, the response to the request should include the requested records.
Otherwise, the response should either inform the requestor that the requested
records will be made available, along with the means of obtaining them and any
additional costs that will be charged for making the records available, or it
should inform the requestor that the requested records fall under an exemption
to FOIA and will not be disclosed. The town shall not create new records, nor
summarize existing records. The town is not required to create an electronic
version of a public record where one does not exist.
   (H)   Records exempt from disclosure. The town adopts as a part of this
policy any and all exemptions, restrictions or limitations contained within
FOIA, as FOIA may be amended from time to time, along with any other
exemptions, restrictions or limitations that may be provided for now or in the
future under South Carolina or Federal law. As previously stated herein, the
Town Attorney shall be consulted to determine whether an exemption, restriction
or limitation to the disclosure requirements of FOIA applies. Where an
exemption, restriction or limitation applies, the town, based upon consultation
with the Town Attorney, should decide whether to deny disclosure based upon the
application of the available exemption, restriction or limitation. Where
records contain certain information exempt from disclosure but which otherwise
fall outside of an exemption, restriction or limitation, the exempted
information shall be redacted and requested records shall otherwise be
disclosed. It should be understood that certain items cannot be disclosed, such
as social security numbers, birthdays, home addresses, victim information, the
Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA) information, information that may
be protected by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996
(HIPPA), including workers compensation claims, and other matters of personal
or private nature. If the requester feels some of the information requested may
fall under this category and there is a legitimate reason to have that
information in the public, the requester should specifically list that type of
information and why it is necessary to disclose. The town will not necessarily
disclose that they are exempting some of this information because disclosing
that they are exempting the information may in and of itself violate the
personal nature of the information.
   (I)   Commonly used exemptions. 
      (1)   Information of a personal nature where the public disclosure
thereof would constitute unreasonable invasion of personal privacy (S.C. Code §
30-4-40(2)).
      (2)   Records, video or audio recordings, or other information compiled
for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of
such law enforcement records or information:
         (a)   Would interfere with a prospective law enforcement proceeding;
         (b)   Would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an
impartial adjudication;
         (c)   Would constitute an unreasonable invasion of personal privacy;
         (d)   Would disclose the identity of a confidential source, including
a state, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which
furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or
information compiled by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a
criminal investigation, by an agency conducting a lawful security intelligence
investigation, or information furnished by a confidential source;
         (e)   Would disclose current techniques and procedures for law
enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose current
guidelines for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions if such
disclosure would risk circumvention of the law;
         (f)   Would endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;
and
         (g)   Would disclose any contents of intercepted wire, oral, or
electronic communications not otherwise disclosed during a trial (S.C. Code §
30-4-40(3)).
   (J)   Appeal process. If the requester feels certain items have been
improperly exempted from disclosure he or she should immediately email the Town
Attorney with a brief description of the disagreement with the disclosure, and
note with specificity the types of material the requester believes should be
disclosed and why. If the requester does not receive an acknowledgement of
receipt of the disagreement within 24 hours from the Town Attorney, the
requester should assume the FOIA request has not been properly submitted and
should make their request again. Within five business days the Town Attorney
shall reply to the disagreement and indicate whether they have additional
information that will be disclosed. If at any time the Town Administrator or
Town Attorney indicates there is no other material they will disclose, the
requester or the town can file for declaratory judgment or injunctive relief.
The Chief Administrative Judge is required to schedule an initial hearing on
the matter within ten days of service of all parties.
   (K)   Failure to comply. In addition to penalties available under FOIA,
willful disregard of, or violation of, this Policy by any employee or other
person who is subject to it, may constitute insubordination and be grounds for
disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
   (L)   Costs for processing FOIA requests. The Council, pursuant to Section
30-4-30 of FOIA, has established the fee schedule below in order to compensate
the town for the actual cost of searching for and making copies of requested
public records. Where it is anticipated that the staff time necessary to comply
with a request may exceed five hours, the requestor may be required to pay a
deposit of twenty-five percent of the estimated costs of complying with the
request before staff will begin searching for or making copies of the requested
records. Costs shall not be charged for time spent examining records to
determine whether they may be disclosed.
   (M)   Fee schedule. All fees for staff time and copies as necessitated by
this section shall be as listed in Ord. 18087, as it shall be amended from time
to time.

   (B)   The Manager shall consider such factors as the volume and strength of
discharge, rate of discharge, quantities of toxic materials in the discharge,
wastewater treatment facility removal capabilities, and cost effectiveness in
determining whether access and equipment for monitoring nondomestic wastewater
discharges shall be required.
   (C)   When the Manager determines that access and equipment for monitoring
or measuring nondomestic wastewater discharges are not practicable, reliable,
or cost effective, the Manager may specify alternative methods of determining
the characteristics of the wastewater's discharge that will, in the Manager's
judgment, provide an equitable measurement.

§ 51.172 DETERMINATION OF WASTEWATER CHARACTERISTICS.
   (A)   Measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater
to which reference is made in this chapter, shall be determined in accordance
with 40 CFR 136 methods approved by the Manager, and shall comply with state
and federal law. Sampling locations, times, durations, and frequencies shall be
determined on an individual basis, subject to approval by the Manager. The user
shall have the option to use, at the user's own expense, more completely
approved sampling methods, locations, times, durations, and frequencies than
specified by the Manager. Any additional results beyond those required by the
Commission are also to be reported to the Commission.
   (B)   Measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater
required by this chapter shall be performed by a qualified laboratory. When
such analyses are required of a user, the user shall make arrangements with a
qualified laboratory, which may include that of the user, to perform such
analyses.
   (C)   Monitoring of wastewater characteristics for any purpose shall be
conducted on a frequency deemed necessary by the Manager, unless more frequent
monitoring is required by authority other than this chapter.
   (D)   Upon demonstration by any person that the characteristics of the
wastewater discharged by that person are consistent, the Manager may reduce the
monitoring frequency as may be required by authority other than this chapter.
In no case shall the frequency of monitoring be less than semiannual for
determining compliance with federal, state, or Commission pretreatment
standards.
   (E)   In determining the discharge characteristics, factors such as
continuous, batch, or seasonal operation, as well as the information
requirements of other provisions in this chapter, shall be considered by the
Manager. The Manager may obtain wastewater samples as required to verify the
consistency of discharge characteristics.
   (F)   Fees for any given measurement, test, or analysis of wastewater
required by this chapter and performed by the Commission shall be the same for
all users, regardless of the quantity or quality of the discharge, and shall
reflect only direct cost. Costs of analyses performed by an independent
laboratory at the option of the user shall be borne directly by the user.
('81 Code, § 51.7.03) (Ord. passed 4-19-93; Am. Ord. 11011, passed 2-8-11)
§ 51.173 WASTEWATER WITH SPECIAL CHARACTERISTICS.
   (A)   The Commission shall prohibit the discharge of any wastewater that
could restrict beneficial reuse of the effluent and/or sludge. All dischargers
shall be required to implement a zero discharge treatment system (“closed
loop”) if necessary to protect the Commission's effluent and sludge for
beneficial reuse. New dischargers may be considered if their wastewater
characteristics are similar to existing sources.
   (B)   The Manager may rely on the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
to protect the wastewater system and receiving waters, as follows.
      (1)   No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, to the
wastewater system, wastewaters containing substances in excess of the quantity
prescribed by the applicable Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standard
promulgated by EPA, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. Compliance
with such applicable pretreatment standards shall be made within three years of
the date the standard is promulgated for existing systems. However, compliance
with a categorical pretreatment standard for new sources shall be required upon
connection to the wastewater system.
      (2)   Upon application by a nondomestic user, the Manager shall establish
limitations for substances specified in the applicable pretreatment standards
to require removal of the substances by the applicant's wastewater treatment
system. The discharge limit for specified substances shall, as a minimum, be
derived in accordance with federal law.
      (3)   Upon application by a nondomestic user, the Manager shall adjust
any limitation on substances specified in the applicable pretreatment standards
to consider factors relating to such users that are fundamentally different
from the factors considered by EPA during the development of the pretreatment
standard. Requests for and determinations of fundamentally different
adjustments shall be in accordance with federal law.
      (4)   Compliance.
         (a)   The Manager shall notify any nondomestic user affected by the
provisions of this section and establish an enforceable compliance schedule for
each.
         (b)   However, if any wastewater contains substances or
characteristics shown to have deleterious effect on the wastewater system,
receiving waters, effluent, or sludge reuse, or that constitute a public
nuisance or hazard if discharged or proposed for discharge to the wastewater
system, the Manager may:
            1.   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharges;
            2.   Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating
the wastewaters not covered by existing fees and charges;
            3.   Require pretreatment to a condition acceptable for discharge
to the wastewater system;
            4.   Require the development of compliance schedules to meet any
applicable pretreatment requirements;
            5.   Require the submission of reports necessary to ensure
compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements;
            6.   Carry out all inspection, surveillance, and monitoring
necessary to determine compliance with applicable pretreatment requirements;
            7.   Obtain remedies for noncompliance by any user. Such remedies
may include injunctive relief, the civil penalties specified in this chapter,
or appropriate criminal penalties; or
            8.   Reject the wastewater if evidence indicates the discharge will
create unreasonable hazards, have a deleterious effect on the wastewater system
or effluent and sludge reuse.
   (C)   When considering the above alternatives, the Manager shall ensure that
conditions of the Commission's NPDES permit are met. The Manager also shall
consider the cost effectiveness and the economic impact of the alternatives on
the discharger. If the Manager allows the pretreatment or equalization of
wastewater flows, the installation of necessary facilities shall be subject to
review by the Commission.
   (D)   Where pretreatment or flow-equalizing facilities are provided or
required for any wastewater, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operation at the owner's expense.
('81 Code, § 51.8.01) (Ord. passed 4-19-93; Am. Ord. 11011, passed 2-8-11)
§ 51.174 COMPLIANCE WITH PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Persons required to pretreat wastewater in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter shall provide a statement, to be reviewed by an
authorized representative of the user, and certified by a qualified person as
determined by the Commission. Such statement shall indicate whether applicable
pretreatment requirements are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
describe the additional operation and maintenance or additional pretreatment
needed for the user to meet the pretreatment requirements.
   (B)   If the user needs to provide additional pretreatment or operation and
maintenance improvements to meet the pretreatment requirements, the user shall
submit a plan (including schedules) to the Manager. The plan (including
schedules) shall be consistent with applicable conditions of the Commission's
requirements, NPDES permit or other local, state, or federal laws.

Ch. 153
§ 52.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   Mount Pleasant operates as a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) Phase II Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System (MS4) under the
South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (SCDHEC) General
Permit Number SCR030000.
   (B)   The NPDES permit allows the town to discharge stormwater to waters of
the state and U.S., provided that it is in compliance with the terms of the
permit to the maximum extent practical.
   (C)   The permit outlines tasks to be completed for compliance with the
terms and conditions of the federal NPDES program. The NPDES MS4 permit
requires a significant increase in the town's resource allocations for the
Stormwater Utility Management Program to be in compliance with requirements
related to water quality assessment and monitoring; system inventory,
inspection, and maintenance; legal requirements; illicit discharge detection
and elimination; post-development best management practice inspections; good
housekeeping and recording; public education; public participation; and
allocation of adequate resources to meet permit compliance.
   (D)   The management of stormwater runoff and sediment is necessary to
reduce pollution, siltation, sedimentation, local flooding and stream channel
erosion, all of which impact adversely on land and water resources and the
health, safety, property and welfare of the residents of the town.
   (E)   The town maintains a utility system of stormwater management
facilities, including but not limited to, inlets, conduits, manholes, channels,
ditches, drainage easements, infiltration facilities, and other components, as
well as natural waterways.
   (F)   The stormwater utility management facilities and components of the
town need to be regularly maintained, rehabilitated, upgraded or expanded, and
additional stormwater management facilities and measures need to be installed
throughout the town.
   (G)   There are chronic drainage problems in numerous areas the town which,
on an annual basis, threaten property, limit access to property, create
unpredictable driving conditions and present a negative image of the town's
ability to address community problems.
   (H)   There is current and continued growth which will impact the town's
stormwater utility system.
   (I)   There are limited resources (equipment, manpower, funds) in the town
to address stormwater utility system issues comprehensively and within a
defined time frame.
   (J)   There are natural and geographic conditions in the town which pose
significant constraints to problem resolutions.
   (K)   The town is a community comprised of citizens with a wide range of
incomes and ability to afford government services.
   (L)   In the town, current and anticipated growth will contribute to the
need for improvements in, and maintenance of, the stormwater management system.
   (M)   The town must continue to upgrade its capability to maintain existing
and future stormwater utility management facilities and measures.
   (N)   Every parcel of real property in the town either uses or benefits from
the stormwater utility management system; and the improvement of existing
facilities and construction of additional facilities in the system will
directly or indirectly benefit the owners of all real property.
   (O)   The extent of use of the stormwater utility management system by each
classification of real property is dependent on a variety of factors that
influence runoff, such as land use, topography, intensity of development,
amount of impervious surface, and location in a particular watershed or basin.
   (P)   Property owners shall finance the stormwater utility management system
in general relationship to their contribution and need for the system and to
the extent they benefit from the system, and charges therefor should bear a
reasonable relationship to the cost of the service, and every effort should be
made to fairly and equitably spread the cost of the system to all property
owners.
   (Q)   The town is utilizing a modified version of the intensity of
development method as detailed in this chapter and believes this decision to be
in the best interests of the community and environment.
   (R)   After careful review, a residential tiered stormwater utility fee
relative to dwelling unit size (square feet) is determined to be fair and
reasonable, and in the best interests of the community.
   (S)   That the stormwater utility fee reflects the on-going, increasing cost
of the stormwater utility management system and maintenance with reasonable
escalation over time.
   (T)   It is in the best interests of the citizens of this town and, most
specifically, the owners of real property, that a Stormwater Utility Management
Program be established by ordinance.

   (C)   Runoff coefficient assignments by classification. For the purpose of
equating non-residential property to residential property in the fee
computation, the ERU is used in conjunction with the total gross land area and
classifications of the properties. Since the ERU is used to relate a rate
charged for a typical residential property, this becomes the common denominator
by which all other non- residential property classifications of properties are
evaluated. To do this, the town utilizes accepted land use coefficients to
relate to the intensity of development and thereby creates ratios that can be
used for the fee computation. Pursuant to this chapter, for non-residential
property calculations, an ERU is considered to be a single-family lot less than
or equal to 20,000 square feet. The runoff coefficient assigned to the ERU is
0.36. The runoff coefficients assigned to the classifications are as follows:
      (1)   Single-Family Residential
         (All tiers)            0.36
      (2)   Agricultural Residential (AR)   0.36
      (3)   Light Industrial (LI)         0.73
      (4)   Neighborhood Commercial
         (NC)               0.77
      (5)   Office Professional (OP)      0.78
      (6)   Area-wide Business (AB),
         Marine District (MD),
         Mixed Use (MU) or Recreation   0.86
      (7)   Multifamily (MF)         0.56
   (D)   Computation methodology of Stormwater Utility Management Program fee
and example calculation.
      (1)   Computation of Stormwater Utility Management Program fee.
         (a)   Determine the ERU base rate for the year.
         (b)   Equate base range (0 - 0.5 ac) of commercial to the ERU.
         (c)   Assign area ranges for commercial zones.
         (d)   Calculate ratios for parcels > 0.5 ac based on area.
         (e)   Using the ratios calculated in division (d), multiply by base
rate to obtain the yearly fee.
      (2)   Example calculation. In order to find the fee for 2.75-acre
property in an AB zone in 2021:
         (a)   ERU = $60.90/year.
         (b)   Ratio of AB to ERU 0.86/0.36 = 2.39. Therefore, a parcel </
=20,000 square feet has a ratio of 2.39.
         (c)   The property (2.75 ac) falls within the assigned area of 2.10 -
5.00 acre.
         (d)   Multiply ratio by avgerage value for this range: 2.39/9.50 x
3.55 = 16.97.
         (e)   Compute fee based on ERU: 16.97 x 60.90 = $1,033.47/year.
   (E)   Stormwater Utility Management Program fee: assigned ratios based on
"C" factors and acreage.

   (F)   Annual fees. Annual fees for all property, whether occupied or vacant,
shall be as follows:
      (1)   Tier 1 Single-Family Residential property. Tier 1 Single-Family
Residential property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times three
quarters (0.75) of an equivalent residential unit (ERU), regardless of the size
of the parcel or the improvements.
      (2)   Tier 2 Single-Family Residential property. Tier 2 Single-Family
Residential property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times one
equivalent residential unit (ERU), regardless of the size of the parcel or the
improvements.
      (3)   Tier 3 Single-Family Residential property. Tier 3 Single-Family
Residential property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times one
and a half (1.50) equivalent residential units (ERU), regardless of the size of
the parcel or the improvements.
      (4)   Agricultural Residential property. Agricultural Residential
property shall be charged a fee equal to the base rate times one equivalent
residential unit (ERU), regardless of the size of the parcel or the
improvements.
      (5)   Commercial property. The intensity of development factor is greater
than a single-family unit because of the amount of impervious area. Pursuant to
generally accepted engineering data, the runoff coefficient or C-Factor for
commercial property has been determined to be as set forth below in divisions
(a) through (e). An equation is used to relate the runoff coefficient of the
multi-family property to a base ERU equal to a single-family lot less than or
equal to 20,000 square feet for calculation purposes. This equation is then
multiplied by the average acreage for the appropriate size range of the
property in question. The determined ratio is then multiplied by the base rate
to determine the yearly fee. Commercial condominiums that have been assigned a
tax map number by the county shall be billed at the base rate.
         (b)   Neighborhood Commercial      0.77
         (c)   Office Professional         0.78
         (d)   Areawide Business,
            Marine District,
            Mixed Use or Recreation      0.86
         (e)   Multifamily            0.56
      (6)   Undeveloped property. Undeveloped property shall be charged one-
half (0.5) of the ERU rate. Pursuant to generally accepted engineering data,
the runoff coefficient is approximately one-half of the runoff coefficient for
the ERU definition stated herein.
      (7)   Recreation facilities, parks, golf courses, and appurtenances
thereto. Recreation facilities, parks, and golf courses shall be charged one-
half (0.5) of the ERU rate for each individual tax parcel. Clubhouses, tennis
and pool facilities, and appurtenances thereto shall be billed at the
appropriate AB Rate as previously defined in this section under division (E).
   (G)   Minimum fee.
      (1)   All dwelling units within the town that have been assigned a tax
map number by the county shall be charged the base rate multiplied by the
appropriate ERU.
      (2)   All non-residential/commercial property within the town that has
been assigned an individual tax map number by the county shall be charged a
minimum fee based upon a parcel size of less than one-half (0.5) acre within
the applicable classification, or a fee based upon an actual calculation as
prescribed by this chapter, whichever is greater.

fully operable pedals and an electric motor of no more than 750 watts, or one
horsepower, and a top motor-powered speed of less than 20 miles an hour when
operated by a rider weighing 170 pounds on a paved level surface, that meet the
requirements of the Federal Consumer Product Code provided in 16 C.F.R., Part
1512, and that operate in a manner such that the electric motor disengages or
ceases to function when their brakes are applied or the rider stops pedaling.
Manufacturers  and distributors of electric-assist bicycles shall apply a label
that is affixed permanently, in a prominent location, to each electric-assist
bicycle, indicating its wattage and maximum electrically assisted speed. The
owner or user of an electric-assist bicycle shall not remove or tamper with the
label. If a user tampers with or modifies an electric-assist bicycle, changing
the speed capability, he must replace the label indicating the vehicle's
wattage or horsepower. Electric-assist bicycles and bicycles with helper motors
are not mopeds.
   MOPED. A cycle, defined as a motor vehicle, with or without pedals, to
permit propulsion by human power, that travels on not more than three wheels in
contact with the ground whether powered by gasoline, electricity, alternative
fuel, or a hybrid combination thereof. Based on the engine or fuel source, the
moped must be equipped not to exceed the following limitations: a motor of 50
cubic centimeters; or designed to have an input exceeding 750 watts and no more
than 1,500 watts. If an internal combustion engine is used, the moped must have

(Ord. 2005, passed 3-12-02)
§ 94.06 STANDARDS FOR ISSUANCE.
   (A)   The Town Administrator shall issue a permit when, from a consideration
of the application and from such other information as may otherwise be
obtained, he or she finds that:
      (1)   The conduct of the parade or public assembly will not require the
diversion of so great a number of town police officers to properly police the
line of movement, and the areas contiguous thereto, as to prevent normal police
protection of the town;
      (2)   The parade or public assembly is scheduled to move from its point
of origin to its point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable
delays en route;
      (3)   There are sufficient parking places near the beginning/ending of
the parade or public assembly to accommodate the number of vehicles reasonably
expected;
      (4)   Such parade or public assembly is not for the primary purpose of
advertising any product, goods or event that is primarily for private profit,
and the parade itself is not primarily for profit. The prohibition against
advertising any product, goods or event shall not apply to signs identifying
organizations or sponsors furnishing or sponsoring exhibits or structures used
in the parade;
      (5)   No parade or public assembly permit application for the same time
and location has already been granted or has been received and will be granted;
and
      (6)   No parade or public assembly permit application for the same time
but different location has already been granted, or has been received and will
be granted; in either case, the police resources required for that prior parade
or public assembly would be so great that, in combination with the subsequent
proposed application, the resulting deployment of police services would have an
immediate and adverse effect upon the welfare and safety of persons and
property.
   (B)   No permit shall be granted that allows for the erection or placement
of any structure, whether permanent or temporary, on a town street, sidewalk or
right-of-way, unless advance approval for its erection or placement has been
obtained from the Town Council.

§ 94.08 NOTICE OF DENIAL OF APPLICATION.
   The Town Administrator, or his or her designee, shall act promptly upon an
application for a parade or public assembly permit filed in a timely manner,

   (A)   Any applicant shall have the right to request reconsideration of a
denial of a parade or public assembly permit to the Town Administrator. Within
five days after receipt of the denial, the denied applicant shall make the
request by filing a written notice with the Town Administrator. The Town
Administrator shall promptly act upon the request within five days following
receipt of the notice of request.
   (B)   Any applicant shall have the right to appeal the denial of a parade or
public assembly permit to the Police, Judicial and Legal Committee. The denied

copy of the notice with the Town Clerk. The Police, Judicial and Legal
Committee shall act upon the appeal at its next scheduled meeting or within 30
days following receipt of the notice of appeal.
   (C)   In the event that the Police, Judicial and Legal Committee rejects an
appeal, the applicant may file an immediate request for prompt judicial review
with a court of competent jurisdiction. In the event of any such review, the
town shall file its response to the complaint or appeal motion within 20 days
of service of same, and will join with the applicant in an application to the

term of court.

CHAPTER 96: POLITICAL SIGNS
Section
   
96.01   Findings of fact
   
96.02   Political signs in public rights of way
§ 96.01 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   S.C. Code § 57-25-10 makes it unlawful for a person to display, place
or affix a sign within the rights-of-way of state highways.
   (B)   In recent years the number of political signs illegally placed within
the public rights-of-way prior to primary and general elections has increased
dramatically. Often those who place such signs in the rights-of-way do not
regularly maintain them in good conditions, or remove them promptly after an
election.
   (C)   Often the signs are placed in locations that block the vision of
motorists and pedestrians. They not only present a clear and present danger to
members of the public, but also impinge on public resources ant the time of
town employees who must remove signs when dangerous conditions exist.
   (D)   While the South Carolina Department of Traffic and Transportation
concedes it is unlawful to erect such signs, it has made the determination that
its resources are limited and the pressing nature of other maintenance
responsibilities dictate that it require removal of such signs only when they
constitute a danger to the traveling public.
   (E)   The existence of such signs create litter, create visibility polluting
blight, may be detrimental to a healthy tourism economy and are a nuisance.
(Ord. 99060, passed 1-11-00)
§ 96.02 POLITICAL SIGNS IN PUBLIC RIGHTS OF WAY.
   It shall be unlawful to place, or allow to be placed, a sign promoting a
political candidate or party within a state maintained street, highway or
right-of- way in the corporate limits of the town, or within any right-of-way
in the corporate limits of the town that is maintained by the town.

§ 110.03 PURPOSE AND DURATION.
   The business license levied by this chapter is for the purpose of providing
such regulation as may be required by the businesses subject thereto and for
the purpose of raising revenue for the general fund through a privilege tax.
Except as set forth below for business licenses issued to contractors with
respect to specific construction projects, each yearly license shall be issued
for the 12-month period of May 1 to April 30. A business license issued for a
construction contract may, at the request of the business, be stated to expire
at the completion of the construction project; provided, any such business
license may require that the business file, by each April 30 during the
continuation of the construction project, a statement of compliance, including
but not limited to a revised estimate of the value of the contract. If any
revised estimate of the final value of such project exceeds the amount for
which the business license was issued, the licensee shall be required to pay a
license fee at the then-prevailing rate on the excess amount. The provisions of
this chapter and the rates herein shall remain in effect from year to year as
amended by Town Council.
(Ord. 21064, passed 9-14-21)
§ 110.04 BUSINESS LICENSE TAX; REFUND.
   (A)   The required business license tax shall be paid for each business
subject hereto according to the applicable rate classification on or before the
due date of the 30th day of April in each year, except for those businesses in
Rate Class 8 for which a different due date is specified. Delinquent renewal
penalties will accrue after May 31 as detailed in §
110.12.
   (B)   A separate license shall be required for each place of business and
for each classification or business conducted at one place. If gross income
cannot be separated for classifications at one location, the business license
tax shall be computed on the combined gross income for the classification
requiring the highest rate. The business license tax must be computed based on
the business's gross income for the calendar year preceding the due date, for
the business's 12-month fiscal year preceding the due date, or on a 12-month
projected income based on the monthly average for a business in operation for
less than one year. The business license tax for a new business must be
computed on the estimated probable gross income for the balance of the license
year. A business license related to construction contract projects may be
issued on a per-project basis, at the option of the business. No refund shall
be made for a business that is discontinued.
   (C)   A business that submits a payment greater than the amount owed may
request a refund. To be considered, a refund request must be submitted in
writing to the town before the June 1 immediately following the April 30 on
which the payment was due and must be supported by adequate documentation
supporting the refund request. The town shall approve or deny the refund
request, and if approved shall issue the refund to the business within 30 days
after receipt of the request.

this chapter, whether listed in the classification index or not, shall register
the business and make application for a business license on or before the due
date of each year; provided, a new business shall be required to have a
business license prior to operation within the town.
   (B)   Application shall be on a form provided by the License Official, or

License Official. Applicants may be required to submit copies of portions of
state and federal income tax returns reflecting gross receipts and gross
revenue figures.

of business license taxes through the business license page of the town's
website, or through the tax portal hosted and managed by the South Carolina
Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office, subject to the availability and capability
thereof. Any limitations in portal availability or capability do not relieve
the applicant or licensee from existing business license or business license
tax obligations.

§ 110.06 DEDUCTIONS, EXEMPTIONS AND CHARITABLE ORGANIZATIONS.

for a governmental entity; or income which cannot be included for computation

business in interstate commerce shall be included in the calculation of gross
income and is not exempted. The applicant shall have the burden to establish
the right to exempt income by satisfactory records and proof.
   (B)   No person shall be exempt from the requirements of the chapter by
reason of the lack of an established place of business within the town, unless
exempted by state or federal law. The License Official shall determine the
appropriate classification for each business in accordance with the latest
issue of the NAICS. No person shall be exempt from this chapter by reason of
the payment of any other tax or fee, unless exempted by state law, and no
person shall be relieved of the liability for the payment of any other tax or
fee by reason of the application of this chapter.
   (C)   A charitable organization shall be exempt from the business license
tax on its gross income unless it is deemed a business subject to a business
license tax on all or part of its gross income as provided in this section. A
charitable organization, or any affiliate of a charitable organization, that
reports income from for-profit activities or unrelated business income for
federal income tax purposes to the Internal Revenue Service shall be deemed a
business subject to a business license tax on the part of its gross income from
such for-profit activities or unrelated business income.
   (D)   A charitable organization shall be deemed a business subject to a
business license tax on its total gross income if (1) any net proceeds of
operation, after necessary expenses of operation, inure to the benefit of any
individual or any entity that is not itself a charitable organization as
defined in this chapter; or (2) any net proceeds of operation, after necessary
expenses of operation, are used for a purpose other than a charitable purpose
as defined in this chapter. Excess benefits or compensation in any form beyond
fair market value to a sponsor, organizer, officer, director, trustee, or
person with ultimate control of the organization shall not be deemed a
necessary expense of operation.
   (E)   Real estate rental of less than three residential dwelling units or
portion thereof for 30 or more consecutive days and subdivision or development
for sale of less than three residential lots are not deemed to constitute doing
business and shall be exempt from business license taxes. Existing and
subsequently created plats and related documents will be considered.
   (F)   Businesses leasing commercial property to the same business entity may
exempt only those lease gross receipts from business license taxes. However, if
the business also leases commercial property to another business, then the
business is required to obtain a license based on the gross receipts received
from these other businesses.
   (G)   Sale of products of a farm or orchard actually produced by the seller
shall be exempt from business license taxes.
   (H)   Any existing business on a newly annexed property into the Town of
Mount Pleasant shall be exempt from license taxes hereunder for the license
year in which the property is annexed, in addition to the subsequent full
license year.
   (I)   Wholesalers are exempt from business license taxes unless they
maintain warehouses or distribution establishments within the town. A wholesale
transaction involves a sale to an individual who will resell the goods and

goods to the reseller. It does not include a sale of goods to a user or
consumer.
(Ord. 21064, passed 9-14-21)

business readily available for inspection by any authorized agent of the town.
   (B)   A change of address must be reported to the License Official within
ten days after removal of the business to a new location and the license will
be valid at the new address upon written notification of the License Official
and compliance with zoning and building codes. Failure to obtain the approval
of the License Official for a change of address shall invalidate the license
and subject the business to prosecution for doing business without a license.
   (C)   A business license may be transferable. In the event of a sale or
transfer of a business, the purchaser or new owner(s) may apply to the License
Official for a credit for taxes previously paid toward the new license taxes.
Upon determination by the License Official that the new business is the same as
the previously licensed business, and the seller and the purchaser agree to the
transfer, the License Official shall deduct from the taxes due a prorated
credit for license taxes paid. The applicant (purchaser) for such credit shall
pay an administrative tax of $50, notwithstanding such credits, such
application shall be made within the same license year of the transfer or sale.
   (D)   The transfer of any partial ownership shall be reported to the License
Official within the same license year. The administrative tax shall not be
applicable to a partial ownership transfer.

license tax and late penalties in addition to other penalties provided herein.

constitute a separate offense.

(Ord. 21064, passed 9-14-21)
§ 110.13 NOTICES.

   (D)   Any complaint received by the town concerning violations of this
chapter by the towing contractor, such as excess charges, poor business

claimant of possession. Charges related to town-owned or leased vehicles will
be forwarded monthly to the town for payment. The invoices which list these
charges to the town will identify the vehicle towed, the vehicle's town
identification number, the location from which towed, the applicable rates, and
the time and date of the service. No charge will be made for emergency minor
repair or service to a police or fire vehicle, such as tire changes, battery
boosts or similar service. When such emergency service is rendered to a police
or fire vehicle, the towing contractor will not lose his or her turn on the

such as that provided for herein to be imposed. The Council has determined that
imposition of the fee provided for herein is consistent with its longstanding
attempt to provide property tax relief to town residents. Accordingly, this
chapter is adopted under the authority and power granted the town under S.C.
Code § 5-7-10 et seq., Article VIII of the South Carolina Constitution and
other applicable laws for the purposes set forth herein.

§ 115.01 PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY.
   Town Council makes the following specific findings:
   (A)   Tourism is a major industry in the town , the growth and development
of which the town has encouraged and supported in order to enhance its economic
development and tax base and to provide a stable economy for its citizens. The
town has supported this major industry by budgeting town funds, the single
largest component of which is ad valorem property taxes, to meet costs
necessary to provide services and facilities that are required for the well
being, security, comfort and convenience of visitors.
   (B)   The cost of providing the special services and facilities required by
the tourism industry should be apportioned more equitably between the town's
taxpayers and those who visit the town and enjoy the special benefits the town
provides them. It is necessary for the promotion of the common interests of the
residents of the town, as well as those who are visitors to the town, to
provide a method for paying certain costs by a means other than the levy of ad
valorem property taxes.
   (C)   It is, and has been, the policy of Town Council to decrease the burden
of ad valorem property taxes on its citizens by assessing charges to those who
impact, but also enjoy the benefits of, town services and facilities. It is
only reasonable and appropriate that those who visit the town and who utilize
and are advantaged by town facilities and services contribute a portion of the
costs required to provide the same.
   (D)   (1)   Article VIII of the state constitution, which became effective
March 7, 1973, has been interpreted by the State Supreme Court for over 20
years. Commenting on why the voters of the state approved Home Rule, Justice
Littlejohn in Knight v. Salisbury, stated in 1974:
         These changes were prompted by the feeling that Columbia should not be
the seat of county government, and that the General Assembly should devote its
full attention to problems at the state level. It was against this background
that Article VIII was written. It is clearly intended that home rule be given
to the counties and that county government should function in the county seats
rather than at the State Capitol. If the counties are to remain units of
government, the power to function must exist at the county level. Quite
obviously, the framers of Article VIII had this in mind.
      (2)   This understanding of the voter's support for Home Rule has
dominated the court's reasoning in upholding, accommodations fees imposed by
Charleston County and Hilton Head and a hospitality fee imposed by the City of
Charleston. The State Supreme Court has consistently upheld the ability of
local government to impose fees specifically designed to meet the special needs
of such governments.
   (E)   Article VIII of the state constitution and S.C. § 5-7-30 authorize the
town to impose fees for certain municipal functions. This tax is enacted
pursuant to S.C. §§ 6-1-700 through 6-1-770.
   (F)   The Council has determined that the imposition of the tax provided for
herein is consistent with its longstanding attempt to provide property tax
relief to town residents.
(Ord. 01039, passed 7-10-01)
§ 115.02 MUNICIPAL HOSPITALITY TAX.
   A uniform tax equal to 2% is hereby imposed on the gross proceeds derived
from the sale of prepared meals, food, and beverages sold in establishments, or
sales of prepared meals, food and beverages sold in establishments licensed for
on-premises consumption of alcoholic beverages, beer or wine, and is imposed on
every person engaged in the business of furnishing food and beverage services,
whether dine in or take out, within the town. Further clarification of such
activities is demonstrated in Appendix A of this chapter. However, Appendix A
is not intended to be all inclusive. The local hospitality tax shall be imposed
on all food and beverages prepared or modified by restaurants, convenience
stores, fast food outlets, grocery stores, or other establishments within the
town.
(Ord. 01039, passed 7-10-01)
§ 115.03 PAYMENT OF MUNICIPAL HOSPITALITY TAX.
   The tax imposed by this chapter shall be collected from any patron when he
tenders payment for his meal, food, or beverage and shall be held in trust for
the benefit of the town until the same is paid to the county as herein after
provided. Every establishment subject to this hospitality tax shall, on the
date or within the time period hereinafter prescribed, make a return to the
county on forms provided by the office delineating gross proceeds of sales of
prepared meals, food, and beverages for the previous month, and the amount of
the tax due by virtue of this chapter. At the time the return is filed, the
full amount of any tax due hereunder shall be remitted. Taxes and required
reports shall be submitted to the county by the twentieth day of the month and
shall cover sales of the previous month. Any taxes not timely remitted shall be
subject to a penalty of 25%. The failure to collect from patrons shall not
relieve any establishment subject to this chapter from making the required
remittance.
(Ord. 01039, passed 7-10-01)
§ 115.04 ACCOUNT AND DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS.
   A special account is to be established, to be known as the hospitality tax
account, into which all monies remitted to the town under this chapter shall be
deposited. Any and all funds in the hospitality tax account, including any
interest as may accrue thereon, shall be used for the purposes as set forth in
S.C. § 6-1-730, as the same may from time to time be amended.
(Ord. 01039, passed 7-10-01)
§ 115.05 INSPECTIONS, AUDITS AND ADMINISTRATION.
   For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, the Business
License Official or other authorized agent of the town is empowered to enter
upon the premises of any person or entity subject to this chapter and to make
inspections, and examine and audit books and records. It shall be unlawful for
any person or entity to fail or refuse to make available the necessary books
and records during normal business hours upon 24 hours written notice. In the
event an audit reveals that false information has been filed by the remitter,
the cost of the audit shall be added to the correct amount of fees determined
to be due. The Business License Official may make systematic inspections of all
establishments within the town to ensure compliance with this chapter. Records
of inspections shall not be deemed public records. The Business License
Official shall administer the provisions of this chapter and make reasonable
regulations relating to its administration.

Committee. Appeals shall be governed by the requirements of the town’s business
license requirements.

§ 117.01 PURPOSE.
   The town Economic Development Strategy aims to sustain and strengthen the
economic vitality of the town by encouraging the location and/or expansion of
business and industrial enterprises that significantly add to the tax base,
provide high-paying and quality jobs, stimulate new economic development or
redevelopment in the town, and are sensitive to and compatible with town
development strategy.
(Ord. 11018, passed 4-12-11; Am. Ord. 22048, passed 8-12-22)
§ 117.02 FINDINGS.
   In furtherance of the stated purpose, Town Council finds and declares the
following:
   (A)   A vigorous and diverse tax base is essential to sustain a meaningful
quality of life as a healthy economy not only enhances the tax base, but also
increases employment opportunities and housing choices within the town. With
this in mind, the town works to create a sustainable local economy that
encourages economic vitality, promotes fiscal integrity, and increases the
local standard of living while preserving and enhancing the quality of life in
Mount Pleasant.
   (B)   Businesses that derive a significant portion of revenues from areas
outside of our region, by their nature, are of particular value to the town
because such businesses typically require significant capital investment,
provide a substantial number of quality, high-paying jobs, provide the
opportunity for new economic development or redevelopment by increasing the
customer base for existing businesses, and have minimal impacts on the
environment or services of the town. Consequently, the location of such
businesses in the town, and any subsequent expansion of them, should be
encouraged.
   (C)   It is in the best interests of the town to create an Economic
Development Incentives Program in furtherance of the public welfare, to enhance
the vitality and diversity of the economy of the town, to assist in the
implementation of the town's Economic Development Strategic Plan, and to
encourage the location and/or expansion of business and industrial enterprises
that bring substantial private investment, quality jobs and the potential for a
spin-off effect to stimulate existing business and the development of new
businesses. The town is specifically interested in businesses that are located
within the Key Development Zones (Patriots Point, Wando Welch/Long Point Road,
Johnnie Dodds Boulevard, and Carolina Park) and align with the Target Clusters
identified in the Economic Development Strategic Plan: Information Technology &
Services, Life Sciences, Architecture & Engineering, Marketing, Design &
Publishing, and Financial Investments.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 136.55 NOTICE TO CLEAR LITTER FROM PRIVATE PROPERTY.
   The Chief of Police is authorized and empowered to notify the owner of any
open or vacant private property within the town or the agent of such owner to
properly dispose of litter located on such owner's property which is dangerous
to public health, safety, or welfare. Such notice shall be addressed by
registered mail, addressed to the owner at his or her last known address.
('81 Code, § 94A.21(A)) (Ord. passed 7-12-88)
§ 136.56 NONCOMPLIANCE; REMOVAL PROCEDURES.
   Upon failure, neglect, or refusal of any owner or agent so notified, to
properly dispose of litter dangerous to the public health, safety or welfare
within 14 days after receipt of written notice provided for in §
136.55 above, or within 14 days after the date of such notice in the event the
same is returned to Chief of Police because of the inability to make delivery
thereof, provided the same was properly addressed to the last known address of
such owner or agent, the Chief of Police is authorized and empowered to pay for
the disposing of such litter or to order its disposal by the town.
('81 Code, § 94A.21(B)) (Ord. passed 7-12-88)
§ 136.57 OWNER CHARGED FOR REMOVAL.
   When the town has effected the removal of such dangerous litter or has paid
for its removal, the actual cost thereof, plus accrued interest at the rate of
6% per annum from the date of the completion of the work, if not paid by the
owner prior thereto, shall be charged to the owner, shall constitute a lien
against the owner's property, and shall be enforced in accordance with §
136.58.
('81 Code, § 94A.21(C)) (Ord. passed 7-12-88; Am. Ord. 23016, passed 5-9-23)

   Where the full amount due the town is not paid by such owner within 30 days
after the disposal of such litter, as provided for in §§
136.55 and
136.56 above, then, and in that case, the Chief of Police shall cause to be
recorded in the Clerk of Court's Office for the county a sworn statement
showing the cost and expense incurred for the work, the date the work was done,
and the location of the property on which the work was done. The recordation of
such sworn statement shall constitute a lien and privilege on the property, and
shall remain in full force and effect for the amount due in principal and
interest, plus costs of court, if any, for collection, until final payment has
been made. The costs and expenses shall be collected in the manner fixed by law
for the collection of taxes and, further, shall be subjected to a delinquent
penalty of 5% in the event same is not paid in full on or before the date of
the tax bill upon which the charges appears become delinquent. Sworn statements
recorded in accordance with the provisions hereof shall be prima facie evidence
that all legal formalities have been complied with and that the work was done
properly and satisfactorily, and shall be full notice to every person concerned
that the amount of the statement, plus interest, constitutes a charge against
the property designated or described in the statement and that the same is due
and collectible by law.
('81 Code, § 94A.21(D)) (Ord. passed 7-12-88)
§ 136.99 PENALTY.

deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be fined in
an amount not exceeding $500, or imprisoned in the county jail for a period not
exceeding 30 days, or both fined and imprisoned. However, no penalty shall
exceed the penalty provided by state law for similar offenses. Each day such
violation is committed or permitted to continue shall constitute a separate
offense and shall be punishable as such hereunder.
   (B)   If a person violates this chapter with the intent to intimidate or
threaten an owner, resident, or invitee of such property because of the actual
or perceived race, color, creed, religion, ancestry, gender, sexual
orientation, gender identity, physical or mental disability, or national origin
of any person and such litter or handbill contains a credible threat, the
person shall be guilty of a separate misdemeanor offense and, upon conviction
thereof, shall be fined in an amount not exceeding $500 or imprisonment for a
period of not more than 30 days, or both. For the purposes of this section,
CREDIBLE THREAT means a verbal or nonverbal threat that places the person who
is the target of the threat in reasonable fear for his or her safety or the
safety of his or her family members or individuals closely associated with the
person, and which is made with the apparent ability to carry out the threat to
cause such harm. It is not necessary to prove that the person making the threat
had the intent to actually carry out the threat.

137.99   Penalty
§ 137.01 FINDINGS.
   The Town Council makes the following findings:
   (A)   A number of motorists in the town are driving into business
establishments with gasoline and/or diesel fuel pumps, filling their vehicles
and/or containers with gasoline or diesel fuel, and thereafter immediately
driving off without paying for same.
   (B)   For the year 2002, town crime statistics evidence approximately 155
larcenies as a result of gas/diesel fuel drive offs without paying.
   (C)   The stated level of crime results in significant man-hours/time
extended by Town Police Officers, along with the administrative backup
associated therewith.
   (D)   The stated man-hours/time by the town's Police Department detracts
from proactive policing opportunities in regard to other community matters and
more serious crimes.
   (E)   The stated level of crime adversely impacts the town's uniform crime
reporting statistics, along with the negative fallout therefrom.
   (F)   The stated level of crime results in significant costs to, and monies
being paid by, the town and its citizens/taxpayers.
   (G)   The stated level of crime with gas/diesel fuel drive offs without
paying seriously and significantly adversely impacts the revenues of local
business owners who own and operate business establishments involving the sale
of gasoline and/or diesel fuel.
   (H)   The stated matters are of serious concern and should now be addressed
and eliminated, if possible.
   (I)   This type of crime with its many adverse impacts can be addressed and,
in fact, eliminated through the adoption of a zero tolerance policy.
   (J)   A zero tolerance policy in regard to this problem could be
accomplished through the adoption of a payment in advance requirement for
gasoline and diesel fuel sold throughout the town.
   (K)   Such a zero tolerance policy is imperative and in the best interests
of the town and its citizens and, as such, the same is adopted along with this
chapter.

138.99   Penalty
§ 138.01 FINDINGS.
   Town Council makes the following findings relative to the adoption of this
chapter:
   (A)   The town is an incorporated municipality, and as such, possesses all
powers granted to municipalities by the Constitution and the laws of the State
of South Carolina, including the powers enumerated in S.C. Code § 5-7-30
relating to regulating streets, markets, and public health; and
   (B)   Numerous studies have found that tobacco smoke is a major contributor
to indoor air pollution, and that breathing secondhand smoke (also known as
environmental tobacco smoke) is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers,
including heart disease, stroke, respiratory disease, and lung cancer.
      (1)   The National Cancer Institute has determined that secondhand smoke
is responsible for the early deaths of up to 65,000 Americans annually.
      (2)   The Surgeon General has declared that:
         (a)   Secondhand smoke causes disease and premature death in
nonsmokers exposed to smoke;
         (b)   Children exposed to secondhand smoke have an increased risk for
sudden death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems, and more
severe asthma;
         (c)   Adults exposed to secondhand smoke have a higher risk of
coronary heart disease and lung cancer;
         (d)   There is no safe level of exposure to secondhand smoke; and
         (e)   Separating smoking and nonsmoking sections of indoor areas does
not sufficiently remove the threats of secondhand smoke in enclosed areas; and
   (C)   A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the
workplace. Studies have shown that employees who work in smoke-filled
businesses suffer a 25-50% higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of
death from cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as increased acute
respiratory disease and measurable decrease in lung function; and
   (D)   Studies have also shown that smoke-filled workplaces result in higher
worker absenteeism due to respiratory disease, lower productivity, higher
cleaning and maintenance costs, increased health insurance rates, and increased
liability claims for diseases related to exposure to secondhand smoke; and
   (E)   There are laws, ordinances and regulations in place that protect
workers from other environmental hazards, including Class A carcinogens,
asbestos, arsenic and benzene, but none which regulate exposure to
environmental tobacco smoke; and
   (F)   Prohibiting smoking in the workplace increases public awareness of the
negative health effects of smoking, reduces the social acceptability of
smoking, and reduces harm to children and other nonsmokers; and
   (G)   The South Carolina General Assembly, in S.C. Code §§ 44-95-10 et seq.
(the “Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990"), imposed certain limitations on smoking.
      (1)   For example, it limited smoking in government buildings (the
definition of which includes city-owned buildings), except where the owner of
such building shall designate smoking areas.
      (2)   Town Council has now determined that additional regulation of
smoking in areas beyond those addressed in the Clean Indoor Air Act of 1990 is
appropriate, in furtherance of its duty to protect the health of its citizens
and employees in the workplace, and therefore enacts this chapter.
(Ord. 07007, passed 6-12-07)
§ 138.02 INTENT.
   Town Council finds that it is in the best interest of the people of this
town to protect nonsmokers from involuntary exposure to environmental tobacco
smoke in the workplace. Therefore, Town Council declares that the purpose of
this act is to preserve and improve the health, comfort and environment of the
people of this town by limiting exposure to tobacco smoke in the workplace.

§ 150.002 FEE SCHEDULES.
   Building valuation and fees.
   (A)   Valuation for new construction. Building valuation for new
construction will be determined by the Building Official, based on the most
current Building Valuation Tables, as published by International Code Council
(ICC) or contract amount, whichever is higher. Upon determination of valuation,
the Building Official will set the amount of the permit fee pursuant to the
latest Department of Engineering and Development Services fee schedule. All
building permits are value-based permits.
   (B)   Where valuation (material and labor) does not exceed $1,000. No permit
is required, unless an inspection is required.
   (C)   Work started without permit. Where work for which a permit is required
by the code is started or proceeded with prior to obtaining the permit, per the
latest Department of Engineering and Development Services fee schedule, but the
payment shall not relieve any persons from fully complying with the
requirements of the code in the execution of the work, nor from any other
penalties prescribed herein.
   (D)   Plan review fee.
      (1)   As determined by the Building Official, when the valuation of the
proposed construction exceeds $1,000 and a structural review is required, a
plan review fee shall be paid to the Building Official before a review will be
started, except as otherwise provided herein. The plan review fee shall be per
the latest Department of Engineering and Development Services fee schedule. The
fee shall be paid at the time of plan submittal for review. This fee is non-
refundable if the plan review has started.
      (2)   In the event that a third-party review has been approved by the
Building Official in accordance with internal policy, the plan review fee shall
be reduced to 10% of the fee calculated as described above. As determined by
the Building Official, the plan review fee may be applied to re-submittals and
revisions to previously reviewed plans.
      (3)   The initial review and one minor re-review (as determined by the
reviewer) is included. If a full re-submission or substantial changes have been
made, there may be additional charges each time after per the latest fee
schedule.
   (E)   Fees are not refundable unless an error from a town employee.

§ 150.003 CONSTRUCTION BOARD OF ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Appointment. There is established in the town a board to be called the
Board of Adjustments and Appeals, which shall consist of five members. Such
Board shall be composed of one architect, one general contractor or engineer,
and three members at large from the building industry. This Board shall be
appointed by Town Council.
   (B)   Term of office. The term of office for all seats on the Board shall be
four years. All terms hereunder shall, however, continue until a successor is
appointed by the Mayor and approved by Town Council. The Mayor and Council
shall act promptly after the expiration of a term to make appointments as soon
as may reasonably be accomplished. Board members may be appointed to succeed
themselves, for a maximum total of two successive full terms. Any service on
the Board prior to this amendment shall be included in determining eligibility
for future service. None of the members shall hold any other public office or
position in the municipality or county while serving on this Board.
   (C)   Vacancy and removal. A vacancy in a term of office shall occur
whenever it is found that a member has resigned or is unable to serve for
whatever reason, or is removed in accordance with the provisions of this
section. Neglect of duty, no longer being a resident of the town, or misconduct
in office shall constitute just cause. Each member is required to attend 75% of
called meetings per year on a rolling-year basis which shall be measured on the
first of every month for the preceding year. Each member shall be afforded one
excused absence which shall not be counted towards the attendance requirement.
Excused and unexcused absences are to be determined by the Chairperson or, in
his or her absence, the acting Chairperson, and are to be stated on the record
at each meeting. Excused absences are generally defined as medical or family
emergencies or unavoidable business or personal conflicts. Each member is
responsible for notifying the Chairperson or the appropriate staff at least two
full working days prior to the meeting, if he or she will not be in attendance.
The member shall also state a reason for the anticipated absence. Emergency
situations that arise within this 48-hour period can be considered excused by
the Chairperson. If removal due to attendance is necessary, the Town
Administrator shall then remove that member from the Board prior to the next
scheduled meeting and notify Town Council. If removal for cause appears
imminent, the Chairperson shall contact the member and ascertain whether
removal should be considered by the Mayor and Town Council. The Chairperson
shall then make a recommendation to Council, prior to Council action on the
matter. Any vacancy in the membership shall be filled for the unexpired term as
soon as may reasonably be accomplished by the Mayor and Town Council in the
same manner as the initial appointment. Service pursuant to an appointment in
this regard shall constitute one full term.
   (D)   Organization. The Board shall elect by secret ballot and majority vote
a Chairperson and Vice-Chairperson from among its members at the January
meeting of each year. The term of office of the Chairperson and Vice-
Chairperson shall be one year. If a vacancy occurs in an office prior to the
expiration of the full term, another election to fill the remainder of the term
of office shall be conducted at the first meeting thereafter. The election
procedures stated hereinabove shall be followed in filling an unexpired term of
office. The Board shall appoint a secretary who may be an officer or employee
of the governing authority. The Board shall adopt rules for the transaction of
business.
   (E)   Meetings and quorum. Three members of the Board shall constitute a
quorum for conducting business. Meetings of the Board shall be held at the call
of the Chairperson and at such other times as the Board may determine. The
Chairperson or, in his or her absence, the acting Chairperson, may administer
oaths and compel the attendance of witnesses by subpoena. Decisions shall be
made by a majority vote, but no fewer than three affirmative votes shall be
required to modify a decision of the Building Official or to vary any provision
of the adopted technical building, fire, or flood codes. The Board shall keep
minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon each question,
or if absent or failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records
of its examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be
immediately filed in the office of the Board, or if there is no such office, in
an appointed office of the town. The minutes and records shall be a public
record. All meetings of the Board shall be open to the public and members of
the Board shall regularly attend meetings and public hearings of the Board and
shall serve without compensation, except for reimbursement for authorized
expenses attendant to the performance of their duties.
   (F)   Duties and powers. To hear and decide appeals of decisions and
interpretations of the Building Official and to consider variances of the
technical building, fire, or flood codes.

SINGLE-FAMILY STORMWATER
MANAGEMENT AND TREE PRESERVATION PROGRAM
§ 150.025 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   Contractors and residents who plan to proceed with clearing and grading
activities that disturb or alter land on a single-family parcel must have a
stormwater management and tree preservation permit prior to the release of any
building permit. Such permit will be issued only after a suitable plan is
approved and installed in accordance with such plan.
(Ord. 18103, passed 1-8-19)
150.026 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The intent of this permit is to minimize tree and stormwater impacts
due to construction on single-family lots. These requirements ensure the
protection of neighboring properties from unmanaged stormwater and construction
site sediment while minimizing impacts to existing trees and buffers.
   (B)   It shall be the responsibility of each property owner to undertake
land development activity in a way that does not diffuse or cast concentrated
runoff in a direction that will cause adverse impacts onto lower elevated
property and to alter land in such a way that will not displace, deflect,
obstruct or impede stormwater from higher elevated property.
   (C)   The owner or representative shall use good construction methods by
implementing all means necessary to remain in compliance. The town review
procedure is not to be used for design purposes, but to ensure the applicant is
fully aware of their responsibility to make use of proper stormwater management
techniques and the latest best management practices prior to undertaking land
development activity. However, additional improvements may be required
throughout the implementation process if deemed necessary following field
inspection.
(Ord. 18103, passed 1-8-19)
150.027 ADMINISTRATION.
    The Engineering and Development Services shall administer this subchapter
through plan reviews and enforcement of standards that are practical and
reasonable for achieving the objectives of the town. It shall not be
administered in such a way to hinder or infringe on the development property
rights of citizens, but to ensure site improvements proceed in a manner that
protects surrounding property from flood damage and prevents the unnecessary
removal of buffers and trees. Therefore, this subchapter allows each property
owner the ability to responsibly remove trees, alter land, and expand
development on their property while effectively managing all stormwater runoff
discharging from the project boundaries. The applicant shall demonstrate
compliance by submission of a stormwater management plan and tree survey
depicting existing and proposed site improvements. It shall conform to the
natural water course of the surrounding area or with the proposed final grades
of the larger common plan for the subdivision, if applicable. Issuance of a
site improvement permit does not constitute a building permit, nor does it
authorize vertical construction. It shall only authorize stormwater related
site improvements. The permit may be administered independently or concurrently
with a building permit submittal.
(Ord. 18103, passed 1-8-19; Am. Ord. 21037, passed 5-11-21)
§ 150.028 STANDARDS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful to undertake activity resulting in discharge
flowrates that exceed the capacity of the receiving drainage system, or to
impede the natural flow traversing the land to where the action causes water
levels to increase on property.
   (B)   A site improvement permit is required before land clearing or land
disturbance on any residential property. Authorization of this permit shall
confirm the applicant’s plan is in compliance with the minimum standards and is
authorized to commence proposed site improvements.
   (C)   All work shall comply with the applicable ordinance regulation in
Chapter
155 and
156 as it relates to the following:
      (1)   Tree protection zones and buffers shall be protected from grading
or clearing activity, other than hand-clearing.
      (2)   Site improvements plans shall be legible and clearly demonstrate
the applicant has used good judgment and is proposing adequate provisions to
implement safeguards to avoid negatively impacting surrounding property.
      (3)   Erosion control devices and existing storm drainage infrastructure
shall be routinely inspected by the applicant to ensure it remains in proper
working order.
      (4)   As-built surveys may be required when deemed necessary by the Town
Plans Examiner. In such cases, final grade elevations are to be provided for
swales, embankments, dry ponds, pipes, surface improvements such as driveways,
and fill.
   (D)   Buffers encroachments shall be pre-approved by Zoning Administrator or
his or her designee.
   (E)   Building permits shall not be released until an acceptable site
inspection has been completed by the Land Development Code Inspector.
   (F)   Site improvement permits shall remain valid for 24 months from the
date of approval. Approval date is the date the final field inspection is
completed and approved.
   (G)   Any work-related activity undertaken by a licensed contractor must be
permitted under this subchapter.
   (H)   The permit application found online at the official town website must
be properly completed and submitted.
   (I)   A copy of the site improvement permit is to be placed on-site and
easily retrieved by an inspector at all times.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the state has in statute 1976 S.C. Code, Title 6, Chapter
7 delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizenry. Therefore, the town does ordain this chapter.
('81 Code, § 152.01 a.) (Ord. passed 3-5-84; Am. Ord. passed 9-13-88; Am. Ord.
passed 6-11-91; Am. Ord. 5-19-92)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the town are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the
occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to
other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
('81 Code, § 152.01 b.) (Ord. passed 3-5-84; Am. Ord. passed 9-13-88; Am. Ord.
passed 6-11-91; Am. Ord. 5-19-92)
§ 152.03 PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designated to:
      (1)   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
      (4)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase erosion or flood damage; and
      (5)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
   (B)   Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)   To protect human life and health;
      (2)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains; electric, telephone, and sewer lines; and streets and bridges
located in floodplains;
      (6)   To help maintain a stable tax base providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
      (7)   To insure that potential home buyers are notified that property is
in a flood area.
('81 Code, § 152.01 c., d.) (Ord. passed 3-5-84; Am. Ord. passed 9-13-88; Am.
Ord. passed 6-11-91; Am. Ord. 5-19-92)

   LIMIT OF MODERATE WAVE ACTION (LiMWA). The line shown on Flood Insurance
Rate Maps to indicate the inland limit of the area expected to receive one and
one-half foot or greater breaking waves during a 1% annual chance flood event.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage, which is limited to that which is
incidental and accessory to the principal use of the primary structure, and can
withstand exposure to the elements with a low flood damage potential. Limited
storage areas shall not be temperature controlled.
   LOWEST ADJACENT GRADE. Elevation of the lowest ground surface that touches
any of the exterior walls of a building.
   LOWEST FLOOR. The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided that such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of other
provisions of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A building, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term also
includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable structures
placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved
property.
   MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
   MEAN SEA LEVEL. The average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It
is used as a reference for establishing various elevations within the
floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the term is  synonymous with National
Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) and when reference is made to MEAN SEA LEVEL it
shall mean the NGVD.
   NATIONAL GEODETIC VERTICAL DATUM (NGVD). The geodetic datum derived by the
US Coast and Geodetic Survey (USCGS), which is now named the National Ocean
Service (NOS), from an adjustment of the first order level nets of both the
United States and Canada. Because sea levels have been rising in varying
amounts with respect to location and time since 1929, the mean tide level and
local mean sea level are now higher than the NGVD by varying amounts and
conversions are necessary to correct for these differences.
   NEW CONSTRUCTION. Any structure for which the “start of construction”
commenced after April 2, 1971. The term also includes any subsequent
improvements to such structure.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK or SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
   NON-COMPLIANT BUILDING. An existing building or structure that is not in
compliance with the provisions of this chapter.
   NORTH AMERICAN VERTICAL DATUM (NAVD) OF 1988. Vertical control, as corrected
in 1988, used as the reference datum on Flood Insurance Rate Maps.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as a
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. Flood related damages sustained by a structure on two
separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the
time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25% of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SECTION 1316 OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968. The act provides
that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local
authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. (For other than “new construction” or “substantial
improvements” under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (PL 97-348)) includes
“substantial improvement”, and means the date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION, repair, reconstruction, or
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the
first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a
manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings,
installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of
excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or
the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the
property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main building. For a “substantial
improvement”, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of
any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a
manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank, or other man-made facilities
or infrastructures.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition  would
equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any combination of repairs, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition or other improvement to a structure taking place
during a period of five years, the cumulative cost of which equals or exceeds
50% of the fair market value of the structure, either before the "start of
construction" of the improvement, or if the structure has been damaged or is
being restored, before the damage occurred. This term includes structures that
have incurred "repetitive loss" or "substantial damage", regardless of the
actual work performed. Where more than one improvement is made over a five-year
period, which begins at permit issuance date, the percentage value (that is,
the value of the improvement expressed as a percentage of the value of the
structure immediately before the improvement) of the most recent improvement
shall be added to the percentage value of all other improvements made within
five years of the current improvement. If the cumulative percentage during the
five-year period equals or exceeds a total of 50%, then it shall be classified
as a SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
   SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARKS or SUBDIVISIONS. The
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities
and pads equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the streets, utilities and pads
before repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
   VIOLATION.  The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's flood plain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in 44 CFR 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4),  (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(4) or (e)(5) is presumed to be in VIOLATION until such time
as that documentation is provided.

      (3)   All LOMRs that are issued by FEMA in Special Flood Hazard Areas
identified by this section are hereby adopted.
   (B)   (1)   Special stormwater management areas. A special stormwater
management area is a designated drainage service area not meeting or exceeding
acceptable levels of service, as such, special stormwater management standards
shall apply in order to provide the highest level of protection to safeguard
residents from unmanaged runoff. It is an area where the current hydrology and
hydraulics have been studied and the culminative expansion of impervious
service, land alternating activity, and natural changes in the environment have
exceeded the capacity limitations of the existing infrastructure. As a result,
the quality of life for residents within this area is at risk. Therefore, land
development standards specific to this area shall serve the public by
protecting property from high water levels to the maximum extent possible.

permanent/fixed generator equipment, and other service facilities (including
ductwork) shall not be located below the design flood elevation in new
construction and substantial improvement construction, except for essential
lighting and power circuits. This requirement does not preclude the
installation of electric vehicle (EV) chargers, service disconnects, pool
equipment filters and pumps, or outdoor faucets for hoses, shower heads and
sinks; provided disconnect and/or back-flow devices are installed to prevent
contamination to the water supply system, and no connection is made to the
sanitary waste collection system and that are designed and/or located so as to
prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding and anchored to prevent flotation;
   (F)   New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system;
   (G)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into floodwaters. On-site waste disposal systems
shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or contamination
from them during flooding;
   (H)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a building
in compliance with the provisions of this section, shall meet the requirements
of new construction as contained in this chapter; and
   (I)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a building
not in compliance with the provisions of this chapter, shall be undertaken only
if the nonconformity is not furthered, extended or replaced, if classified as a
substantial improvement;
   (J)   Notwithstanding substantial improvement or substantial damage
construction, the minimum elevation of the lowest floor of an improvement or
addition to a non-compliant building shall not be less than the Base Flood
Elevation of the effective FEMA maps plus the town’s freeboard of the existing
building; and all new materials installed below the design flood elevation
shall be flood-resistant;
   (K)   New or replacement electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment installed in non-compliant buildings, where substantial
improvement or damage is not a factor, shall be elevated to at least the
existing lowest floor level; and ductwork installed below the design flood
elevation shall be designed so as to prevent water from entering or
accumulating within during conditions of flooding;
   (L)   Sanitary landfills are prohibited;
   (M)   New critical facilities are prohibited from the 500-year floodplain.
This includes those areas designated as VE, AE, and X (shaded) on the
applicable FIRM.
   (N)   Elevators shall be installed in accordance with FEMA Technical
Bulletin 4-93, “Elevator Installation for Buildings Located in Special Flood
Hazard Areas”, which is incorporated herein by reference, specifically

   (O)   Review all permit applications to determine whether proposed building
sites will be reasonably safe from flooding.
   (P)   All gas or liquid storage tanks, either located above ground or
buried, shall be anchored to prevent flotation and lateral movement resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (Q)   In order to address increasing flood levels, flood hazards, and the
associated damage caused by importation of fill, the following shall apply
within the town's 100-year regulatory floodplain, as depicted in the current
effective adopted Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and effective Letter of Map
Revisions (LOMR):
      (1)   Beginning July 1, 2024 (the "Effective Date"), the permitting of
certain foundation types shall be prohibited for all new foundations for single
family dwellings, including attached single-family dwellings. The provisions of
this section do not apply to garages, additions, conversions, substantially
improved, substantially damaged, or nonresidential structures.
      (2)   The most current version of Appendix B to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency's National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) Flood Insurance
Manual dated October 2022 (the "Appendix") is hereby incorporated by reference
and shall govern acceptable foundation types with the following foundations
prohibited:
         (a)   The foundations depicted in Diagrams 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B, 3 and 4 of
the Appendix for new detached single-family dwellings; and

§ 152.25 [RESERVED].
§ 152.26 COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREAS (VE ZONES) AND COASTAL A ZONES.
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in §
152.06 are areas designated as coastal high hazard areas and Coastal A Zones.
These areas have special flood hazards associated with wave wash; therefore,
the following provisions apply:
   (A)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be located
landward of the reach of the mean high tide first line of stable natural
vegetation and comply with all applicable Department of Health and
Environmental Control (DHEC) Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM)
setback requirements;
   (B)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated by
piers, piles or other open foundation systems so that the bottom of the lowest
supporting horizontal member (including pilings or columns) is located no lower
than the design flood elevation;
   (C)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored on
pilings or columns;
   (D)   All pilings and columns and the attached structures shall be anchored
to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement, due to the effect of wind
and water loads acting simultaneously on the building components. The anchoring
and support system shall be designed with wind and water loading values that
equal or exceed the 100-year mean recurrence interval (1% annual chance flood)
and the current edition of the International Building Code or International
Residential Code as adopted by the State of South Carolina..
   (E)   There shall be no fill used as structural support. Non-compacted fill
may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping/aesthetic
purposes; provided the fill will wash out from storm surge, thereby rendering
the building free of obstruction prior to generating excessive loading forces,
ramping effects, or wave deflection. The Building Official shall approve design
plans for landscaping/aesthetic fill, only after the applicant has provided an
analysis by an engineer, architect and/or soil scientist, which demonstrates
that the following factors have been fully considered:
      (1)   Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for
excessive natural compaction;
      (2)   Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave deflection to
adjacent properties; and
      (3)   Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping;
   (F)   There shall be no alteration of sand dunes or vegetation that would
increase the potential flood damage;
   (G)   The space below the lowest floor shall be either free of obstruction
or constructed with non-supporting, breakaway, open latticework, open privacy
slats or shutters, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and
water loads, without causing collapse, displacement or other structural damage
to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. If
used, the open latticework or open privacy slats or shutters (“open breakaway
panels”) must be made of wood or plastic no thicker than one inch (nominal),
and at least 40% of the area of the panels formed with these materials must be
open. The panels must completely span the areas between piers or other vertical
structural supports, in accordance with division (H) below, and meet the
following design specifications:
      (1)   Design safe loading resistance of each wall shall be not less than
ten nor more than 20 pounds per square foot; or
      (2)   If more than 20 pounds per square foot, a registered professional
engineer or architect shall certify that the design wall collapse would result
from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood event,
and the elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system wall
not be subject to collapse, displacement or other structural damage, due to the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components during the base flood event. Maximum wind and water loading values
to be used in this determination shall each have 1% chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year (100-year mean recurrence interval).
   (H)   If open breakaway panels are utilized, such enclosed space shall not
be designed to be usable for human habitation, but shall be designed to be
usable only for parking of vehicles, building access, or limited storage. The
open breakaway panels may be used only around the perimeter of the space below
the elevated structure. Interior partitions or enclosures are prohibited, with
the exception of elevator shaft enclosure walls as provided in division (I)
below;
   (I)   Elevator shaft enclosure walls and access stairs attached to or
beneath an elevated building may be excluded from the breakaway requirement, if
the potential loads generated by these obstructions are considered in the
design of the building. However, in all cases, they must be constructed of
flood-resistant materials;
   (J)   Prior to construction, plans for any building that will have open
breakaway panels must be submitted to the Building Official for approval;
   (K)   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvement to a structure
shall not enclose the space below the lowest floor, except with open breakaway
panels, as provided for in divisions (G), (H) and (J);
   (L)   The placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an
existing manufactured home (mobile home) park or subdivision are prohibited;
provided, however, a replacement manufactured home may be placed on a lot in an
existing manufactured home park or subdivision only if the anchoring standards
of division (D) and the elevation standards of division (B) are met;
   (M)   A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the
design, specifications and plans for construction are in compliance with the
provisions contained in divisions (B), (C), (D), (E), (G) and (I) of this
section.
   (N)   Appurtenant features, such as swimming pools, decks and patios,
gazebos, fences, and other features as may be determined by the Building
Official as potentially causing an obstruction, must comply with the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Technical Bulletin 5-93, “Free-Of-
Obstruction Requirements for Buildings Located in Coastal High Hazard Areas”,
which is incorporated herein by reference, specifically including any
subsequent revisions thereto.
      (1)   Other small, low value accessory structures may be allowed in the
VE Zone; provided they also comply with the Federal Emergency Management Agency
(FEMA) Technical Bulletin 5-93, “Free-Of-Obstruction Requirements for Buildings
Located in Coastal High Hazard Areas”. For the purposes of this division, a
SMALL ACCESSORY STRUCTURE is defined as one that has a footprint of less than
100 square feet, and a LOW VALUE ACCESSORY STRUCTURE as one that has a value of
less than $1,000.
      (2)   Any and all other obstructions located in the VE Zone shall meet
all applicable requirements of this section.

§ 152.53 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and
in the instance of an historical building, a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of
the building.
   (B)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship and;
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud upon or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (C)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice specifying the difference between base flood elevation and the elevation
to which the building is to be built and stating that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the
reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (D)   The Building Official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 153.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known as the “Stormwater Management and Water Quality
Regulations of the Town of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.’
(Ord. 07045, passed 8-14-07)
§ 153.002 AUTHORITY AND SCOPE.
   (A)   This chapter is adopted pursuant to the authority conferred upon the
town by the South Carolina Constitution, the South Carolina General Assembly,
and in compliance with the requirements imposed upon the town by the National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (“NPDES”), and all applicable state
permits and regulations issued in accordance with the federal Clean Water Act,
the South Carolina Pollution Control Act, and regulations promulgated
thereunder.
   (B)   It is the goal of the Town Council that the provisions of this chapter
will result in reduction of the discharge of pollutants to the Town MS4 and its
receiving waters, to the maximum extent practicable.
   (C)   This chapter is to be construed to further its purpose of controlling
and reducing pollutant discharges to the Town MS4 and to the waters of the
state, to assure the obligations under its NPDES permit issued by the
Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC), as required by 33 U.S.C.
§ 1251 and 40 C.F.R.§ 122.26.
   (D)   The application of this chapter, the provisions expressed herein, and
the federal and state stormwater regulations shall be minimum stormwater
management requirements, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any
other town ordinances or powers granted to the town by South Carolina statues,
including, without limitation, the power to require additional or more
stringent stormwater management requirements.
   (E)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply throughout the incorporated
areas of the town.
   (F)   The Town Engineer and Stormwater Program Manager shall be primarily
responsible for the coordination and enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter, the Town Stormwater Management Program (SWMP), and the town's NPDES
permit.
   (G)   To the extent that any provisions or requirements of this chapter
overlap or duplicate the requirements of another chapter, the most stringent
requirement in the Town Code of Ordinances shall apply.
(Ord. 07045, passed 8-14-07)
§ 153.003 FINDINGS.
   The town makes the following findings:
   (A)   Uncontrolled stormwater runoff may have significant, adverse impact on
the health, safety and general welfare of the town and the quality of life of
its citizens, by transporting pollutants into receiving waters and by causing
erosion or flooding.
   (B)   The town is required by federal law (33 U.S.C. § 1342(p) and 40 C.F.R.
§ 122.26) to obtain a National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit
from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control (“DHEC”)
for stormwater discharges from the Mount Pleasant Stormwater System. The NPDES
permit requires the town to impose controls to reduce the discharge of
pollutants in stormwater to the maximum extent practicable, using management
practices, control techniques and systems, design and engineering methods, and
such other provisions determined to be appropriate for the control of such
pollutants.
   (C)   Additionally, certain facilities that discharge stormwater associated
with an industrial activity, including land-disturbing activities, are required
to obtain NPDES permits. Also, The South Carolina Stormwater Management and
Sediment Reduction Act (S.C. Code §§ 48-14-10 et seq.) requires a state permit
for certain land-disturbing activities.
(Ord. 07045, passed 8-14-07)
§ 153.004 PURPOSE.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect, maintain and enhance the
environment of the town, and the short-term and long-term public health, safety
and general welfare of its citizens, by establishing requirements and
procedures to control the potential adverse effects of increased stormwater
runoff associated with both future development and existing developed land.
Proper management of stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and
private property, insure a functional drainage system, reduce the effects of
development on land and stream channel erosion, attain and maintain water
quality standards, enhance the local environment associated with the drainage
system, reduce local flooding, reduce pollutant loading to the maximum extent
practicable, and maintain to the extent practicable the pre-development runoff
characteristics of the area, and facilitate economic development while
mitigating associated pollutant, flooding and drainage impacts.
   (B)   It is further the purpose of this chapter to comply with the federal
and corresponding state stormwater discharge (NPDES) regulations (40 C.F.R. §
122.26 and S.C. Regulation 61-9.122.26) developed pursuant to the Clean Water
Act, and to assure the town of the authority to take any action required by it
to obtain and comply with its NPDES permit for stormwater discharges. Among
other things, these regulations require the town to establish legal authority
that authorizes or enables the town, at a minimum, to:
      (1)   Control the contribution of pollutants and the quality of
stormwater discharges to the Mount Pleasant Municipal Separate Storm Sewer
System (“MS4"), and stormwater discharges associated with residential,
commercial, industrial and related facilities activity, in order to achieve
compliance with all applicable state NPDES permit requirements to the maximum
extent practicable;
      (2) Prohibit illicit discharges to the Town MS4 and receiving waters;
      (3)   Control spills, dumping or disposal of materials other than
stormwater to the Town MS4 and receiving waters;
      (4) Control, through intergovernmental agreements, contribution of
pollutants from one municipal stormwater system to another;
      (5)   Require compliance with conditions in ordinances, permits,
contracts or orders;
      (6)   Ensure adequate long-term operations and maintenance of best
management practices (BMPs); and
      (7)   Carry out all inspection, surveillance and monitoring procedures
necessary to determine compliance and noncompliance with permit conditions,
including the prohibition on illicit discharges to the Town MS4 and receiving
waters.
   (C)   The application of this chapter and the provisions expressed herein
shall be the minimum stormwater management requirements, and shall not be
deemed a limitation or repeal of any other powers granted by statute. In
addition, if site characteristics indicate that complying with these minimum
requirements will not provide adequate designs or protection for local property
or residents, it is the owner and operator's responsibility to exceed
management practices, control techniques and systems, design and engineering
methods, and such other programs and controls as may be required to meet all
applicable construction quality, water quantity, and water quality regulations
and requirements.
   (D)   This chapter is to be construed to further its purpose of controlling
and reducing pollutant discharges to the Town MS4 and to the waters of the
state, to assure the obligations under its NPDES permit issued by DHEC as
required by 33 U.S.C. § 1251 and 40 C.F.R. § 122.26.

nor will a certificate of occupancy be issued for commercial projects, until
such time as a statement is received from the project engineer certifying that
construction is complete and in accordance with approved plans.
   (M)   No clearing and grading permit shall be issued or modified without the
following:
      (1)   Right of entry for emergency maintenance if necessary;
      (2)   Right of entry for inspections;
      (3)   Any off-site easements needed;

§ 153.042 DRAINAGE PLAN REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Storm drainage. A drainage system shall be designed and constructed to
provide for the proper drainage of the surface water and the drainage area of
which it is a part, to permit the unimpeded flow of natural watercourses, to
provide for water quality control, and where necessary, water quality
improvements. The information, plans, specifications, certifications and design
evaluations described in the drainage master plan, preliminary plat checklist,
or site plan checklist, whichever is appropriate, shall be submitted to the
Town Engineer. Checklists shall be provided by the Department of Engineering
and Development Services, and may be amended from time to time.
      (1)   Design and construction standards.
         (a)   Drainage systems shall be designed by a licensed engineer and
constructed by the subdivider/developer consistent with the design principals
and standards contained herein, described in the Town BMP manual and
established by SCDHEC-OCRM.
         (b)   In all cases, drainage systems shall conform to cross sections,
dimensions, erosion control measures and grades as shown on the approved
construction plans.
      (2)   Watershed. The watershed containing the site shall be shown, and
shall be extended to a natural watercourse or publicly maintained drainage
facility that is adequate to receive the storm drainage.
      (3)   Connection to public storm sewers. Where adequate existing public
storm sewers are reasonably accessible, as determined by the Director of
Engineering and Development Services or his or her designee, the system
proposed for the land being subdivided is required to be connected thereto.
      (4)   Ditches and swales.
         (a)   Open drainage ditches (a DITCH is a waterway with side slopes 3:
1 or steeper) shall not be permitted in the town.
         (b)   Existing ditches above the SCDHEC-OCRM critical line shall be
piped, filled and regraded, based upon staff recommendations.
         (c)   SWALES are grass-lined drainage ways with 10 to 1 side slopes,
and are encouraged as a means to manage stormwater in a manner that is
protective of water quality.
      (5)   Positive drainage for each lot. The subdivider/developer shall be
responsible for including as part of the drainage plan provisions for positive
drainage for each lot individually as a part of the project development.
         (a)   Individual lot drainage shall be detailed on the construction
plans and shall include, but not be limited to, yard drains for lawn areas,
side and rear yard features to include swales and a piped system of inlets and
other items necessary for the removal of water from the lot.
         (b)   It is not necessary to provide pad-ready lots during subdivision
development.
         (c)   However, positive drainage is required for each lot prior to
plat approval.
         (d)   Rear yard pipe systems are required and shall be designed to
accommodate ten-year storm events.
         (e)   Inlets shall be standard 6490 modified grate or an equivalent
designed to minimize debris clogging.
      (6)   Inspection fee. Upon application for preliminary subdivision plat,
the applicant shall submit such inspection fee for drainage systems, based upon
a per linear foot of roadway centerline as may be established by Town Council.
      (7)   Permanent erosion control features and drainage systems for streets
and lots. Filling, grading, permanent erosion control features, and
installation of drainage systems for lots and streets shall be provided prior
to final plat approval.
   (B)   Erosion, runoff and sedimentation control. Engineering and
construction on any land within the town shall be carried out in such a manner
as to protect neighboring persons and property from damage or loss resulting
from excessive stormwater runoff, soil erosion, or deposition upon private
property or public streets of water-transported silt and debris.
   (C)   Plan requirements. Drainage plans shall include:
      (1)   The information, plans, specifications, certifications and design
evaluations described in the drainage master plan, preliminary plat checklist,
or site plan checklist, whichever is appropriate. Checklists shall be provided
by the Engineering and Development Services Department, and may be amended from
time to time;
      (2)   No grate inlets in the right-of way of public streets;
      (3)   A stormwater pollution prevention plan as described in §
153.043;
      (4)   A permanent maintenance plan for all stormwater management
facilities; and
      (5)   Design components that meet the following special situations, as
appropriate and as described in S.C. Regulation 72-304, Appendix B, Chapter
III, C.3.XIII.
         (a)   All projects must detain the greater of one inch of runoff from
the entire site, or one-half inch of runoff from the developed portion of the
site; and must demonstrate the rate of release extends for 24 hours and does
not exceed the pre-development flow rate.
         (b)   For projects located within 1,000 feet of shellfish beds, 1-1/
2 inches of runoff from the developed portion of the site must be retained
onsite.
         (c)   For bridges that traverse saltwater and/or critical areas.
            1.   No treatment is necessary for runoff from bridge surfaces
spanning SA waters. This runoff can be discharged through scupper drains
directly into surface waters. However, the use of scupper drains should be
limited as much as feasibly possible.
            2.   If the receiving water is either ORW or SFH, then the
stormwater management requirements shall be based on projected traffic volumes
and the presence of any nearby shellfish beds. The following matrix lists the
necessary treatment practices over the different classes of receiving waters.
            3.   The average daily traffic volume (ADT) is based upon the
design carrying capacity of the bridge.
 
Water Quality Class                           Average Daily Traffic Volume
                                              0-30,000 Greater than 30,000
ORW (within 1,000 feet of shellfish beds)     ***      ***
ORW (not within 1,000 feet of shellfish beds) **       **
SFH (within 1,000 feet of shellfish beds)     **       ***
SFH (not within 1,000 feet of shellfish beds) **       **
SA                                            *        *
 
*** The first inch of runoff from the bridge surface must be collected and
routed to an appropriate stormwater management system, or routed so that
maximum overland flow occurs encouraging infiltration before reaching the
receiving body. Periodic vacuuming of the bridge surface should be considered.
** A stormwater management plan must be implemented, which may require the
over-treatment of runoff from associated roadways to compensate for the lack of
direct treatment of runoff from the bridge surface itself. Periodic vacuuming
should be considered. The use of scupper drains should be limited as much as
feasibly possible.
* No treatment is required. The use of scupper drains should be limited as much
as feasibly possible.
         (d)   For golf courses adjacent to receiving water bodies.
            1.   Minimum setbacks from the receiving water body of 20 feet for
all manicured portions of the golf course (fairways, greens and tees) are
required, unless other acceptable management techniques are approved and
implemented to mitigate any adverse impacts.
            2.   All drainage from greens and tees must be routed to interior
lagoons or an equivalent stormwater management system.
            3.   To prevent the conversion of the stormwater system to critical
area and to maintain positive drainage at high tides, all outfalls from the
lagoon system must be located at an elevation above the critical area (if the
discharge is to critical area), and above the normal water elevation a distance
to allow for storage of the first inch of runoff. The volume that must be
stored shall be calculated by multiplying the area of all the greens and tees
by one inch.
            4.   No greens or tees shall be located on marsh hummocks or
islands, unless all drainage can be conveyed to the interior lagoon system or
to an equivalent onsite stormwater management system.
            5. Stormwater impacts to freshwater wetlands shall be limited by
providing minimum-20-foot buffers, or an accepted alternative, between
manicured areas (fairways, greens and tees) and the wetlands. This minimum
buffer must be increased if land application of treated effluent is utilized in
the area.
            6.   An integrated pest management system designed in accordance
with current best technology practices must be employed on the course to limit
the application of chemicals that, if over-applied, may leach into the ground
and adjacent surface waters.
            7.   In accordance with South Carolina Department of Health and
Environmental Control requirements, a two-foot separation must be maintained
between the surface of the golf course and the ground water table where spray
effluent is applied.
            8.   The normal ground water elevation must be established by a
registered engineer or soil scientist.
            9.   All projects within 1,000 feet of shellfish beds must retain
the first 1-1/2 inches of runoff.
            10.   If spray effluent or chemicals are applied to the turf via
the irrigation system, all spray heads must be located and set so as to prevent
any aerosols from reaching adjacent critical areas.
         (e)   For mines and landfills.
            1.   When mining or landfill projects are located within one-half
mile of receiving water bodies, pumping of ground water from sediment basins
must be done with floating intakes only. Pumping of these basins must cease
whenever the water levels come to within two feet of the pond bottom.
            2. In addition, landfill planning must be designed on a
comprehensive site basis for stormwater management and sediment/erosion control
to include management practices for each separate cell as it is phased into the
landfill.

§ 153.043 STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION PLANS (SWPPPs).
   (A)   Stormwater pollution prevention plan framework.
      (1)   A SWPPP must be prepared as part of the submission of any drainage
plan.
         (a)   At least one SWPPP must be developed for each construction
project covered by this plan, and a licensed engineer must prepare such SWPPP.
         (b)   For projects that disturb more than one acre, the SWPPP must be
prepared, amended when necessary, certified and stamped by a qualified
individual who is licensed as listed in §
153.008.
      (2)   The SWPPP must:
         (a)   Identify all potential sources of pollution that may reasonably
be expected to affect the quality of stormwater discharges from the
construction site;
         (b)   Describe practices to be used to reduce pollutants in stormwater
discharges from the construction site; and
         (c)   Assure compliance with the terms and conditions of the town's
water quality letter of approval, when properly implemented.
      (3)   Once a definable area has been finally stabilized, the permittee
may mark this on the SWPPP, and no further SWPPP or inspection requirements
apply to that portion of the site (e.g., earth-disturbing activities around one
of three buildings in a complex are done and the area is finally stabilized,
one mile of a roadway or pipeline project is done and finally stabilized, and
the like).
      (4)   The permittee must implement the SWPPP as written from commencement
of construction activity until final stabilization is complete.
   (B)   Allowable non-stormwater discharges. The following non-stormwater
discharges are authorized, provided the non-stormwater component of the
discharge is in compliance with § 153.043(E), Management of non-stormwater
discharges allowed under §
153.042(B):
      (1)   Discharges from firefighting activities;
         (2)   Fire hydrant flushings;
         (3)   Waters used to wash vehicles, where detergents are not used;
         (4)   Water used to control dust;
         (5)   Potable water, including uncontaminated water line flushings;
         (6)   Routine external building wash down that does not use
detergents;
         (7)   Pavement wash waters, where spills or leaks of toxic or
hazardous materials have not occurred (unless all spilled material has been
removed), and where detergents are not used;
         (8)   Uncontaminated air conditioning or compressor condensate;
         (9)   Uncontaminated ground water or spring water;
         (10)   Foundation or footing drains, where flows are not contaminated
with process materials such as solvents;
         (11)   Uncontaminated excavation dewatering;
         (12)   Landscape irrigation.
   (C)   SWPPP contents: site and activity description.
      (1)   The SWPPP must identify all operators for the project site, and the
areas of the site over which each operator has control.
      (2)   The SWPPP must describe the nature of the construction activity,
including:
         (a)   The intended sequence and timing of planned major activities
that disturb soils, such as clearing and grubbing, initial and final grading,
and cut and fill activities at the site;
         (b)   Estimates of the total area expected to be disturbed by
excavation, grading, or other construction activities, including dedicated off-
site borrow and fill areas; and
         (c)   A general location map (e.g., USGS quadrangle map, a portion of
a city or county map, or other map) with enough detail to identify the location
of the construction site and surface waters of the state within one mile of the
site.
      (3)   The SWPPP must contain a legible site map, showing the entire site,
identifying:
         (a)   Direction(s) of stormwater flow and approximate slopes
anticipated after major grading activities;
         (b)   Locations of off-site material, waste, borrow or construction
equipment storage areas, excluding roll-off containers;
         (c)   Locations of all surface waters of the state (including
wetlands);
         (d)   Locations where stormwater discharges to a surface water; and
         (e)   Areas where final stabilization has been accomplished and no
further construction-phase permit requirements apply.
      (4)   The SWPPP must describe and identify the location and description
of any stormwater discharge associated with industrial activity other than
construction at the site. This includes stormwater discharges from dedicated
asphalt plants and dedicated concrete plants that are covered by this permit.
   (D)   SWPPP contents: controls to reduce pollutants.
      (1)   The SWPPP must include a description of all pollution control
measures (i.e., BMPs) that will be implemented as part of the construction
activity to control pollutants in stormwater discharges. For each major
activity identified in the project description, the SWPPP must clearly describe
control measures necessary to comply with this chapter and applicable laws and
regulations, the general sequence during the construction process in which the
measures will be implemented, and which operator is responsible for the control
measure's implementation.
      (2)   The SWPPP must include a description of interim and permanent
stabilization practices for the site, including a schedule of when the
practices will be implemented. Site plans should ensure that existing
vegetation is preserved where possible, and that disturbed portions of the site
are stabilized.
      (3)   For sites with stormwater discharges to receiving waters listed as
impaired in South Carolina's 303(d) List of Impaired Waters, the following
requirements apply:
         (a)   If a total maximum daily load (TMDL) that is applicable to
stormwater construction discharges has been established and is in effect, then:
            1.   SWPPP measures or controls that are consistent with the
assumptions and requirements of such TMDL must be incorporated into the
drainage plan; and
            2.   The SWPPP must incorporate any conditions applicable to
project discharges necessary for consistency with the assumptions and
requirements of such TMDL; and
            3.   If a specific wasteload allocation has been established that
would apply to project discharges, the SWPPP must incorporate that allocation
and implement necessary steps to meet that allocation.
         (b)   If a TMDL has specified a general wasteload allocation
applicable to construction stormwater discharges, but no specific requirements
for construction sites have been identified in the TMDL, then:
            1.   DHEC consultation is required to confirm that adherence to a
SWPPP that meets the requirements of this chapter will be consistent with the
TMDL.
            2.   Where a TMDL has not specified a wasteload allocation
applicable to construction stormwater discharges, but has not specifically
excluded these discharges, adherence to a SWPPP that meets the requirements of
this chapter will generally be assumed to be consistent with the approved TMDL.
            3.   If the TMDL specifically precludes such discharges, the town
will not approve the project unless DHEC issues a separate stormwater permit
for the project.
         (c)   If a TMDL has not been established or is not in effect, the
SWPPP must not allow stormwater discharges that will contribute to the
violations of the water quality standards. To accomplish this, the applicant
must:
            1.   First determine whether or not a project discharge may contain
any pollutant that has caused the impairment.
            2.   If project stormwater discharges will not contain the
pollutant(s) of concern, no additional requirements are necessary.
            3.   If project discharges will contain the pollutant(s) of
concern, the BMPs selected for the site must be carefully evaluated and their
performance assessed to ensure that stormwater discharges will not contribute
to or cause a violation of water quality standards.
            4.   For projects that disturb 25 acres or more, the SWPPP must
contain a written quantitative and qualitative assessment that the BMPs
selected will control project stormwater discharges so that they will not
contribute to or cause a violation of water quality standards.
            5.   For more information, please see the DHEC publication entitled
“Antidegradation for Activities Contributing to Nonpoint Source Pollution to
Impaired Waters,” which can be downloaded at the following DHEC website:
www.scdhec.gov/eqc/water/pubs/antidegnps.pdf.
            6.   A copy of the most current 303(d) List of Impaired Waters can
be obtained from:
               Water Quality Division
               Bureau of Water SC DHEC
               2600 Bull Street
               Columbia, SC 29201
               or downloaded at the following DHEC website: www.scdhec.gov/
water/html/tmdl.html.
      (4)   The following records must be maintained as part of the SWPPP:
         (a)   Dates when major grading activities occur;
         (b)   Dates when construction activities temporarily or permanently
cease on a portion of the site. (Note: TEMPORARILY CEASING CONSTRUCTION means
ceasing construction on a portion of the site for more than 14 days. A PORTION
OF THE SITE means, but is not limited to, a PORTION OF THE SITE with dedicated
controls. Where stabilization by the 14th day is precluded by snow cover or
frozen ground conditions, stabilization measures must be initiated as soon as
practicable. Where construction activity on a portion of the site is
temporarily ceased, and earth-disturbing activities will be resumed within 14
days, temporary stabilization measures do not have to be initiated on that
portion of the site); and
         (c)   Dates when stabilization measures are initiated.
         (d)   Electronic storage of the above mentioned information is
acceptable, provided that it is referenced in the SWPPP and it is readily
available.
      (5)   The SWPPP must include a description of all post-construction
stormwater management measures that will be installed during the construction
process to control pollutants in stormwater discharges after construction
operations have been completed.
      (6)   Structural measures should be placed on upland soils to the degree
practicable. Such measures must be designed and installed in compliance with
applicable federal, local or state requirements.
      (7)   The SWPPP must describe measures to prevent the discharge of
building or other similar materials to surface waters of the state, except as
authorized by a permit issued under § 404 of the Clean Water Act. See also §
153.043 (L)(3).
      (8)   The SWPPP must describe measures to minimize, to the extent
practicable, off-site vehicle tracking of sediments onto paved surfaces and the
generation of dust.
      (9)   The SWPPP must include a description of construction and waste
materials expected to be stored on-site, with updates as appropriate. The SWPPP
must also include a description of controls, including storage practices such
as roll-off containers, to minimize exposure of the materials to stormwater,
and spill prevention and response practices.
      (10)   The SWPPP must include a description of pollutant sources from
areas other than construction (including stormwater discharges from dedicated
asphalt plants and dedicated concrete plants), and a description of controls
and measures that will be implemented at those sites to minimize pollutant
discharges. If these areas are located off the construction area on property
not owned by the owner of the project, they can be either included in the SWPPP
for the construction site, with the owner of the dedicated facility being a co-
permittee under the permit issued by the town for the project; or the owner of
the dedicated facility can obtain: (a) their own permit coverage to build the
dedicated facility; and (b) their own coverage under the Stormwater General
Permit for Industrial Activity, Permit #SCR000000, or other appropriate permit.
The method(s) selected to deal with dedicated facility areas must be addressed
in the SWPPP.
   (E)   Management of non-stormwater discharges allowed under §
153.042(B).
      (1)   The SWPPP must identify all allowable sources of non-stormwater
discharges, except for flows from firefighting activities, which are combined
with stormwater discharges associated with construction activity at the site.
      (2)   Non-stormwater discharges should be eliminated or reduced to the
extent feasible.
      (3)   The SWPPP must identify and ensure the implementation of
appropriate pollution prevention measures for the non-stormwater component(s)
of the discharge.
   (F)   Maintenance of controls.
      (1)   All erosion and sediment control measures and other protective
measures identified in the SWPPP must be maintained in effective operating
condition. If site inspections identify BMPs that are not operating
effectively, maintenance must be performed as soon as practical or as
reasonably possible, and before the next storm event whenever practicable, to
maintain the continued effectiveness of stormwater controls.
      (2)   If existing BMPs need to be modified or if additional BMPs are
necessary to comply with the requirements of this permit and/or South
Carolina’s water quality standards, implementation must be completed before the
next storm event, whenever practicable. If implementation before the next storm
event is impracticable, the situation must be documented in the SWPPP and
alternative BMPs must be implemented as soon as reasonably possible.
      (3)   Sediment from sediment traps or sedimentation ponds must be removed
as indicated in the SWPPP, or when the design capacity has been reduced by 50%,
whichever occurs first.
   (G)   Copy of permit requirements. Copies of the town water quality approval
letter, the signed and certified notice of intent form that was submitted to
DHEC, and the co-permittee certifications are required as part of the SWPPP.
Also, upon receipt, a copy of the letter from the DHEC authorizing coverage
under the DHEC construction general permit must also be included as a component
of the SWPPP.
   (H)   Applicable state or federal programs. The SWPPP must be consistent
with all applicable federal or state requirements for soil and erosion control
and stormwater management, including updates to the SWPPP as necessary to
reflect any revisions to applicable federal or state requirements for soil and
erosion control.
   (I)   Inspections. The following inspection requirements duplicate SCDHEC's
construction general permit and are included here to simplify compliance with
both the town's and the DHEC's requirements.
      (1)   After construction begins, inspections must be conducted at a
minimum in accordance with one of the two schedules listed below:
         (a)   At least once every seven calendar days, or
         (b)   At least once every 14 calendar days and within 24 hours of the
end of a storm event of one-half inch or greater.
      (2)   Inspection frequency may be reduced to once every month if the
entire site is temporarily stabilized.
      (3)   On a case-by-case basis, the town may require any permittee who has
coverage under this program to conduct inspections on a more frequent basis
than prescribed in this subsection. Examples
include, but are not limited to: permittees who have compliance problems, and
permittees whose sites’ stormwater discharges to environmentally sensitive
waters (such as waters classified as outstanding resource waters, shellfish
harvesting waters, and the like).
      (4)   Inspections must be conducted by qualified personnel, provided by
the operator or cooperatively by multiple operators. QUALIFIED PERSONNEL means
a person knowledgeable in the principles and practice of erosion and sediment
controls, who possesses the skills to assess conditions at the construction
site that could impact stormwater quality, and to assess the effectiveness of
any sediment and erosion control measures selected to control the quality of
stormwater discharges from the construction activity. This person must be
either the preparer of the SWPPP or an individual who is under the direct
supervision of the preparer of the approved SWPPP, and who meets the
requirements in this paragraph, or an individual who has been certified through
a construction site inspector certification course that has been approved by
DHEC. Inspections may also be conducted by a person with a registration
equivalent to the registration of the preparer of the SWPPP and who meets the
qualifications of this paragraph, or an individual who is under the direct
supervision of the person with an equivalent registration and who meets the
requirements in this paragraph.
      (5)   Inspections must include all areas of the site disturbed by
construction activity and areas used for storage of materials that are exposed
to precipitation. Inspectors must look for evidence of, or the potential for,
pollutants entering the stormwater conveyance system. Sedimentation and erosion
control measures identified in the SWPPP must be observed to ensure proper
operation. Discharge locations must be inspected to ascertain whether erosion
control measures are effective in preventing violations to South Carolina's
water quality standards, where accessible. Where discharge locations are
inaccessible, nearby downstream locations must be inspected to the extent that
such inspections are practicable. Locations where vehicles enter or exit the
site must be inspected for evidence of off-site sediment tracking.
      (6)   Utility line installation, pipeline construction, and other
examples of long, narrow, linear construction activities may limit the access
of inspection personnel to the areas described above. Inspection of these areas
could require that vehicles compromise temporarily or even permanently
stabilized areas, cause additional disturbance of soils, and increase the
potential for erosion. In these circumstances, controls must be inspected on
the same frequencies as other construction projects, but representative
inspections may be performed. For representative inspections, personnel must
inspect controls along the construction site for one-quarter mile above and
below each access point where a roadway, undisturbed right-of-way, or other
similar feature intersects the construction site and allows access to the areas
described above. The conditions of the controls along each inspected quarter
mile segment may be considered as representative of the condition of controls
along that reach extending from the end of the quarter mile segment to either
the end of the next quarter mile inspected segment, or to the end of the
project, whichever occurs first. Representative inspections must include any
areas where stormwater discharges to environmental sensitive waters (such as
waters classified as outstanding resource waters, shellfish harvesting waters,
and the like).
      (7)   An inspection report must be completed for each inspection required
above. At a minimum, the inspection report must include:
         (a)   The inspection date;
         (b)   Names, titles, and, if not previously given in an inspection
report, the qualifications of personnel making the inspection;
         (c)   Weather information for the period since the last inspection (or
since commencement of construction activity if the first inspection), including
a best estimate of the beginning of each storm event, duration of each storm
event, approximate amount of rainfall for each storm event (in inches), and
whether any discharges occurred;
         (d)   Weather information and a description of any discharges
occurring at the time of the inspection;
         (e)   Location(s) of discharges of sediment or other pollutants from
the site;
         (f)   Location(s) of BMPs that need maintenance;
         (g)   Location(s) of BMPs that failed to operate as designed or proved
inadequate for a particular location;
         (h)   Location(s) where additional BMPs are needed that did not exist
at the time of inspection; and
         (i)   Corrective action required, including any changes to the SWPPP
necessary and implementation dates.
         (j)   A record of each inspection and of any actions taken in
accordance with this section must be retained as part of the SWPPP for at least
three years from the date that permit coverage expires or is terminated. The
report must be signed in accordance with of § 122.22 of S.C. Regulation 61-9
      (8)   For construction sites disturbing ten acres or more, a monthly
report must be submitted to the town.
         (a)   The report must be signed in accordance with § 122.22 of S.C.
Regulation 61-9.
         (b)   In lieu of submitting monthly reports, the reports may be stored
electronically in a manner in which town personnel will have access to review
this data, such as on a dedicated website to which town personnel will have
unlimited access.
         (c)   Other forms of electronic storage of monthly reports may be
utilized once arrangements have been made with the town.
      (9)   For construction sites that disturb less than ten acres, the town
may require monthly reports to be submitted on either a project-by-project
basis or an operator-by-operator basis.
      (10)   If the information required in this subsection is already included
on the inspection forms, only copies of the inspection forms need to be
submitted to the town. If the information required in this subsection is not
included on the inspection form, then the monthly reports must include, at a
minimum, the following additional information:
         (a)   A summary of the results of the inspections conducted during the
month;
         (b)   A listing of all deficiencies noted during inspections, with the
date each deficiency was noted;
         (c)   For each deficiency noted that required corrective action:
            1.   A listing of the name(s), address(es), and telephone number(s)
of the party or parties responsible; and
            2.   A statement whether this deficiency was previously listed in a
monthly report;
         (d)   A listing of the corrective actions that were taken to remedy
any deficiencies noted, and the date each corrective action was completed;
         (e)   A statement on whether or not the SWPPP was updated to deal with
any deficiencies noted; and
         (f)   A copy of each inspection conducted during the month attached in
an appendix to the monthly report.
      (11)   For construction sites disturbing ten acres or more, in addition
to the information required above, the first monthly report submitted after
construction has started must include one copy of the co-permittee and
contractor certifications. Subsequent monthly reports on construction sites
that disturb ten acres or more must include copies of certifications for co-
permittees and contractors added after construction has started. For each co-
permittee and contractor certification submitted to the town, the preparer of
the SWPPP, or someone with a registration equivalent to that of the preparer of
the SWPPP, must certify that either an on-site or, when applicable, an off-site
pre-construction conference was held with the co-permittee or contractor in
accordance with this permit. This certification must give the date of the
conference and the responsibilities of each co-permittee and contractor.
      (12)   For construction sites disturbing less than ten acres, the owners/
operators may be required to submit the co-permittee and contractor
certifications on a case-by-case basis. When the owner/operator is required to
submit the co-permittee and contractor certifications, the preparer of the
SWPPP, or someone with a registration equivalent to that of the preparer of the
SWPPP, must certify that either an on-site or an off-site pre-construction
conference was held with the co-permittees and contractors in accordance with
this permit. This certification must give the date of the conference and the
responsibilities of each co-permittee and contractor.
      (13)   Each monthly report with one copy must be submitted to the Town
Stormwater Program Manager on or before 28th day of the month following the
reporting period. For example, the monthly report for July 2007 is due after
July 31, 2007, and on or before August 28, 2007.
      (14)   Until construction starts, the monthly report may just state that
construction activity has not started.
      (15)   When required, monthly reports must be submitted until the notice
of termination is submitted to DHEC. When the notice of termination is
submitted, it must contain a signed statement by the preparer of the SWPPP, or
a person with a registration equivalent to that of the preparer of the SWPPP,
that all work was completed to the best of his or her knowledge and belief, in
accordance with the approved SWPPP and this CGP. For projects disturbing more
than one acre, the certifying person's knowledge and belief must be based on
the results of the periodic inspections conducted by the preparer of the SWPPP
(or a person with an equivalent registration), or by a qualified individual
under his or her direct supervision in accordance with this CGP, or by an
individual certified through a construction site inspector certification course
that has been approved by DHEC.
      (16)   Copies of inspection forms and monthly reports must be submitted
to the Stormwater Program Manager at the following address:
      Town of Mount Pleasant
      P.O. Box 745
      Mount Pleasant, SC 29465
or to a designated town email address, when available.
   (J)   Maintaining an updated plan.
      (1)   The SWPPP, including the site map, must be amended whenever there
is a change in design, construction, operation or maintenance at the
construction site that will result in discharges that will cause, have the
reasonable potential to cause, or contribute to violations to South Carolina's
water quality standards.
      (2)   The SWPPP must be amended if, during inspections or investigations
by site staff or by local, state or federal officials, it is determined that
the SWPPP is ineffective in either eliminating, when reasonably possible, or
significantly minimizing pollutants in stormwater discharges from the
construction site.
      (3)   Based on the results of an inspection, the SWPPP must be modified
as necessary to include additional or modified BMPs designed to correct
problems identified. Revisions to the SWPPP must be completed within seven
calendar days following the inspection. Implementation of these additional or
modified BMPs must be accomplished as described in this section.
   (K)   Signature, plan review and making plans available.
      (1)   A copy of the SWPPP (including a copy of the permit), DHEC notice
of intent, and construction general permit coverage letter from DHEC must be
retained at the construction site (or other location easily accessible during
normal business hours to: DHEC, EPA or town officials) from the date of
commencement of construction activities to the date of final stabilization.
      (2)   If you have day-to-day operational control over SWPPP
implementation, you must have a copy of the SWPPP available at a central
location on-site for the use of all those identified as having responsibilities
under the SWPPP whenever they are on the construction site. If an on-site
location is unavailable to store the SWPPP when no personnel are present,
notice of the plan's location must be posted near the main entrance at the
construction site.
      (3)   For linear construction of roads or utilities (such as roads built
by the South Carolina Department of Transportation and utility construction,
including electrical power lines, gas lines, main sewer trunk lines, and water
distribution lines that are not part of a development), neither of which are a
part of a subdivision or other type of development project, the updated copies
of the approved SWPPP must be sent to the town in situations where it is not
practical to have the approved SWPPP on location. For South Carolina Department
of Transportation Projects where there is no construction trailer on site, the
SWPPP may be kept in the office of the SC DOT resident engineer.
      (4)   SWPPPs must be made available upon request by town. The copy of the
SWPPP that is required to be kept on-site or locally available must be made
available, in its entirety, to the town for review and copying at the time of
an on-site inspection.
      (5)   All SWPPPs must be signed and certified in accordance with § 122.22
of S.C. Regulation 61-9.
   (L)   Management practices.
      (1)   All control measures must be properly selected, installed and
maintained in accordance with any relevant manufacturer specifications and good
engineering practices. If periodic inspections or other information indicate a
control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the operator must replace
or modify the control for site situations as soon as practicable.
      (2)   If sediment escapes the construction site, off-site accumulations
of sediment must be removed at a frequency sufficient to minimize off-site
impacts, unless: access to the off-site property cannot be reasonably obtained
from the property owner; or DHEC agrees that it is appropriate to leave the
off-site accumulations in place.
      (3)   Litter, construction debris, oils, fuels, building products with
significant potential for impact (such as stockpiles of freshly treated
lumber), and construction chemicals that could be exposed to stormwater must be
prevented from becoming a pollutant source in stormwater discharges.
      (4)   Except as provided below, stabilization measures must be initiated
as soon as practicable in portions of the site where construction activities
have temporarily or permanently ceased, but in no case more than 14 days after
the construction activity in that portion of the site has temporarily or
permanently ceased.
         (a)   Where stabilization by the 14th day is precluded by snow cover
or frozen ground conditions, stabilization measures must be initiated as soon
as practicable.
         (b)   Where construction activity on a portion of the site is
temporarily ceased, and earth-disturbing activities will be resumed within 14
days, temporary stabilization measures do not have to be initiated on that
portion of the site.
      (5)   A combination of sediment and erosion control measures is required
to achieve maximum pollutant removal.
         (a)   Sediment basins.
            1.   For common drainage locations that serve an area with ten or
more acres disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment basin
that provides storage for a calculated volume of runoff from the drainage area
from at least a ten-year, 24-hour storm, or equivalent control measures, must
be provided, where attainable, until final stabilization of the site.
            2.   Where no such calculation has been performed, a temporary (or
permanent) sediment basin providing at least 3,600 cubic feet of storage per
acre drained, or equivalent control measures, must be provided, where
attainable, until final stabilization of the site.
            3.   When computing the number of acres draining into a common
location, it is not necessary to include flows from off-site areas and flows
from on-site areas that are either undisturbed or have undergone final
stabilization, where such flows are diverted around both the disturbed area and
the sediment basin.
            4.   In determining whether installing a sediment basin is
attainable, the operator may consider factors such as site soils, slope,
available area on-site, and the like. In any event, the operator must consider
public safety as a design factor for the sediment basin, and alternative
sediment controls must be used where site limitations would preclude a safe
design.
         (b)   Sediment controls for drainage locations serving ten or more
acres. For drainage locations that serve ten or more disturbed acres at one
time, and where a temporary sediment basin or equivalent controls are not
attainable, smaller sediment basins and/or sediment traps should be used. Silt
fences, vegetative buffer strips, or a combination of sediment controls that
are equivalent to sediment basins and/or sediment traps are required for all
down-slope boundaries (and for those side-slope boundaries deemed appropriate
as dictated by individual site conditions).
         (c)   Sediment controls for drainage locations serving less than ten
acres. For drainage locations serving less than ten acres, smaller sediment
basins and/or sediment traps should be used.
            1.   At a minimum, silt fences, vegetative buffer strips, or
equivalent sediment controls are required for all down-slope boundaries (and
for those side-slope boundaries deemed appropriate, as dictated by individual
site conditions) of the construction area, unless a sediment basin providing
storage for a calculated volume of runoff from at least a ten-year, 24-hour
storm, or at least 3,600 cubic feet of storage per acre drained, is provided.
            2.   If a basin is not provided, each structural control used must
be designed to handle the entire drainage area it serves.
         (d)   Increased requirements. On a case-by-case or watershed-by-
watershed basis, the town may require the use of a larger storm event and/or a
larger storage volume when designing sediment basins.
      (6)   Velocity dissipation devices must be placed at discharge locations
and along the length of any outfall channel, to provide a non-erosive flow
velocity from the structure to a water course so that the natural physical and
biological characteristics and functions are maintained and protected (e.g., no
significant changes in the hydrological regime of the receiving water).

§ 153.044 WATER QUANTITY CONTROLS.
   (A)   Statement of compliance required with drainage plan submittal. A
determination that the development is in compliance with the Town Flood Damage
Prevention Ordinance (
Chapter 152) and the design standards listed in this chapter must be included
with the drainage plan submittal.
   (B)   Drainage design guidelines.
      (1)   Piped drainage systems and culverts.
         (a)   Piped collection systems for public streets (catch basins,
inlets, cross drains, and longitudinal piping) shall be designed for the ten-
year frequency storm event.
            1.   Catch basins and inlets shall be spaced so that the spread in
the street for the design flow shall not exceed eight feet.
            2.   A check should be made at all low points to determine and
minimize the impacts from less frequent storms.
            3.   All inlets shall be of the curb-opening-type and low-point
basins shall have double wings to provide for drainage flow in both directions
entering the inlet.
         (b)   Road elevations in A and V zones shall allow passage during a
five-year event as a minimum.
         (c)   Design of road culverts.
            1.   Road culverts (e.g., pipes carrying stormwater under a street
or road from one side of the right-of-way to the other) shall be designed for a
100-year frequency flood event.
            2.   The area inundated under these conditions shall be contained
within a defined drainage easement.
         (d)   The design flow, acres drained, and the hydraulic grade line for
the design flow shall be shown on the plans.
         (e)   Design of pipes and culverts.
            1.   Pipes and culverts should be designed using the methods given
in the hydraulic engineering circulars published by the Federal Highway
Administration.
            2.   The Burkli-Ziegler and Talbot formulas shall not be used since
they have questionable applicability to conditions in the town area.
            3.   All pipe joints shall be wrapped with filter fabric in 18-inch
wide sections, utilizing, at a minimum, fabric with a mass per unit area of
(English measure) 5.0 ounces per square yard, and a thickness of 60 mils; or
(metric measure) 170.0 grams per square meter, and a thickness of 1.5
millimeters.
         (f)   Energy dissipaters shall be provided as needed, where excessive
velocities occur.
         (g)   Use of reinforced concrete pipes.
            1.   Reinforced concrete pipes shall be used at public street
locations and easements designated for maintenance by the town.
            2.   Exceptions may be made by the Director of Planning and
Development for those not at street locations, provided complete data is
submitted.
         (h)   Non-corrosive pipes shall be used at all other locations,
subject to the request of and approval by the Director of Planning and
Development.
   (C)   Minimum design standards.
      (1)   A combination of storage and controlled release of stormwater
runoff shall be required for all development and construction that creates the
peak rate of runoff from the site, unless the designer certifies that no
downstream damage will occur due to the increase in runoff.
      (2)   Certifications are required at the time of approval.
      (3)   The peak release rate of stormwater from all developments where
detention is required shall not exceed the peak stormwater runoff rate from the
area in its natural undeveloped state for all intensities up to and including
the 100-year frequency.
      (4)   The same methodology must be used for calculating the pre-
development and post-development rates of runoff from a site.
      (5)   The “bowstring” method may be used for designing detention
facilities for which the drainage area is less than three acres and a factor of
two applied to the estimated volume.
      (6)   Reservoir routing techniques shall be used for designing all
detention facilities for which the drainage area is three acres or larger.
      (7)   For mosquito control, ponds are to be designed to dry in three days
or to contain a minimum permanent depth of 24 inches of water.
      (8)   All stormwater storage facilities and water quality BMPs in the
town are to be privately owned and maintained.
      (9)   Stormwater management facilities may include both structural and
nonstructural elements. Natural swales and other natural runoff conduits shall
be retained where practicable.
      (10)   Where additional stormwater management facilities are required to
satisfy the minimum control requirements, the following measures are examples
of what may be used:
         (a)   Stormwater detention structures (dry basins);
         (b)   Stormwater retention structures (wet ponds);
         (c)   Facilities designed to encourage overland flow, slow velocities
of flow, and flow through buffer zones;
         (d)   Infiltration practices.
      (11)   Where detention and retention structures are used, designs that
consolidate these facilities into a limited number of large structures will be
preferred over designs that utilize a large number of small structures.
      (12)   A waiver shall only be granted after the applicant has submitted a
certification of no impact, stamped by a professional engineer and containing
descriptions, drawings, and any other information necessary to evaluate the
proposed land-disturbing activity. A separate written waiver request shall be
required if there are subsequent additions, extensions or modifications that
would alter the approved stormwater runoff characteristics to a land-disturbing
activity receiving a waiver.
      (13)   Discharge velocities shall be reduced to provide a nonerosive
velocity flow from a structure, channel or other control measure, or the
velocity of the two-year, 24-hour-design storm runoff in the receiving waterway
prior to the land-disturbing activity, whichever is greater.
      (14)   For all stormwater management facilities, a hydrologic-hydraulic
study shall be done showing how the drainage system will function with and
without the proposed facilities. For such studies, the following land use
conditions shall be used. Existing land use data shall be taken from the most
recent aerial photograph, field checked and updated.
         (a)   For the design of the facility outlet structure, use developed
land use conditions for the area within the proposed development and existing
land use conditions for upstream areas draining to the facility.
         (b)   For any analysis of flood flows downstream from the proposed
facility, use existing land use conditions for all downstream areas.
         (c)   The effects of existing upstream detention facilities can be
considered in the hydrologic-hydraulic study.
         (d)   Drainage report format.
            1.   All basin maps submitted as part of the study shall clearly
indicate node numbers linked with any model output.
            2.   The drainage report must also have tabbed sections linked to a
table of contents.
      (15)   Drainage plans can be rejected by the Town Engineer if they
incorporate structures and facilities that will demand considerable
maintenance, will be difficult to maintain, or utilize numerous small
structures, if other alternatives are physically possible.
      (16)   The drainage system and all stormwater management structures
within the town (including both public and private portions) will be designed
to the same engineering and technical criteria and standards. The Department of
Engineering and Development Services review will be the same whether the
portion of the drainage system will be under public or private control or
ownership.
      (17)   All stormwater management measures shall be designed in accordance
with the design criteria contained in the SCDHEC or Town stormwater BMP manual
and/or stormwater design manual, using procedures contained in this manual or
procedures approved by the Town Engineer.

§ 153.045 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Drainage easements.
      (1)   Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainage way,
channel or stream, adequate acres for stormwater or drainage easements shall be
reserved, conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourses, and of
sufficient width to carry off stormwater and to provide for maintenance and
improvement of such watercourses.

§ 153.048 DESIGN STANDARDS MANUAL.
   (A)   The town may provide or develop and maintain a stormwater design
standards manual in accordance with the approved Stormwater Management Program.
In the event that the design manual has not been provided or updated, the Town
Engineer may require specific design, structural, testing, inspection or repair
standards until such time as the manual is provided.
   (B)   The stormwater design manual shall serve as guidance for the design,
construction, testing, inspection and repair of stormwater infrastructure.
   (C)   Although the intention of the manual is to establish uniform
practices, it neither replaces the need for engineering judgment nor precludes
the use of information not presented.
   (D)   Other accepted engineering procedures may be used to conduct
hydrologic and hydraulic studies if approved by the Town Engineer.
   (E)   Other options that become available and are not offered in the manual
will be accepted for review and consideration by the Town Engineer.
   (F)   Nothing in this chapter shall absolve the applicant form complying

Applicants should ensure that their project is designed and conducted in
accordance with all other local, state and federal requirements. Reviews and
approvals of projects by town staff do not constitute approval for other
governmental regulatory requirements.
(Ord. 07045, passed 8-14-07)
§ 153.049 BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES MANUAL.
   (A)   Purpose. The town shall provide or develop and maintain a best
management practices manual in accordance with the approved Stormwater
Management Program. The best management practices manual shall serve as
guidance for the design, construction and maintenance of facilities that
discharge stormwater.
   (B)   Contents. The manual will include, but not be limited to, the
following information:
      (1)   Guidance and specifications for the preparation of stormwater
management plans. Acceptable techniques for obtaining, calculating and
presenting the information required in the plans shall be described, as will
design conditions that must be accounted for.

enforced by specific prescription in zoning requirements, subdivision
regulations, or on a site-specific basis as may be prescribed to meet
management program objectives.
   (C)   Updated periodically. The manual shall be updated periodically to
reflect the most current and effective practices, and shall be made available
to the public.
   (D)   Other accepted engineering practices may be used. The manual is not
designed to replace the need for engineering judgment. Rather, other accepted
engineering procedures may be used to conduct hydrologic and hydraulic studies,
if they equal or exceed the procedures contained in the manual, or if they are
approved by the Town Engineer.
   (E)   Compliance with other governmental requirements. Nothing in this
chapter shall absolve the applicant form complying with other land usage
ordinances, regulations or policy requirements. Applicants should ensure that

§ 154.01 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be referred to as the “Development Impact Fee Chapter for
the Town of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina"”
(Ord. 17009, passed 4-3-17; Am. Ord. 18068, passed 10-9-18)
§ 154.02 AUTHORITY.
   This chapter is adopted pursuant to and in compliance with the authority of
the South Carolina Development Impact Fee Act, S.C. Code Title 6, Art. 9, Ch. 1
(the "Act"), and is to be interpreted in accordance with such Act, or as it may
be amended in the future.
(Ord. 17009, passed 4-3-17; Am. Ord. 18068, passed 10-9-18)
§ 154.03 FINDINGS.
   The Mount Pleasant Town Council hereby declares that:
   (A)   Adequate parks and recreation facilities, fire protection, municipal
facilities and equipment, and transportation system are vital and necessary to
the health, safety, welfare and prosperity of the town and its citizens.
Substantial growth and new construction is taking place within the town and is
anticipated to continue. This growth creates substantial need for new
infrastructure capacity. Meeting these needs is very costly; however, failure
to do so will result in an inadequate system of facilities and equipment to
accommodate anticipated demand. This would make the town a less desirable place
to live and do business and be detrimental to the health, safety, welfare and
prosperity of the town and its citizens.
   (B)   To the extent that future growth and new construction in the town
place demands on parks and recreation facilities, fire protection, municipal
facilities and equipment, or the transportation system those demands and needs
should be met by shifting a portion of the capital costs for providing new
capacity to serve new development, which creates, in whole or in part, these
demands and needs.
   (C)   By resolution adopted on January 10, 2017, the Town Council directed
the Planning Commission to conduct the necessary studies and develop a
recommended development impact fee ordinance in accordance with the
requirements of the Act.
   (D)   The Planning Commission recommended to Town Council a Development
Impact Fee Study Report for Mount Pleasant dated January 11, 2017, a Town of
Mount Pleasant Transportation Impact Fee Program Update Report, a Town of Mount
Pleasant Capital Improvements Plan with projects eligible for impact fee
funding dated January 11, 2017, and a Housing Affordability Analysis in Support
of a Development Impact Fee Study Report in Mount Pleasant dated January 11,
2017, each of which have an updated final version dated March 28, 2017, adopted
by the Town Council, as modified, on April 3, 2017, effective July 1, 2017.
   (E)   This chapter is enacted to implement the findings and recommendations
of the Development Impact Fee Study Report for Mount Pleasant and endorse the
list of capital projects eligible for impact fee funding in the Town of Mount
Pleasant Capital Improvements Plan.
   (F)   The impact fees prescribed in this chapter are equitable, do not
impose an unfair or disproportionate burden on developers and new construction,
and are in the best interests of the general welfare of Mount Pleasant and its
citizens.
   (G)   New facilities or equipment eligible for development impact fee
funding will benefit all new development or redevelopment in town limits.
Therefore, it is appropriate to treat the entire town as one service area for
calculating, collecting and spending development impact fees.
   (H)   This chapter provides the procedures for timely processing of
applications for determination of appropriate development impact fees
applicable to all development inside town limits subject to the impact fees,
and for the timely processing of applications for individual assessment of
development impact fees, credits or reimbursements allowed or paid.
   (I)   The transportation impact fees presented in
Appendix A  of this chapter reflect the town's commitment to provide road
capacity for future vehicle trips using maximum service capacities defined by
the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual.
   (J)   The transportation fees reflect the Institute of Transportation
Engineers’ Trip Generation Manual, Eleventh Edition, or such edition noted in
Appendix A .
   (K)   The maximum allowable recreation impact fee determined in the
Development Impact Fee Study Report for Mount Pleasant has been reduced by 5%
for the General Development Impact Fee Schedule provide in
Appendix A  of this chapter, setting the fees at 95% of the maximum amount to
provide a reasonable fee for residential investment and to ensure that the
impact fees collected do not exceed the cost to provide capital facilities that
accommodate new development.
   (L)   The maximum allowable fire protection impact fee determined in the
Development Impact Fee Study Report for Mount Pleasant has been reduced by 20%
for the General Development Impact Fee Schedule provided in
Appendix A  of this chapter, setting the fees at 80% of the maximum amount to
provide a reasonable fee for residential and non-residential investments and to
ensure that the impact fees collected do not exceed the cost to provide capital
facilities and equipment that accommodate new development.
   (M)   The maximum allowable municipal facilities and equipment impact fee
determined in the Development Impact Fee Study Report for Mount Pleasant has
been reduced by 20% for the General Development Impact Fee Schedule provided in
Appendix A  of this chapter, setting the fees at 80% of the maximum amount to
provide a reasonable fee for residential and non-residential investments and to
ensure that the impact fees collected do not exceed the cost to provide capital
facilities and equipment that accommodate new development.
   (N)   The maximum allowable cost per trip for the transportation impact fee
determined in the Town of Mount Pleasant Transportation Impact Fee Program
Update Report has been reduced by 20% for the General Development Impact Fee
Schedule summarized in
Appendix A  of this chapter, setting the fees at 80% of the maximum amount to
account for the planning level nature of cost estimates; the forecasting
methodology and various data sources utilized; and to provide a margin of
confidence that transportation impact fee expenditures go toward identified
needs that are not likely to change.
   (O)   Property for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to
the effective date of this chapter shall not be subject to the updated
development impact fees.

§ 154.08 PROVISIONS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.
   Because all or part of any particular development project may be exempt from
development impact fees for affordable housing, the following sets forth the
administrative standards for determining what constitutes affordable housing
and the procedures for exemption from one or more development impact fees.
   (A)   Median family income. Affordable housing is based upon 80% of the
median family income for residents living within the Town of Mount Pleasant.
Median family income shall be determined once a year utilizing the following
procedure:
      (1)   The most recently available figures from the US Census Bureau
American Community Survey will serve as the base year for this evaluation;
      (2)   Each subsequent year will be adjusted once annually thereafter
during January of the calendar year based upon the previous year's published
Consumer Price Index (CPI) increase for the U.S. Southeast Region, until the
next U.S. Census Bureau data set is published and this procedure is replicated.
   (B)   Maximum expenditure. The maximum expenditure for housing costs shall
correspond to the Fannie Mae Foundation Mortgage Calculator multiplier of 30%
of gross family income as used in the Housing Affordability Analysis in Support
of a Development Impact Fee Study in Mount Pleasant. Affordable housing based
upon 80% of median family income is:
      (1)   Multifamily rental dwelling units of which the gross monthly rent
cost does not exceed 30% of 80% of the gross median family monthly income.
      (2)   Fee simple ownership dwelling units of which the cost of
homeownership for the dwelling unit do not exceed 30% of 80% of the gross
median family monthly income as reflected in the sales price using the Fannie
Mae Foundation Mortgage Calculator (or comparable methodology) assuming a 20%
down payment and a specified interest rate. The specified interest rate shall
be determined by selecting the lowest 30-year fixed mortgage rate reported by
area lending institutions as of the first week of January for any given year
and shall remain so for the balance of the year.
   (C)   Procedures for exemption from development impact fees.
      (1)   A developer seeking exemption from one or more development impact
fees for the construction of affordable multifamily rental dwelling units must
identify the alternate source of funds for the impact fee and, unless the
alternate source is from town resources, post a financial guarantee suitable to
the town prior to the issuance of a building permit. The amount of the
financial guarantee shall reflect the amount of development impact fees due for
all affordable housing units as if they were not affordable housing units. No
certificate of occupancy for any of the units may be issued until the impact
fees for the affordable housing units have been paid by the alternate source or
from the proceeds of the financial guarantee.
      (2)   If the alternate source of funds for impact fees is from town
resources, prior to issuance of the certificate of occupancy by the town, the
developer shall record an agreement approved by the town restricting the
monthly rental cost of each affordable housing unit for a period of ten years.
Upon delivery of the recorded rent control agreement, the certificate of
occupancy shall be issued.
      (3)   A developer seeking exemption from one or more development impact
fees for construction of a fee simple ownership dwelling unit shall identify
the alternate source of funds for the impact fees and, unless the alternate
source is from town resources, post a financial guarantee suitable to the town
prior to the issuance of a building permit. The amount of the financial
guarantee shall reflect the amount of development impact fees due for all
affordable housing units as if they were not affordable housing units. No
certificate of occupancy may be issued for the affordable housing dwellings
until the impact fees have been paid by the alternate source or from the
proceeds of the financial guarantee.
      (4)   If the alternate source of funds for impact fees is from town
resources, prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy by the town, the
developer shall file with the town a closing statement for the dwelling unit
indicating an arm's length sales price no greater than that allowed for
affordable housing at the time of final sale and a recorded covenant, approved
by the town, restricting the sales price of the dwelling, for a period of ten
years, to the original sales price, adjusted annually for inflation.

      (1)    The Engineering and Development Services Department shall
determine and collect all development impact fees administered within town
limits.
      (2)    Upon the effective date of this chapter, development impact fees
shall be charged to new development or redevelopment in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this chapter. The fees to be collected will be
determined prior to the issuance of a building permit or development permit. No
building permit or development permit shall be issued for any development
requiring the payment of development impact fees until the fees have been
remitted to the Department of Engineering and Development Services, or in the
case of affordable housing, the appropriate financial guarantees have been
filed with the Town Chief Financial Officer. Payment of such fees shall not
relieve the developer from obligations to comply with any other applicable town
ordinances, regulations or requirements prior to receiving a certificate of
occupancy.
      (3)   All monies paid by the fee payer pursuant to this chapter shall be
identified as development impact fees and promptly deposited in the appropriate
development impact fee trust fund described under in §
154.10 of this chapter.
      (4)   For the purpose of calculating transportation development impact
fees, the use of land types assumed in the General Development Impact Fee
Schedule of this chapter (i.e.,
Appendix A ) shall be defined in accordance with the definitions contained in
the Institute of Transportation Engineers' Trip Generation Manual, Eleventh
Edition, or such edition noted in
Appendix A .
      (5)   Payment of development impact fees according to the General
Development Impact Fee Schedule (i.e.,
Appendix A ), or independent impact fee calculation study as provided for in
this chapter, shall constitute full and complete payment of the new
development's proportionate share of public facilities costs.
      (6)   A developer may negotiate and contract with the town to provide
facilities or services in lieu of payment of development impact fees in
accordance with § 6-1-1050 of the Act (S.C. § 6-1-1050) and this chapter.
   (B)   Recreation impact fee.
      (1)   Formula. Recreation impact fees collected within town limits shall
be in accordance with the following formula:

             is being sought.
             The cost per dwelling unit for providing improvements to parks and
             recreation facilities as indicated in
             Appendix A and based on information presented in the Development
COST =       Impact Fee Study Report for Mount Pleasant adopted by Town Council
             on April 3, 2017, effective July 1, 2017. The cost shall be 95% of
             the maximum allowable recreation impact fee as provided in
             Appendix A of this chapter.
 
      (2)   Determining recreation impact fees. The amount of recreation impact
fees attributable to a specific development shall be determined through the
following process:
         (a)   Verify the type and number of new residential dwelling units for
which the building permit is being sought;
         (b)   Determine whether any of the proposed residential dwelling units
qualify for a discount on recreation impact fees as "affordable housing" and,
if so, the number and type of such units;
         (c)   Determine the applicable residential dwelli\ng unit category set
forth in
Appendix A  (as applicable) of this chapter; and
         (d)   Multiply the discounted development impact fee rate for the
residential dwelling unit category by the number of net new units to be covered
by the building permit.
      (3)   Independent recreation impact fee calculation. In the event that a
fee payer or town staff contend that the use of land for which the building
permit is being sought is not within those uses of land identified in
Appendix A , or if the fee payer contends that the
Appendix A  calculations are not accurate for its intended use, then  the
Director of Engineering and Development Services , or its designee, shall make
a determination as to the most comparable use of land category to assume for
calculating recreation impact fees. If the fee payer disagrees with the
determination of  the Director of Engineering and Development Services  or if
the town otherwise deems it appropriate, an independent impact fee calculation
may be performed to quantify the fair share of system improvement costs
attributable to the development. Preparation of an independent impact fee
calculation will immediately halt the building permit application process until

             Appendix A and based on information presented in the Development
COST =       Impact Fee Study Report for Mount Pleasant adopted by Town Council
             on April 3, 2017, effective July 1, 2017. The cost shall be 80% of
             the maximum allowable transportation impact fee as provided in
             Appendix A of this chapter.
 
   (F)   Special cases. The  Engineering and Development Services  shall take
the following special cases into account when calculating development impact
fees for a building permit application:
      (1)   When an application for a building permit has been made that
contains two or more uses of land in any combination, including two or more
uses of land within a single building or structure, the total development
impact fee assessment shall be the sum of the products, as calculated above,
for each use of land unless an independent impact fee calculation is performed,
and approved for use by  the Director of Engineering and Development Services ,
or its designee, consistent with §§
154.09(B)(3),
154.09(C)(3),
154.09(D)(3) or
154.09(E)(3) (as applicable) of this chapter.
      (2)   In the case of a change, redevelopment or modification of a use of
land which requires a building permit, and which is not exempted from
development impact fees under §
154.07 of this chapter, the impact fee calculation shall be based upon the net
increase in new or proposed use of land as compared to the existing or previous
use of land.
      (3)   In the case of a demolition or termination of an existing use or
structure, development impact fees for future redevelopment shall be based upon
the net increase in development impact fees for the new or proposed use of land
as compared to the existing actual active previous use of land since its
original occupancy. Credit for the prior use shall not be transferable to
another location.
      (4)   In the case of relocating an existing use of land, development
impact fees shall be assessed to the relocated use at its new location. Future
redevelopment of the old location from which the use was removed will receive a
credit against development impact fees assessed equal to the impact fees that
would have been assessed against the relocated use. Credits shall not be
transferable to the new location.
      (5)   Before a building permit application may become eligible for the
provisions set forth in §
154.09(F)(2) through (4) of this chapter, a developer shall provide reasonably
sufficient evidence that a previous use of land had been actively maintained on
the site within 60 months of the date of application for a building permit.
Such evidence may include proof of utility records, records for the use sought
to be shown, or other documentation.
      (6)   Any claim of existing or previous use must be made no later than
the time for application of a building permit. Any claim made after such time
shall be deemed invalid.

§ 154.10 IMPACT FEE TRUST FUNDS.
   (A)   Development impact fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be
kept separate from other revenue of the town. There shall be one trust fund
established for each development impact fee category depicted in
Appendix A  of this chapter: recreation, fire protection, municipal facilities
and equipment, and transportation. All development impact fees collected shall
be properly identified by property address noted on the approved building
permit and by the appropriate trust account.
   (B)   Any funds on deposit not immediately necessary for expenditure shall
be maintained in an interest-bearing account prior to expenditure on
recommended projects. Interest earned on development impact fees in deposit
must be considered revenue to the trust fund account for which income is earned
and must be subject to all restrictions placed on the use of development impact
fees pursuant to this chapter.
(Ord. 17009, passed 4-3-17; Am. Ord. 18068, passed 10-9-18)
§ 154.11 LIMITATION OF EXPENDITURES OF FUNDS COLLECTED.
   (A)   Eligible system improvement costs. Funds from development impact fee
trust accounts shall be expended only for the public facilities and system
improvements identified as eligible for impact fee funding in the Town of Mount
Pleasant's most recent adopted Capital Improvements Plan, incorporated herein
by reference. No funds shall be used for administrative or operating costs
associated with imposing any of the development impact fees. Eligible
components of a public facility may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
      (1)   Design and construction plan preparation;
      (2)   Right-of-way acquisition;
      (3)   Construction of new facilities, structures, or amenities that
provide additional capacity;
      (4)   Purchase of new equipment (>$100,000 purchase price) that provide
additional capacity;
      (5)   Construction of new through lanes and/or turn lanes;
      (6)   Construction of new bridges;
      (7)   Construction of new drainage facilities associated with capital
improvements;
      (8)   Purchase and installation of traffic signalization;
      (9)   Construction of new curbs, medians, and shoulders;
      (10)   Relocating utilities to accommodate new road construction; and
      (11)   Principal payments, interest and other finance charges on bonds or
other indebtedness issued by or on behalf of the town for financing any or all
public facilities.
   (B)   Rationale nexus test. The Town's Chief Financial Officer, or its
designee, shall make an annual report to the Town Council and publish this
report for access by the general citizenry showing where development impact
fees have been collected and what projects have been funded with these
revenues. The Council shall consider this report and whether the fees are being
spent for the benefit of new development within town limits. If the Council
determines that this is not the case, then it shall adjust the Town of Mount
Pleasant Capital Improvements Plan and other projected capital expenditures to
correct the condition.
   (C)   Expenditure of funds. Development impact fee funds shall be expended
in the order in which they were collected. The disbursal of such funds shall
require approval of the Town Council, upon recommendation of the Town
Administrator or its designee.
   (D)   Reimbursement. Impact fee funds not obligated for expenditure within
three years of the date that they are scheduled to be expended in the Town of
Mount Pleasant Capital Improvements Plan shall be returned, with actual
interest earned, to the record owner of the property for which the fees were
collected, on a first-in, first-out basis.
(Ord. 17009, passed 4-3-17; Am. Ord. 18068, passed 10-9-18)
§ 154.12 CREDITS/REIMBURSEMENTS.
   (A)   General provisions.
      (1)   A developer shall be entitled to a credit against development
impact fees assessed pursuant to this chapter, applying the same discount rates
applied to the maximum allowable impact fees presented in this chapter for the
various impact fee categories, for town-approved monetary or in-kind
contributions toward some or all of the public facilities included in the Town
of Mount Pleasant Capital Improvements Plan that are eligible for impact fee
funding.
      (2)   Development impact fees shall not be imposed on a fee payer or
developer who has entered into a credit agreement with the town for certain
contribution, payment, construction or dedication of land up to the cash value
of the specific improvements identified within the agreement. Any difference
between total development impact fees due, by impact fee category, for the
development and the cash value of the executed credit agreement remain eligible
for collection pursuant to the rules and requirements of this chapter.
      (3)    Any request for development impact fee credit or reimbursement
shall be submitted to the Director of Engineering and Development Services at
the time of application consistent with other provision in this chapter. Town
Council agreements may be submitted in advance of the application.
   (B)   Application for credit agreement.
      (1)    The determination of the amount of any credit shall be undertaken
through submission of an application for credit agreement, which shall be
submitted through the Engineering and Development Services Department for
review by the Director of Engineering and Development Services, or its
designee.
      (2)   The application for credit agreement shall include the following
information:
         (a)   The following documentation must be provided if the proposed
application involves a credit for any cash contribution:
            1.   A certified copy of the development approval in which the
contribution was agreed; and
            2.   Proof of payment (if already made); or
            3.   Proposed method of payment (if not already made).
         (b)   The following documentation must be provided if the proposed
application involves credit for dedication of land:
            1.   A drawing and legal description of the land;
            2.   The appraised fair market value of the land at the date a
building permit application is sought for the use of land, prepared by a
professional real estate appraiser who is a member of the member Appraisal
Institute (MAL) or who is a member of Senior Residential Appraisers (SRA); and
            3.   A certified copy of the development permit in which the land
was agreed to be dedicated (if applicable).
         (c)   The following documentation must be provided if the proposed
application involves credit for construction:
            1.   The proposed construction documents of the specific
construction project prepared and certified by a duly qualified and licensed
engineer in the State of South Carolina;
            2.   The projected costs for the suggested improvements, which
shall be based on local information for similar improvements, along with the
construction schedule for the completion of said improvements. Such estimated
cost shall include construction or reconstruction of the project; the cost of
labor and materials; the cost of all lands, property, rights, easements and
franchises acquired; financing charges or interest prior to and during
construction and for one year after completion of construction; costs of plans
and specifications; surveys of estimates of costs and revenues; costs of
professional services; and all of the expenses necessary or incidental to
determining the feasibility or practicability of such construction or
reconstruction.
      (3)    Within 14 days of receipt of the proposed application for credit
agreement, the Director of Engineering and Development Services, or its
designee, shall determine if the application is complete. If it is determined
that the proposed agreement is not complete, the Director of Engineering and
Development Services shall send written notification to the applicant outlining
the deficiencies. The Director of Engineering and Development Services shall
take no further action on the proposed Application for credit agreement until
all such deficiencies have been corrected or otherwise settled.
      (4)   Once the Director of Engineering and Development Services
determines the proposed application for credit agreement is complete, it shall
be reviewed within 30 days by a committee of designated staff composed of the
Town Administrator, Town Chief Financial Officer, Director of Engineering and
Development Services, and the Department Head for the impact fee category under
consideration (either the Recreation Director for the recreation impact fee,
the Fire Chief for the fire protection impact fee, the Director of Public
Services for the municipal facilities and equipment impact fee, or the Director
of Engineering and Development Services for the transportation impact fee).
Together, this group will be known as the Development Impact Fee Credit Review
Committee.
      (5)   If the application for credit agreement is approved by the
Development Impact Fee Credit Review Committee, a credit agreement shall be
prepared and signed by the applicant and the Town Administrator. It shall
specifically outline the contribution, payment, construction or land
dedication; the time by which it shall be complete, dedicated or paid, and any
extensions thereof; and the dollar credit the applicant shall receive for the
contribution, payment or construction against development impact fees. Any
credit agreement shall be limited to the impact fee dollars owed for the
project as defined in §
154.12(A) of this chapter, by the developer, for the impact fee category under
consideration, unless Town Council decides to entertain a credit agreement in
excess of fees owed that may be transferred to another project of the same
developer in the same service area (see §
154.03(G) of this chapter for definition of service area). The agreement may
also include provisions for rescinding the credit and issuing stop work orders
if the dedication and/or work and/or construction are not timely accomplished.
      (6)   A fee payer affected by the decision of the Credit Review Committee
regarding credits may appeal such decision pursuant to §
154.14(A) of this chapter.
(Ord. 17009, passed 4-3-17; Am. Ord. 18068, passed 10-9-18; Am. Ord. 20053,
passed 9-11-20, effective 1-1-21; Am. Ord. 21040, passed 5-11-21)
§ 154.13 APPEAL PROCESS.
   A developer shall have the following rights for appeal of development impact
fees imposed by the town on their development pursuant only to this chapter:
   (A)   Administrative appeal.
      (1)   A developer may file an administrative appeal with the Town
Administrator regarding the payment of development impact fees, independent
calculation of impact fees, or credits or reimbursements by filing a written
notice of appeal. Said notice shall be filed within 30 days of the decision
sought to be appealed. The filing of an appeal will immediately halt the
building permit application process, unless the developer posts a bond or
submits an irrevocable letter of credit for the full amount of the development
impact fees as calculated by the town to be due. All notices of appeal shall
include a full explanation of the reasons for the appeal, specifying the
grounds therefore, and containing any documentation that the developer desires
to be considered. The appeal shall contain the name and address of the
developer filing the appeal and shall state their capacity to act as a
representative or agent if they are not the owner of the property to which
impact fees or credits pertain.
      (2)   Within 30 days following receipt of the written notice of appeal,
the Town Administrator will review the appellant's written report, supporting
documentation and departmental staff reports. The 30-day review period may be
extended if additional information is needed from the appellant in order to
render a decision. Upon completion of the administrative review, the Town
Administrator will provide a written response to the appellant constituting a
final administrative determination.
      (3)   Any person desiring to appeal the final administrative
determination of the Town Administrator regarding payment of development impact
fees or credits shall file a written notice of appeal to the Town Council. Said
notice of appeal to Town Council shall be filed with the Clerk of Town Council
within 15 days following receipt of the final administrative determination.
Receipt shall be construed to have occurred when the final administrative
decision is deposited in the United States mail postage prepaid to the person
whose name and address is identified in the original notice of appeal.
      (4)   The Town Clerk of Council will schedule all impact fee appeals for
the first Town Council meeting following ten days from receipt of the written
notice of appeal to the Town Council. Postponements of the Town Council appeal
date may be granted by the Town Administrator if they are requested in writing
at least ten days in advance of the scheduled Town Council meeting date.
      (5)   When an appeal is scheduled for oral presentation before the Town
Council, the appellant and town staff shall each be given ten minutes at the
oral argument to present the appeal and to discuss the submitted written
record.
   (B)   Payment under protest. A fee payer may pay development impact fees
under protest. Payment under protest does not preclude the developer from
filing an administrative appeal nor is the fee payer estopped from receiving a
refund of an amount considered to have been collected illegally. A fee payer,
at its option, may also post a bond or submit an irrevocable letter of credit
for the amount of development impact fees due instead of making a cash payment
under protest, pending the outcome of an appeal.
   (C)   Mediation. Town Council shall provide for mediation by a qualified
independent party, upon voluntary agreement by both the developer and the town,
to address a disagreement related to development impact fees calculated by the
town. Neither a request for, nor participation in, mediation shall preclude a
fee payer from pursuing other developer rights or remedies otherwise available
by law.

§ 154.14 REFUNDS.
   (A)   General provisions. Funds not obligated for expenditure within three
years of the date that they are scheduled to be expended in the Town of Mount
Pleasant Capital Improvements Plan shall be refunded to the record owner of
property for which the impact fees were paid, with actual interest earned, on a
first-in, first-out basis. For the purpose of determining whether fees have
been spent or encumbered, the first money placed in a trust fund account shall
be deemed to the first money taken out of that account when withdrawals have
been made.
   (B)   Refund process.
      (1)   The owner of property eligible for a refund of one or more
development impact fee payments shall submit to the Town Chief Financial
Officer a notarized sworn statement that the person is the current owner of the
property for which a refund is due, a certified copy of the latest recorded
deed, and a copy of the most recent ad valorem tax bill for the property.
      (2)   When a right to a refund exists, the town shall send a refund to
the current owner of record within 90 days after it is determined by Town
Council that a refund is due.
      (3)   All refunds shall include the pro rata portion of the interest
earned while on deposit in the specific development impact fee trust account.
      (4)   A record owner of property for which one or more development impact
fee refunds are due has standing to sue for such refund pursuant to § 6-1-1020
(D) of the Act (S.D. Code § 6-1-1020(D)) if there has not been a good-faith
effort towards a timely payment of a refund pursuant to division (B) of this
section.

§ 154.16 TERMINATION OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEE.
   Development impact fees for the Town of Mount Pleasant shall be terminated
within 15 years after the effective date of this chapter, or when sufficient
fees have been collected to fund all of the projects eligible for development
impact fee funding that are identified in the Town of Mount Pleasant Capital
Improvements Plan, whichever shall first occur, unless:
   (A)   Town Council adopts a revised Development Impact Fee Study Report for
Mount Pleasant or amends the Town of Mount Pleasant Capital Improvements Plan
for a subsequent amount of time; or
   (B)   Town Council adopts an updated Development Impact Fee Ordinance for
the Town of Mount Pleasant pursuant to the substantive and procedural
requirements set forth in the South Carolina Development Impact Fee Act, as
amended.

public health, safety, welfare and convenience.
(Ord. 17009, passed 4-3-17; Am. Ord. 18068, passed 10-9-18)
§ 154.99 PENALTIES.
   Town Council shall have the following remedies, which may be exercised
individually or collectively, for collecting development impact fees. The
failure to pursue any remedy at any time shall not be deemed as a waiver of
town rights to pursue any remedy at such other time as may be deemed
appropriate.
   (A)   Interest and penalties. The town may, at its discretion, add to the
amount of calculated development impact fees due prior to award of a
certificate of occupancy, reasonable interest and penalties for non-payment or
late payment of required funds. Penalties for unpaid development impact fees
shall be administered consistent with
Chapter 10 (General Provisions), §
10.99 in the Town of Mount Pleasant Code of Ordinances, which declares the
violation a penalty subject to a fine not to exceed $500 or imprisonment not to
exceed 30 days. Each day of violation shall be deemed a separate offense.
   (B)   Withholding certificate of occupancy. The town may withhold a
certificate of occupancy until full and complete payment has been made by the
developer of development impact fees due for the development.
   (C)   Lien. The town may impose a lien on the developer's property for
failure of the developer to pay required development impact fees in full.
   (D)   Other. The town may pursue the collection of the development impact
fees, including interest, by way of civil process in the Court of Common Pleas
for Charleston County.

General Development Impact Fee Schedule Notes:
1.   Fees listed in Appendix A are discounted per unit. This is the “COST”
factor in the formula for the corresponding impact fee category in §
154.09.   
2.   If the fee payer is applying for a permit to allow for a change in use or
an expansion, redevelopment, or modification of existing development, the fee
required to be paid shall be based on the net increase for the new use compared
to the previous use.
3.   Notwithstanding the provisions above regarding the applicable fees listed
in the transportation impact fee schedule, transportation impact fees may be
calculated independently as provided in §
154.09.
4.   a.   Uses not specifically listed in the transportation impact fee section
of the schedule above shall be determined by the Director of Engineering and
Development Services, based upon either the trip generation characteristics for
a specific use listed in the ITE Trip Generation Manual, eleventh edition, or a
use with similar trip generation characteristics listed in the same manual. If
a building permit is requested for mixed uses, then the fee shall be determined
according to the above schedule by apportioning the space committed to uses
specified on the schedule.
   b.   All trip generation rates are taken from the ITE Trip Generation Manual
based on average weekday vehicle trip ends unless otherwise noted.
   c.   All land uses that have ITE pass-by data are reduced by the average
p.m. peak hour pass-by rate for that specific use.
   d.   Any use listed in the ITE Trip Generation Manual which provides a rate
based on occupancy (i.e., per occupied room) will consider the entire
development occupied for purposes of calculating the fee.

Appendix B, § 8, of this chapter, is required before Final Plat approval or
issuance, and shall accompany the permit in non-subdivision areas where
improvements are made.
    (H)   Two-year warranty.
      (1)   The developer shall execute an agreement guaranteeing the required
public street improvements against defect in workmanship and materials for two
years after acceptance of such improvements by the Town, as documented by the

§ 155.047 BLOCKS AND LOTS.
   (A)   Minimum requirements. The following are considered the minimum
requirements for meeting the terms of this section; however, the Planning
Commission may grant a waiver from one or more of the design standards
contained in this section where deemed appropriate, if all conditions specified
in §
155.047(A)(1) through (4) are met.
      (1)   There are topographical constraints, such as the presence of
wetlands or critical areas, or other unusual conditions, such as the presence
of historic trees (as defined in Chapter 156 of this code), pertaining to the
particular parcel(s) of land that do not generally apply to other parcels in
the vicinity and that are not the result of actions of the applicant;
      (2)   The applicant demonstrates that compliance with one or more
provisions of this section is unreasonable, in conflict with the public
interest, or a practical impossibility;
      (3)   The modification will not adversely affect the reasonable
development of adjacent property; and
      (4)   In all cases, the public welfare and interests of the town shall be
protected and the general intent and spirit of the regulations preserved.
      (5)   Applications for a waiver shall be accompanied by written
justification explaining how all conditions are met. Financial disadvantage or
mere inconvenience shall not be considered sufficient justification for a
waiver.
      (6)   Each waiver request shall be evaluated on its own merits, and the
granting of a particular waiver shall not set a precedent for other waiver
requests.
      (7)   In approving a request for a waiver from the provisions of this
section, the Planning Commission may impose reasonable conditions that will, in
its judgment, justify such waiver and ensure that the intent of these Land
Development Regulations is upheld.
      (8)   A request for a waiver may be made on its own or in conjunction
with a Sketch Plan submittal. The Planning Commission shall review and act upon
the waiver request within 60 days of the date on which it is scheduled to be
considered.
   (B)   Blocks. The length, width, and shape of blocks shall be determined
with regard to:
      (1)   Provision of adequate building sites suitable to special needs of
the type of use (residential, commercial, industrial, other) contemplated.
      (2)   Zoning requirements as to lots sizes and dimensions.
      (3)   Needs for convenient access, circulation, control, and safety of
street traffic.
      (4)   Limitations and opportunities of topography and drainage features.
      (5)   Block lengths shall not exceed 1,400 feet.
      (6)   Eyebrow designs (partial circle cul-de- sacs) shall not be
permitted.
   (C)   Lots.
      (1)   Lots shall be accessible by improved public streets, except as
provided below.
         (a)   Postage stamp lots.
            1.   Individual units in attached buildings and the buildings
themselves located in commercial and mixed use developments may be located on
their own fee-simple lot, with access provided by a shared ingress/egress
easement. The intent is to allow a fee-simple lot subdivision exclusive to the
actual building pad or close proximity thereto in a “postage stamp” fashion
within the larger parcel boundary. This necessitates elimination of the normal
yard setback requirements and bufferyard requirements on these “postage stamp”
lots.
            2.   The shared ingress/egress easement and all required parking
for the use shall be located on property owned by a property owners’
association, with covenant restrictions insuring access and maintenance of the
same, and a method of collecting sufficient funds through assessments to owners
to cover the maintenance costs.
            3.   A copy of these restrictive covenants shall be approved by the
town prior to subdivision of the property into fee-simple lots.
            4.   Qualification for subdivision pursuant to these provisions is
contingent upon buildings located on the proposed lots meeting all applicable
building and fire code provisions and an approved drainage plan.
         (b)   Subdivision of residential lots containing more than one
dwelling unit.
            1.   Purpose. The purpose of these requirements is to provide for a
one-time subdivision of an existing lot of record containing multiple dwelling
units in order to enable the property owner to convey clear title to each lot
and dwelling unit. This is in recognition of unique settlement patterns of
coastal Lowcountry communities, where developed properties may contain more
than one dwelling unit.
            2.   Applicability. The provisions contained within this section
are only applicable to existing lots of record zoned RC-1, RC-2, RR, CC, R-l,
or R-2 and which currently contain two or more detached dwelling units, but not
accessory dwelling units approved and permitted by the town, and did so at the
time of the adoption of Ordinance No. 12074. Applicants for subdivisions of
residential lots containing more than one dwelling unit may be required to
provide documentation, such as a certificate of occupancy or tax records, to
this effect.
            3.   Reviewing authority. Plats submitted for subdivisions of lots
containing more than one dwelling unit shall be reviewed by the Town Engineer,
or his or her designee.
            4.   Standards. Each of the following standards must be met:
               a.   Regardless of total lot size and density provisions, each
existing lot of record may be subdivided only one time and into not more lots
than there are dwelling units. The subdivision plat shall clearly state that
the parcels created by this process shall not be divided again, except in full
compliance with all regulations in effect at that time.
               b.   Each lot should meet the minimum lot size and dimensional
standards of the zoning district in which it is located. However, in
recognition that many of the lots that contain multiple dwelling units and may
be eligible for this subdivision were platted prior to existing Zoning Code
regulations concerning minimum lot standards, lot size and dimensional
requirements may be reduced by no more than 20% in order to accomplish the
subdivision.
               c.   The lot shall be subdivided so that each existing dwelling
unit meets the minimum setback requirements of the zoning district in which it
is located. However, in recognition that many of the lots that contain multiple
dwelling units and may be eligible for this subdivision were platted prior to
existing Zoning Code regulations concerning minimum lot standards, setback
requirements may be reduced by no more than 50% in order to accomplish the
subdivision.
               d.   Flag lots are not permitted. However, lots may be located
in a configuration similar to a flag lot (one in front of the other), with
access to the rear lot provided through an access easement. Such access
easement shall be a minimum of 12 feet in width and shall provide a minimum of
14 feet unobstructed vertical clearance so as to accommodate emergency
vehicles, shall meet all applicable Fire Code provisions, and shall be approved
in writing by the Fire Chief, or his or her designee. The access easement shall
also be identified on the plat and shall run with the land in perpetuity.
               e.   The subdivision plat shall include a note stating that the
town is not responsible for either construction or routine maintenance of the
access easement.
               f.   Each lot must have Mount Pleasant Waterworks water and
sewer service.
               g.   Each dwelling unit must have its own individual utility
meters.
               h.   When access easements are required, joint access easements
shall be utilized where possible.
               i.   Each lot shall have an individual address provided by the
town.
               j.   All other applicable subdivision requirements shall be met.
      (2)   The lot size, width, shape, grade, and zoning orientation shall be
in proper relation to:
         (a)   Applicable zoning requirements;
         (b)   Street and block design;
         (c)   Existing and proposed topographical conditions; and
         (d)   The type of development and use contemplated.
      (3)   Flag lots shall not be permitted.
      (4)   The minimum lot width required for the zoning district must be met
as measured at the front yard setback building line.
      (5)   However, the minimum front building line setback for cul-de-sac
lots and the rear building line setback line for lots falling on a curve
section of a dedicated street may be indicated where the lot meets the minimum
width requirements and shown on the preliminary and final plats (or other plat
submitted for recording).
      (6)   All lots served by public water and sewers shall meet the minimum
area requirements for the zoning districts within which they are located.
      (7)   Lots that require the installation of individual wells and/or
individual septic tanks shall be required to meet standards established by the
County Health Department.
      (8)   Insofar as practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to
straight street lines, and radial to curved street lines.
      (9)   Excessive lot depth in relation to lot width shall be avoided.
         (a)   As a general rule, the depth of residential lots in all
districts except the R-4 Medium Density Residential District, and TH Townhouse
District shall not be less than one nor more than 2-1/2 times their width.
            1.   In the R-4 Medium Density Residential District, the depth of
residential lots shall not be less than one nor more than three times their
width. Due to the minimum lot area and dimensional requirements of this zoning
district, lots platted at the minimum 40-foot width must be exactly 100 feet in
depth in order to meet the minimum lot area requirement and not exceed the
width to depth ratio.
            2.   In the TH Townhouse District, the width to depth ratio shall
not apply. Due to the minimum lot area and lot width requirements of this
zoning district, lots platted at the minimum width cannot meet the minimum lot
area requirement without exceeding the width to depth ratio.
         (b)   Lot width shall be measured at the front building line setback,
except as provided in division (C)(5) of this section.
      (10)   Corner lots shall be of sufficient size and shape to permit
required building setback and orientation to both streets.
      (11)   Any remnants of land not meeting all the requirements of this
chapter for a lot shall be incorporated either in existing or proposed lots or
shallbe legally deeded to public use, if acceptable to the town.
      (12)   Each proposed lot shall be so designed as to allow the development
of a private driveway designed in accordance with
Chapter 156  serving the lot and sufficient space for off-street parking and
loading.
      (13)   Only parallel parking shall be permitted within the right-of-way.
      (14)   Lot area. The minimum lot area as required herein shall consist of
high ground land only, and shall not include land within the OCRM's designated
critical area or portions of lots located in lakes, ponds, lagoons, or similar
bodies of water, or other areas designated as wetlands on a certified plat of
the property.

§ 155.048 STREETS.
   (A)   General.
      (1)   The layout of the streets as to arrangement, character, width,
grade, and location may be required to conform to the town's Comprehensive Plan
and Official Map, to adjoiningstreet systems or adjoining properties, and to
the topography, natural features, and drainage systems to be provided.
         (a)   Connectivity to adjoining properties shall be required in most
instances.
         (b)   Stub Streets for the future connection to adjoining lands, as
approved by the town, shall be constructed along with other streets in the
development.
         (c)   Temporary endings shall be provided with a based turn around.
      (2)   Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by through
traffic will be discouraged.
      (3)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
collector or through street, the Planning Commission may require marginal
access streets, reverse frontage with screen planting, deep lots, or such other
treatment as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties
and to afford separation of through and local traffic.
      (4)   Half streets along property lines shall be prohibited.
      (5)   Dead-end streets. Dead-end streets reduce efficiency in the
transportation network, limit emergency access to lots on the street, and can
promote higher vehicle speeds due to the lack of intersections. The purpose in
limiting the length of dead-end streets is to ensure that new development is
designed to be inherently safe, walkable, and efficient for the facilitation of
traffic and pedestrian movement.
         (a)   Dead-end streets, designed to be so permanently, shall be no
longer than 800 feet, provided, however, that:
            1.   For low-density property with the zoning classifications of
RC-1, RC-2, CC, RR, R-1, and R-2, a maximum length of 1,000 feet shall be
allowed; and
            2.   Not more than 25 lots have sole access to the dead-end street.
         (b)   Street length shall be measured from the intersection of the
centerline of the new street right-of-way and the edge of the existing street
right-of-way, along the centerline of the new street, to the outermost pavement
edge at the terminus of the new street.
         (c)   All permanent dead-end streets shall be provided at the closed
end with a turnaround having a street property line diameter of 80 feet.
         (d)   The Planning Commission may grant a waiver from the provisions
of §
155.048(A)(5) herein above where deemed appropriate, if all conditions
specified in §
155.048(A)(5)(d)1. through 3. are met.
            1.   There are topographical constraints or other unusual
conditions pertaining to the particular parcel(s) of land that do not generally
apply to other parcels in the vicinity and that are not the result of actions
of the applicant;
            2.   The applicant demonstrates that compliance with the provisions
is unreasonable, in conflict with the public interest, or a practical
impossibility; and
            3.   In all cases, the public welfare and interest of the town
shall be protected and the general intent and spirit of the regulations
preserved.
            4.   Applications for a waiver shall be accompanied by written
justification explaining how all conditions are met. Financial disadvantage or
mere inconvenience shall not be considered sufficient justification for a
waiver.
            5.   Each waiver request shall be evaluated on its own merits, and
the granting of a particular waiver shall not set a precedent for other wavier
requests.
            6.   In approving a request for a waiver from these provisions, the
Planning Commission may impose reasonable conditions that will, in its
judgment, justify such waiver and ensure that the intent of these land
development regulations is upheld.
            7.   A request for a waiver may be made on its own or in
conjunction with a Sketch Plan submittal. The Planning Commission shall review
and act upon the waiver request within 60 days of the date on which it is
scheduled to be considered.
         (e)   Should the Planning Commission grant a waiver from these
requirements, as provided in §
155.048(A)(5)(d), the following conditions shall apply, in addition to any and
all conditions placed upon the approval by the Planning Commission.
            1.   A turnaround at the terminus of the street is required.
Turnarounds for emergency vehicles may also be required at various intervals
along the street. Determination regarding the necessity of such turnarounds
shall be made in consultation with the Fire Department. All turnarounds shall
meet National Fire Protection Association standards;
            2.   The street shall be designed in such a manner so as to limit
vehicle speed. This could include design elements such as planter islands,
medians, on-street parking, and/or raised crosswalks. All such design elements
shall be the maintenance responsibility of the neighborhood Property Owners’
Association. A note to this effect shall be included on all plans and plats
submitted to the town; and
            3.   Unless precluded by the manner in which adjacent properties
have developed, opportunities for future vehicular connectivity shall be
provided in one or more locations. The right-of-way for any stub street shall
extend to the property line. The location of such stub street(s) shall be at
the discretion of the Planning Commission, in consideration of practical
potential development scenarios involving the adjacent parcel(s).
      (6)   No street name shall be used that will duplicate or be confused
with the names of existing streets or subdivisions east of the Cooper River.
         (a)   Street names proposed by the subdivider shall be approved by E-
911.
         (b)   The subdivider shall submit verification that he or she has
obtained approval of the names from E-911.
         (c)    If the names of existing streets occur, the Planning, Land Use,
and Neighborhoods and Development Department shall require the subdivider to
substitute names free from duplication or confusion.
         (d)   The Planning, Land Use, and Neighborhoods and Development
Department shall maintain an up-to-date file of all street names in use east of
the Cooper River, and make such information available for guidance of
subdividers.
      (7)   Alleys.
         (a)   Alleys shall be permitted where required to provide for service
access, such as off- street parking, loading and unloading, consistent with and
adequate for the uses proposed.
         (b)   Where provided, alleys shall be privately owned and
appropriately noted on the final plat.
      (8)   Additional access to subdivisions.
         (a)   Roads of an existing subdivision shall not be used as the sole
means of ingress and egress in developing a new subdivision or extending an
existing one, unless granted by the Planning Commission.
         (b)   If, in judgment of the Planning Commission, the increased
traffic and noise would create a safety hazard or otherwise be detrimental to
residents of the existing subdivision, additional access shall be provided.
      (9)   Prior to acceptance by the town, rights- of-way and easements shall
be stabilized, grassed, cleaned and neatly trimmed.
      (10)   Prior to acceptance by the town, streets and drainage systems
shall be cleaned.
      (11)   Erosion and silt control measures shall be provided in accordance
with applicable standards.
      (12)   Landscaping, signs, or other objects shall not interfere with
needed sight distance.
      (13)   Private streets are not allowed for purposes of subdivision,
unless otherwise provided in §
155.047(C)(1)(a)-(d), in accordance with the provisions thereof.
      (14)   Street name signs and traffic control devices.
         (a)   Street name signs, pavement markings and other traffic-control
devices shall be installed at all intersections and other locations by the
subdivider.
         (b)   The design, construction, materials, and placement of all street
name signs shall conform to the requirements of the town.

shall be 60 feet.
         (b)   Minimum horizontal distance between edge of pavement, back of
curb or sidewalk, and the centerline of the planted tree shall be five feet;
the effect of which is to create a suitable “verge” or planting strip for the
trees.
      (c)   An approved root-barrier treatment shall be included in the street
tree planting to protect the roadway and/or sidewalk from future root damage.
This treatment may be in spot locations if design plans are sufficiently
detailed to allow this, or may be along an entire street segment. If street
trees are provided, the appropriate treatment shall be indicated on the
approved construction plans for new streets.
      (d)   Utility easement location. The location of utility easements shall
not conflict with these provisions. It will be the responsibility of the civil
engineering design professional to coordinate this function with the utility
provider.

§ 155.051 STORM DRAINAGE AND FLOOD AREAS.
   (A)   Storm drainage. A drainage system shall be designed and constructed by
the subdivider to provide for the proper drainage of the surface water of the
subdivision, and the drainage area of which it is a part, to permit the
unimpeded flow of natural watercourses.
      (1)   Design and construction standards.
         (a)   Drainage systems shall be designed and constructed by the
Subdivider/developer consistent with the design principals and standards
contained herein and established by SCDHEC- OCRM.
         (b)   Drainage systems in all cases shall conform to cross sections,
dimensions, erosion control measures and grades as shown on the approved
construction plans.
      (2)   The off-street drainage system shall include the watershed
affecting the subdivision, and shall be extended to a natural watercourse or
publicly maintained drainage facility that is adequate to receive the storm
drainage.
      (3)   Where adequate existing public storm sewers are reasonably
accessible as determined by the Director of the Department of Engineering and
Development Services, or his or her designee, require that the system proposed
for the land being subdivided be connected thereto.

         (a)   Where detention/retention ponds, lakes, and the like are
incorporated as part of the drainage system, the designing engineer shall
designate a minimum floor elevation.
         (b)   The minimum elevation shall be such that flooding shall not
result from a 100-year flood and in accordance with the town's Flood Damage
Prevention Chapter.
      (5)   Ditches.
         (a)   Open drainage ditches (a ditch is a waterway with side slopes 3:
1 or steeper) shall not be permitted in the town.
         (b)   Existing ditches above the OCRM critical line shall be piped,
filled, and regraded, when required by the Planning Commission based upon
staff's recommendation.
      (6)   The Subdivider/developer shall be responsible for providing
positive drainage for each lot individually as a part of the project
development.
         (a)   Individual lot drainage shall be detailed on the construction
plans and shall include, but not be limited to, yard drains for lawn areas,
side and rear yard features to include swales and a piped system of inlets and
other items necessary for the removal of water from the lot.
         (b)   It is not necessary to provide pad- ready lots during
subdivision development.
         (c)   However, positive drainage is required for each lot prior to
plat approval.
         (d)   Rear yard pipe systems are required and shall be designed to
accommodate ten- year storm events.
         (e)   Inlets shall be designed to minimize debris clogging.
         (f)   To promote responsible land development practices, it shall be
unlawful to:
            1.   Place fill along the outer perimeter of any subdivided
property;
            2.   Alter the ground above the existing elevation in a manner that
solely benefits the stormwater management of the subdivision and directly
impacts adjacent properties by way of casting surface water onto or impeding
the flow of surface runoff from another property; or
            3.   Place fill or impediments to surface flow within ten feet of
any pre-existing perimeter lot line abutting adjacent properties.
            4.   The provisions of this division shall not apply to the
following:
               a.   Existing subdivided lots recorded with the Office of the
Register of Deeds for Charleston County prior to the date of the adoption of
the ordinance enacting this division (Ord. 240004);
               b.   Internal lot lines to the subdivision which conform to a
unified grading plan;
               c.   Continuation of a planned development with the same
ownership as in a phased development;
               d.   When fill is used to ensure positive flow through a low-
lying areas without redirection of the pre-determined flow path; and
               e.   When fill is added to meet minimum road elevation when the
design incorporates stormwater management improvements to capture roadway
runoff and all offsite runoff to prevent impacts to adjacent properties.
      (7)   Upon application for Preliminary Plat, the applicant shall submit
such inspection fee for drainage systems based upon a per linear foot of
roadway centerline as may be established by Town Council.
      (8)   Filling, grading, permanent erosion control features, and
installation of drainage systems for lots and streets shall be provided prior
to Final Plat approval.
      (9)   Prior to the termination of the two-year warranty period, an
inspection of the piped drainage systems may be performed by a Town inspection
official.
         (a)   This inspection will be to ensure that all piped drainage
systems are free and clear of silt, sediment, and trash associated with
construction activities prior to acceptance by the Town.
         (b)   Under the Two-Year Warranty included in § 7 of Appendix B, the
developer is noted as responsible for maintaining free and clear drainage
systems during the warranty period.
         (c)   Therefore, the developer shall be responsible for:
            1.   Maintaining clean drainage systems during the two-year
warranty period; and
            2.   All costs associated with cleaning the piped drainage systems.
      (10)   Failure to respond to cleaning requests shall result in the
cessation of future phase work until such a time as the drainage system is
cleared and accepted by the inspection official.
   (B)   Flood areas. If the area being subdivided, or any part thereof, is
located within the boundary of a designated flood hazard area or coastal high

§ 155.054 GREENSPACE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION PLAN, AND ENVIRONMENTAL
GUIDELINES FOR LAND DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   A Greenspace Preservation and Protection Plan shall be provided in
accordance with these requirements for all new residential development
consisting of five acres and larger. The cumulative acreage of a multi-phased
project of five acres and larger shall be subject to these requirements.
Additionally, the provisions of this section shall not apply to nonresidential
subdivisions or land zoned MF, Multi-family Residential District.
      (1)   Intent and purpose. The desired outcome is to provide reasonable
utilization of the property while achieving the intent and purpose of this
Greenspace Preservation and Protection Plan, rather than to maximize the
development capacity of the property.
         (a)   Intent. The intent is to ensure that development is conducted in
a manner that is harmonious with the natural environment and maximizes the
quality and survivability of retained vegetation.
         (b)   Purpose. The purpose is to identify those natural features that
should be preserved so that development may occur around those features.
      (2)   Findings. The Town Council finds and declares the following:
         (a)   The existing vegetation requirements have resulted in the
excessive removal of natural vegetation during land development; and
         (b)   To remedy these conditions, an amendment to these regulations is
now necessary; and
         (c)   These regulations will include a tree and topographical plan
that will form the basis of the arrangement of development on the property, as
well as additional areas of preservation to ensure the adequate preservation of
natural vegetation along street frontage and internal to the development; and
         (d)   Council now deems these provi- sions are in the best interest of
the citizens of the town to accomplish these desires.
      (3)   Specific requirements.

shall be provided on collector and entry roads (60 feet or greater right-of-way
width).
               b.   In the absence of existing vegetation, replanting is
required, based on the density and diversity of the representative sampling of
100 square feet (ten by ten) of existing natural vegetation within close
proximity to the subject area, comprised of canopy and understory trees and
shrubs.
               c.   Easement treatment. If future utility installation is
anticipated, additional area shall be set aside so as not to interfere with the
natural and undisturbed buffer. Penetration for utilities should be
perpendicular to the buffer and limited to roadway access as a preferred
option.
            2.   Internal areas of preservation. A suitable amount of natural
vegetation shall be preserved within new development, based upon the following
requirements.
               a.   Percentage required.
                  i.   For developments where the minimum lot size is less than
10,000 square feet, a minimum of 30% of the developable land shall be set aside
for internal areas of preservation, although more may be required, based upon
site analysis provided by the tree and topographical exhibit. For the purposes
described herein, developable land shall not include fresh and saltwater
wetlands, retention ponds and rights-of-way.
                  ii.   For developments where the minimum lot size is equal to
or greater than 10,000 square feet, a minimum of 20% of the developable land
shall be set aside for internal areas of preservation, although more may be
required, based upon site analysis provided by the tree and topographical
exhibit. For the purposes described herein, developable land shall not include

requirements for all nonresidential development as of the effective date March
1, 2023. The 2024 updates shall be effective June 11, 2024. This provision
shall apply to nonresidential subdivisions, multi-family residential proposals,
HOA amenity centers, utilities and recreational facilities, and any mixed-use
developments where parcels are not proposed to be fee-simple residential lots.
      (1)   Intent and purpose. The desired outcome is to implement a program
to enhance commercial and nonresidential development through incentivizing and
establishing developmental standards in a manner that conforms to the strategic
and comprehensive initiatives for the preservation and protection of our
natural resources.
         (a)   Intent. The intent is to ensure development is conducted in a
manner that utilizes best environmental practices and encourages
environmentally responsible techniques through the use of low-impact site
design and construction methods.
         (b)   Purpose. The purpose is to use conservation practices, nature-
based solutions, encourage the use of advancing energy-saving technology,
support of eco-friendly materials, advocate for responsible construction
methods, improve wildlife habitat and biodiversity, enhance aesthetic value,

environment through site design and development.
      (2)   Findings. The Town Council finds and declares the following:
         (a)   Future development types and patterns will continue to consist
of new commercial, commercial re-development, multi-family, recreational and
economic development; and
         (b)   To implement a program to advance the use of low-impact
development is in conformance with the town strategic and comprehensive plans,
making these conditions an amendment to these regulations is now necessary; and
         (c)   These regulations will include a point system for measuring and
administering fair and consistent standards for implementing low-impact
development techniques. Points shall be pre-determined by the Environmental
Manager, or his or her designee, based upon effectiveness of pursing overall
program intent, proportional financial obligation, level of long-term
maintenance associated with the technique; and
         (d)   Four impacts are categorized as influential to the endeavors of
this program. These are:
            1.   Protect, restore, and conserve natural water resources;
            2.   Preserve and improve ecosystem biodiversity;
            3.   Improve community livability, mobility, aesthetics, and well-
being; and
            4.   Promote energy efficiency and sustainable material resources.

SUBCHAPTER B: ZONING DISTRICTS
PART 1: GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 156.020 INTRODUCTION.
   (A)   Generally. This subchapter describes the purpose of each base,
planned, floating, and overlay, zoning district in the town. The purpose
statements provide a foundation for the various standards applicable to the
various zoning districts and assist in interpretation of the district
standards. The purpose statements are not regulations, but rather a summary of
the district character and regulatory intent.
   (B)   Allowed uses. The particular uses allowed in each zoning district are
set forth in Subchapter C. Allowed uses in a PD District are specified in the
rezoning ordinance that establishes the PD District and any amendments thereto.
   (C)   Development standards. Development standards for the base districts,
including setbacks and height limits, are specified in the subpart or section
associated with each zoning district. Development standards for PD Districts
are specified in the rezoning ordinance associated with a particular site.
   (D)   Additional district regulations. Additional supplemental regulations
for each district, where applicable, are also included in this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.021 DISTRICTS ESTABLISHED.
   (A)   In order to accomplish the purposes set forth in §
156.002, the municipality is divided into the zoning districts identified in
Table 156.021-2: Zoning Districts and described in Parts 2, 3, and 4 of this
subchapter.
   (B)   Table 156.021-1 describes the three types of zoning districts
established in this subchapter.
 
Table 156.021-1: Descriptions of District Types
District Type Description
              Base districts establish uniform use, dimensional, and
Base          development standards for each class or kind of building,
              structure, or use in a district.
              Planned districts are a special type of base district that
              accommodate innovative developments that cannot be achieved in a
Planned       standard base district. Planned districts allow for adjustments
              to generally applicable use, dimensional, and development
              standards. Development in planned districts is subject to a site
              plan approved as part of a rezoning application.
              Overlay districts establish additional standards that supplement
Overlay       the base, planned, or floating districts. All standards
              applicable to the underlying base, planned, or floating zoning
              district apply in addition to the overlay district regulations.

   (G)   Variations to applicable dimensional standards.
      (1)   Applicability. This division (G) applies to all parcels zoned ED
District, including parcels that are zoned for economic development use within
a Planned Development District; provided, however, that the provisions shall
only apply to the economic development use as specified in the Use Table when
other permitted uses are also allowed on the parcel.
      (2)   Types of variations allowed. In general, all applicable off-street
parking, loading, bufferyard, and supplemental regulations apply to uses within
this district; provided, however, that variations may be made to such
provisions during the design review process as may be necessary to accomplish
unique operational requirements or characteristics inherent with individual
businesses. An example may be the allowance of additional paved parking for an
office use with a significant number of cubicles, sometimes referred to as a
“cube farm” that has higher daily parking demand, as opposed to a shopping
center’s desire for additional paved parking to accommodate sales on one or two
days a year.
      (3)   Setbacks. All setbacks may be adjusted during the design review
process.
      (4)   Justification in the record of approval/notations on plans.
         (a)   Justification for such variations from the normal development
standards shall be specified on the approved plans and/or elsewhere in the
approval record.
         (b)   Variations from the prescribed development standards shall only
be allowed if the appearance and form of improvements remain consistent, to the
maximum extent possible, with the general context of the area in which the use
is located to ensure an acceptable coexistence with the neighboring uses.

SUBPART 2.4: SCW (SHEM CREEK  WATERFRONT DISTRICTS)
§ 156.090 SCW PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the SCW, Shem Creek Waterfront, Districts is
to implement the 2019 Shem Creek Area Management Plan by retaining and
protecting the town's:
      (1)   Working waterfront such that the important industries of commercial
fishing and historic water-based recreational uses remain part of the town's
heritage, economy, and quality of life;
      (2)   Waterfront entertainment, dining, and other hospitality venues
along with other supportive water-based commercial operations, including
excursions, vessel rentals, and seafood sales; and
      (3)   Historic, locally-based office and commercial uses in a manner
compatible with the historic character of Shem Creek with nearby marshlands and
wetland habitats.
   (B)   Findings.
      (1)   The 2019 Shem Creek Area Management Plan recommended preserving the
unique history, nature, and economy of Shem Creek and its character as a
working waterfront and destination for town residents, employees, and visitors.
      (2)   Since the 1930s, Shem Creek has been home to commercial scale
water-dependent commercial activities, including fishing, shrimping,
recreational boating, and fuel dispensing, among others. Since the 1960s, these
uses have diminished along the creek but remain viable along the creek today.
      (3)   In the 1960s, Shem Creek began its recent history of restaurants,
recreational boating opportunities, and other new uses available to town
residents and visitors, and as a source of local employment opportunities.
      (4)   Shem Creek's distinguished history has included limited, but
compatible, land uses that provide investment and employment opportunities to
town residents, including small offices and restaurants with opportunities to
view and experience the town's unique marsh environments and habitats.
      (5)   Maintaining the historic design features and scale of the built
environment along Shem Creek is critical to facilitating the objectives and
goals of the Shem Creek Area Management Plan.
      (6)   The Area Management Plan further found that incompatible land uses
have encroached upon working waterfront areas of Shem Creek, to the point where
its use and viability as a working waterfront is in peril.
      (7)   Based on the findings and objectives of the Shem Creek Area
Management Plan, it is important to preserve and provide opportunities for
compatible historic land uses like restaurants, water-based recreational
activities, and other compatible supporting land uses.
      (8)   Based on the findings and objectives of the Area Management Plan,
it is important to preserve and provide opportunities for improving locally-
based non-residential uses that are compatible with nearby marshland habitats
and environmental resources.

SUBPART 2.5: WG-C (WATERFRONT  GATEWAY–COOPER RIVER DISTRICT)
§ 156.105 PURPOSE AND GOALS.
   (A)   The purpose and intent of the WG-C, Waterfront Gateway–Cooper River,
District is to provide a mechanism for achieving a cohesive, vibrant, active,
and lively waterfront gathering place that acts as a destination for residents
and visitors alike, providing opportunities for employment, housing, lodging,
entertainment, shopping, and dining.
   (B)   The following goals are hereby stated to accomplish the purpose and
intent of the district.
      (1)   This district should seek to take optimum advantage of the town's
waterfront as an opportunity for place making, cultural district, and a tourist
destination. This district will better connect Memorial Waterfront Park with
Patriot's Point and its attractions, as well as connecting back to Coleman and
Johnnie Dodds Boulevards. The Waterfront Gateway District should be an
integrated district with a network of pedestrian paths and streetscapes,
including walks along the waterfront. Land uses should be mixed, including
hotels and lodging facilities, tourist attractions, recreational and marine
facilities, restaurants, and entertainment venues. The creation of public
spaces and outdoor retail environments is encouraged, and events should be
programmed to help keep the district active and lively. Developments should
promote internal trip capture and alternative means of transportation, as this
area has limited transportation access. Land use in this Waterfront Gateway
District will be evaluated based upon transportation impacts. Also, as the term
"Gateway" implies, the appearance of the Waterfront Gateway District must
present an attractive image for the Mount Pleasant community and avoid any
monolithic or out-of-scale structures.
      (2)   The Waterfront Gateway District should be a destination for
tourism, business conventions, events, culture, and arts for Mount Pleasant to
increase the attractiveness of the community for all ages.
      (3)   A high priority for town residents is to expand public access to
the water. This concept includes increasing public access to and views of
natural waterways; creating opportunities for boating, fishing, and other
recreation; and integrating first-class public spaces near natural waterways.
It involves preserving existing view corridors of surrounding water and marsh
from public streets and other public places and developing new and improved
public parks and gathering places along waterfront locations by providing
additional facilities and potential new locations for water access.
      (4)   Promote a "Park Once" policy in the district. Circulation within
the area should be primarily on foot or bicycle, though use of trolleys or
other transit services is encouraged. Development of intermodal transportation
facilities, to include both land-based and water-based transportation options,
is also encouraged. While many people will arrive at the district by car, once
they arrive they should be able to park their vehicles and leave them in one
location. Another advantage of a Park Once Policy is that it encourages shared
parking arrangements, reducing the amount of land needed for parking and
freeing up land for quality, compact, mixed use development.

§ 156.106 LOCATION.
   (A)   This zoning district classification is available for implementation on
parcels located west of Magrath Darby Boulevard and all properties located

(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.107 USE MIXING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Generally. In order to create a district that is successful and
dynamic, an appropriate mix of complementary uses located in relatively close
proximity to each other is required.
   (B)   Horizontal or vertical mixed use. Uses may be horizontally or
vertically mixed. In order to facilitate the mixture of commercial and
residential uses in the same building, residential uses may occur on the street
level or any building level containing commercial uses.
   (C)   Proximity of different uses. In order to accomplish the goal of mixed
use in a horizontally mixed use development, different uses should, to the
greatest extent possible, be located one-quarter mile or less from each other.
   (D)   Land use groups. The required mixture of uses shall include uses from
the following four land use groups, as specified in Table 156.107-1: WG-C Use
Mixing Requirements and as allowed by
Subchapter C:
      (1)   Group 1. Restaurant, entertainment, recreation, and civic uses;
      (2)   Group 2. Retail uses;
      (3)   Group 3. Office and hotel uses; and
      (4)   Group 4. Residential uses.
   (E)   Parcels one acre or less in size. The mixed use requirement shall not
apply on parcels one acre or less in size where a mixture of uses is not
feasible. However, aggregation of multiple smaller parcels is highly encouraged
in order to promote a more effective utilization of land in creating well-
designed projects, connected and unified in design and function. The maximum
benefit allowed by the provisions of this district will result from such
aggregation of properties.
   (F)   Subdivision. Subdivision of property in order to subvert the use
mixing requirement is prohibited.
   (G)   Phasing requirements.
      (1)   Since a goal of this district is to achieve a variety of uses that
will create a vibrancy and attractiveness of use by the public, it is important
for the first phase of a mixed use development to include uses from at least
two land use groups specified in division (D) above.
      (2)   In consideration that market factors may make this provision
difficult to achieve, a phasing plan shall be submitted for approval in
conjunction with a concept plan or sketch plan, as applicable, for any
development proposing not to include two or more uses in the first phase of
construction.

§ 156.108 DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   High quality public realm. In this district, form is as important as
use and a high quality public realm is critical in successfully creating an
environment in which people want to live, work, and play. Primary entrances to
buildings shall be located near the public realm streetscape. An emphasis
should be placed upon a high degree of design quality for the building façade
and a strong interaction between the buildings and the public realm. Public
spaces, such as plazas, should be integrated with surrounding development.
   (B)   Design review required. All development within the WG-C is subject to
the design review process as provided in this chapter. However, in order to
achieve the goals of the WG-C, when in conflict, the site development
requirements as set forth in this subpart take precedence over those found
within other subchapters.
   (C)   Siting and design of buildings and parking areas. Siting and design of
buildings and parking areas shall be closely evaluated to ensure avoidance of
the "silo effect" of buildings surrounded by asphalt parking lots with no
meaningful relationship to adjacent developments.
   (D)   Civic uses. Because of the nature of their uses, build-to lines,
setbacks, and other design elements for civic uses shall be determined through
the design review process.
   (E)   Interconnectivity.
      (1)   Streets should be interconnected where possible. Site plans should
provide opportunities for future interconnectivity if such cannot be
accomplished at the time of development.
      (2)   Cul-de-sacs or dead end streets are not permitted unless they have
a terminal vista of the waterfront.
   (F)   Alternative modes of transportation.
      (1)   A development shall accommodate a variety of modes of
transportation.
      (2)   A pedestrian/bicycle system and related amenities shall be provided
in strategic locations, and shall be interconnected both within the development
and to other adjacent developments.
      (3)   Provision of a shuttle service is highly encouraged. Such service
should be coordinated with surrounding properties, and all developments should
include an area designated for shuttle access.
      (4)   Provision of bus shelters is highly encouraged and will require
coordination with CARTA early in the development process. Bus shelter location
and design shall be subject to approval through the design review process.
   (G)   Terminal vistas.
      (1)   Properties that terminate views down streets shall be identified
during the design review process, and will be held to a higher architectural
standard along this visible façade.
      (2)   Such identified properties are those that are located across from
side streets that intersect the primary street and terminate or intersect and
continue at a different angle. Properties that are at the end of a straightaway
on a primary street shall also meet this requirement.
   (H)   Avian habitats. As the Cooper River Waterfront Gateway District area
is an important stopover site for migratory birds, required landscaping shall
incorporate bird-friendly plants with an intention to create or augment habitat
areas.
   (I)   Open space. A minimum of 10% of the total project area shall be
reserved as contiguous open space. A portion of this open space is encouraged
to be natural open space in order to serve as wildlife corridors/conservation
areas.
   (J)   Public realm. An engaging public realm is critical to the success of
this district and its importance cannot be overstated. To this end, a high
degree of design and material quality is expected. The various public realm
components are subject to approval through the design review process, but shall
generally adhere to the specifications listed below.
      (1)   Waterfront public walkways and pedestrian waterfront connections.
Recognizing the importance of public access to the waterfront, construction and
dedication of a public walkway is required for properties adjacent to the
river/marsh. The walkway shall be constructed and dedicated prior to approval
of a final plat for any portion of the proposed development. If a final plat is
not required, the walkway shall be constructed and dedicated prior to issuance
of a certificate of occupancy for any portion of the proposed development. A
strong emphasis shall also be placed on areas that connect pedestrians from the
street to the waterfront. Such pedestrian waterfront connections are required
for properties adjacent to the river/marsh. Generally, these areas shall
consist of the following elements:
         (a)   Dimensions and location of waterfront public walkways.
Waterfront public walkways shall be generally located parallel to the shoreline
and shall include an open area with a minimum width of ten feet and an average
width of 40 feet measured landward from the critical line, which may include
the critical line buffer where such buffer is required. Waterfront public
walkways shall include a primary path or boardwalk with a minimum clear width
of ten feet, located to the greatest extent possible adjacent to the shoreline.
The primary path may be located within the required critical line buffer.
Secondary paths may be provided and shall be at least six feet in width.
         (b)   Dimensions and location of pedestrian waterfront connections.
Pedestrian waterfront connections shall be generally located perpendicular to
the shoreline, shall include an open area with a minimum width of 30 feet, and
shall include a primary path with a minimum clear width of eight feet. The
number and location of pedestrian waterfront connections shall be determined
through the design review process.
         (c)   Landscaping. Public walkways and waterfront connections shall be
planted with high quality native or naturalized coastal vegetation, to include
of a minimum of one 2.5-inch caliper canopy tree for approximately every 100
linear feet of area in addition to other appropriate landscaping, to include
understory trees, shrubs, and grasses. Lawn area may be used but it must remain
accessible.
         (d)   Acreage to count towards open space requirements. Waterfront
public walkways may satisfy all or a portion of the open space requirements of
this section.
      (2)   Streetscape. As another critical component of the public realm, a
strong emphasis shall be placed on the appearance of the streetscape.
Generally, this area shall consist of the following elements:
         (a)   Landscaping. Three canopy trees of a minimum four-inch caliper
shall be required for each 100 linear feet of street frontage using species
approved during the design review process. Such tree types shall be consistent
with each block and evenly spaced, with exceptions made for curb cuts,
utilities, and other obstructions. Planters shall be required as a design
element to soften the building exterior and enhance the streetscape appearance.
         (b)   Relationship of buildings to the street. Changes in elevation
between the building front and the street shall be avoided to the fullest
extent possible. Stairs abutting the sidewalk may be utilized to accommodate a
change in grade elevation. Stair design shall be integrated into the overall
streetscape design.
         (c)   Sidewalks. There shall be a public sidewalk at least ten feet in
width located on both sides of all streets within the WG-C, either within the
right-of-way or within a pedestrian easement on private property.
      (3)   Site furnishings.
         (a)   To ensure consistency throughout the WG-C, site furnishings
should be similar to the current styles used at the Memorial Waterfront Park,
as illustrated in Figure 156.108-1: WG-C Site Furnishings.
         (b)   Permanent or temporary design features shall not impede
pedestrian access on the public sidewalk.
         (c)   Benches shall be located in visible and convenient locations.
The public realm should also include trash receptacles at sufficient intervals,
as well as strategically placed bicycle parking facilities.
         (d)   All site furnishings shall be installed at the time of
construction.

IMAGES/0-0-0-12937.png]
 
      ( 4)   Lighting. At a minimum, safety lighting shall be provided along
the length of the walkways and waterfront connections and shall be installed at
the time of construction. To ensure consistency throughout the Waterfront
Gateway District, the streetscape shall include light fixtures similar to those
currently existing in the area, as illustrated in Figure 156.108-2: WG-C Light
Fixtures.

      (5)   Signs. Standard wayfinding signs shall be placed in strategic
locations throughout the public realm. Wayfinding signs are intended to convey
navigational directions to pedestrians and bicyclists.
      (6)   Maintenance responsibility. The waterfront public walkways and
pedestrian waterfront connections shall be established within a recorded public
access easement. The waterfront public walkways and pedestrian waterfront
connections, as well as all site furnishings/public amenities, shall be
installed and maintained by the property owner.
   (K)   Bufferyards. In general, bufferyard requirements on individual parcels
are specified in Subchapter D; except that front bufferyards are not required
in lieu of the streetscape requirements contained in this subpart. However,
contingent upon approval through the design review process, developments
providing opportunities for interconnectivity with adjacent parcels may forgo
side and rear bufferyards along parcel lines.
   (L)   Density. The maximum residential density is 12 dwelling units per
acre.
   (M)   Side yard setback. A minimum side yard setback is not required.
   (N)   Rear yard setback. The minimum rear yard setback is 15 feet, except as
provided below:
      (1)   Contingent upon approval through the design review process,
development utilizing an integrated site plan involving multiple parcels may
forgo rear yard setbacks along parcel lines.
      (2)   Setbacks for civic uses shall be in accordance with the provisions
of division (D), above.
   (O)   Elevated buildings.
      (1)   Buildings in flood zones.
         (a)   In order to project a pedestrian-friendly streetscape, it is
highly recommended that alternatives to elevating non-residential and mixed use
buildings located in "A" flood zones be pursued. This may be accomplished by
floodproofing or altering the elevation of the finished floor inside the
building.
         (b)   However, in the event that these techniques are not feasible and
the building must be elevated, such elevation may not exceed the minimum
elevation required, which includes two feet of additional freeboard. To the
greatest extent possible, elevating the building shall not compromise the width
and integrity of the public realm.
      (2)   Buildings elevated for parking. Buildings may be elevated to
accommodate grade-level parking, pursuant to the provisions of §
156.109(F).
   (P)   Gated access. Gated access to a development is prohibited, although
gated access to parking areas may be permitted subject to the design review
process if access to open space is not impeded.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.109 PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Shared parking requirements for mixed use developments. Because one of
the primary functions of the district is to provide a pedestrian-oriented
experience and an overabundance of parking areas would detract from this goal,
parking within a mixed-use development shall be shared for all uses.
   (B)   Parking for non-residential uses. Required parking is calculated
utilizing the shared parking standards established by the Urban Land Institute
(ULI). ULI parking standards must meet a Level of Service (LOS) A or B for
walking distance. If shared parking standards cannot be achieved, the ratios
specified in Subchapter F, Part 2 apply.
   (C)   Parking for residential uses. Parking spaces for residential uses is
limited to a range of a minimum of 1.5 spaces and a maximum of 2.0 spaces per
dwelling unit.
   (D)   On-street parking.
      (1)   On-street parking is allowed within the district if it is depicted
on an on-street parking plan map, submitted with the development site plan, and
approved through the design review process.
      (2)   The on-street parking plan shall include detailed design guidelines
for the spaces, specifying items such as paving materials and the manner in
which the spaces shall be identified.
   (E)   Design of parking lots and loading areas. All parking lots and
exterior loading areas shall be buffered from any adjacent pedestrian way by
planting street trees and providing a landscaped area with a continuous row of
high shrubs, or a fence or seating wall.
   (F)   Parking structures.
      (1)   Screening required. All parking structures that front primary
streets or relate to the public realm shall be screened. Screening may include
residences, retail storefronts, other nonresidential uses, landscaping, or
other appropriate architectural features as determined through the design
review process.
      (2)   Sloping floors. Sloping floors shall not be visible from primary
streets.
      (3)   Vehicular access. Wherever possible, vehicular access to parking
structures shall be from side streets or alleys and not directly from the
primary street.
      (4)   Incentive for parking structures. There is no maximum parking limit
for non-residential uses if a parking structure is utilized on site.
   (G)   Parking for outdoor dining uses. Parking for outdoor dining uses shall
be as provided in Subchapter F, Part 2 for restaurant use and not based upon
square footage of the outdoor use area.
   (H)   Parking for streetside dining uses. Additional parking is not required
for streetside dining uses.

PART 4: OVERLAY DISTRICTS
SUBPART 4.1: MIXED USE CENTERS OVERLAY DISTRICT
§ 156.180 PURPOSE.
   (A)   This subpart is intended to implement the 2019-2029 Town of Mount
Pleasant Comprehensive Plan by shifting from high-intensity linear development
to the creation of more compact community-building centers of activity through
the redevelopment of mixed-use centers.
   (B)   This subpart defines mixed-use centers by their location, situation,
and function within the town.
      (1)   The neighborhood and community mixed use centers are local mixed-
use centers at the neighborhood and community scale. Their main purpose is the
support of surrounding neighborhoods and creation of community space.
      (2)   The redevelopment centers are typically older commercial and multi-
family areas that may be approaching the end of their development cycle. The
goal is that redevelopment in these areas captures the essence of the community
mixed use centers, but at a larger scale, providing community spaces along with
businesses, attainable and senior housing, and employment opportunities.

PI-2, located within each geographic subdistrict area, as illustrated on the
maps in this Subpart.
   (B)   The use regulations in the Mixed Use Centers Overlay District apply to
all lots subject to the overlay.
   (C)   All other provisions of the Mixed Use Centers Overlay District apply
to:
      (1)   The establishment of a new use on a previously undeveloped lot;
      (2)   A change in use of a developed lot;
      (3)   The construction of any new building or structure and its
associated site improvements, if all project costs exceed $250,000; and
      (4)   The renovation, repair, alteration, or other improvement of an
existing structure that exceeds the lesser of:
         (a)   $250,000 in total project costs; or
         (b)   50% of its replacement value at the time of renovation, repair,
or alteration. Replacement value of existing principal structures is determined
using the taxable/use value of improvement established by the Charleston County
Assessor’s Office.

SUBPART 4.2: NP-OD (NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTER PRESERVATION OVERLAY DISTRICT)
§ 156.200 PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of the NP-OD, Neighborhood Character Preservation
Overlay District, is to:
      (1)   Acknowledge the inherent attributes of older, established
neighborhoods and their associated characteristics of walkable development
patterns, urban design, streetscape, and architecture that contribute to the
identity of Mount Pleasant;
      (2)   Allow for the continued construction, addition to, and renovation
of homes located in these older neighborhoods of Mount Pleasant, nearest to
Coleman Boulevard, Shem Creek, and the Historic District, by creating a special
overlay zoning classification with flexible development standards that allow
for the continuation of the distinctive and identifiable attributes of a given
neighborhood; and
      (3)   Provide protection for persons and property within this district
against flooding and improve drainage.
   (B)   Findings. In furtherance of the stated purpose, Town Council finds and
declares the following.
      (1)   This district is in the older part of the town developed before the
current ordinances were enacted. Subsequently, many of the lots and structures
are nonconforming.
      (2)   The homes located in this area are considerably smaller than new
homes being built on similarly zoned lots elsewhere in the town.
      (3)   Creating a special overlay district will enable homeowners to add
porches and increased unenclosed living areas to homes that are currently at or
over the front yard setback required.
      (4)   The area where the impervious surface limit applies is largely
developed and is in an older and traditional part of town that is naturally
prone to flooding. The impervious surface limit will serve to reduce flooding
and improve drainage in this described area.

   (C)   Impervious surface coverage. No more than 40% of a lot may be covered
by impervious surfaces as defined in Subchapter N.
   (D)   Yard requirements. For properties located within the Old Village
Historic District, principal structure setback distances shall be determined
during the certificate of appropriateness review process. Justification for
setback distances shall be based on the established pattern of historic
principal structures on adjacent lots and the block with respect to the overall
character of the streetscape and district by citing the specific historic
principal structures and setback used to determine the setback for new
construction, additions, or alterations.
   (E)   Accessory structure height. Accessory structures, including detached
accessory dwelling units, are limited to the maximum height specified in §
156.424 or the height of the principal structure, whichever is less.
   (F)   Accessory structure location.
      (1)   Single-frontage and corner lots. For parcels abutting one right-of-
way or two rights-of-way intersecting one another, accessory structures shall

Guidelines.
      (2)   Construction on public property.
         (a)   The HDPC shall not approve any porches, steps, posts, fences,
walks, or other appurtenances extending over, on, or within a public sidewalk,
alleyway, or street right-of-way, unless the particular item is necessary for
the authentic restoration or maintenance of the particular project and will not
impede pedestrian or vehicular traffic or constitute a public safety hazard.
The preceding shall not allow approval of on-street parking located in the
public right-of-way.
         (b)   Any area restored or maintained on, over, or within a public
sidewalk or public alley under the authority hereof shall be the responsibility
of the owner.
         (c)   The owner's restoration, reconstruction, or maintenance of any
such item within such area shall constitute the owner's agreement to protect
and hold the town harmless against any and all liability, cost, damage, or
expense suffered or sustained by the town, as a result of, or growing out of,
the restoration, reconstruction, or maintenance.
      (3)   Maintenance and repair.
         (a)   Nothing in this subpart shall be construed to prevent the
ordinary maintenance or repair of any exterior architectural feature that does
not involve a change in design, material, color, or outer appearance thereof.
         (b)   Nor shall it be construed to prevent the construction,
reconstruction, alteration, restoration, or demolition of any such feature that
the Building Official or similar official certifies is required by the public
safety because of an unsafe or dangerous condition.
      (4)   Building area ratio (BAR) requirement.
         (a)   New construction of residential dwellings, including additions
and their accessory use buildings, are subject to a building area ratio (BAR).
         (b)   The BAR is calculated by ascertaining the total of number of
square feet of building areas taken on a horizontal plane, specifically
including any cantilevered areas, of the principal building and all accessory
buildings (except those less than 144 square feet in area), exclusive of
uncovered porches (decks), terraces, and steps.
            1.   Building area in two-story rooms (i.e., cathedral ceilings) is
counted twice.
            2.   Building area in a crawl space is not counted.
            3.   Garage area is counted, regardless of whether it is located
underneath a house or in an accessory building.
         (c)   The BAR shall not comprise more than 50% of the lot size.
However, a minimum house size of 2,500 square feet is allowed regardless of lot
size, if 40% lot coverage is not exceeded.
            1.   The maximum building area, including accessory structures, is
5,500 square feet regardless of lot size.
            2.   For lots containing tidally influenced saltwater wetlands/
marsh or open water beyond the delineated DHEC-OCRM critical line, BAR shall be
calculated using only the "high ground" of the lots and specifically excluding
the wetlands/ marsh or open water.
         (d)   At least 10% of the BAR must be comprised of porches.
         (e)   Exceptions.
            1.   The BAR shall not apply to garage space located under a house
when the house is required to be elevated a minimum of eight feet above
finished grade in order to comply with FEMA regulations.
            2.   The BAR shall not apply to basement space where a sub-grade
basement can be accommodated without the use of fill.
            3.   The BAR shall not apply to alterations that do not change the
massing of a structure. Examples include, but are not limited to, finished
space in an attic or under an elevated structure.
      (5)   Historic buildings.
         (a)   Historic buildings located on historic properties, as defined
herein, may be considered conforming with respect to any height, setback, yard,
area, or other dimension found by the HDPC to be of historic significance.
         (b)   In this regard, these existing conditions may supersede any
conflicting standard set forth in the zoning district in which the building is
located, and may be applied to the building and the site in making future
determinations of conformity as to the existing building or any changes
consistent with an approved certificate of appropriateness.
      (6)   Parking requirements. Notwithstanding other provisions found
elsewhere in this chapter, these parking requirements shall apply to all
residential use properties located within the OVHD.
         (a)   A minimum of two off-street parking spaces per residence is
required.
         (b)   Additional spaces for homes over 2,500 square feet of BAR are
required at the rate of one space per every 1,000 square feet, or portion
thereof, of BAR over 2,5000 square feet of BAR.
         (c)   Required off-street parking shall be allowed to be parked in
tandem and encroach within required yard requirements.

SUBPART 4.4: SB-OD (SWEETGRASS  BASKET OVERLAY DISTRICT)
§ 156.230 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Generally. The SB-OD, Sweetgrass Basket Overlay District, is intended
to:
      (1)   Provide development regulations consistent with those of Charleston
County;
      (2)   Protect the sweetgrass basket-making culture by allowing their sale
through traditional roadside stands;
      (3)   Preserve the rural character of the community;
      (4)   Provide interconnectivity between and within developments; and
      (5)   Provide an access management plan for safe and efficient traffic
flow.
   (B)   Residential Area. The Residential Area is intended to maintain the
large-lot development that has been the tradition and is characteristic of lots
in the area at the time of original adoption of the SBOD.
   (C)   Old Georgetown Road Loop Office Area. This area is intended solely for
low-intensity professional office uses having minimal impact on adjacent
residences due to limited hours of operation and traffic generated primarily by
automobiles rather than delivery trucks, but also fulfilling the intent for
access management by encouraging access from Old Georgetown Road and shared
access if from U.S. Highway 17 North.
   (D)   Village Commercial Area, from Old Georgetown Road to Hamlin Road. This
area is intended to allow low-intensity commercial uses, and to provide safe,
convenient, and efficient traffic movement by utilizing secondary roads and
creating interconnectivity among developed parcels, thereby reducing the need
for traffic trips onto U.S. Highway 17 North.
   (E)   Village Commercial Area, from Hamlin Road to Porchers Bluff Road. This
area is intended to allow appropriate commercial uses in conjunction with the
existing residential uses and to provide safe, convenient, and efficient
traffic movement by implementing an appropriate access management plan, thereby
reducing the need for vehicle trips onto U.S. Highway 17 North.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.231 DISTRICT BOUNDARY.
   (A)   The lots subject to the SB-OD regulations are all those within the
area generally bounded by a portion of the Isle of Palms Connector, U.S.
Highway 17 North, Porchers Bluff Road, and Rifle Range Road, as more accurately
depicted on the Zoning Map.
   (B)   The SB-OD is further distinguished by a Residential Area, an Old
Georgetown Road Loop Area, and two Village Commercial Areas, which are more
fully described below and depicted on

all those not included in the Old Georgetown Road Loop Area or in the Village
Commercial Area.
      (2)   Old Georgetown Road Loop Office Area. Properties included in the
Old Georgetown Road Loop office area are those located between U.S. Highway 17
North and Old Georgetown Road.
      (3)   Village Commercial Area, from Old Georgetown Road to Hamlin Road.
This Village Commercial Area applies to the area 400 feet in depth from the
edge of the right-of-way on properties having frontage on U.S. Highway 17
North.
      (4)   Village Commercial Area, from Hamlin Road to Porchers Bluff Road.
This Village Commercial Area applies to the area 400 feet in depth, from the
edge of the right-of-way on properties having frontage on U.S. Highway 17
North.

special exception uses, subject to their respective approval processes; and
      (2)   Lots in the Old Georgetown Road Loop Office Area or Village
Commercial Areas may utilize uses provided in the CC, Community Conservation
District, including accessory, conditional and special exception uses, subject
to those approval processes.
   (C)   Commercial uses.
      (1)   In order to maintain the intent of the Old Georgetown Road Loop
Office Area, commercial uses shall be limited to those permitted in the OP-1,
Office Professional-1, zoning district, including accessory, conditional, and
special exception uses, subject to those approval processes;
      (2)   Hours of operation for uses located within the Old Georgetown Road
Loop Office Area shall be limited to between 7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m.;
      (3)   In the Village Commercial areas, properties with frontage on
Highway 17 may have commercial uses within 400 feet of the highway right-of-way
consistent with NC-2, Neighborhood Commercial-2, zoning district, including
accessory, conditional, and special exception uses, subject to those approval
processes. If the property extends beyond that depth, the remainder of the
property shall be considered to be in the Residential Area, with those allowed
uses;

§ 156.234 BUFFERYARD REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Planting of sweetgrass encouraged. To help fulfill preservation of the
sweetgrass basketmaking craft, planting and cultivation of all grasses used in
their making is encouraged.
   (B)   Old Georgetown Road Loop Office Area and Village Commercial Area, from
Old Georgetown Road to Hamlin Road. Buffers are required in accordance with
Subchapter D.
   (C)   Village Commercial Area, from Hamlin Road to Porchers Bluff Road. All
bufferyards shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of Subchapter
D; provided, however, that the width of these bufferyards may be reduced by a
maximum of one-third of the required width, if the area of all required
bufferyards exceeds 30% of the area of the site. Bufferyards adjacent to
residentially zoned properties may not be reduced.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.235 COMMERCIAL SITE DESIGN STANDARDS
   (A)   Village Commercial Area, from Old Georgetown Road to Hamlin Road.
      (1)   Site design of one parcel shall include interconnectivity for
parking and access with the adjoining parcels, if possible.
      (2)   Stub-out connections for future shared parking and access are
required if such interconnectivity cannot be achieved in the current design.
   (B)   Village Commercial Area, from Hamlin Road to Porchers Bluff Road.
      (1)   A more rural visual context. The design guidelines in Subchapter H
shall generally be followed with the emphasis and exceptions provided herein.
The intent of the design requirements for the SB-OD is to reflect a more rural
visual context rather than a suburban or urban look.
         (a)   Therefore, building materials should consist of cementitious
siding to give the appearance of wood siding rather than brick or adorned
masonry siding, pitched roofs are preferred over flat roofs, and the use of
porches are encouraged.
      (b)   Corrugated metal and unadorned masonry may be acceptable as siding
material in the proper context.
      (c)   Figure 156.235-1 shows examples of the desired treatment.

      (2)   Buildings on corner lots. Notwithstanding the provisions of §
156.891, buildings located on a corner lot may be set back from U.S. Highway 17
North and designed to address the side street as the primary street, if
continuous, interconnecting access is provided through the adjoining parcels of

SUBPART 4.5: VSP-OD (VILLAGE-SCALE  PEDESTRIAN OVERLAY DISTRICT)
§ 156.250 PURPOSE.
   The VSP-OD, Village-Scale Pedestrian Overlay District, is intended to:
   (A)   Foster an active, pedestrian-oriented form of development where the
form is as important as use, with buildings and primary entrances located near
the public realm and high-quality pedestrian streetscapes in front;
   (B)   Encourage a high degree of design quality for the building façade and
a strong interaction between the buildings and the public realm; and
   (C)   Emphasize the importance of the public realm and integrate public
spaces, such as plazas, with surrounding development.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.251 DISTRICT BOUNDARY.
   (A)   The lots subject to the VSP-OD regulations are generally described as
those properties abutting:
      (1)   Johnnie Dodds Boulevard;
      (2)   Coleman Boulevard;
      (3)   Ben Sawyer Boulevard, between its intersection with Coleman
Boulevard and Chuck Dawley Boulevard and the western side only of its
intersection with Rifle Range Road;
      (4)   Chuck Dawley Boulevard; and
      (5)   Bowman Road, west of Stuart Engals Boulevard and terminating at
Mathis Ferry Road.
   (B)   This triangular-shaped area, which is bounded on the west by the
Ravenel Bridge and on the east by I-526, represents the core of the southern
end of town.
   (C)   Figure 156.251-1: Village Scale Pedestrian Overlay District Boundary

§ 156.253 OPEN SPACE AND PARKS.
   (A)   For any development containing residential dwelling units, at least 8%
of the development acreage, excluding the activity zone (see §
156.1036), shall be designed and utilized as open space and/or parks in the
form of active and passive parks, plazas, or public gathering spaces.
   (B)   The location and design of the open space or park area is subject to
Planning Commission or Design Review Board approval, as applicable for the
proposed development.

§ 156.254 COLEMAN BOULEVARD DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to lots in the VSP-OD that
generally abut Coleman Boulevard and Ben Sawyer Boulevard, between the
intersections of Magrath Darby Boulevard on the north and Patriot's Point
Boulevard on the south and the west side of the intersection of Ben Sawyer
Boulevard and Rifle Range Road, specifically excluding lots located within the
Shem Creek Waterfront District and the residential subdivision of Bayview
Acres, as shown on
Figure 156.251-1: Village Scale Pedestrian Overlay District Boundary.
   (B)   Generally. 
Table 156.254-1: Coleman Boulevard Development Standards specifies building
height, build-to lines, and setbacks for all lots in the VSP-OD along Coleman,
West Coleman, and Ben Sawyer Boulevards based on the lot’s location (“area”) as
shown on
Figure 156.254-1: Coleman Boulevard Area Map.
   (C)   Building height.
      (1)   All structures shall have at least two floors, with a maximum of
three floors allowed. The two-floor minimum only applies to buildings fronting
the boulevard.
      (2)   Where indicated on
Table 156.254-1: Coleman Boulevard Development Standards as 45 feet/55 feet,
the maximum building height along all streets is 45 feet. A maximum building
height of 55 feet is allowed on the interior portion of the development site.
      (3)   Any portion of a building exceeding 45 feet in height must be set
back from all right-of-way lines, at a distance to be determined through the
design review process.
      (4)   Any portion of a building exceeding 45 feet in height shall have a
maximum of four floors. In cases where buildings utilize a flat roof, the
maximum height is measured to the top of the roof structure.
      (5)   Areas above the maximum height or maximum number of stories:
         (a)   Shall not be used to create an extra floor of living area or
enclosed commercial space;
         (b)   Shall not be used for open decks, multi-level decks, or rooftop
restaurants; and
         (c)   May be used for storage.
   (D)   Build-to lines/setbacks for civic uses. The build-to line or setback
for civic uses is determined through the design review process.
   (E)   Building footprint limitations. Because "big box" retail development
is inconsistent with the purpose of the VSP-OD, the building footprint of any
individual structure is limited to 50,000 square feet.

§ 156.336 CLASSIFICATION OF NEW AND UNLISTED PRINCIPAL USES.
   (A)   The Zoning Administrator may determine that an unlisted use is:
      (1)   Allowed in one or more zoning districts as a permitted use,
conditional use, or special exception use if sufficiently similar in nature and
impact to a permitted, conditional, or special exception use listed in §
156.338; or
      (2)   Prohibited in all zoning districts.
   (B)   In making this determination, the Zoning Administrator may refer to
any of the following factors as guidance:
      (1)   The definitions contained in Subchapter N;
      (2)   Whether the use is consistent with the purpose of the zoning
district in which it would be allowed;
      (3)   Whether the use has visual, traffic, environmental, or other
impacts similar to an expressly listed use. The Zoning Administrator may refer
to empirical studies or generally accepted planning or engineering sources in
making this determination; and
      (4)   Whether the use is within the same industry classification as
another allowed use. In making this determination, the Zoning Administrator may
refer to the most recent edition of the North American Industry Classification
Manual (“NAICS”) and/or the American Planning Association’s Land-Based
Classification Standards (LBCS) Tables.
   (C)   The burden is on the applicant to establish that the unlisted proposed
use is similar to the expressly listed use. The applicant shall submit
verification that shows the proposed use is similar to another permitted,
conditional, or special exception use and could be allowed.
   (D)   The Zoning Administrator shall determine whether a proposed use is
similar to another permitted, conditional, or special exception use in the
zoning district and could be allowed or is not similar and therefore
prohibited. If the Zoning Administrator determines that:
      (1)   The proposed use is sufficiently similar in nature and impact to a
permitted use, the applicant may proceed with any application necessary to
establish the use;
      (2)   The proposed use is sufficiently similar in nature and impact to a
conditional use, the applicant may submit a zoning permit application (see
Subchapter I, Part 7) demonstrating compliance with the applicable conditions
specified in
Subchapter C, Subpart 3.3;
      (3)   The proposed use is sufficiently similar in nature and impact to a
special exception use, the applicant may submit a special exception application
(see
Subchapter I, Part 9); or
      (4)   The proposed use is not sufficiently similar in nature and impact
to a permitted use, conditional use, or special exception use, then the
proposed use shall be denied and the applicant notified in writing.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.337 PREEMPTION.
   Uses regulated by the State of South Carolina and exempt from local control

   (D)   Home office. A home office is a type of home-based business with no

essential to the conduct of the limited home-based business (e.g., for
horseback riding instruction, swimming lessons, or sports instruction).
   (F)   Home-based day care.
      (1)   A home-based day care is a type of home-based business where

the home-based day care; and
         (e)   The home-base day care is licensed by the appropriate state
agency.

Subchapter I, Part 9 apply.
   (G)   Outdoor instructional swimming lessons.

§ 156.495 COMMERCIAL-TYPE DUMPSTER.
   All commercial-type dumpsters shall be located outside a public right-of-

(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.496 FARMERS’ MARKET.
   (A)   Market manager required. All temporary farmers’ markets shall have a
market manager authorized to direct the operations of all vendors participating
in the market on the site of the market during all hours of operation.
   (B)   Parking. All temporary farmers’ markets shall provide at least three
off-street parking spaces for each vendor stall.

(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.497 INTERIM AND PART-TIME USES AND STRUCTURES.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   The purpose of providing for uses that operate on an interim or
part-time basis is two-fold:
         (a)   The first is to allow the utilization of property intended for
the highest and best use of the property in stages without full compliance with
all development regulations for a limited amount of time under strict permit
requirements. This could involve such development standards as paved parking
and required landscaping or bufferyard plantings.
         (b)   The second is to allow the utilization of property for such uses
that do not represent the highest and best use of a property, but provide an
opportunity to utilize the same as a revenue source or interim use for either
an existing principal use or vacant land.
      (2)   Examples of such uses are a drive-in movie theater utilizing an
inflatable screen located in an existing parking lot or vacant lot, utilization
of a vacant lot or parking lot for outdoor dining or other uses that would
normally not be allowed, or tents or other structures or spaces for classrooms,
offices, religious services, and the like.
   (B)   Findings.
      (1)   This part and
Chapter 116 allow for temporary uses and special events for certain uses of
limited occurrences and duration;
      (2)   Even under normal circumstances there exists an additional need for
the allowance of such activities and uses as described in this part that are
not provided in the current temporary use or special event regulations; and
      (3)   Under a public health emergency or other event that disrupts normal
operations, many of the highest and best uses of properties are no longer
allowed or feasible, such as indoor dining or open-lot retail and similar uses.
   (C)   Types of interim and part-time uses.
      (1)   Any principal, accessory, or other temporary use allowed in a
particular zoning district may be allowed as an interim or part-time use.
      (2)   An unlisted use may be allowed as an interim or part-time use in
accordance with the provisions in §
156.486.
   (D)   Parking lots. When a parking lot is established as an interim use, the
applicant shall provide perimeter and right-of-way screening in accordance with
Subchapter D, Part 2.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.498 MOBILE VENDING.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies to mobile food vending units,
mobile food pushcarts, and mobile retail vending units.
   (B)   Zoning permit must be displayed. As specified in §
156.473, all mobile vending uses require issuance of a zoning permit prior to
setting up or selling merchandise. Permit certificates shall be attached to the
mobile vending unit where they are readily visible, and shall include the
current name, mailing address, and valid phone number of the mobile vending
unit owner.
   (C)   Business license required. All mobile vendors must obtain from the
town an appropriate, current business license.
   (D)   Allowed merchandise.
      (1)   Mobile food vending units and mobile food pushcarts. Allowed
merchandise is limited to edibles, hot and cold beverages containing no
alcohol, and items related to such merchandise.
      (2)   Mobile retail vending units. Allowed merchandise is limited to non-
perishable, non-food retail goods.
   (E)   Maximum number of mobile vendors per lot. No more than one mobile
vendor is allowed on any given lot at the same time without first obtaining a
special events permit, except that there is no limit on the number of pushcart
vendors occupying a particular lot, nor is there a limit on the number of
pushcart vendors or vendors with small, tow-behind carts occupying a shopping
center.
   (F)   Parking.
      (1)   Required parking for the primary business(es) on the lot shall be
minimally affected.
      (2)   Parking for the mobile vending unit shall not interfere with any
public roads or ingress or egress thereto.
   (G)   Signs. Temporary signs associated with a mobile vending unit are
allowed subject to
Subchapter G.
   (H)   Garbage and recycling. Garbage and recycling receptacles must be made
available for patron use and removed from the site daily by the mobile vendor.
   (I)   Compliance with state regulations.
      (1)   Mobile food vendors shall meet all applicable South Carolina
Department of Agriculture (SCDA) regulations for mobile food units and possess
a valid SCDA permit where applicable.
      (2)   Any mobile food vendor or mobile food vending unit that has been
issued a notice of health violation by any department of the State of South
Carolina that remains uncorrected upon a subsequent inspection shall have its
mobile food vendor permit revoked.
   (J)   Prohibitions. A mobile vendor shall not:
      (1)   Leave any mobile vending unit unattended;
      (2)   Conduct sales on any public road, street, highway, or right-of-way,
except that pushcart vendors may operate on a sidewalk located in a right-of-
way if the sidewalk is at least eight feet in width;
      (3)   Store, park, or leave any mobile vending unit overnight on any
street or sidewalk;
      (4)   Leave from any location without first picking up, removing, and
disposing of all trash or refuse remaining from sales made by the vendor;
      (5)   Solicit or conduct business with persons in motor vehicles;
      (6)   Sell anything other than that for which a license to vend has been
issued;
      (7)   Sound or permit the sounding of any device that produces a loud and
raucous noise, or use or operate any loudspeaker, public address system, radio,
sound amplifier, or similar device to attract the attention of the public;
      (8)   Allow any item relating to the operation of the vending business to
lean against or hang from any building or other structure lawfully placed on
public property;
      (9)   Engage in open-lot or outdoor display of products or merchandise;
      (10)   Change vending locations without first notifying the Department of
Planning, Land Use, and Neighborhoods and submitting the required application
and site plan; or
      (11)   Discharge fat, oil, grease, or wastewater into the sanitary sewer
system. All waste shall be properly stored and disposed of at a properly
designated disposal location.
   (K)   Exemptions. Catered events and special events with a special event
permit are exempt from the requirements of this part.

   (A)   This part applies to all short-term rentals, as defined in §
156.517, below.
   (B)   This part and its requirements applies to any and all businesses that
qualified as a bed and breakfast under previous town ordinances.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.517 DEFINITIONS.
   For purposes of this part, the following definitions apply unless the
context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   RESIDENTIAL DWELLING UNIT. A building or portion of a building arranged or
designed to provide complete independent living facilities for one or more
persons, including permanent provisions for living, sleeping, eating, cooking,
and sanitation.
   SHORT-TERM RENTAL.
      (1)   The rental or lease for valuable consideration of a residential
dwelling unit, or portion thereof, for a duration of less than 30 consecutive
days;
      (2)   Home-based businesses and tourist accommodations, including hotels
(includes motels and extended stay accommodations), boutique hotels (includes
inns), and similar accommodations located on property in a commercial zoning
district are excluded from the definition of SHORT TERM RENTALS and thus are
not subject to this part.
   STR OPERATOR. Any property owner who receives payment for operating a
residential dwelling unit, or portion thereof, as a short-term rental.
For the purposes of this part, OPERATOR may be interpreted to mean property
owner.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.518 MAXIMUM NUMBER ALLOWED.
   At no time shall the maximum number of residential dwelling units used as
STRs exceed 400 (the “cap”), except as otherwise set forth in §
156.519(A)(2).
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.519 SHORT-TERM RENTAL PERMIT.
   (A)   To operate each STR, one must obtain an STR permit, which must be
applied for on an annual basis as follows:
      (1)   STR permit requirements. The following requirements must be met
prior to issuance of an STR permit:
         (a)   The approved STR application;
         (b)   Payment of STR permit application fees; and
         (c)   Payment of business license fees for STR permits held during the
previous year.
      (2)   Annual registration.
         (a)   The STR permit application and registration fees shall be paid
at the time the application is submitted. Any outstanding penalty fees must be
paid prior to an application being reviewed. For current STR operators,
applications must be submitted and associated fees paid, starting November 15
and ending midnight December 15. Current STR operators that submit an
application by the December 15 deadline, and are able to provide proof that all
requirements were met during the previous operating year, shall not be subject
to the cap, as set forth in §
156.518. Applications received from current STR operators after December 15
will be subject to the cap, as set forth in §
156.518, and will be treated as a new STR operator application.
         (b)   Beginning January 1, STR applications may be considered,
starting with the waitlist, for issuance of an STR permit if the cap has not
been reached after current STR operators have completed their applications. Any
application received for an STR that was illegally operating the prior year
will be assessed a penalty fee of $500 in addition to the standard permit fees.
If an application is found to be incomplete, the primary contact will be
notified, and will have ten business days to submit missing information. If not
received within ten business days of notification, the application will be
denied.
      (3)   Change in registered owner information. STR permits shall not
transfer upon conveyance of the property. A new owner of a residential dwelling
unit, formerly registered as an STR under the previous owner, shall be required
to submit a new STR application and review fee. Upon approval pursuant to the
provisions of this part, an STR permit can be issued to the new owner of the
residential dwelling unit. However, if the residential dwelling unit operating
as a short-term rental is owned as joint tenants with right of survivorship,
the STR permit can be transferred to another joint tenant of the residential
dwelling unit, upon the death of the short-term rental permit holder. In order
for the STR permit to be transferred under this division, the joint tenant must
be an immediate family member and must submit the information listed in
divisions (A)(3)(a) through (d) below for review. For purposes of this
division, an IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBER is a spouse, parent, sibling, or child of
the short-term rental permit holder.

rental permit holder;
         (b)   A copy of the deed for the residential dwelling unit operating
as a short-term rental, indicating that the applicant is a joint tenant with
right of survivorship for the residential dwelling unit;
         (c)   Proof that the applicant has satisfied all requirements under
divisions (B) and (D) below; and
         (d)   A non-refundable review fee of $100 is required in conjunction
with a request to transfer the STR permit.
      (4)   Inaccurate or incomplete registration information. It is a
violation of this part for an owner to intentionally provide inaccurate
information for the registration of a residential dwelling unit used as an STR,
or to fail to provide information required by the application form.
      (5)   Designation of local agent.
         (a)   The owner of a residential dwelling unit used as an STR shall
designate a local agent who shall be responsible for operating the STR in
compliance with the law. Official notices may be served on the designated local
agent and/or the STR operator; however, any notice served on the designated
local agent shall be deemed to have been served upon the STR operator of
record.
         (b)   Nothing shall prevent the STR operator from designating
themself, or a properly formed and registered business entity, as the agent.
The agent must be able to physically respond to the site within 60 minutes in
case of emergency.
      (6)   More than one property owner or ownership by entity.
         (a)   Where more than one person has an ownership interest in a
property used as an STR, the required information shall be provided for each
owner.
         (b)   In cases where the property owner is not a person, the
information required for the applicant shall be provided for the organization
owning the STR and for the president, general manager, or other chief executive
officer of the organization.
   (B)   Annual renewal requirements. An application must be submitted annually

while renting one bedroom, and up to six bedrooms, to separate "guests" or
"entities," in the fashion of a traditional bed and breakfast; or
            3.   Where there is a legally established accessory dwelling unit,
an STR operator may rent their accessory dwelling unit, in its entirety, to one
"guest" or "entity," or an STR operator may rent their principal residential
dwelling unit, in its entirety, to one "guest" or "entity.” If the owner does
not live on site, in no case shall the ADU and principal residential dwelling
unit be rented separately. Occupancy of an accessory dwelling unit is limited

facility equipment may be mounted on top of existing and new poles in a
cylinder shape to look like an extension of the pole.
         (e)   Brand logos and other signage are prohibited on all SWF except
signage required to warn of RF emissions, instructions for disabling the SWF,
contact information to be used by workers on or near the SWF, and as otherwise
required by federal or state law. Signage will be no larger than required to be
legible from street level.
      (3)   Types. The town’s order of preference for poles or support
structures is as follows:
         (a)   Monopole/town-owned pole;
         (b)   Decorative pole or structure;
         (c)   Existing or proposed structures designed to support or capable
of supporting small wireless facilities; and

§ 156.585 PLANT SPECIES.
   (A)   Generally. 
Table 156.585-2: Plant Species List specifies the types of plants that may be
used to satisfy the requirements of this subchapter. Plants not listed may be
approved by staff. Examples of unlisted plants that may be approved include new
varieties of species already listed and species that may now survive in this
geographic area due to warmer temperatures.
   (B)   Native species required. To encourage a diversity in plantings, at
least 50% of the total quantity of canopy and understory trees and at least 25%
of shrubs used to fulfill the requirements of this subchapter shall be native
species.
Table 156.585-2: Plant Species List indicates native species in bold text.
   (C)   Species variety required.
      (1)   To avoid a monoculture and encourage diversity among plantings, a
variety of species are required based on the number of plantings as specified
in
Table 156.585-1: Species Variety.
      (2)   This applies for each type of planting (canopy trees, understory
trees, and shrubs). For example, if six canopy trees, 12 understory trees, and
25 shrubs are planted, the plantings must include at least two different
species of canopy trees, four different species of understory trees, and seven
different species of shrubs.

or understory tree planting requirements, except:
      (1)   In a critical area buffer; and
      (2)   Where existing conditions, such as the size of existing planter
islands or the presence of overhead power lines, constrain the type of tree
that can be used.
   (E)   Class IV trees. Class IV trees, as identified in
Table 156.702-1: Tree Mitigation Calculation, shall not count towards planting
requirements except in critical area buffers, special right-of-way buffers, and
scenic highway buffers.

(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.586 REQUIRED VEGETATION IS PROTECTED.
   (A)   All vegetation required by this subchapter is protected and requires
prior approval for the alteration of bufferyard or buffer width or removal of
bufferyard or buffer vegetation.
   (B)   Mitigation for removal is required by replacement or through donation
to the town's tree bank in applicable situations.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.587 IMPACTS FROM AERIAL TRANSMISSION POWER LINES.
   (A)   Where protected trees are mutually considered danger trees by the
power provider and the Zoning Administrator:
      (1)   Their removal request shall be submitted in plan form and may be
granted, with replacement being required, as outlined in
Subchapter E, to be planted on the site of the requested removal. Where buffer
configuration, aerial power line conditions or other circumstances or
conditions do not permit canopy tree replacement, the largest size tree or tall
shrubs may be permitted, with replacement calculations based upon nursery
standards or an equivalent donation made to the tree bank as determined by Town
Council; and
      (2)   Such trees may be pruned only in accordance with town standards and
with the specifications provided in the latest version of ANSI A300. ANSI A300:
Standards for Tree Care Operations specifies acceptable alternatives to topping
that may be considered.
   (B)   Where power line maintenance operations cause violation of
Subchapter E by means such as excessive pruning, based upon pruning standards
referenced in §
156.706, the tree may be considered damaged and require removal and
replacement. Damage to bufferyard or buffer vegetation as a part of any
maintenance activity requires replacement in-kind.
   (C)   Where taller maturing species of trees exist directly under the power
lines, pruning practice would otherwise require a tree to be topped, resulting
in a standing stub without lateral limbs, they may be removed with Zoning
Administrator approval, and may require replacement with more power line-
compatible species.
   (D)   Regular line clearance pruning may be permitted on cyclical events, if
pruning is the minimum legally required.
   (E)   No portions of a bufferyard or buffer shall be maintained by clear
cutting or herbicide applications.
   (F)   Where existing aerial lines are to be placed underground, locations
for ground cabinets should first be sought outside of the bufferyard or buffer.
Where other options do not exist, minimal portions of the bufferyard or buffer
may be cleared to allow for the setting of ground cabinets, with Zoning
Administrator approval of the plans, and replanting required around the
cabinets to screen them and best reestablish all vegetative levels of the
bufferyard or buffer.
   (G)   Where road widening or other road improvements impact existing
bufferyards, a buffer width reduction may occur only when a full buffer width
cannot be accommodated with site adjustments. Where a full bufferyard width
cannot be provided through site adjustments but some additional width can be
accommodated, the width shall be increased to the maximum extent possible.
Required plant quantities, based upon the pre-road improvement buffer width
within impacted buffers, may only be reduced to the extent that plantings
cannot fit within the final approved bufferyard width. The potential to have
plantings within the right-of-way may be considered where plantings on private
property cannot be accommodated.

§ 156.588 IMPACTS FROM ROAD IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Where road widening or other road improvements impact existing
bufferyards or buffers, a width reduction may occur only when the full required
width cannot be accommodated with site adjustments.
   (B)   Where a full bufferyard or buffer width cannot be provided through
site adjustments but some additional width can be accommodated, the width shall
be increased to the maximum extent possible. Required plant quantities, based
upon the pre-road improvement buffer width within impacted buffers, may only be
reduced to the extent that plantings cannot fit within the final approved
bufferyard width. The potential to have plantings within the right-of-way may
be considered where plantings on private property cannot be accommodated.

   (A)   The purpose of this part is to:
      (1)   Separate different land uses from each other, in order to:
         (a)   Eliminate or minimize potential nuisances, such as dirt, litter,
noise, glare of lights, signs, and unsightly buildings or parking areas; and
         (b)   Provide spacing to reduce adverse impacts of noise, odor, or
danger from fires or explosions;
      (2)   Improve air and water quality;
      (3)   Moderate climatic effects;
      (4)   Reduce flooding by slowing, stormwater runoff and increasing
infiltration;
      (5)   Stabilize soils; and
      (6)   Provide habitat for wildlife.
   (B)   Both the amount of land and the type and amount of planting specified
for each bufferyard required by this part are designed to ameliorate nuisances
between adjacent land uses or between a land use and a street. Perimeter and
right-of-way bufferyards are not intended for future location of water, sewer,
or other utility lines.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.601 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This part applies to
      (1)   All subdivisions subject to the sketch plan process (see §
155.021); and
      (2)   The following types of development in the RM, OP-1, OP-2, NC-1, NC-
2, AB-1, AB-2, ED, LI, WG-C, SCW-W, SCW-H, SCW-N, and PD Districts:
         (a)   All new non-residential developments and buildings;
         (b)   All new mixed use buildings;
         (c)   All new multiplex and apartment complex developments and
buildings;
         (d)   Any change of use from one non-residential use to another non-
residential use;
         (e)   Any change of use from a residential use to a non-residential
use;
         (f)   Any expansion of an existing building, structure, or vehicular
use area by more than 50% of its gross area; and
         (g)   Any renovation of a nonconforming structure or site feature
meeting the threshold in §
156.1538.
   (B)   This part does not apply to lots located in the Old Village Historic
District.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.602 EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   For sites subject to the design review process (see
Subchapter I, Part 12) that include one or more separate lots within a larger
development (such as an "outparcel"), the necessity of whether a bufferyard is
required between the lots within the development, and the specific requirements
thereof, shall be determined during the design review process.
   (B)   Where two non-residential lots share two-way vehicular access (i.e., a
driveway) along a common side or rear lot line, the perimeter bufferyards may
be eliminated where this vehicular access occurs.
      (1)   If the two lots share a fully cohesive (shared), interconnected
parking lot, the perimeter bufferyard may be entirely eliminated along the
common lot line(s) where the parking lot connection exists.
      (2)   Portions of the lots not interconnected are required to provide the
perimeter bufferyard as normally required.
   (C)   Bufferyards do not apply to interior lot lines for lots subdivided
pursuant to the provisions of §
155.047(C)(1)(a). However, perimeter and right-of-way bufferyards are required
along the development perimeter or as prescribed by the design review process.
   (D)   Bufferyards do not apply to lots subdivided pursuant to the provisions
of §
155.047(C)(1)(b).
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.603 LOCATION OF PERIMETER AND RIGHT-OF-WAY BUFFERYARDS.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   Perimeter and right-of-way bufferyards are located along the outer
perimeter of a lot, extending to the lot line; and
      (2)   Are not located on any portion of an existing public or private
street or areas encumbered by a recorded easement, except as allowed in
division (E) below.
   (B)   Perimeter bufferyards. Perimeter bufferyards are located along all lot
lines that are not adjacent to a public or private right-of-way.
   (C)   Right-of-way bufferyards. Right-of-way bufferyards are located along
all lot lines that are adjacent to a public or private street right-of-way.
   (D)   Relationship to required setbacks. Where front, side, and rear
setbacks are required by this chapter, perimeter and right-of-way bufferyards
may be established within the setback area.
   (E)   Perimeter and right-of-way bufferyards along utility line easements.
Perimeter and right-of-way bufferyards installed along utility line easements
shall meet one of the following requirements:
      (1)   If utility lines run parallel or near parallel to a lot line that
requires a bufferyard, the required bufferyard must begin at the edge of the
utility easement closest to the proposed development; or
      (2)   The property owner shall obtain a written agreement from the
utility company having control of the easement authorizing the required
plantings to be placed within the easement and to remain within the easement in
perpetuity unless the bufferyard is no longer required. This agreement shall:
         (a)   Specify the agency or person responsible for the maintenance and
replacement of any removed, damaged, or diseased vegetation; and
         (b)   Be submitted with the zoning permit application or preliminary
plat application, as applicable.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.604 PERIMETER AND RIGHT-OF-WAY BUFFERYARD TYPES.
   (A)   Existing plant material. Any existing plant material that otherwise
satisfies the requirements of this part may be counted toward satisfying the
required bufferyard if they are identified on the development plans.
   (B)   Groundcover required. All bufferyard areas shall be covered with mulch
or suitable ground cover, except where other surfaces, such as sidewalks or
recreational trails, are allowed to occur within a bufferyard.
   (C)   Evergreen plant materials. When evergreen (or conifer) plant materials
are used in a perimeter or right-of-way bufferyard, they shall be planted in
clusters.
   (D)   Developments subject to design review. The type and height of the
required structure and exact placement of required plants shall be determined
through the design review process (see
Subchapter I, Part 12) based upon the proposed use of the subject property and
the uses of adjoining properties and, in the case of fence structures, the type
of materials utilized and maintenance issues.
   (E)   Developments subject to Planning Commission review.
      (1)   The type and height of the required structure (if any) and the
number and species of required plants shall be specified on the sketch plan
(see §
155.021). The Planning Commission may require changes based upon the proposed
use of the subject property and the uses of adjoining properties and, in the
case of fence structures, the type of materials utilized and maintenance
issues.
      (2)   The exact placement of required plants shall be determined through
the preliminary plat process (see §
155.023), based upon the proposed use of the subject property and the uses of
adjoining properties.
   (F)   All other developments. For all other developments subject only to the
zoning permit process (see
Subchapter I, Part 7), the applicant shall propose the number, species, and
placement of required plants. However, staff may require changes to help ensure
the plants thrive where planted and effectively buffer the subject property as
intended.
   (G)   Bufferyard illustrations. The illustrations in Figures 156.604-
1 through 156.604-7 graphically indicate the planting requirements for each
bufferyard type. Each illustration depicts the bufferyard to be provided on a
given property, which is a portion of the total bufferyard to be provided
between two adjoining properties or between the subject property and the right-
of-way.
      (1)   The illustrations specify the type and quantity of plant materials
required by each bufferyard type and each bufferyard option.
      (2)   The requirements are stated in terms of the bufferyard width and
the number of plants required per 100 linear feet of bufferyard.
      (3)   The requirements of a bufferyard may be satisfied by any one of the
options illustrated.
      (4)   The plant unit multiplier is a factor by which the basic number of
plant materials required for a given bufferyard is determined, given a change
in the width of that yard.
      (5)   Figure 156.604-7: Required Structures in Perimeter and Right-of-Way
Bufferyards provides specifications for the walls and fences required in
certain bufferyard types.
      (6)   When required, structure type F-1 shall be placed in a bufferyard
within four feet of the lot line, while structure types F-2, F-3, F-4, and F-
5 may be placed anywhere within a bufferyard.

PART 3: CRITICAL AREA BUFFERS
§ 156.620 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The purpose of the critical area buffer is to:
      (1)   Reduce stormwater pollutants;
      (2)   Improve water quality;
      (3)   Prevent and reduce erosion through undisturbed and stabilized
areas;
      (4)   Preserve wildlife corridors and natural habitats for important
species;
      (5)   Reduce flooding and subsequent damage to property; and
      (6)   Provide a natural privacy barrier.
   (B)   The intent of this part is to prohibit grassed, manicured lawns within
the buffer area.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.621 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This part applies to all lots located adjacent to the critical area,
as defined in S.C. Code § 48-39-10, or located within 35 feet of the critical
area line.
   (B)   Where a developed lot does not meet the critical area buffer
requirements, the buffer shall be established in accordance with this part if
the principal structure on the lot is improved by 50% or more of its assessed
value.
   (C)   Where a vacant lot does not meet the critical area buffer
requirements, the buffer shall be established in accordance with this part when
the lot is developed.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.622 CRITICAL AREA BUFFER REQUIRED.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   A vegetated buffer shall be maintained or established along areas
designated as the tidally influenced "critical area" by the South Carolina
Department of Environmental Services (SCDES) Bureau of Coastal Management
(BCM).
      (2)   The natural vegetation in the buffer shall remain undisturbed,
except as allowed by §
156.624 and §
156.626. In addition, invasive species shall be removed in accordance with §
156.583.
   (B)   Buffer location.
      (1)   The critical area buffer is located landward of the critical area
line.
      (2)   A critical area buffer is required whether or not the critical area
line is located on the subject lot.
      (3)   Critical areas by their very nature are dynamic systems, subject to
change over time. Because of this, the limits of the critical area buffer are
established by the final plat approved by the town and recorded with the
Charleston County ROD office.
         (a)   The buffer limits shall remain unchanged in perpetuity unless a
new subdivision occurs. At such time, the critical line must be validated by
SCDES-BCM, which will establish the current critical line location and thus the
new buffer area; provided, however, the new critical line location only applies
to the subject lot and not to adjoining lots.
         (b)   In areas where the critical area buffer has been averaged, the
new buffer area shall not result in a reduction in square footage of the former
buffer area previously established.
         (c)   It is the sole responsibility of the property owner to ensure
all construction activity occurs landward of the current SCDES-BCM critical
line, irrespective of the critical line location reflected on the most recent
recorded plat.
   (C)   Buffer width.
      (1)   The width of the critical area buffer is:
         (a)   An average of 35 feet; and
         (b)   A minimum of 20 feet.
      (2)   The minimum and average buffer widths apply to individual lots. The
average buffer width shall not be applied over adjacent lots.
   (D)   Natural, undisturbed buffer required.
      (1)   New developments, redevelopments, and lot subdivisions are required
to maintain any existing buffer in its natural state, except as provided in §
156.624, §
156.625, and §
156.626.
      (2)   If a natural, vegetated bufferyard does not exist on a lot at the
time of submittal of development plans, the applicant shall establish the
bufferyard during the development process as specified in
Subchapter D, Part 6.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)

      (3)   Is the minimum width necessary to provide access;
   (C)   Minimum utility line penetrations, as specifically and previously
approved on development plans; and
   (D)   Permitted freestanding signs and utility ground cabinets.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.625 STORMWATER CONTROL MEASURES.
   (A)   Existing lots.
      (1)   Where stormwater control measures must be placed within the
critical area buffer on an existing lot, the property owner shall use swales or
other means, rather than drainage pipes, to convey stormwater.
      (2)   The stormwater control measure(s) must be located within an
existing vision corridor. If a vision corridor does not exist, any clearing of
vegetation required for construction of the stormwater control measures must
meet the requirements in §
156.626.
   (B)   New subdivisions requiring sketch plan approval.
      (1)   Any new subdivision that is not exempt from sketch plan approval
pursuant to §
155.028: Exceptions may use drainage pipes to convey stormwater through the
critical area buffer.

area buffer on any lot in accordance with this section.
   (B)   Vision corridor defined. A vision corridor is a vertical corridor cut
through the buffer, allowing a view through the critical area buffer. This area
is generally formed by two near perpendicular lines connecting the critical
area line to the upland boundary of the critical area buffer.
   (C)   Vision corridor area.
      (1)   The area of a vision corridor shall not exceed one-third (33%) of
the square footage of the total buffer area.
      (2)   The vision corridor shall be one single uniform unbroken portion,
except on lots where the buffer exceeds 5,250 square feet in area where it may
be broken into multiple vision corridors that each are at least 25 feet in
length.
   (D)   Vegetation removal and pruning.
      (1)   Within the vision corridor, trees of a protected size for the lot
(see Subchapter E) shall not be removed. Smaller trees may be pruned or cut
with hand tools, but the stump must remain in place.
      (2)   Grasses, shrubs, and other smaller vegetation may be pruned and
trimmed, but shall not be removed at the root.
      (3)   Pruning of any vegetation is limited to eight feet above the ground
and must be completed in accordance with the American National Standard for
Tree Care Operations – Tree, Shrub, and Other Woody Plant Management - Standard
Practices (Pruning) (ANSI A300).
      (4)   The use of heavy equipment and herbicides is prohibited in the
buffer.
      (5)   The intent of this division is to ensure the root mass remains
intact to stabilize the ground surface, which prevents soil erosion.

plans.
      (1)   For developments subject to design review, the vision corridor
shall be delineated on the final design review plans.
      (2)   For all other developments, the vision corridor shall be delineated
on the building permit application.
      (3)   Once a building permit application is submitted for a particular
lot, a vision corridor may only be established through a plat revision or deed
restriction on the property on which it is located to act as a record of its
establishment.
      (4)   The distances from rear and side property lines must be shown on
final design plans and revised plats or specified in the deed restriction, as
applicable.
   (C)   Subsequent changes to an established buffer or vision corridor must be
re-approved and re-recorded, with restoration in accordance with Subchapter D,
Part 6 required for any previously disturbed buffer area, if necessary.
   (D)   Buffer and vision corridor limits shall be staked in the field prior
to and throughout construction activities. In addition, the vision corridor
shall have protective barricades (see Figure 156.705-3: Protective Barricade)
along its edges that are approximately perpendicular to the critical line.

healthy, neat, and orderly appearance at least equal to the original
development, and shall be kept free of refuse, with dead vegetation promptly
replaced.
   (C)   Courtesy inspections may be coordinated by town staff to ensure proper
maintenance.
   (D)   Any pruning or maintenance that significantly limits a plant's ability
to obtain its natural form and fulfill the intent of the landscaping and
bufferyard requirements will result in the issuance of a citation and/or the
possible replacement of damaged material with replacement equal to or greater
than the damaged material. Replacement greater than the damaged material may be
required when portions of plants are removed or when the landscaping or
bufferyard is nonconforming. Pruning specifications as provided in the latest
version of ANSI A300 shall be used to determine compliance with this division.

§ 156.673 LANDSCAPING MAINTENANCE BOND.
   (A)   Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy or the recording of a
final plat, as applicable, the developer or subdivider shall post a landscaping
maintenance bond or other financial security to ensure the required plantings
survive in a healthy condition.
   (B)   The bond shall be equal to 20% of the cost of installation of all
required landscaping, including plants and labor, and shall be valid for at
least two years from the date of installation.
   (C)   The town will release the maintenance bond two years after
installation of the landscaping if the landscaping has been maintained in a
healthy growing condition and any dead or dying plants have been replaced.

SUBCHAPTER E: TREE PROTECTION
§ 156.700 AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   The citizens of the town recognize the importance of preserving the
natural landscape through the protection of existing trees to:
      (1)   Promote the public health, safety, and general welfare;
      (2)   Lessen air pollution;
      (3)   Increase dust filtration;
      (4)   Reduce noise, heat, and glare;
      (5)   Prevent soil erosion;
      (6)   Improve surface drainage and minimize flooding;
      (7)   Ensure that noise, glare, and other distractions of movement in one
area do not adversely affect activity within other adjacent areas;
      (8)   Beautify and enhance improved and undeveloped land;
      (9)   Preserve and protect both the natural and historic amenities within
the town;
      (10)   Ensure that excessive tree cutting does not reduce property
values; and
      (11)   Minimize the cost of construction and maintenance of drainage
systems necessitated by the increased flow and diversion of surface waters.
   (B)   In furtherance of the above purposes and pursuant to authority
conferred by the South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning and
Enabling Act of 1994, as amended, the Town Council does ordain and enact into
law the following sections:
      (1)   Regulating and restricting the removal of trees from all developed
and undeveloped real property;
      (2)   Providing for replacement of trees;
      (3)   Establishing standards for tree protection during land clearing and
construction;
      (4)   Providing certain exceptions and exemptions;
      (5)   Establishing and defining the approval process, with respect to
these regulations, for developments subject to the design review procedure;
      (6)   Providing appeal procedures and remedies;
      (7)   Providing penalties for violations of this chapter;
      (8)   Providing proper methods for maintenance;
      (9)   Defining certain terms used herein; and
      (10)   For other purposes.
   (C)   The intent of this subchapter is to encourage the protection and
replacement of trees consistent with the economic and healthful enjoyment of
private property. The intent is not punitive, nor to cause hardship to any
individual, private firm, or public agency that uses every care and diligence
to protect trees within the town.
   (D)   The Zoning Administrator shall be an ISA Certified Arborist and shall
be responsible for administration of all provisions of this subchapter. Public
tree management and all aspects of maintenance (see §
156.708) shall be administered by the Public Services Department.
   (E)   No person, firm, organization, society, association, or corporation,
or any agent or representative thereof, shall directly or indirectly destroy or
remove any protected, significant, or historic tree, except as authorized under
the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.701 JURISDICTION AND APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This subchapter applies to all real property within the corporate
limits of the town.
   (B)   Protected, significant, or historic trees shall not be removed except
in accordance with this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.702 TREE REMOVAL AND REPLACEMENT.
   (A)   Tree removal permit required.
      (1)   Prior to removal of any protected, significant, or historic tree,
the applicant must obtain a tree removal permit issued by the Zoning
Administrator, an approved clearing and grading permit, or any other tree
removal permit, as appropriate.
      (2)   An application for tree removal must be submitted, along with
payment of the required fee. Pending staff review of the request, a replacement
plan may be required which must be submitted and approved prior to issuance of
the tree permit.
      (3)   Where full replacement cannot be accomplished by replanting on the
site, fee in lieu of replacement trees may be considered in accordance with
division (M) below. When fee in lieu of replacement trees is part of an
approved replacement plan, payment must be submitted prior to issuance of the
removal permit.
      (4)   On all properties, the removal of historic trees, except as
otherwise provided in this subchapter, requires approval as specified in this
section or in §
156.704, as applicable.
      (5)   In cases where removal is requested for a boundary tree, all owners
must agree through written consent on removal and replacement prior to approval
and issuance of a tree removal permit.
      (6)   Tree removal permits will not be issued on properties where
outstanding mitigation has not been satisfied.
   (B)   Display of permit. Any permit or document authorizing removal of a
tree shall be clearly displayed in an obvious and noticeable location, such as
a window or storm door, for review during the removal process. Failure to do so
is a violation of this chapter and subject to the provisions of §
156.709.
   (C)   Tree replacement.
      (1)   Removal of each protected, significant, or historic tree, except as
specified elsewhere in this chapter, requires replacement/mitigation in caliper
inches (see ANSI Z60.1 for measuring instructions). The total number of inches
removed from the site is measured as the diameter at breast height (DBH).
      (2)   In the case of developed sites:
         (a)   Tree replacement must be planted within a defined period of time
not to exceed six months from the date of permit issuance; and
         (b)   If the mitigation calculation is greater than or equal to 2.5
inches, one replacement tree of at least 2.5-inch caliper must be planted on-
site.
      (3)   In the case of new construction, replacement trees shall be
installed prior to final inspection of the project. This includes construction
of both principal and accessory structures.
      (4)   Replacement trees must:
         (a)   Be selected from
Table 156.702-1: Tree Mitigation Calculation and have an equal or higher point
value than the designated classification of the tree(s) removed;
         (b)   Be selected in accordance with §
156.585; and
         (c)   Meet the requirements in §
156.584.
      (5)   Replacement is not required for removal of invasive species.
      (6)   Replacement trees shall not conflict with any drainage or utility
features or be located within drainage or utility easements.
   (D)   Tree mitigation calculation. 
Table 156.702-1: Tree Mitigation Calculation will be used to determine the
amount of mitigation required for removal of existing trees.
      (1)   Quality rating. Many local canopy trees have been grouped by their
average quality rating found in July 2005's Southeastern U.S. Tree Species
Rating Guide. For species not listed, find the average quality rating for Zone
8 in this guide available through the Southern Chapter of ISA, and compare to
the quality rating point range in the table below.
      (2)   Health rating. Trees are great complex systems with many unique
characteristics and health concerns and, therefore, health is categorized
broadly.
         (a)   Good. 100% to 75% live crown ratio. Minimal structural defects.
         (b)   Fair. 75% to 50% live crown ratio. Minor or tolerable structural
defects that can be overcome through arborist intervention.
         (c)   Declining. Less than 50% live crown ratio. Severe structural
defects that would classify it as a hazard tree, including insufficient holding
wood.

1 In the case of a hazard tree, as determined by an ISA TRAQ Certified
Arborist, the replacement requirement can be further reduced or eliminated.
2 Approval of an historic tree removal request (>24 inches DBH) may require
review by the Board of Zoning Appeals or Design Review Board and have other
replacement requirements.
3 Species with adjusted quality ratings that differ from the guide based on
local experience and expertise.
4 Species in this category are exempt from the requirements of this section,
except that Pine species and Sweet Gum shall be maintained in undisturbed
buffers and buffer areas requiring protection of all vegetation of a certain
size and may be approved for plantings in such buffers, and Pine species
greater than 24 inches DBH are considered historic trees and are protected as
such (see §
156.703(D)).
 
   (E)   Detached house lots.
      (1)   On individually platted lots for/with detached house dwellings, the
following criteria shall be used to evaluate requests for the removal of
historic and significant trees:
         (a)   The tree location in relation to property boundaries,
infrastructure, existing physical features;
         (b)   The condition of the canopy, overall health, and species;
         (c)   The nature of the request, justification, and reason for
removing the tree; and
         (d)   Whether practical alternatives have been vetted to preserve the
tree.
      (2)   Removal of Category I or II historic trees or pine trees greater
than 24 inches DBH classified as ‘good’ or ‘fair’ shall be decided by the Board
of Zoning Appeals, except as provided in §
156.704.
   (F)   Residential sketch plans.
      (1)   On sketch plans for residential subdivisions requiring approval by
the Planning Commission, trees 16 inches and greater are protected.
      (2)   A minimum of 160 caliper inches of protected trees per developable
acre shall be retained on the site. On sketch plans where the undeveloped
property has less than this amount of inches existing, caliper inches from
planted canopy trees may be used to meet this requirement. Further, each newly
platted lot shall have at least one 2.5-inch canopy tree retained or planted
on-site, preferably in the front yard.
      (3)   Developable acreage does not include wetlands, retention ponds, or
rights-of-way.
      (4)   Removal of historic trees requires replacement, as described
herein, in excess of 160 caliper-inch minimum.
      (5)   In general, lots and infrastructure should not be sited so as to
require the removal of protected trees 16 inches or greater, whenever possible.
However, the Planning Commission may authorize the removal of these protected
trees for that purpose at the time of sketch plan approval, when their
retention becomes inordinately burdensome in developing the property in a
reasonable fashion. The approval for removal shall be judiciously exercised in
consideration of the stated intent of this subchapter, and with due
consideration of the size, quality, and health rating of individual trees as
provided herein. In such cases when the Planning Commission approves removal,
the following standards apply:
         (a)   In the development of a residential subdivision, replacement
trees may be located as follows:
            1.   On homeowners’ association property, if reviewed and approved
by the Zoning Administrator. Trees between 2.5 and 16 inches DBH retained on
the homeowners' association property can count toward required replacement
inches, if surveyed and protected by a recorded covenant agreement; and/or
            2.   Within the public street right-of-way in accordance with an
approved design plan, as provided in §
155.048(F)(21).
         (b)   Replacement trees shall not conflict with any drainage or
utility features or be located within drainage or utility easements.
         (c)   Mitigation trees shall be selected from
Table 156.702-1: Tree Mitigation Calculation. Replacement species shall be
equal to or of higher point value than the designated classification of the
tree(s) removed.
         (d)   Prior to final plat approval, mitigation must be accomplished as
described above or by providing a cash bond for 200% of the tree replacement
cost in accordance with an approved mitigation plan. The cash bond will have a
maximum lifespan of two years from the date of issue; afterwards, the town may
plant the trees or forfeit the cash bond money into the Tree Bank Fund.
   (G)   Townhouse, triplex, quadplex, and multiplex developments. For
townhouse, triplex, quadplex, and multiplex developments, the following
standards apply:
      (1)   Removal of protected and significant tree(s) may be approved by the
Zoning Administrator, if replacement trees are selected from the canopy tree
list in §
156.585.
      (2)   Removal of Category I or II historic trees or pine trees greater
than 24 inches DBH classified as ‘good’ or ‘fair’ shall be decided by the Board
of Zoning Appeals, except as provided in §
156.704.
      (3)   A minimum of 160 caliper inches per acre shall be retained on the
site. On parcels with less than this amount, caliper inches from planted canopy
trees may be used to meet this requirement.
      (4)   Removal of historic trees requires replacement, as described
herein, in excess of the 160 caliper-inch minimum.
   (H)   Properties subject to design review. For properties subject to the
design review procedure (see
Subchapter I, Part 12), the removal of protected, significant, and historic
trees is at the discretion of the designated reviewing authority, exercised
through the site plan approval process.
      (1)   However, the project site design shall endeavor to retain
protected, significant, and historic trees whenever possible, consistent with
the design principles in
Subchapter H and effective utilization of the project site.
      (2)   The removal of protected, significant, and historic trees is not
intended to provide maximum utilization of the site area, but rather reasonable
use of the site based upon the factors stated above.
      (3)   In reviewing requests for removal of protected, significant, and
historic trees, the designated reviewing authority shall consider tree species,
size, and condition, and may require an independent assessment from an ISA
certified arborist to assist in the final determination.
      (4)   In cases where the removal of an historic tree is proposed, the
developer of the property shall be able to demonstrate that efforts to preserve
the tree(s) were made through site planning and that removal of the tree is
necessary to create the best, most cohesive site plan. This information may be
used by the DRB in making any decisions regarding the proposed removal of
historic tree(s).
      (5)   A minimum of 160 caliper inches per acre shall be retained on the
site. On parcels with less than this amount, caliper inches from planted canopy
trees may be used to meet this requirement.
      (6)   Removal of historic trees requires replacement, as described
herein, in excess of 160-caliper-inch minimum.
   (I)   All other land uses. For other land uses not subject to the design
review process, removal of protected, significant, and historic trees is
allowed with approval of the Zoning Administrator, if replacement trees are
selected from the canopy tree list in §
156.585.
      (1)   However, the project site design shall endeavor to retain
protected, significant, and historic trees whenever possible, consistent with
this subchapter’s stated tree protection principles and effective utilization
of the project site.
      (2)   The removal of protected, significant, and historic trees is not
intended to provide maximum utilization of the site area, but rather reasonable
use of the site based upon the factors stated above.
      (3)   In reviewing requests for removal of protected, significant, and
historic trees, the reviewing authority shall consider tree species, size, and
condition, and may require an independent assessment from an ISA certified
arborist to assist in the final determination.
      (4)   In cases where the removal of an historic tree is proposed, the
developer of the property shall be able to demonstrate that efforts to preserve
the tree(s) were made through site planning, and that removal of the tree is
necessary to create the best, most cohesive site plan. This information may be
used by the reviewing authority in making any decisions regarding the proposed
removal of historic tree(s).
      (5)   A minimum of 160 caliper inches per acre shall be retained on the
site. On parcels with less than this amount, caliper inches from planted canopy
trees may be used to meet this requirement.
      (6)   Removal of historic trees shall require replacement, as described
herein, in excess of 160-caliper-inch minimum.
   (J)   Submittal requirements for clearing and grading permit. Table 156.702-

1 Submittal requirements may be waived by Zoning Administrator.
2 Detached house and townhouse subdivisions requiring preliminary plat approval fall into
this category.
3 This category includes uses such as places of worship; private, semi-private, and
public recreation facilities; and government and quasi-government facilities.
4 Only if required by the Board of Zoning Appeals, Planning Commission, or Town Council.
 
   (K)   Replacement for trees removed without permission.
      (1)   Replacement for trees protected by this subchapter that are removed
without permission shall be calculated by twice the number of inches removed.
      (2)   If the DBH inches of the removed tree cannot be determined,
replacement shall be based on the stump diameter. Where there is no stump to
calculate the diameter of the illegally removed tree, replacement shall be
calculated based on the tree having been 24 inches.
   (L)   Replanting schedule standards. To avoid a monoculture among plantings
and to encourage a diversity, at least 50% of the total quantity of replacement
trees shall be native species. The required planting diversity is based on the
number of replacement trees required.
      (1)   Five to ten trees. Minimum two types of trees to be planted;
      (2)   Ten to 20 trees. Minimum four types of trees to be planted;
      (3)   Twenty to 100 trees. Minimum seven types of trees to be planted;
      (4)   Greater than 100 trees. Minimum ten types of trees to be planted.
   (M)   Fee in lieu of replacement trees.
      (1)   In cases where any or all replacement trees cannot be adequately
accommodated on a site, the developer/owner may have the option of paying a fee
in lieu of replacement trees to the town. This fee shall be two times the
wholesale value per 2.5-inch caliper tree required for mitigation that is not
being planted on site.
      (2)   This money shall be put into the Tree Bank Fund to be used solely
for the planting and/or maintaining of trees for the public good, including the
placement of utility lines underground.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator shall decide whether to accept the fee or
require the on-site placement of the trees.
   (N)   Relocation of a protected tree. Relocation is accomplished by moving
the protected tree elsewhere on the land to be developed pursuant to the same
development order and under the same ownership. The relocation of a protected
tree shall be coordinated with staff and require Zoning Administrator approval
of a detailed maintenance plan, as appropriate based upon size of relocated
tree.
   (O)   Inspection of protected, relocated, or replaced trees.
      (1)   All relocated or replaced trees shall be inspected by the Zoning
Administrator one year after their planting to ensure they are surviving in a
healthy condition.
      (2)   Trees planted pursuant to this subchapter that are found to be in
declining condition shall be replaced by the owner of the parcel within 30 days
of notification from the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   If replacement is necessary, there shall be a re-inspection six
months after the replacement planting.
   (P)   Maintenance of protected, relocated, or replaced trees. The owner of
the parcel is responsible for the maintenance of all protected, relocated, or

plans approved by the respective governing bodies; and
            2.   A finding is made by the applicable governing body that the
tree removal is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the
public.
         (b)   Replacement is required in accordance with this subchapter.
Where buffer configuration or other conditions or circumstances do not permit
canopy tree replacement, mitigation may be achieved with one of the following
methods:
            1.   The largest size tree or tall shrubs may be permitted, with
replacement calculations based upon nursery standards;
            2.   An equivalent donation made to the Tree Bank Fund, as
determined by Town Council; or
            3.   As may be approved in accordance with division (C)(5) below.
         (c)   Tree removal, canopy pruning, and root pruning of trees within
boundaries of existing Town or Mount Pleasant Waterworks infrastructure,
easements, and rights-of-way is permitted with approval of the Zoning
Administrator, upon receipt of a written request from the Town Director of
Public Services, the Town Director of Engineering and Development Services, or
the General Manager of Mount Pleasant Waterworks, if the tree is causing damage
or interference with operation, maintenance, or rehabilitation of Town or Mount
Pleasant Waterworks infrastructure or facilities, and where no other corrective
options are determined feasible to protect or access the infrastructure or
facilities. The Zoning Administrator may approve removal and/or pruning with
replacement required in accordance with this subchapter.
      (5)   Tree replacement not otherwise specified under this division.
         (a)   Utility infrastructure providers, including the town and Mount
Pleasant Waterworks, may be entitled to a reduction or alteration of mitigation
requirements by the Town Administrator should the following conditions be met:

§ 156.705 TREE PROTECTION ZONES (TPZ).
   (A)   Minimum tree protection zone.
      (1)   During the development approval process, a tree protection zone
shall be established around all trees to be saved in accordance with this
subchapter and erected prior to the start of construction.
      (2)   The tree protection zone shall consist of a circular area centered
around the tree, the radius of which is equal to one foot for each inch of DBH
measurement (except as may be modified by division (B) below).
      (3)   The area within the tree protection zone shall remain free of all
building materials, dirt, or other construction materials, debris, vehicles,
and development activities, except as allowed by division (C) below.
      (4)   Impervious surface materials, building foundations, and other
subgrade building elements are prohibited within the tree protection zone.
      (5)   The tree protection zone shall be shown on all site plans,
construction plans, sketch plans, preliminary plats, final plats, and
subsequent recorded plats.
      (6)   Such depiction shall also include an explanation in the appropriate
"note" section of the documents of the treatments.
   (B)   Modifications to tree protection zones. In situations where strict
adherence to the tree protection zone, as defined above, is impossible or
unrealistic (due to site conditions, other town requirements, overlapping tree
protection zones, size or shape of a tree, and the like), the PLAN Department,
through field determination and consultation, may allow or require
modifications to this zone with potential conditions. Particular consideration
should be given to the installation of utilities.
   (C)   Development activities. Development activities within the tree
protection zone shall be in accordance with the following procedures:
      (1)   Grade changes.
         (a)   Moderate fill may be allowed, upon prior approval of the PLAN
Department and with the prior installation of an aeration system.

(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.706 REMEDIAL PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Conditions that require remedial procedures.
      (1)   Remedial site reclamation and tree care procedures shall be
implemented when development activities have caused damage to either the tree
or the tree's growing site and that damage is repairable.
      (2)   If encroachment into tree protection zones is anticipated or has
happened, the following practices shall be employed to improve survivability.
   (B)   Canopy pruning.
      (1)   A tree that has suffered root damage becomes stressed as that root
system no longer provides sufficient water and nutrients for the existing
crown.
         (a)   This stress becomes evident with the appearance of "staghorns"
or deadwood within the tree's crown.
         (b)   Once a tree has had construction damage, it is advisable to
delay pruning for one to three years until the deadwood becomes evident.
Pruning for deadwood removal is then recommended.
      (2)   The removal of live plant tissue from a construction-damaged tree
can accelerate the tree's decline.
      (3)   Trees that have not been affected by construction activities can be
pruned for maintenance of the tree's health, appearance, and safety, utilizing
accepted arboricultural practices.
      (4)   Pruning specifications as provided in the latest version of ANSI
A300 shall be used in all pruning cases.
      (5)   The pruning of specimen trees may be subject to PLAN Department
approval.
      (6)   All cabling work and other structural support supplemental systems
shall be installed in accordance with the latest edition of ANSI A300 American
National Standard for Tree Care Operations - Trees, Brush, and Other Woody
Plant Maintenance - Standard Practices on Support Systems and Cabling.
      (7)   Any lightning rod protection shall be installed in accordance with
ANSI A300 American National Standard for Tree Care Operations - Trees, Brush
and Other Woody Plant Maintenance - Standard Practices on Lightning Protection.
   (C)   Root pruning. All roots outside of the protective barricade to be
removed during the development shall be cleanly severed and a two-inch layer of
mulch shall be applied over the surface of exposed roots during development.
   (D)   Fertilization.
      (1)   Fertilizer applications will enhance the vigor of trees stressed by
site disturbances, thereby promoting root development.
      (2)   Information regarding appropriate fertilizers and application rates
may be obtained in the latest edition of ANSI A300 American National Standard
for Tree Care Operations - Trees, Brush and Other Woody Plant Maintenance -
Standard Practices on Fertilization.
   (E)   Soil aeration.
      (1)   A tree's ability for adequate root development, and ultimately its
chances for survival, are improved with reclamation of the growing site.
      (2)   Wherever possible, the soil should be brought back to its natural
grade.
         (a)   Unnecessary fill, compaction, erosion sedimentation, concrete
washout, and construction debris should be removed.
         (b)   When machinery is required for site improvement, it is
recommended that a "Bobcat" or similar lightweight, rubber-tired vehicle be
used so as to minimize soil compaction.
      (3)   Compacted soil within the tree protection zone should be aerated
(see Figure 156.705-6: Soil Aeration).
         (a)   A compressed air gun is used to cut narrow trenches in a spoke
pattern away from the trunk, to a depth of eight to 12 inches or greater if the
soil grade has been raised.
         (b)   Trenches should begin four to six feet from the trunk to avoid
cutting any major support roots and should extend to the dripline.
         (c)   Trenches are then backfilled with topsoil or compost. The air
exchange, nutrient, and water-holding capacities of soils can be improved with
soil amendments. This is best accomplished by backfilling with mineral
amendments such as perlite, vermiculite, isolite, and the like.

   (F)   Mulching. A four- to six-inch layer of mulch material, such as pine
straw, pine bark, or wood chips, spread within the tree protection zone of
trees on construction sites is extremely beneficial.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.707 IRREPARABLE DAMAGE IN TREE PROTECTION ZONES.
   Where the Planning, Land Use, and Neighborhoods (PLAN) Department determines
that irreparable damage has occurred to trees within the tree protection zones,
the trees must be removed and replaced in accordance with the requirements of §
156.702(K).
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.708 PUBLIC TREES.
   (A)   Public trees within the town are considered to be a valuable public
resource. In order to appropriately care for and maintain these public
resources, the town shall create inventories and develop work plans as
described in this section.
   (B)   Maintain a current inventory of all public trees. The inventory data
gathered and recorded for each tree shall include, at a minimum, the following
informati on:
      (1)    Location (address or latitude/l ongitude coordinat es);
      (2)   Tree species;
      (3)   DBH;
      (4)   Condition; and
      (5)   Maintenance needs.
   (C)   Develop an annual work plan for the management of public trees
utilizing the tree inventory information. The work plan shall contain the
following plans and schedules:
      (1)   Tree planting;
      (2)   New tree maintenance, including mulching, irrigation, and young
tree training pruning;
      (3)   Tree pruning;
      (4)   Tree mulching; and
      (5)   Tree removal.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.709 NOTICE OF VIOLATION AND PENALTY.
   (A)   If the Zoning Administrator finds that any of the provisions of this
subchapter are being violated, they may issue a stop work order and shall, in
writing, notify the owner of the property and the general building contractor,

PART 3: OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE AND LOT DESIGN
§ 156.755 APPLICABILITY.
   This part applies to all uses subject to this subchapter except where
otherwise indicated.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.756 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Tandem parking. Tandem parking is prohibited, unless specifically
allowed elsewhere in this chapter.
   (B)   Stop signs. Stop signs shall be provided at the transition from a
surface parking area to the public right-of-way.
   (C)   Wheel stops. Wheel stops shall be provided wherever an angled parking
space abuts a curb or sidewalk.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.757 SURFACING.
   (A)   All parking spaces shall be surfaced with a suitable paving material
such as asphalt, concrete, specialty pavers, or pea gravel (but not other types
of gravel or similar material), except as provided in §
156.741(B) and division (B) below.
   (B)   Parking spaces located in the SCW-W, SCW-H, SCW-N Districts and
parking spaces serving detached house dwellings, duplex dwellings, and any
other use that requires or provides six or fewer parking spaces may be surfaced
with other suitable paving material approved by the Zoning Administrator in
consultation with the Town Engineer. The applicant shall provide manufacturer
specifications and construction details for the proposed materials.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.758 PARKING SPACE AND TRAVEL AISLE DIMENSIONS.
   (A)   Parking spaces oriented 90 degrees to the travel aisle shall be at
least nine feet in width and 18 feet in length. However, where parking spaces
abut landscaped areas not required by this chapter, the paved length of the
parking stall may be reduced to 17 feet if curbing or anchored concrete wheel
stops are furnished at the edge of paving to allow the vehicle to overhang the
landscape area.
   (B)   Angled parking spaces positioned at other than 90 degrees to the
travel aisle, parallel parking spaces, and one-way travel aisles shall be
dimensioned in accordance with recognized standard criteria, such as time-saver
standards.
   (C)   The minimum dimensions for a parking space exclude aisles, maneuvering
space, turnaround space, and drives.
   (D)   All two-way travel aisles shall be a minimum of 24 feet in width.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.759 DRIVE-THROUGHS.

public access driveway to prevent vehicles from backing up into the adjacent
roadway.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.760 DESIGN REGULATIONS FOR COMMERCIAL, INSTITUTIONAL, AND APARTMENT
COMPLEX PARKING LOTS.
   (A)   Applicability. This section applies for commercial, institutional, and
apartment complex parking lots located in any zoning district.
   (B)   Lighting. Parking lots and vehicular use areas shall be lighted in
accordance with
Subchapter H, Part 3, Subpart 3.4.
   (C)   Screening. All parking lots and vehicular use areas shall be screened
from all abutting properties and rights-of-way by the minimum requirements of
Subchapter D, Part 2.
   (D)   Parking lot landscaping.
      (1)   Planter islands. Surface parking lots shall contain planter islands
located so as to best relieve the expanse of paving.
         (a)   The end of each parking row shall terminate in a planter island,
outlined by curb and gutter or concrete wheel stops.
            1.   A maximum of 12 parking spaces in a row is allowed without a
planter island.
            2.   However, this requirement may be modified by the Zoning
Administrator when strict application will seriously limit the function of an
area.
         (b)   Planter islands shall have a minimum area of 150 square feet.
            1.   Planter islands shall contain at least one 2.5-inch-caliper
canopy tree with a minimum clean trunk of five feet and a minimum overall
height of eight feet at the time of planting. “Minimum clean trunk” means the
tree does not have limbs or leaves between the ground and the specified height,
which helps maintain a clear line of sight for drivers and pedestrians.
            2.   The remainder shall be landscaped with understory trees,
shrubs, or ground cover.
            3.   As it presents considerable root competition for trees, the
use of lawn within an island should be limited.
            4.   Planter islands with a minimum area less than 250 square feet
shall not include light poles, fire hydrants, manholes, curb inlets/drain
boxes, transformers, and the like.
         (c)   Depth of termination area and height of landscaping shall be
determined by preserving a sight triangle within the parking area formed by a
long leg of 50 feet and a height of eye of three and one-half feet.
      (2)   Planted borders.
         (a)   Where a parking area is not located immediately adjacent to a
perimeter or right-of-way bufferyard, the parking area shall have planted
borders at least five feet in width located parallel to lot lines and rights-
of-way.
         (b)   Planted borders are intended to supplement, not replace,
required bufferyards.
         (c)   Planted border areas shall contain at least one 2.5-inch-caliper
canopy tree, with a minimum clear trunk of five feet and a minimum height of
eight feet, for each 30 linear feet of the border area. The remainder shall be
landscaped with shrubs, lawn, ground cover, or other approved materials.
         (d)   Planted border areas may be interrupted to provide:
            1.   Ingress and egress drives for the property; and
            2.   Sidewalks that are generally perpendicular to the border area
and that are used to connect the parking area to a building.
   (E)   Existing plant material.
      (1)   The natural landscape shall be preserved according to the
provisions of §
156.991.
      (2)   Wherever healthy plant material exists on a site, the standards in
division (D) above may be adjusted to allow credit for such plant material, if
the existing plant material meets the standards in this section.

§§ 156.761 THROUGH 156.769 RESERVED.
PART 4: ALTERNATIVE PARKING PLANS
§ 156.770 PURPOSE.
   The minimum off-street parking ratios are intended to encourage development
that is economically viable and environmentally sensitive. The standards in
this subchapter are not intended to be so rigid as to require significantly
more parking spaces than a particular use demands, or to inhibit creative
development. Project conditions associated with individual sites may justify
the use of alternative parking plans as provided in this part.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.771 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Alternative parking plans may be submitted in conjunction with any
application, subject to the requirements in the applicable section of this
part.
   (B)   Alternative parking plans may modify the provisions of §
156.732 or §
156.741, but shall not modify any other provisions of this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.772 OFF-SITE PARKING.
   (A)   Applicability. Off-site parking may be provided for any use, subject
to the provisions in this section.
   (B)   Location.
      (1)   The off-site parking area shall be located no more than 600 feet
from the primary pedestrian entrance of the use(s) served. This distance is
measured from the nearest point of the off-site parking area to the primary
pedestrian entrance of the use served along the shortest designated pedestrian
route.
      (2)   The off-site parking spaces shall not be separated from the use(s)
served by a street right-of-way greater than 80 feet in width.
   (C)   Availability of off-site parking spaces. Off-site parking spaces used
to meet minimum parking requirements must be exclusively available to the users
of the use served by the off-site parking spaces during the duration of use.
   (D)   Off-site parking agreement required. The owner of the lot on which the
off-site parking is located must relinquish, through a covenant agreement with
the town, their development rights over the property until such time as parking
space is provided elsewhere or on the same premises as the principal use or
uses.
      (1)   An agreement ensuring the use of the off-site parking area by the
associated use shall be submitted in conjunction with the application.
      (2)   If an off-site parking agreement is revoked by the parties to the
agreement, off-street parking shall be provided in another location in
accordance with the requirements of this subchapter.
   (E)   Off-site parking in the TH District.
      (1)   In the TH District, required parking may be provided in a community
parking lot or garage, the title to which and/or easement for the use of which
runs with and/or is appurtenant to the title of townhouse.
      (2)   Any such parking lot or garage shall be located 200 feet or less
from the dwelling(s) it serves.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.773 ON-STREET PARKING.
   (A)   Applicability.
      (1)   On-street parking is allowed in Planned Development Districts, if
expressly authorized by the associated rezoning ordinance.
      (2)   On-street parking may be allowed in zoning overlay districts (see
Subchapter B).
      (3)   On-street parking may be provided in any zoning district that is
subject to Subchapter H, if approved through the design review process.
   (B)   Location.
      (1)   Public streets.
         (a)   On-street parking may be located on town-owned rights-of-way.
         (b)   On-street parking on state rights-of-way is subject to review
and approval by the South Carolina Department of Transportation.
         (c)   On-street parking is publicly available and may not be reserved
for private use.
         (d)   On-street parking may not be used for required off-street
parking.
      (2)   Private streets. On-street parking may be located on private
rights-of-way.
      (3)   Access drives. On-street parking may be located on private drives

   (C)   Design.
      (1)   On-street parking spaces. On-street parking spaces shall be:
         (a)   Oriented parallel to the travel lanes, except on private streets
and access drives where they may be parallel or angled;
         (b)   Dimensioned in accordance with recognized standard criteria,
such as time-saver standards;
         (c)   Located at least 50 feet from any street intersection, as
measured from the closest edge of the parking space to the center of the
intersection;
         (d)   Located at least 30 feet from any intersection of two access
drives or an access drive and a street, as measured from the closest edge of
the parking space to the center of the intersection; and
         (e)   Marked in accordance with the latest edition of the Manual on
Uniform Traffic Control Devices.
      (2)   Curb and gutter. Curb and gutter shall be provided.
      (3)   Curb extensions.
         (a)   Curb extensions (or “bulb-outs”) shall be provided between at
least every six on-street parking spaces.
         (b)   A curb extension shall have at least the same dimensions as the
on-street parking spaces.
         (c)   Curb extensions shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs,
groundcover, or a combination of these elements. For developments subject to
the Environmental Guidelines for Land Development (see §
155.054(B)) curb extensions on:
            1.   Private streets or access drives may accommodate low impact
development stormwater control measures; and
            2.   Public streets may accommodate low impact development
stormwater control measures, if approved by the Town Engineer.
   (D)   New on-street parking may constitute up to 50% of required parking.
      (1)   Unless otherwise specified in a PD District ordinance or zoning
overlay district regulations, newly constructed on-street parking spaces may be
used to satisfy up to 50% of the parking spaces required for any use if the on-
street parking is located within:
         (a)   250 feet of any building entrance for a residential use; and
         (b)   600 feet of the primary building entrance for a non-residential
use.
      (2)   All required accessible parking spaces shall be provided off-
street.
   (E)   On-street parking map required.
      (1)   If on-street parking spaces are used to satisfy any portion of the
minimum parking requirement, the applicant shall provide a key map allocating
the provided on-street parking to the lot or tenant utilizing the spaces.
However, on-street parking spaces for a specific use shall not be reserved
exclusively by that use, but must be available for general public use at all
times. Signs or action limiting general public use of on-street spaces is
prohibited.
      (2)   The overlapping of the same on-street parking space(s) for multiple
uses is prohibited.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.774 SHARED PARKING.
   (A)   Applicability. Shared parking may be provided for any two or more
uses, subject to the provisions in this section.
   (B)   Generally.
      (1)   Off-street parking spaces may be shared among more than one use,
whether the uses are on the same lot or on separate lots, if the total number
of off-street parking spaces is at least equal to the sum of the individual
off-street parking space requirements for each use specified in §
156.741, except as provided in division (D) below.
      (2)   Shared parking spaces must be available on an equal basis for all
users. Parking spaces shall not be designated solely for certain uses through
the use of signs or other elements, except that shared parking spaces provided
pursuant to division (D) below may be restricted to specific users during
certain hours.
   (C)   Shared parking agreement required.
      (1)   When off-street parking spaces are shared among more than one use,
a legally sufficient agreement, approved by the Town Attorney prior to
execution, ensuring the perpetual joint usage and maintenance of the shared
parking area(s) shall be recorded with the Charleston County Register of Deeds.
      (2)   The agreement must include provisions for written notice to the
Zoning Administrator prior to expiration, termination, or an amendment to the
agreement.
      (3)   An executed shared parking agreement shall be submitted to the
Zoning Administrator prior to technical review and code compliance or zoning
permit approval, as applicable, and recorded within 30 days of approval.
      (4)   If a shared parking agreement expires, terminates, or is amended in
a manner contrary to this section, off-street parking shall be provided in
another location in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter within
60 days of such action. Unless remediating steps are taken that bring the
property into compliance with parking requirements, the property may be
considered in violation of this chapter.
   (D)   Reduction in required number of off-street parking spaces.
      (1)   Where off-street parking spaces are shared among two or more uses
that have different hours of operation or peak parking demand hours, the Zoning
Administrator may allow a reduction in the total number of required parking
spaces.
      (2)   The reduction shall be based on a shared parking analysis prepared
by a professional engineer or transportation planner that clearly demonstrates
the feasibility of shared parking.
      (3)   In the shared parking analysis, the professional engineer or
transportation planner shall assess:
         (a)   Site-specific elements, including the size and type of the
proposed development and the composition of uses or tenants; and
         (b)   The anticipated rate of parking turnover and the anticipated
peak parking and traffic loads for all uses, using:
            1.   Actual parking counts for uses or combinations of uses that
are the same or comparable to the proposed use(s) in terms of density, scale,
bulk, area, type of activity, and location; and/or
            2.   Relevant data from the Institute of Transportation Engineers
(ITE), Urban Land Institute (ULI) meeting a Level of Service A or B for walking
distances from parking to entrance, or another generally accepted resource for
parking demand data; and/or
            3.   The availability of current or planned public transportation
routes, greenways, and other pedestrian and bicycle connections.
      (4)   If one or more uses change, a new shared parking analysis is
required to demonstrate whether the parking reduction continues to accommodate
the parking demand for each use. If the number of parking spaces provided no
longer accommodates the parking demand generated by each use, parking shall be
provided in accordance with this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.775 PARKING DEMAND STUDIES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of a parking demand study is to demonstrate the
appropriate off-street parking ratio for a proposed use, based on operational
characteristics of the particular use and relevant site-specific factors.
   (B)   Applicability.
      (1)   The applicant for any use where §
156.741 specifies that the minimum number of off-street parking spaces is
established via a parking demand study, or for any use not listed in the table,
shall submit a parking demand study in conjunction with the relevant
application.
      (2)   The applicant for any use may submit a parking demand study in
conjunction with the relevant application if the applicant believes the parking
ratio specified in §
156.741 exceeds the number needed for the proposed use.
   (C)   Documentation of parking demand required.
      (1)   The parking demand study shall be prepared by a professional
engineer or transportation planner.
      (2)   The professional engineer or transportation planner shall provide
documentation verifying parking demand based on:
         (a)   Relevant data for the proposed use, if available, such as number
of employees, hours of operation, and number and frequency of customer or
client visits; and/or
         (b)   Actual parking counts for uses or combinations of uses that are
the same or comparable to the proposed use(s) in terms of density, scale, bulk,
area, type of activity, and location; and/or
         (c)   Data from the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), Urban
Land Institute (ULI) meeting a Level of Service A or B for walking distances
from parking to entrance, or another generally accepted resource for parking
demand data.
      (3)   The parking demand study shall consider the availability of current
or planned public transportation routes, greenways, and other pedestrian and
bicycle connections.
   (D)   Total number of parking spaces required. The approved parking demand
study shall establish the minimum number of parking spaces required for the
use.
   (E)   Changes affecting the number of parking spaces needed.
      (1)   If changes occur that affect the number of parking spaces needed
for the use, such as building additions, changes to operational characteristics
of the use, or adjustments to hours of operation, then either:
         (a)   A new parking demand study shall be submitted to demonstrate
whether the number of existing parking spaces continues to accommodate the
parking demand for the use; or
         (b)   Parking shall be provided in accordance with the applicable
ratio specified in
Subchapter F, Part 2.
      (2)   If the new parking demand study demonstrates that the number of
existing parking spaces no longer accommodates the parking demand generated by
the use, parking shall be provided in accordance with the new parking demand
study or with the applicable ratio specified in
Subchapter F, Part 2.

and accomplish the other purposes set out above.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.811 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   This subchapter applies to new and existing signs within the town,
except for the signs exempted from the applicability of this subchapter in §
156.812.
   (B)   This subchapter does not prohibit signs required by local, state, or
federal law and does not authorize signs prohibited by state or federal law.
   (C)   A person may not construct, install, operate, display, change the sign
copy, or otherwise use any sign this subchapter prohibits.
   (D)   A person may not construct, install, operate, display, change the sign
copy, or otherwise use any sign at a time, place, or manner that this
subchapter prohibits.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.812 EXEMPT SIGNS.
   (A)   Government signs. This subchapter does not apply to signs erected,
maintained, or displayed by the state, federal, Charleston County, or town
governments. Government uses in all zoning districts may include signs.
   (B)   Traffic control devices. This subchapter does not apply to traffic
control devices on public or private property that the Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices adopted in this state requires.
   (C)   Required signs. This subchapter does not apply to any sign or device
the state, federal, or county government requires a person to erect, maintain,
or display.
   (D)   Indoor signs. This subchapter does not apply to signs within a
structure that are not visible from any perspective outside of the structure.
   (E)   Signs in an enclosed facility. This subchapter does not apply to signs
in an enclosed facility, such as a fenced or restricted access facility, that
are not visible from any point outside the facility.
   (F)   Signs smaller than one square foot. This subchapter does not apply to
signs with an area of less than one square foot that are located on a platted
lot. Such signs may not be placed in the right-of-way of any public street.

sign must comply with the standards of this subchapter.
   (G)   Non-residential light pole banners. This subchapter does not apply to
temporary banners affixed to light poles in multi-tenant developments that are
displayed for a period not to exceed 90 days.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.813 PROHIBITED SIGNS.
   The following signs are hereby expressly prohibited unless specifically
otherwise allowed.
   (A)   Off-premises signs. Off-premises signs are prohibited, except as
provided in §
156.828.
   (B)   Signs that move. Signs or portions of signs that move by any means, or
signs that give the appearance of movement in any manner, including feather
signs, except for flags as allowed in this subchapter.
   (C)   Signs on parked vehicles. A vehicle, including trailers or other non-
motorized wheeled vehicles carrying or displaying signs, may not be parked so
that it functions primarily as a sign.
      (1)   Factors. The following factors determine whether a vehicle is used
primarily as a sign:
         (a)   The vehicle is parked at a prominent location on the lot;
         (b)   The vehicle is parked at the same or similar locations for more
than eight consecutive hours during the same day or for more than three
consecutive days during the same week; and
         (c)   A viewer in the right-of-way can read the sign copy.
      (2)   Presumption of use as a sign. While other factors may also
establish a violation of the prohibition of vehicle signs, a vehicle
presumptively violates this provision if the vehicle satisfies the three
factors, and the owner of the vehicle does not provide a compelling reason to
justify the parking location as opposed to another less conspicuous location.
   (D)   Signs that emit sound, odor, or visible matter, such as smoke or
vapor.
   (E)   Any sign or sign structure that obstructs the view of, or may be
confused with, a traffic/directional safety sign.

county-maintained street, highway, or right-of-way or within any street or
right-of-way that is maintained by the town.
   (G)   Any sign painted on or affixed to trees or other natural features,
utility poles, benches, or other street furniture, such as waste receptacles,
bike racks, drinking fountains, public telephones, and the like.

   (L)   Banners, flags (except as specifically permitted in this subchapter),
pennants, streamers, balloons, and other gas-filled figures, except as allowed
in
Chapter 116.
   (M)   Marquees.
   (N)   Electronic readerboard signs. However, interactive digital kiosks and
displays are not considered signs.
   (O)   Portable signs, except for A-frame signs, as specifically permitted in
this subchapter.
   (P)   Any other sign not expressly authorized by this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.814 CONTENT NEUTRALITY AND SUBSTITUTION.
   (A)   Content neutrality. Despite any other provision of this subchapter,
the content of a sign’s message does not limit its permissibility under this
subchapter. However, location-based standards such as off-premises sign
regulations do not regulate content and do apply to signs.
   (B)   Substitution allowed. Any sign allowed with a commercial message may
contain any non-commercial message. Any sign with a non-commercial message may
contain any other non-commercial message.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.815 CLASSIFICATION OF SIGN USERS AND INTERPRETATION OF TABLES.
   (A)   Generally. This subchapter classifies sign users in a series of tables
to provide different allowances for area, height, and other features for signs
based on the use and to ensure that the same sign standards apply to similarly
situated users and in cohesive areas.
   (B)   Classifications. For the purposes of the subchapter, the following use
classifications apply:
      (1)   Residential uses. These are the principal uses listed in §
156.338, category for residential uses;

or group of buildings developed for multiple non-residential users or mixed-
uses occupying one development site, such as a shopping center, retail center,
office park, multi-story multi-tenant building, planned development, mixed-use
building, or comprehensive development projects. Exclusively residential
developments are not considered a multi-tenant development.
   (C)   Interpretation of tables. This subchapter presents the allowed
specifications for signs in a series of tables. The subjects addressed by the
tables are described below. Each of the tables is a summary of the dimensional
allowances and features, and additional standards and requirements are included
in the substantive section for each sign type. The tables include the following
standards.

§ 156.865 MEASUREMENTS.
   (A)   Height.
      (1)   Freestanding signs. For freestanding signs, height is the distance
from the highest point of the sign to the base of the sign at the ground level.

IMAGES/0-0-0-13050.png]
 
   (B)   Sign area.
      (1)   Generally. The general sign area, measured in square feet (“sq.
ft.”), is the width multiplied by the height of a single rectangle, parallel
with the ground, that contains all sign copy and other illuminated decorative
embellishments that are not an architectural design element of the building or
the base or sign support structure.
Figure 156.865-1: General Sign Measurements illustrates this measurement.
      (2)   Channel letters. The sign area for signs using channel letters is
the sign face width multiplied by the sign face height for the smallest
rectangle that completely encloses all sign copy. It does not include the
background unless the background is internally illuminated. Figure 156.865-2:
Channel Letter Area Measurement illustrates this measurement.

IMAGES/0-0-0-13052.png]
 
      (3)   For two-sided signs. The sign area of a two-sided sign with
parallel faces of the same size is the measure of the larger sign area of
either of the two sides. Signs with more than two faces and multi-sided signs
or objects are not allowed.
   (C)   Façade width.
      (1)   Measurement. Where this subchapter calculates a sign area allowance
based on the width of a building’s façade facing a street frontage, the width
of the façade is the horizontal distance of the façade at grade on the side of
the building facing a public street. Figure 156.865-3 illustrates this
measurement.
      (2)   Shopping centers and retail centers. For shopping centers and
retail centers with multiple occupants, the width of the façade is the
horizontal distance of the portion of the façade between party walls or tenant
separation partitions for the particular occupant at grade on the side of the
building on which the sign is proposed.

§ 156.882 DESIGN REVIEW PROCESS REQUIRED.
   The design review process establishes a systematic and uniform review
procedure for proposed construction of all applicable non-residential, mixed-
use, and in some cases multi-family developments to protect and provide for the
desired character of the commercial districts and development areas throughout
the town.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.883 TOWN DESIGN PRINCIPLES.
   (A)   Purpose. The following design principles serve as criteria for staff
and the Design Review Board for decision-making as it relates to Mount Pleasant
vernacular or lowcountry vernacular in the review of proposed development and
redevelopment throughout the town. The goal of the design standards is to
maintain the traditional small village feel of Mount Pleasant as it continues
to grow.
   (B)   Findings. The vernacular buildings of Mount Pleasant are typical of
most small, Atlantic seaboard fishing communities, and can be generally
described as simple and utilitarian in expression of form, design, material,
and detail. Mount Pleasant has historically been a small town. By 1970, the
population had only grown to roughly 6,000 residents. Since that time, the
population has doubled each decade. Buildings were generally small, vernacular
structures. While some buildings with formal styles were constructed, they are
generally few. Therefore, future construction should follow the form and
detailing of the more abundant small, vernacular buildings and utilize
vernacular designs and elements as described herein.
   (C)   Simplicity of massing and form. Traditional buildings are known for
their simple and utilitarian forms. Because traditional structures were built
by hand, elaborate shapes or complex forms were avoided due to labor and cost
implications. Structures must be distilled to a simple massing composed of one
or more rectangular forms.
   (D)   Legible hierarchy and order of elements. Throughout the lowcountry,
features of traditional structures are generally arranged from most to least
important. The most important portions of the building are emphasized and
receive greater attention to detail. The least important portions recede or
receive simpler treatments. Likewise, new buildings must include primary
massing components (i.e., the dominant or central part of a building) and
secondary or tertiary massing components (i.e., areas that flank or link the
main portion of the building are considered less prominent areas).
   (E)   Harmonious proportions. Traditional structures utilize simple
proportions to optimize rationality and constructability. The use of proportion
in new construction must establish harmonious relationships between the massing
of the building and architectural elements. Simple proportional relationships
that contribute to visually pleasing and cohesive whole generally adhere to 1:
1, 3:2, and 5:2 ratios. Vertical orientation, where elements are taller than
they are wide, are preferred because they relate well to human scale and
perception.
   (F)   Consistent arrangement of elements. Traditional architecture arranges
openings, columns, and elements of the building in a manner that is based on
practicality, ease of construction, and time efficiency. Window openings must
be arranged regularly and symmetrical along a building face.
   (G)   Top, middle, and base. Vertical elements must be composed of a clearly
visible top, middle, and base. These three separate concepts are rooted in
classical patterns, provide order, and give articulation to a building.
Building elevations must clearly illustrate a visually pronounced first floor
or base level, a middle ground consisting of all floors above the base level,
and an articulated top consisting of the final floor or top level with defined
cornice or sloped roof profile.
   (H)   Relationship to the street. Traditionally, structures were placed and
arranged so that the most public portion of the building (e.g., the entrance)
orients outward toward the public realm (i.e., a street, park, plaza, or
private courtyard area connecting to a street). The front of buildings must be
arranged to create a strong and discernible connection with the public realm.
   (I)   Relationship to environs. Lowcountry vernacular architecture responds
to and connects with the natural environment and regional climate. Building
placement, orientation to the sun, natural light and ventilation, materiality,
and shading all lend toward developing a strong sense of character that is
unique to Mount Pleasant vernacular. New construction must incorporate elements
that relate well to the natural setting and climate.
   (J)   Materials and detailing. Primary building materials were limited to
those readily available in the area–predominantly wood and some brick. Roofs
generally feature a hipped or gabled roof, often with broad eave overhangs and
exposed rafter tails or fascia trim. Boxed eaves, when present, feature a
traditional pedimented gable or return detail. Roofing materials are
historically metal standing seam or 5-V crimp and later shingles. Windows are
abundant for light and ventilation. Window shapes and panes are taller than
wide. Windows occur as singles, pairs or, in some instances, triples with a
single, wide “picture frame” trim. Decorative trim and detailing is generally
limited to the pedestrian areas of the building, such as display windows and
entry elements, although some simple variations of cornice trim may be found at
the eaves and in the gables. Large porches are common at the primary entries,
with square wood columns that are often chamfered. Simple round Tuscan columns
were sometimes used but are primarily seen as later replacement columns.
   (K)   Vista and view shed. Lowcountry vernacular structures are generally
framed within their settings, often incorporating large trees and roadways into
a visual experience. Where it is reasonably practical, proposed structures
shall not impede scenic views from the main road, from existing structures, or
from natural settings. Structures must strengthen and maintain vistas and view
sheds.
   (L)   Relationship to adjacent structures. Although maximum site densities
and special site requirements defined for particular use districts shall be
preserved, proposed structures shall not dominate, in an incompatible manner,
an adjacent building, nor in surrounding general development substantially in
compliance with this chapter.
   (M)   Cohesive design. Cohesive design elements create harmony through
related massing, scale, proportion, detail, materials, color, site planning,
and landscaping.
      (1)   All elevations of a structure shall be in harmony with one another
in terms of scale, proportion, detail, material, and color. The side and rear
elevations of buildings shall be as visually attractive as the front elevation.
Rooflines and architectural detailing shall present a consistency in quality
design.
      (2)   All buildings and structures within a proposed development,
including canopies, shall utilize a unifying architectural theme and be uniform
in character in order to create a harmonious whole. However, it is not to be
inferred that buildings must look alike to achieve a harmony of style. The
scale of buildings and accessory structures (including canopies) shall be
appropriate to the scale of structures located in the surrounding area.
Canopies designed as domineering or overpowering architectural features are not
allowed.
      (3)   The architecture, landscaping, and building siting must work in
concert to create a unified appearance that contributes to the existing/
developing streetscape.
   (N)   Architectural compatibility.
      (1)   The architectural design and material finish of buildings, signage,
gasoline pump canopies, and other necessary structures shall be compatible with
one another, and with adjacent and surrounding structures where such structures
are substantially in compliance with this section.
      (2)   In reviewing a proposed structure, specific considerations shall be
given to its compatibility with adjacent structures.
      (3)   Proposed structures shall be shown to scale, in a streetscape view
with adjacent buildings, by using elevations or, in certain instances,
photographs, of adjacent structures.
   (O)   Local design quality. Structures that are of symbolic design for
reasons of advertising, corporate identity or corporate continuity shall be
highly discouraged; however, the Design Review Board or staff may work with
applicants to incorporate limited signature design elements into buildings, to
allow recognition of certain corporate or signature identity, while still
retaining the ability to achieve a project design unique to Mount Pleasant.
Similarly, prototype architecture is prohibited; however, the Design Review
Board or staff may work with applicants to incorporate limited signature design
elements into buildings, to allow recognition of certain corporate or signature
identity, while still retaining the ability to achieve a project design unique
to Mount Pleasant.
   (P)   Prohibited architectural styles. Colonial, Classical, Victorian,
Bauhaus, mid-20th Century modern, and/or formal architectural styles and
designs are prohibited. The form may be based on historical models; however,
the formal detailing of the historical period styles should be absent or
extremely simple when present.
   (Q)   Consideration for contemporary architectural treatments. Contemporary
architectural treatments, as demonstrated in Figure 156.883-1: Contemporary Use
of Vernacular Design and Elements below, shall not be prohibited where it
maintains the traditional form, massing, design elements, materials, and
adherence to design principles of Mount Pleasant vernacular or lowcountry
vernacular, and arranges the components in a new and/or modern way such that
the basic nature and form of the traditional architecture is clearly visible
and compatible with surrounding structures and sites. Commercial buildings
should reflect and incorporate traditional characteristics and patterns with
simple modifications made to accommodate emerging market trends and commercial
activities.

IMAGES/0-0-0-13056.png]
 
   (R )   Consideration for taller buildings. Structures that are excessively
wide and tall are not consistent with Mount Pleasant vernacular and lowcountry
vernacular tradition. Vernacular structures were generally no taller than 38 -
40 feet, given the sum of heights of the base, floor-to-floor levels, and roof
of a traditional two-story structure. Therefore, modern buildings generally
taller than three stories and 45 feet should employ traditional design
principles to mitigate excessive massing and scale of building elements and
relate to traditional form and models. Specific design standards that include
parameters for taller buildings are noted in §§
156.892,
156.894, and
156.898(C).

or by unbroken extension of line, shall not be permitted.
      (3)   Flat roofs.
         (a)   Flat roofs are prohibited, except when provisions are made for
outdoor mechanical wells and similar types of equipment, as follows.
         (b)   On buildings requiring flat roofs for roof-mounted mechanical
equipment, a flat roof section may be attached to the rear of the building,
with a pitched roof over the front portion of the building so that the flat
roof area appears to be a later addition. Buildings may create a flat roof area
between pitched elements, where the pitched elements completely screen the
mechanical equipment from view. Hipped or gabled roofs with a mechanical roof
well will not be considered mansard roofs, when the roof appears to be a true
hipped or gabled design.
   (E)   Eaves. Gable or hip roofs shall have broad eave overhangs proportioned
to the building.
   (F)   Roof elaborations.
      (1)   Cupolas, widow's walks, and other roof appurtenances, such as
domes, are not allowed; provided, however, that civic buildings, such as
churches, may incorporate these elements when appropriate to the design theme
of the structure.
      (2)   Roof appurtenances, such as dormers, roof monitors, light wells,
and mechanical vents, shall be gabled, hipped, or shed designs, and shall
function as true elements not used for aesthetic purposes only.

utilize a single drive-through access lane and/or a single row of parking, with
a two-way drive aisle located between the building and the primary street
frontage, pursuant to the following conditions:
      (1)   The drive-through pick-up window shall not be located on the
primary street;
      (2)   The drive-through access isle and parking shall be suitably
screened from view, with a structure such as a pierced-brick wall and/or a
vegetated hedge of single- or double-row vegetation. Because individual
building sites vary and to provide variety in design, these treatments will be
determined during the design review process;
      (3)   The plant unit multiplier shall be 1.5 for required vegetation,
except as stated above, if a hedge screening treatment is utilized, and the
canopy trees utilized shall be from the list as provided in §
156.585;
      (4)   Double- or multi-lane drive-through access is allowed elsewhere on
the site, but not between the building and the primary street frontage;
      (5)   The drive-through lanes and access aisle(s) shall be considered

Classification System for Outdoor Luminaires. Each component is assigned a
value between zero and five, with lower numbers indicating a luminaire emits
less light in a given direction. A zero value means the luminaire emits no
light in the given direction.
      (2)   Backlight. Backlight creates light trespass onto adjacent lots and
streets.
      (3)   Uplight. Uplight contributes to skyglow.
      (4)   Glare. Glare causes visual discomfort or reduced visibility.
   (B)   Maximum allowable BUG ratings.
      (1)   All luminaires shall be rated and installed according to
Table 156.976-3: Maximum Allowable Backlight, Uplight, and Glare (BUG) Ratings.
      (2)   A luminaire may be used if it is rated for the lighting zone of the
site or is lower in number for all ratings (B, U, and G). Luminaires equipped
with adjustable mounting devices permitting alteration of luminaire aiming in
the field are prohibited.
      (3)   If a luminaire does not have a BUG rating, it shall be fully-
shielded.

§ 156.981 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subpart, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   BACKLIGHT. For an exterior luminaire, lumens emitted in the quarter sphere
below horizontal and in the opposite direction of the intended orientation of
the luminaire. For luminaires with symmetric distribution, backlight will be
the same as front light.
   CORRELATED COLOR TEMPERATURE (CCT). A numerical figure used to describe the
apparent color of white or nearly white light sources such as LEDs or metal
halide.
   DIRECT LIGHT. Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or
reflector diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens of a luminaire.
   EXTERIOR LIGHTING. The illumination of an outside area or object by any
human-made device located outdoors that produces light by any means.
   FIXTURE. The assembly that houses the lamp or lamps, and can include all or
some of the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a
lamp holder, a ballast, a reflector or mirror, or a refractor or lens.
   GLARE. Lighting entering the eye directly from luminaires or indirectly from
reflective surfaces that causes visual discomfort or reduced visibility.
   LAMP. The component of a luminaire that produces the actual light. A generic
term for a source of optical radiation (i.e., “light”), often called a “bulb”
or “tube.” Examples include incandescent, fluorescent, high-intensity discharge
(HID) lamps, and low pressure sodium (LPS) lamps, as well as light-emitting
diode (LED) modules and arrays.
   LANDSCAPE LIGHTING. Lighting equipment powered at less than 15 volts with
luminaires having a rated initial luminaire lumen output of 525 lumens or less.
   LIGHT TRESPASS. Light that falls beyond the boundaries of the property it is
intended to illuminate.
   LIGHTING EQUIPMENT. Equipment specifically intended to provide gas or
electric illumination, including but not limited to, lamps, luminaires,
ballasts, poles, posts, lenses, and related structures, electrical wiring, and
other necessary or auxiliary components.
   LUMEN. The unit of measure used to quantify the amount of light produced by
a lamp or emitted from a luminaire (as distinct from “watt,” a measure of power
consumption).
   LUMINAIRE. A complete lighting unit (fixture), consisting of a lamp, or
lamps and ballast(s) (when applicable), together with the parts designed to
distribute the light (reflector, lens, diffuser), to position and protect the
lamps, and to connect the lamps to the power supply.
   LUMINAIRE, FULLY-SHIELDED. A luminaire constructed and installed in such a
manner that all light emitted by the luminaire, either directly from the lamp
or a diffusing element, or indirectly by reflection or refraction from any part
of the luminaire, is projected below the horizontal plane through the
luminaire's lowest light-emitting part. Any structural part of the luminaire
providing this shielding must be permanently affixed and part of the luminaire,
not part of any surrounding building or architectural elements.
   LUMINAIRE, HEIGHT OF. The vertical distance from the ground directly below
the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest, direct, light-emitting part of
the luminaire.
   MOUNTING HEIGHT. See LUMINAIRE, HEIGHT OF.
   SEASONAL LIGHTING. Temporary lighting installed and operated in connection
with holidays or traditions.
   SECURITY LIGHTING. The minimum amount of exterior lighting necessary to
illuminate building entrances, exits, and other possible points of entry;
exterior walkways; and/or outdoor storage areas.
   SKYGLOW. The brightening of the nighttime sky that results from scattering
and reflection of artificial light by moisture and dust particles in the
atmosphere. SKYGLOW is caused by light directed or reflected upwards or
sideways and reduces one's ability to view the night sky.
   UNIFORMITY. A description of the smoothness of the lighting pattern or the
degree of intensity of light and dark areas in the area to be lighted.
   UNIFORMITY RATIO. A measurement of the relative difference between the
average footcandles of illumination on the area to be lighted and the
footcandles at the point of minimum illuminance on the area to be lighted. The
lower the ratio, the more uniform the lighting design. A UNIFORMITY RATIO of 3:
1 means the average footcandles value on the area to be lighted is three times
the footcandles value at the point of least illuminance on the area to be
lighted.
   UPLIGHT. For an exterior luminaire, flux radiated in the hemisphere at or
above the horizontal plane.

§§ 156.1012 THROUGH 156.1019 RESERVED.
SUBPART 4.2: COMMERCIAL VILLAGE SPECIAL DESIGN SUBAREA
§ 156.1020 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   Purpose. The Commercial Village concept shares certain similarities
with standard enclosed malls in terms of business types, but its land use
patterns differ considerably.
      (1)   Where enclosed malls are surrounded by large, streetless seas of
asphalt, which, in turn, are surrounded by numerous developed outparcels devoid
of pedestrian linkages; the Commercial Village will assimilate various uses on
a unified street system capable of continued evolution.
      (2)   Structures, including buildings, utility buildings, and parking
decks, will display a high degree of architectural integrity to appeal to and
attract people, and promote the appearance, character, and economic value of
the property.
      (3)   Development patterns are encouraged to have office or residential
uses above retail uses. Design elements will include excellence in the
architecture of structures, unified scale and proportionality shared by
buildings, street furniture, lighting standards, streets and parking lots, the
use of window displays, and convenience of parking relative to sidewalks, as
described by standards herein.
      (4)   The accommodation of automobiles, though utterly essential, will
not dominate land use patterns or design quality.
   (B)   Applicability. This subpart applies to developments consisting of
shopping centers, strip centers, super centers, malls, and other combined
commercial projects totaling more than 100,000 square feet, including
outparcels.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1021 SUPPLEMENTAL BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Building setback. Buildings will follow a generally uniform setback
along the street. Variations may be allowed to accommodate architectural
features.
   (B)   Primary façade and entry orientation. Building façades facing parking
lots shall be considered the same as street-front façades and shall be designed
as a primary façade.
   (C)   Structures.
      (1)   Individuality in the design of each building is encouraged.
         (a)   Unity between buildings shall rely primarily on proportional
relationship and composition of material.
         (b)   Regardless of height, buildings must relate to one another by
exactly or closely approximating each other's cornice and fenestration lines.
      (2)   The establishment of a successful relationship between the scale of
structures is critical.
         (a)   Regardless of height or size, buildings must relate to one
another's scale, particularly where large buildings abut small buildings.
         (b)   Therefore, large buildings must avoid wide, flat expanses by
using architectural treatments to reduce the visual effect of width.
      (3)   Proportional height-to-width ratios are expected to be provided by
project architects and applied to all structures and the development area. Tall
structures that contain only one floor must use architectural treatments to
infer a second story.
      (4)   Structures designed solely to promote standardized corporate images
are prohibited.
      (5)   All structures are to be specifically designed for their particular
sites and in consideration of the character of the entire development.
   (D)   Parking lot areas and facilities.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   Parking lot areas must be designed to accommodate pedestrians
and landscaping, as well as vehicles.
         (b)   Parking lot areas must be designed to reduce lateral parking
space requirements and increase the amount of landscaped and/or buildable area.
      (2)   Location of parking lot.
         (a)   Parking lots must be positioned to the rear or side of
buildings.
         (b)   Where this is not required as a result of the design review
process and where they abut streets, parking lots must be shielded from view by
the use of walls and landscaping that contribute to the streetscape of the
adjacent built environment.
         (c)   Entrances to parking areas must be evident through the use of
landmark entrance treatments.
      (3)   Spatial requirements.
         (a)   Parking areas must be located within a reasonable safe walking
distance from destinations no further than 400 feet from the entrance to a
commercial building.
         (b)   Each individual parking lot area will measure no larger than 400
by 400 feet.
         (c)   All parking lots will provide pedestrian linkages to the
buildings they serve. In order to channel foot traffic to appropriate entrances
and exits, clearly marked pedestrian sidewalks and pathways are required within
large parking lots accommodating more than 100 vehicles.
         (d)   Parking lot areas must be clearly delineated by the use of
borders around the perimeter.
            1.   Borders may be created by landscape strips, buildings, walls,
or fences.
            2.   When walls and fences are utilized, the landscaped strip may
be reduced to five feet.
            3.   Otherwise, landscaped borders shall be ten feet wide.
            4.   Curbing is required within parking lots, unless suitable
substitutes are approved through the design review process.
      (4)   Planter islands at ends of parking rows. Canopy trees shall be
planted between every 12 parking places.
      (5)   Excess parking areas. Excess parking may be provided if it is
composed of porous or semi-porous material and with an approved alternative
parking plan.
   (E)   Internal access roads.
      (1)   A system of interconnecting, predominantly linear streets is
required.
      (2)   All streets must include sidewalks on each right-of-way.
         (a)   The width of the sidewalks shall be determined by the estimated
amount of pedestrian traffic.
         (b)   In most instances, where buildings abut sidewalks, an eight- to
ten-foot width will be necessary.
      (3)   Angled and/or parallel parking shall be provided along streets
where it can be safely accommodated.
      (4)   Street trees shall line every street to contribute to the
definition of the streetscape, and will be selected to create a street canopy
that provides effective shade for pedestrians and vehicles. They will be
planted to provide separation of the sidewalk from the street curb.
      (5)   Buildings must be separated from street sidewalks by narrow,
planted earth islands, landscaped boxes, or other landscaped features.
      (6)   All streets shall have standing curbs.
      (7)   Street furniture, particularly in the form of benches, kiosks,
drinking fountains, and trash receptacles, shall be strategically placed for
the benefit of pedestrians.

§ 156.1036 ACTIVITY ZONE.
   (A)   Description. The activity zone is a quasi-public space that may be
used for pedestrian circulation, placement of required canopy trees, planters,
benches, trash receptacles, and other street furnishings, in addition to the
uses described herein.
   (B)   Location. Because the activity zone is specifically defined as the
area between the street right-of-way line and build-to line, this means that an
activity zone is not allowed where a setback is required.
      (1)   On Coleman and Ben Sawyer Boulevards, activity zones are expressly
prohibited where a setback is required, as specified in
Table 156.254-1: Coleman Boulevard Development Standards.
      (2)   On Johnnie Dodds Boulevard, activity zones are expressly prohibited
on the following neighborhood streets: Lansing Drive, Tall Pine Road, Dragoon
Drive, Pine Hollow Road, Cottingham Drive, Williamson Drive, and the western
side of Bowman Road between Johnnie Dodds Boulevard and Mathis Ferry Road.
      (3)   On Chuck Dawley Boulevard, activity zones are allowed only on Chuck
Dawley Boulevard. Activity zones are expressly prohibited on all side streets.
   (C)   Permitted uses. All uses in the activity zone shall be conducted
outside of the street right-of-way. Design review approval is required prior to
establishing any use and/or installing any street furnishings within the
activity zone. Allowed uses are limited to the following:
      (1)   Streetside dining;
      (2)   Outdoor merchandise display, which must be related to the business
in front of which it is located;

canopy tree placement and as defined for streetside dining.
         (b)   Awnings must be at least five feet in depth, measured
horizontally from face of building.
         (c)   Awnings shall be a maximum of eight feet in height, measured
from the bottom of an awning and/or valence to the sidewalk adjacent to
building. This measurement may be adjusted for grand, multi-story windows.
         (d)   Balconies may project over the activity zone, but in no instance
shall they extend over the right-of-way.
         (e)   Support structures for awnings and balconies are prohibited in
the activity zone.
      (2)   Raised planters. In order to enhance the pedestrian-oriented theme
of development, planters are required as a design element to soften the
building exterior and enhance the streetscape.
      (3)   Street furniture. Street furniture shall be utilized to enhance and
facilitate the pedestrian experience and shall not be utilized as additional
signage.
      (4)   Pedestrian access to remain unimpeded. In all cases, permanent or
temporary design features or activities shall not impede pedestrian access on
the public sidewalk.

Additional low shrub or groundcover plantings, including grass, may be required
between the Sabal palmettos in the verge.
   (C)   Parking lot islands. Parking lot islands, which must include four-inch
caliper or larger canopy trees of a species approved during the design review
process, must be provided at a minimum of every 12 spaces when adjacent to rear
or side property lines. Internal parking lot islands either shall be provided
at a minimum of every 12 spaces or only at the end of parking rows.
   (D)   Sidewalks and landscaping.
      (1)   There shall be a public sidewalk, either within the right-of-way or
within a pedestrian easement on private property, on both sides of all streets.
The sidewalk shall be at least five feet wide on side streets and internal
access roads and at least eight feet wide on boulevard streets.
      (2)   On boulevard streets, sidewalks shall typically be separated from
traffic by a grassed verge, which shall be at least three feet wide, measured
from the back of curb, and planted with palmettos at approximately 30 feet on
center. However, where on-street parking is utilized, the palmettos may be
planted in openings of three feet by three feet, with eight-foot-wide sidewalks
serving the parallel parking areas. See Figures 156.1038-1, 156.1038-2, and
156.1038-3.

      (1)   On Coleman Boulevard between its intersection with Lansing Drive
and its intersection with Chuck Dawley Boulevard, the minimum building frontage
on properties of less than 100 feet is 100% of its frontage, except for
adequate allowance for one curb cut. The total required building frontage may
be accomplished through a phased development plan.
      (2)   For properties with more than 100 feet of frontage on the
boulevards, a minimum of 70% building frontage is required. The total required
building frontage may be accomplished through a phased development plan.
      (3)   Pocket parks, plazas, and other civic open spaces that are
integrated into the overall design of a project count for up to 20% of the
required building frontage.

§ 156.1039 JOHNNIE DODDS BOULEVARD STANDARDS.
   (A)   Bufferyards.
      (1)   Scenic Highway Buffer (Mathis Ferry Road). See §
156.607.
      (2)   Right-of-way bufferyard. Three canopy trees of a minimum-four-inch
caliper are required for each 100 linear feet of street frontage, using species
such as southern red oak, live oak, willow oak, elm varieties, and American
beech. These trees must be consistent along each block and evenly spaced, with
exceptions made for curb cuts, utilities, and other obstructions.
      (3)   Perimeter bufferyards.
         (a)   In general, perimeter bufferyard requirements on individual lots
are specified in Subchapter D, Part 2. However, contingent upon approval
through the design review process, development utilizing an integrated site
plan involving multiple parcels may forgo perimeter bufferyards along lot
lines, except when commercial uses abut residential uses lying outside the VSP-
OD. In the latter case, a minimum ten-foot, Type C bufferyard, with an F3
fence, is required in all instances. This buffer may overlap with the required
side and/or rear yard setback.
         (b)   Perimeter bufferyards are not required where common wall
construction to adjacent properties spanning property lines is utilized in
accordance with applicable Building and Fire Code requirements.
   (B)   Pedestrian trails.
      (1)   A key component of the VSP-OD in the Johnnie Dodds Boulevard area
is the provision of an integrated pedestrian and bicycle access plan through
sidewalks and trails. This system is graphically depicted in Figure 156.1039-1:
Pedestrian Trails.
      (2)   Dedication of easements and construction for sidewalks and
pedestrian trails on development parcels may be required in the approval
process to implement this pedestrian and bicycle access system.
      (3)   In addition to the pedestrian trail system, Figure 156.1039-1:
Pedestrian Trails illustrates areas suitable for open space and parks.

§ 156.1040 CHUCK DAWLEY BOULEVARD STANDARDS.
   (A)   Right-of-way bufferyards. Three canopy trees of a minimum four-inch
caliper are required for each 100 linear feet of street frontage, using species
such as southern red oak, live oak, willow oak, elm varieties, and American
beech. These trees must be consistent along each block and evenly spaced, with
exceptions made for curb cuts, utilities, and other obstructions.
   (B)   Perimeter bufferyards.
      (1)   In general, perimeter bufferyard requirements on individual lots
are specified in
Subchapter D, Part 2. However, contingent upon approval through the design
review process, developme nt utilizing an integrated site plan involving
multiple parcels may forgo perimeter bufferyard s along lot lines, except when
commercia l uses abut residential uses lying outside the VSP-OD. In the latter
case, a minimum ten-foot, Type C bufferyard, with an F3 fence, is required in
all instances. This buffer may overlap with the required side and/or rear yard
setback.
      (2)   Perimeter bufferyards are not required where common wall
construction to adjacent properties spanning property lines is utilized in
accordance with applicable Building and Fire Code requirements.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1041 SUPPLEMENTAL BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Primary façade and entry orientation.
      (1)   Primary entry. For buildings with frontage on the boulevards or
frontage roads, the primary entry must be from Coleman Boulevard, Ben Sawyer
Boulevard, Johnnie Dodds Boulevard frontage road, or Chuck Dawley Boulevard.
Rear of buildings shall not be designed to appear as fronts. Display windows
are required on all street facades for retail buildings. Other commercial or
office buildings shall adhere to the requirements of §
156.899(D)(4). Second floor and above, with a separate entrance from the first
floor, shall have primary entrance from the primary street, when feasible.
Buildings, businesses, and residences facing side streets should have entrances
from the side street.
      (2)   Secondary entry. Secondary entrances from the rear of a store may
be allowed; however, this area may not be treated as a storefront in detailing
or pedestrian amenities.
   (B)   Elevated buildings. In order to project a pedestrian-friendly
streetscape, it is highly recommended that alternatives to elevating commercial
buildings located in "A" flood zones be pursued. This may be accomplished by
flood proofing or altering the elevation of the finished floor inside the
building. However, in the event that these techniques are not feasible and the
building must be elevated, such elevation may not exceed the minimum elevation
required plus one foot of additional freeboard; provided further, that this
provision does not apply to a parking garage located in a flood zone.
   (C)   False second floors. False second floors are not allowed for buildings
in which multiple stories are required. However, a mezzanine comprising one-
third of the area of the floor below, or an atrium located between the floor
and ceiling equivalent to two-story spaces, may be utilized to fulfill this
requirement.
   (D)   Parking lot areas and facilities.
      (1)   Parking lot requirements for multi-family, mixed use, and non-
residential uses.
         (a)   Ground level parking in buildings and parking structures is
permitted, if the street level frontage of the building complies with the
requirements outlined in this subsection.
         (b)   In no case shall ground level parking lots occupy more than one-
third of a lot’s frontage along a pedestrian street or street segment;
excluding primary and secondary entries.
         (c)   Parking and exterior loading areas shall be buffered from any
adjacent pedestrian way by planting canopy trees and providing a landscaped
area with a continuous row of high shrubs, or a fence or seating wall, subject
to the design review process.
         (d)   On private property, pervious materials, other than loose rock
or gravel, may be utilized for required parking spaces and parking drive
aisles, subject to the design review process.
      (2)   Parking structures. When possible, parking structures (garages)
shall be placed in the center of the block and may utilize ground floor
parking. See Figure 156.1041-1: Parking Structure Location.

IMAGES/0-0-0-13131.png]
   ( E)    Access and connectivity.
      (1 )   R esident ial uses, including detached single-family dwellings,
duplex dwellings, and townhouse dwellings.
         (a)   Units on the second floor and above must have a direct access to
the street. This access may be created through the use of a single or multiple
lobby(ies) that access the street level.
         (b)   Where duplex or townhouse dwellings may be approved along any
boulevard streets, requirements for sidewalks and street tree plantings shall
be in accordance with the specifications of the respective sub-area.
         (c)   Parking in structures not located mid-block shall be above the
ground floor or behind the storefront or residential uses, if located on the
ground floor as described below.
            1.   If located to the side of a building, the parking structure
must be set back from the front of that building and have an architectural
façade.
            2.    Slopi ng floor s shall not be visible from primary streets.
            3.   Retail storefronts, residences, or other business uses on
street level shall be required on street frontages of parking structures to
provide vitality.
            4.   Vehicular access shall be from side streets or alleys wherever
possible, and not directly from the primary street.
      (2)   Incentive for parking structures. There shall be no maximum parking
requirements for commercial uses if a parking structure is utilized on site.
      (3)   Parking for outdoor dining. Parking for outdoor dining shall be
determined by the minimum number of off-street parking spaces required for
restaurant use in
Subchapter F, Part 2 and not based upon square footage of outdoor use area.
   (F)   Vehicular access.
      (1)   Access points to the boulevards shall look like streets, with
identifiable features including pavement markings, sidewalks and crosswalks,
planting strips, and canopy trees, distinguishable from parking lot entrances,
as illustrated in the figures below.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/6694e965e9dfdd7b2e635f55b75a6af65807bdd7/
IMAGES/0-0-0-13133.png]
 
      (2)   Shared vehicular access is encouraged; the benefit is more frontage
and more developable land on parcels.
      (3)   Residential uses, including detached single-family dwellings,
duplex dwellings, and townhouse dwellings. In cases where single-family lots
are subdivided with access to an existing public street, access for parking
must be located to the rear of the lots (alley-fed). Driveways for individual
dwelling units may not be located on existing public streets.
   (G)   Drive-through uses.
      (1)   Because driving culture is not compatible with the walkability
goals of the Village Scale Pedestrian area, drive-through facilities are
generally discouraged, and may need to be located internal to sites, behind
other road-front buildings that meet the goals of the standards.
      (2)   Drive-through lanes are prohibited within the activity zone.
      (3)   Drive-through lanes shall not present impediments to the smooth and
orderly flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic to or within the site.

SUBPART 4.4: SHEM CREEK WATERFRONT  SPECIAL DESIGN SUBAREA
§ 156.1055 APPLICABILITY.
   In addition to the requirements of the town’s commercial design standards
described in
Subchapter H, Part 2 and Part 3, the design standards in this subpart apply for
all development within the Shem Creek Waterfront Districts.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1056 SUPPLEMENTAL BUILDING DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   Buildings shall front on Shem Creek;
      (2)   Avoid monolithic massing and create visual variety;
      (3)   Provide variation in cornice and/or eave height along Shem Creek;
      (4)   Vary building elevation, using step-backs or other changes in
building massing to limit continuous repetitive facades; and
      (5)   Vary building height, roof slope, and roof details.
   (B)   Building edge and massing.
      (1)   The building edge must be maintained for at least 75% of any
frontage on Shem Creek; and
      (2)   Continuous repetitive facades must be limited to 50 feet along
building fronts.
   (C)   View plane.
      (1)   A view plane for Shem Creek or marsh frontages shall be defined,
beyond which no building element shall penetrate, determined by maximum
allowable façade height at the minimum building setback line, starting at a
height of 25 feet along this line, at an angle of 30 degrees upward from the
horizontal.
      (2)   Building façades shall be no closer to Shem Creek than the minimum
setback defined below in this section and no further than 15 feet beyond the
resulting minimum building setback.
   (D)   Rooflines.
      (1)   Roofs must maintain a sloped or gabled design.
      (2)   However, a flat roof may be provided at the center of a structure
solely for the purpose of housing required mechanical equipment and associated
services areas not accessible by the public.
      (3)   Roofing materials shall be metal standing seam, terne metal,
corrugated or 5-V crimp metal.
   (E)   Materials.
      (1)   Primary building materials. Primary building materials shall be
wood. For the purposes of this division, wood shall refer to wood, cementitious
siding, and other synthetic materials meant to facilitate the appearance of
wood siding as described herein.
      (2)   Secondary building materials. Secondary building materials shall be
wood except as provided below:
         (a)   Limited use of 5-V crimp, corrugated, standing seam terne metal,
or standing seam copper architectural metal cladding, may be incorporated into
the overall building composition when used as an architectural accent and when
found to meet the intent of this section. Such architectural cladding will
exhibit features, such as quality architectural materials, a natural finish,
and concealed fasteners.
         (b)   Metal cladding shall not constitute more than 50% of any façade.
   (F)   Elevated buildings.
      (1)   Buildings in flood zones.
         (a)   In order to project a pedestrian-friendly streetscape, it is
highly recommended that alternatives to elevating commercial buildings located
in “AE” flood zones be pursued. This may be accomplished by floodproofing or
altering the elevation of the finished floor inside the building. However, in
the event that these techniques are not feasible, and the building must be
elevated, such elevation may not exceed the minimum elevation required by Town
of Mount Pleasant flood damage prevention regulations.
         (b)   All elevated buildings shall utilize traditional building design
elements such as doors and window openings to give the appearance of a
traditional ground floor where those façades are most visible from the public
view to the extent allowed by Town of Mount Pleasant flood damage prevention
ordinances.
         (c)   Where flood damage prevention ordinances prohibit or severely
limit the use of architectural treatments to create the appearance of a ground
floor, landscaping should be used to screen the ground floor area.
      (2)   Open space and parks. Passive parks, plazas or public gathering
spaces should be utilized to facilitate a vibrant, pedestrian-friendly
streetscape between the street and building façade of elevated buildings.
      (3)   Street furniture. Street furniture shall be utilized in passive
parks, plazas, or public gathering spaces between the street and building
façade of elevated buildings to enhance and facilitate the pedestrian
experience.
      (4)   Parking design standards.
         (a)   Stand up curbing will not be required within parking lots;
however concrete wheel stops shall be used to border and define drive aisles,
where determined necessary. Alternative curbing substitutes shall be reviewed
through the design review process.
         (b)   Diamond-shaped planter islands (minimum 36-inch width), which
must include Sabal palms or single-stem Crape myrtles, shall be placed every 36
feet within a row of parking, both internally and when adjacent to rear and
side property lines. The planter will be placed in the center of the
intersection of four parking spaces. The equidistant placement of this planter
will provide vegetation in the parking area, without detracting from parking
counts. See Figure 156.1056-1: Diamond-Shaped Planter Island.

IMAGES/0-0-0-13135.png]
         ( c)   Planter islands are not required to terminate parking rows.
         ( d)   Gravel parking is permitted as a suitable material. However,
accessible parking stalls must meet IBC standards in which gravel is not
permitted.
      (5)    Buffer and landscaping vegetation requirements.
         ( a)   Natural habitats. As the Shem Creek area is a noted habitat
containing wetlands and estuaries housing migratory birds, required landscaping
shall be native or bird-friendly species, with an intention to create or
augment habitat areas.
         (b)   Perimeter buffers only. In the interest of meeting the
district's intent of both pedestrian interconnectivity and accommodation of
parking, internal buffers will not be required between neighboring properties
within the districts, except for the following conditions.
            1.   A five-foot A-type bufferyard (two canopy trees, three
understory, five shrubs per 100 feet linear) with native or bird-friendly
vegetation shall be required around the outer perimeter of each district and
along the following district streets: Coleman Blvd., Mill St., and Haddrell.
            2.   If a conflict in application of requirements exists, the
district's specific buffer requirements shall apply first; Planned Development
district zoning specific requirements second; and requirements of Subchapter D
third.
      (6)   Site furnishings and miscellaneous.
         (a)   Bike racks will be required to be installed at each commercial
establishment in conjunction with any site or building additions, renovations,
or remodels.
         (b)   Mobile raised planters are encouraged to help define outdoor
activity space within the perimeter of a property. Planters are not permitted
to obstruct pedestrian interconnectivity or prohibit interaction with the
public realm as approved through the design review process.
   (G)   Parking. The applicant must propose a parking design plan for
consideration as part of the design review process.
      (1)   No more than 10% of surface parking areas shall be covered by
impervious surfaces, as defined in Subchapter N.
      (2)   For the uses listed below, the following requirements apply:
         (a)   Restaurant: 1.25 parking spaces per 100 square feet.
         (b)   Lodging: one parking space per room
         (c)   Office: one parking space per 200 square feet.

      (1)   The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the initial
zoning associated with an annexation petition. Since the initial zoning is

recommendation on the annexation petition.
   (B)   Town Council decision.
      (1)   Following the Planning Commission’s public hearing, Town Council
shall approve or disapprove the annexation petition. If Council approves the
annexation petition, the initial zoning automatically applies as provided in §
156.1112(B)(1) and (B)(2) unless the applicant has submitted an initial zoning
application as allowed by §
156.1112(B)(3).
         (a)   If Town Council feels the circumstances of the case warrant a
second public hearing, then it may vote to hold one.

remand the matter back to its Planning and Development Committee or Planning
Commission for further study and recommendation.
      (2)   Town Council may amend the Zoning Map to provide for initial zoning

Pleasant Code of Ordinances.
      (3)   After a period of six months, if readings of the annexation
petition and initial zoning are not finalized, the petition becomes null and
void, rescinding any Town Council action on the request. Resubmission of the
petition shall be processed as a new application with prescribed fees and all
other requirements met.
   (C)   Postponement requests and application withdrawals.
      (1)   Withdrawal of an annexation petition and initial zoning prior to
the advertisement for its initial public hearing or posting of the property is
considered as a termination of the petition. Resubmission of the petition shall
be processed as a new application with prescribed fees and all other
requirements met.
      (2)   A postponement request or withdrawal of an annexation petition and
initial zoning that occurs between the time of published advertisement of the
public hearing or posting of the property and the public hearing proceedings
shall be treated as a request denial. Reapplication is subject to a one-year
waiting period, unless granted a waiver by Council, as specified in §
156.1343.
      (3)   In either case, amendment processing shall terminate upon receipt
of written notice from the applicant or owner.

area surrounded by the municipality; and
   (G)   Any other factors Town Council deems appropriate.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1117 SCOPE OF APPROVAL.

effective immediately upon final reading by Town Council and the lot(s) is
subject to all laws and regulations of the Town of Mount Pleasant.
   (B)   Approval of an annexation petition and initial zoning does not
authorize development. Any development that occurs after annexation requires
additional approval, which may include site plan or subdivision plat approval,
if applicable, and building permits and certificates of occupancy.

§ 156.1118 REAPPLICATION.
   (A)   When Town Council disapproves an annexation petition, the petition may
not be initiated on the same parcel or any part thereof for a period of 12
months, irrespective of change(s) in ownership;
      (1)   However, after receipt of written petition by the property owner(s)
or other body authorized to submit an annexation petition stating how

   Some land uses, buildings, or structures are not appropriate under all
circumstances in a given zoning district but may be appropriate if adequate
precautions are taken to assure compatibility with surrounding uses, public
need, and the town as a whole. This part allows such uses through a special
exception use permit.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1201 APPLICABILITY.
   This part applies to an application for a special exception use permit. An
applicant shall obtain a special exception use permit before changing a use to
or establishing a new use that is designated as a special exception use for the
zoning district, as shown in §
156.338.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1202 INITIATION.
   (A)   Applicant eligibility. A special exception use permit application may
be initiated by:
      (1)   The property owner or tenant of the property proposed for the use;
or
      (2)   An agent of the property owner or tenant of the property proposed
for the use.
   (B)   Pre-application meeting. A pre-application meeting is required (see §
156.1079).
   (C)   Application requirements.
      (1)   A special exception use permit application is filed with the PLAN
Department on or before the Board of Zoning Appeals application deadline
specified on the annual meeting schedule. Applications may be filed
electronically or in-person.
      (2)   A conceptual site plan with adequate detail of features such as
building layout, setbacks, easements, parking, circulation systems, and buffers
must be submitted in conjunction with the special exception use permit
application. An application filed without an adequate conceptual site plan is
considered incomplete.
   (D)   Effect on other proceedings. A special exception use permit request
that would correct a zoning violation stays all legal proceedings by the town
on the zoning violation, unless the Zoning Administrator certifies to the Board
of Zoning Appeals, after the special exception use permit application has been
filed, that a stay would cause an imminent peril to life and property. In cases
where there is an imminent peril to life and property, proceedings will not be
stayed unless a restraining order is granted by the Board or by a court of
record on application.
   (E)   Consideration for Planning Commission and Town Council procedures. As
a matter of process and procedure, proposed developments involving applications
for special exception uses that also require separate review by the Planning
Commission and/or separate Town Council approval, shall not be considered by
the Board of Zoning Appeals until the referenced review and/or approval is
completed.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1203 COMPLETENESS.
   See §
156.1080.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1204 NOTICE.
   (A)   The notice specified in Table 156.1204-1 is required for a special
exception use permit application.
   (B)   If the Board remands a special exception use permit request to the
Zoning Administrator for further review, the Board may set a hearing without
further public notice for a time certain within 60 days unless otherwise agreed
to by the parties. The Board must maintain a list of persons who express an
interest in being informed when the remanded matter is set for rehearing, and
notice of the rehearing must be mailed to these persons before the rehearing.

(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1206 REVIEW CRITERIA.
   (A)   In considering an application for a special exception use permit, the
Board shall:
      (1)   Apply the standards for the proposed special exception use as set
out in
Subchapter C, Part 3, Subpart 3.3; and
      (2)   Use the following general criteria for judging the compatibility of
the proposal with the surrounding area:
         (a)   Adequate provision is made for such items as setbacks, fences,
and buffer or planting strips to protect adjacent properties from the possible
adverse influence of the proposed use, such as noise, vibration, dust, glare,
odor, traffic congestion, and similar factors;
         (b)   Vehicular traffic and pedestrian movement on adjacent roads is
not hindered or endangered;
         (c)   Off-street parking and loading areas and the entrance(s) and
exit(s) of these areas are adequate in terms of location, amount, design, and
construction to serve the proposed use; and
         (d)   The proposed use is compatible with existing uses to the extent
that such use will not adversely affect the level of property values, general
character, or general welfare of the nearby area.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1207 SCOPE OF APPROVAL.
   (A)   Generally. An approved special exception use permit application does
not authorize construction or development. All special exception uses also
require zoning permit approval, following approval by the Board of Zoning
Appeals and prior to the establishment of the use.
   (B)   Approval based on submitted plans.
      (1)   Unless specifically modified by the Board's approval, the special
exception use must be established in accordance with the specific plans
submitted with the application.
      (2)   Minor changes to the approved plans that do not affect the approval
granted may be allowed in order to meet other code requirements, if approved by
the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Routine repairs and maintenance may be made to a structure
constructed pursuant to special exception use permit approval as required to
preserve it in sound condition. Any proposed changes to the structure shall be
presented to the Board Secretary for a determination as to whether a new
application is required.
   (C)   Vested rights.
      (1)   In order to complete additional applications and receive the
necessary permits for construction, special exception use permits are vested
for a period of two years, subject to the rights and restrictions contained
within this title.
      (2)   Failure to receive the necessary permits within the prescribed
timeframe renders the special exception use permit approval void and of no
force or effect.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1208 REAPPLICATION.
   (A)   For a period of 12 months, the Board shall not accept a special
exception use permit application for a matter upon which it has rendered a
final decision, except as provided in the Board’s rules of procedure.
   (B)   Prior to the lapse of the 12-month timeframe and upon a majority vote
ascertaining changed facts or circumstances, the Board may accept such a
special exception permit application for consideration.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1209 APPEALS.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   A person who may have a substantial interest in any decision of the
Board of Zoning Appeals, or an officer or agent of the Town of Mount Pleasant,
may appeal from a decision of the Board to the Circuit Court of Charleston
County, by filing with the Clerk of Court a petition, in writing, setting forth
plainly, fully, and distinctly why the decision is contrary to law. The appeal
must be filed within 30 days after the decision of the Board is mailed.
      (2)   A property owner whose land is the subject of a decision of the
Board of Zoning Appeals may appeal either:
         (a)   As provided in this division (A); or
         (b)   By filing a notice of appeal with the Circuit Court, accompanied
by a request for pre-litigation mediation in accordance with S.C. Code § 6-29-
825. Any notice of appeal and request for pre-litigation mediation must be
filed within 30 days after the decision of the Board is postmarked.
   (B)   Notice of appeal and transcript. Upon the filing of the appeal, the
Clerk of the Circuit Court shall give immediate notice of it to the Secretary
of the Board and, within 30 days from the time of the notice, the Board shall
file with the Clerk a certified copy of the proceedings held before the Board
of Zoning Appeals, including a transcript of the evidence heard before it, if
any, and the decision of the Board, including its findings of fact and
conclusions.
   (C)   Supersedeas. The filing of an appeal in the Circuit Court from a
decision of the Board shall not ipso facto act as a supersedeas, but the judge
of the Circuit Court may, at their discretion, grant a supersedeas upon such
terms and conditions as may seem reasonable and proper.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1210 RECORDKEEPING.
   (A)   The Board will keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or if absent or failing to vote, indicating the
fact.
   (B)   The Board will issue a written decision to all parties involved in the
matter.
   (C)   All final decisions and orders of the Board must be in writing and
permanently filed in the PLAN Department office as a public record. All
findings of fact and conclusions of law must be separately stated in final
decisions or orders of the Board, which must be delivered to parties of
interest by certified mail.

§§ 156.1211 THROUGH 156.1214 RESERVED.
PART 10: IMPACT ASSESSMENTS
§ 156.1215 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of an impact assessment is to provide a basis for assessing a
proposed major development project's favorable or unfavorable impact on the
town's overall environment and infrastructure, with an emphasis on
transportation, drainage, and service provision.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1216 APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   Minimum thresholds. Impact assessments are required for new
development and redevelopment that meet the following minimum thresholds:
      (1)   New development of land.
         (a)   An impact assessment is required when one or more of the
following conditions are met:
            1.   The proposed development is comprised of residential uses that
are projected to generate more than 75 peak hour vehicle trips; or
            2.   The proposed development is comprised of 40,000 square feet or
more of non-residential area, and is projected to generate more than more than
75 peak hour vehicle trips; or
            3.   The proposed development is comprised of a combination of
residential and non-residential uses such that the residential component only
is projected to generate more than 75 peak hour vehicle trips, and the non-
residential component consists of 40,000 square feet or more of area.
         (b)   Projected peak hour vehicle trips are determined by the Zoning
Administrator in consultation with the Director of Engineering and Development
Services.
         (c)   Calculations of total square footage of open venues for
entertainment, recreation, and civic uses, such as playing fields,
amphitheaters, or concert lawns, shall include the open area square footage.
      (2)   Redevelopment of improved property. An impact assessment is
required for redevelopment projects when the net increase in both peak hour
vehicle trips and building square footage meets the threshold requirements
specified in division (A)(1)(a) above. The impacts assessed shall be predicated
only upon the net increase of peak hour vehicle trips and building square
footage.
   (B)   Project phasing.
      (1)   The subdivision of a project into development phases, or any
staging proposals (irrespective of ownership), or subdivision of a larger
parcel into smaller parcels for sale or development, does not void the
requirement of an impact assessment for the overall project.
      (2)   In phased development projects, additional impact assessments may
be required, if the proposed development phase meets any of the minimum
threshold requirements.
      (3)   The determination of whether additional impact assessments are
required is made by the Zoning Administrator at the time of the developer's
additional plan approval request.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1217 INITIATION.
   (A)   Pre-application meeting. An applicant initiates the Impact Assessment
procedure by attending a pre-application meeting with staff from the PLAN
Department and the Department of Engineering and Development Services.
      (1)   During the pre-application meeting, the developer must identify the
type of development and size; access requirements; land use types and
densities; project phasing; and the anticipated build-out year for the proposed
development. The developer shall also present any available construction plans,
concept drawings, or figures of the proposed development.
      (2)   The developer shall also request any needed clarifications of the
remaining process. Town staff shall provide guidance concerning the
transportation impact assessment process (see §
156.1218(F)) and assist in identifying any additional information that is
required.
      (3)   It is not necessary for the applicant to complete the
transportation impact assessment data form (see §
156.1218(F)(3)) prior to the pre-application meeting, but having the requested
information readily available will make the meeting more productive.
   (B)   Transportation impact assessment process. The transportation impact
assessment process is initiated in accordance with §
156.1218(F)(2), which requires a pre-application meeting as specified in
division (A) above.
   (C)   Transportation impact assessment data form. Following the pre-
application meeting, the applicant must submit a complete transportation impact
assessment data form (see §
156.1218(F)(3)) at least eight weeks prior to the Planning Commission meeting
at which the impact assessment is anticipated to be considered.
   (D)   Preliminary staff review. Submittal of an impact assessment for
preliminary staff review (see §
156.1081) is required. Impact assessments submitted for preliminary staff
review are not required to include a complete traffic study, but traffic
summaries and anticipated mitigation should be provided for review.
   (E)   Impact assessment application submittal. Once the applicant has
completed the preliminary impact assessment review, they may submit a complete
impact assessment application for consideration by the Planning Commission and
Town Council. The application must be submitted on or before the Planning
Commission application deadline specified on the annual meeting schedule.
   (F)   Zoning requests.
      (1)   Requests for zoning of property proposed for annexation or rezoning
requests for property located within the municipal limits and for which no
specific development plan is contemplated do not require submittal for impact
assessment approval in conjunction with the zoning/rezoning request.
      (2)   However, if a specific development plan is contemplated that will
require impact assessment approval, the impact assessment may be submitted in
conjunction with the zoning/rezoning request.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1218 SUBMITTAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Generally. The impact assessment shall be prepared by qualified
professionals pursuant to checklist forms devised and provided by the
Department of Planning, Land Use, and Neighborhoods, and shall include, but is
not limited to, the information specified in this section.
   (B)   Conceptual plan. The impact assessment shall be submitted with a
conceptual plan, the requirements of which are compiled in a checklist by the
Department of Planning, Land Use, and Neighborhoods, and may be subject to
alteration from time to time, as deemed necessary.
   (C)   General description of proposed major development project. Provide a
general written description of the proposed major development project. Include
in this description the proposed phases of development or operation and
facility utilization, target dates for each of these, and date of completion.
In addition:
      (1)   Indicate the site size, development staging, and appropriate
descriptive measures of the proposed project;
      (2)   Describe the relationship of the proposed development to the town
Comprehensive Plan's objectives and policies;
      (3)   Indicate the relationship to existing or proposed plans for public
facilities, such as parks and recreation, schools, transportation, wastewater
treatment, and the like; and
      (4)   Describe the relationship of the proposed project to any of the
town's special area management plans.
   (D)   Specific impacts on public facilities – water supply, and wastewater
management. Identify projected average daily potable water demands at the end
of each development phase. Specify any consumption rates that have been assumed
for the project. Provide a description of the volume and characteristics of
effluents.
   (E)   Specific impacts on public facilities – drainage. Provide the
following minimum requirements to adequately determine the impacts from changes
to the stormwater characteristics of the land:
      (1)   Current drainage pattern of the property, which shall include
topographic information represented with one-foot contours;
      (2)   Sub-watershed map identifying significant drainage features within
the nearest receiving waterbody drainage basin;
      (3)   When repetitive flood losses have been documented on FEMA reporting
forms within the sub-watershed basin, provide a hydrology analysis that
demonstrates no change in conditions upstream or downstream from the proposed
development;
      (4)   Water quality plan describing how the impairment will be addressed
during and after construction, when the receiving waterbody contains a total
maximum daily loading (TMDL) restriction, or when an impaired monitoring
station that is identified on the South Carolina Department of Environmental
Services Bureau of Water 303d list.
   (F)   Specific impacts on public facilities – transportation. The following
procedures shall be used to identify traffic impacts and mitigation strategies
associated with the proposed development project and may be referred to as the
“transportation impact assessment process.”
      (1)   Purpose.
         (a)   The purpose of this division (F) is to establish a process
allowing town staff and officials to better understand the relationship between
new development and the existing and proposed transportation infrastructure.
         (b)   It will provide a highly detailed analytical tool for the
identification of transportation deficiencies and corresponding mitigation
strategies addressing the impacts related to new development.
         (c)   The described analysis and resulting mitigation strategies are
predicated upon an accepted operational Level of Service D for suburban
population areas, as recommended in the town's adopted Transportation Plan as
included in the current Comprehensive Plan. It is not intended to provide
justification for the denial of individual development projects, per se, based
solely upon the inability to provide an operational Level of Service D to all
roadway segments identified as the transportation influence area described
herein.
      (2)   Transportation impact assessment process initiation. To engage in
the formal transportation impact assessment review process, the developer must
obtain a transportation impact assessment application package from the
Department of Engineering and Development Services, schedule a pre-application
meeting (see §
156.1217), and ultimately complete the application. The package will contain a
description of the review process, a checklist of required information, and a
transportation impact assessment data form.
      (3)   Transportation impact assessment data form.
         (a)   Once the pre-application meeting (see §
156.1217) is complete, the developer must submit a complete transportation
impact assessment data form to town staff. The purpose of the transportation
impact assessment data form is to provide town staff with sufficient
information regarding the proposed development to determine whether an impact
assessment is required, and what the general impact of the development may be
on the transportation system. The impact assessment data form will include, at
a minimum, the following information:
            1.   Name, address, and phone number of the owner, agent, and
developer of the property;
            2.   Name, address, and phone number of the qualified
transportation professional conducting the transportation impact assessment;
            3.   Name of the proposed development;
            4.   The location of the development (including a location map
clearly showing the roadways adjacent to the proposed project);
            5.   A description of the proposed project, including a site plan,
total developed area, types of land uses, and land use densities (i.e., gross
square footage of building space, dwelling units, employees);
            6.   A brief narrative describing the project, including phasing of
the project, anticipated build-out year, and access requirements; and
            7.   Trip generation characteristics.
         (b)   The layout and content of the form may be periodically modified
to ensure that town staff is requesting and obtaining the data necessary for
preliminary impact assessment review.
         (c)   Town staff shall determine whether the transportation impact
assessment data form is complete and notify the applicant appropriately. Only
proposed developments that have submitted complete transportation impact
assessment data forms at least eight weeks prior to the anticipated Planning
Commission meeting will be carried forward in the current batch of projects.
      (4)   Preliminary transportation impact assessment review.
         (a)   Review process.
            1.   For those projects carried forward in the process, town staff
shall conduct a preliminary review of the proposed development and provide the
applicant with the results.
            2.   Applicants will not only receive the preliminary review
results from their own proposal, but also those for other proposals currently
under review.
            3.   This will enable applicants to address the impacts of other
proposals currently under review in their transportation impact assessment
reports.
         (b)   Travel demand models and capacity spreadsheets. Town staff shall
use travel demand models and capacity spreadsheets in conducting the
preliminary impact reviews, using the travel demand modeling computer program
known as “QRS.”
         (c)   Travel demand modeling process.
            1.   Using QRS travel demand models, town staff shall estimate
traffic volume changes on the surrounding road network resulting from each
proposed development. The surrounding roadway network is comprised of the major
transportation facilities, as identified in the adopted Transportation Plan,
and consists of 76 separate roadway segments.
            2.   Using the land use densities (i.e., dwelling units, square
footage, employment data) and/or estimated vehicle trips included with the
transportation impact assessment data form, town staff shall modify the travel
demand model to include the proposed development.
            3.   Staff shall have QRS estimate the number of trips based on
socioeconomic data or, if data is provided on the transportation impact
assessment data form, define the proposed development as a point generator and
enter the total number of trips originating from that point.
            4.   Based on the location of the proposed development, staff shall
modify the data for the appropriate Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) within the
model. The model can then estimate the number of trips and distribute/assign
the trips onto the surrounding road network.
            5.   Once staff has modified and run the travel demand models,
modeled volumes will be imported into a capacity analysis spreadsheet. The
capacity spreadsheets indicate the maximum capacity of roadway segments and
track the consumption of capacity by existing volumes and volumes attributable
to approved or proposed developments. Maximum capacities shall be calculated
using Highway Capacity Manual methodology.
            6.   Volumes used for capacity evaluation are calculated by
applying modeled growth percentages to existing counts. Modeled volumes for the
most recent year for which counts are available shall serve as the base values
for estimating modeled growth percentages.
            7.   To assess the impacts of proposed development on the road
network, it is necessary to compare modeled volumes to those estimated for
developments that have been approved but not yet constructed. Growth
percentages shall be calculated for two conditions, approved projects and
proposed projects. (Proposed developments that are pending approval by the
Planning Commission or Town Council will be considered as approved for reviews
of the group of projects undergoing preliminary impact assessment reviews.)
            8.   The percent growth in modeled volumes shall then be applied to
existing traffic counts and converted to p.m. peak hour volumes, using existing
peak hour factors and directional splits. These volumes will then be compared
to existing roadway capacities in order to identify any potential roadway
deficiencies resulting from the proposed development.
            9.   After reviewing the results of the capacity analysis
spreadsheets, town staff will define the minimum area of influence to be used
in conducting a detailed traffic impact study for the proposed development. The
minimum area of influence shall be defined by identifying all road segments
with volumes attributable to the development exceeding 2% of the road segment's
available LOS D capacity.
            10.   Staff will notify the developer as to the limits of the
traffic impact study area, and any other analysis requirements to be included
in the traffic impact study prepared by the developer. An example of other
analysis requirements could include a.m. peak period analysis in the vicinity
of a school site to address operational and safety concerns, such as signal
provision/coordination or turn lane additions.
      (5)   Traffic impact study.
         (a)   Study area/minimum requirements.
            1.   The traffic impact study area shall be comprised of all areas
with adverse links. ADVERSE LINKS are defined as roadway segments in which the
projected trips added to the existing volume and committed trips (E + C) exceed
the LOS D capacity for that link.
            2.   Based on the limits of the traffic impact study area and any
other requirements specified by town staff, the developer shall conduct a
detailed traffic impact study for the proposed development.
            3.   The methodology and procedures used in the traffic impact
study must be in accordance with accepted engineering practices of the state
and approved by town staff. At a minimum, the traffic impact study must include
a summary of the trips the development will generate, capacity analysis of the
intersections and roadway segments contained within the study area,
identification of any roadway deficiencies caused by the development, and
proposed improvements for mitigating transportation network deficiencies, if
applicable.
         (b)   Application timeframe.
            1.   Once the traffic impact study has been completed, it shall be
submitted, along with other required documentation, to the town as part of the
transportation impact assessment application package.
            2.   The transportation impact assessment application package will
not be accepted earlier than 14 days from the time staff provides reports from
the preliminary impact assessment review.
      (6)   Transportation impact assessment application.
         (a)   The transportation impact assessment application package must
include a completed transportation impact assessment data form, site plan/
construction drawings, a description of land use types and densities, access
requirements, the traffic impact study report, and other information discussed
in the pre-application meeting.
            1.   Application packages will be reviewed in the order they are
received, based on time stamps that will be applied upon confirmation of
receipt of a complete package.
            2.   Town staff shall determine whether the developer has submitted
a complete application package.
            3.   Only proposed developments that meet established deadlines for
completed application packages will be carried forward in the current batch of
projects.
            4.   Projects that meet deadlines for the transportation impact
assessment data form, but fail to meet application package deadlines, shall
begin the impact assessment process from the start.
         (b)   A complete application package will include estimates of the
number of trips generated by the proposed development, including, if
appropriate, the estimated amount of vehicle trips generated by the proposed
development for each phase of the development and at build-out. The estimated
number of vehicle trips must be calculated for total daily and p.m. peak hours,
using the procedures outlined in the ITE Trip Generation Handbook.
            1.   Vehicle trips will be estimated using either ITE trip rates or
formulas contained in the latest edition of the ITE Trip Generation Manual.
            2.   Any other methods used for estimating vehicle trips must be
approved by the Director of Engineering and Development Services prior to
submitting the application package.
         (c)   The application package must include:
            1.   A detailed summary of the proposed land use types and
associated densities, ITE land use codes, and ITE trip rates/formulas;
            2.   A table summarizing the total daily and p.m. peak hour
vehicles trips generated by the proposed development by phase and build-out;
            3.   A distribution of the number of vehicle trips entering and
exiting the development for the p.m. peak hour;
            4.   A table summarizing assumed internal trip capture rates and
pass-by trips, if applicable; and
            5.   A brief narrative describing any assumptions made regarding
the estimation of vehicle trips, distribution, internal capture, and pass-by
trips.
      (7)   Staff review period.
         (a)   While town staff shall estimate the impacts of proposed
developments individually during the preliminary impact assessment review,
recommendations to local officials shall be based on the aggregate effects of
all projects in the current group of projects under review. (For the aggregate
analysis, only projects that have been previously approved by the Planning
Commission are considered “approved.”) Staff recommendations must be developed,
considering the information contained in the completed application packages and
the analysis of the aggregate impacts.
         (b)   Town staff must analyze the current proposed projects as a
group, using QRS models and capacity spreadsheets, according to the following
significance and adversity testing methodology.
            1.   Significance. The significance level is defined by the general
use of 2% of LOS D capacity for a given roadway link. When projected trips on
any given link exceed the 2% threshold, trips on the link are considered
significant. Provided, however, that trips on a link that already exceed the
LOS D capacity shall be exempt from consideration for mitigation, other than
site-specific safety and operational features, such as the provision of turn
lanes and/or signalization improvements.
            2.   Adverse. Adversity on any given roadway link is achieved when
project trips added to the existing volume and committed trips (E+C) exceed LOS
D for that link.
            3.   Mitigation. Mitigation will be considered when project trips
are both significant and adverse with respect to each affected roadway link, as
illustrated in the following scenarios:
               a.   Scenario 1. Project trips do not exceed the 2% threshold,
but with the addition of project trips the link becomes adversely affected.
This represents adversity, but not significance. This will likely happen when a
link is already very close to the LOS D capacity with the E+C trips. Mitigation
is not recommended;
               b.   Scenario 2. Project trips exceed the 2% threshold, but
adding them to the E+C trips does not exceed the LOS D capacity. This
represents significance, but not adversity. Mitigation is not recommended;
               c.   Scenario 3. Project trips exceed the 2% threshold
(significance). The E+C trips do not exceed the LOS D capacity, meaning the
link is currently not adverse with existing plus committed trips. However, when
project trips are added to the E+C trips, the LOS D capacity is exceeded and
the link becomes adverse due to the project trips. Mitigation is recommended;
               d.   Scenario 4. Project trips exceed the 2% threshold
(significance). The E+C trips already exceed the LOS D capacity, meaning the
link is already adverse with existing plus committed trips. Mitigation shall be
limited to site-specific safety and operational features (such as the provision
of turn lanes and/or signalization improvements).
            4.   Other mitigation circumstances. It is important to emphasize
that, since the analysis is predicated upon each link in the roadway network,
it may be that certain links in the area of influence are already deficient
(LOS E or F) and may only require mitigation to remedy site-specific
operational and safety concerns, but at the same time, other links in the area
of influence may become deficient as a direct result of additional project
trips and, therefore, require additional mitigation improvements.
         (c)   Town staff shall review the application and present
recommendations to the Planning Commission. Staff shall review the traffic
impact study and compare it to the results of its own analyses. Based on their
review, staff will determine if any additional analysis is required. If the
town determines that additional analysis is required, the developer may be
requested to revise the application and/or the traffic impact study
accordingly. Once town staff has completed their review, they will evaluate the
need for mitigation projects to address impacts as a result of the development.
      (8)   Mitigation projects.
         (a)   Based on staff's review of the development and recommendations
contained in the traffic impact study, town staff may recommend transportation
improvements necessary to mitigate identified negative impacts.
            1.   If improvements are required, town staff can provide a list of
roadway segments that were identified as being below LOS D due to the proposed
development. The town will enter negotiations with the developer to identify
transportation system improvements that mitigate the impact of the proposed
development on the identified set of roadway segments.
            2.   Site-specific mitigation efforts, such as additional turn
lanes or storage modifications, may also be required, even though the project
may not cause a LOS failure on roadway segments.
         (b)   On individual roadway links where existing volumes currently
exceed the Level of Service D capacity, or on individual roadway links where
existing and committed demand volumes exceed the Level of Service D capacity,
mitigation improvements shall be limited to remedy site-specific safety and
operational concerns.
         (c)   The provision of all or a portion of mitigation improvements
shall be limited to the proportionate share of demand generated by the proposed
development. When mitigation embodies improvements identified in the town's
current Transportation Capital Improvement Plan, an appropriate credit will be
given towards the development project's transportation impact fee.
         (d)   If town staff and the developer agree on a set of improvements,
such agreements will be documented and included in the application package.
            1.   If an agreement cannot be reached regarding what improvements
should be implemented with the development, the developer may request to
present the development proposals to the Planning Commission.
            2.   Town staff will also present their recommendations and
findings to the Planning Commission.
      (9)   Provisions for phasing required improvements. Include a description
of how phased improvements will occur during the development process,
identifying when specific improvements will be accomplished and the entity
responsible for the same.
      (10)   Graphic illustration of process.
         (a)   Figure 156.1218-1 illustrates the Transportation Impact
Assessment approval process.

IMAGES/0-0-0-13145.png]
 
         (b)   The graphic illustrates the anticipated approval timeframe for
the transportation impact assessment process.
            1.   Submittal deadlines for complete transportation impact
assessment data forms and impact assessment applications must be met to keep
the review process on schedule.
            2.   Staff review timeframes are predicated upon best estimates,
but are tentative and may be extended, based upon such factors as project size,
complexity of analysis, and similar factors. The rationale is that the
applicant controls the scope of development, and staff must be allowed
sufficient time to conduct and review analysis and mitigation alternatives.
   (G)   Specific impacts on police, fire, recreation, and public services. The
impact assessment shall:
      (1)   Describe how the proposed project will affect basic town services
in general;
      (2)   To the extent possible, relate service provisions to appropriate
standards (i.e., personnel, service area, facilities, and equipment) and the
relationship to adopted plans (e.g., Recreation Master Plan), if applicable.
Examples include such analysis as police officers per 1,000 population, nearest
fire station, the necessity for additional garbage trucks to serve the
development, and the like; and
      (3)   Indicate the method of solid waste collection, either public or
private, in text, and describe pertinent factors such as aggregated individual
receptacles or common collective receptacles. Graphically depict location on
Conceptual Plan and address applicable access requirements.
   (H)   Specific impacts on education. Provide an assessment of impact on the
school system, to include projection of school age children in the proposed
development by type of school and attendance zone.
   (I)   Specific impacts on cultural, archeological, and environmental
resources.
      (1)   Describe the impact of the proposed development on relevant
cultural, archeological, and environmental resources, particularly as it
relates to displacement or alteration of the same as a result of drainage
improvements and land disturbance for development.
      (2)   Indicate proposed tree removal on Conceptual Plan.
   (J)   Fiscal/economic considerations.
      (1)   Provide an analysis of the estimated average annual ad valorem tax
yield from the proposed project during each phase of development. Indicate
assumptions and standards utilized, including but not limited to, assessed
value, exemptions, millage rate, and the like.
      (2)   Provide an analysis of the estimated cost for the town to serve the
proposed development. Staff may develop a process and/or calculation method
that applicants must use.
      (3)   Provide totals for other applicable fees, such as impact fees,
permit fees, and plan review fees.
   (K)   Housing. Provide a breakdown of the proposed residential units, by
price or rental range; and the type of unit, such as detached house, duplex,
townhouse, and the like; and assess the potential of the proposed development
to meet local housing needs.
   (L)   Infrastructure. For impact assessments involving new residential
subdivisions that are subject to the preliminary and final plat process, the
application must include a master drainage plan, a master sanitary sewer plan,
and a master potable water distribution plan (see §
155.029)
   (M)   Letters of coordination. Based upon the necessity of addressing
particular concerns of a given project, letters of coordination from various
town departments, agencies, or other entities referenced herein may be required
to adequately assess specific impacts. This determination will be made by PLAN
staff at the pre-application meeting.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)

proceed with any other application required by this chapter,
Chapter 155, or other chapters of the Town Code for the proposed development,
including special exception use permit applications and zoning permit
applications.
   (B)   Development approvals and construction/denial. Development approvals
and construction shall be in accordance with division (C) below, and the
following:
      (1)   Once Town Council approves the impact assessment, the developer
will follow established town development procedures for construction projects,
including obtaining permits.
      (2)   Development approvals may be contingent upon the developer making
certain transportation improvements.
         (a)   In order to obtain a building permit, the developer may post a
financial guarantee suitable to the town, in an amount of one and one half
times the amount of the cost of construction of the improvements.
         (b)   The certificate of occupancy may be withheld until all
contingent transportation improvements are completed.
   (C)   Time limitation.

residential construction shall become null and void if site work predicated
upon an approved preliminary plat has not commenced within the two-year
timeframe, or if the preliminary plat approval authorizing the installation of
improvements becomes void pursuant to division (E) below.
      (3)   Non-residential and multiplex developments. Approval of an impact
assessment for commercial, mixed use, or multiplex development shall become
null and void if a building permit predicated upon an approved site plan has
not been issued within the two-year timeframe. The issuance of a building
permit, in and of itself, shall not be deemed to fulfill the time limitation
requirement, but must be followed by construction progressing in a timely
manner toward project completion.
      (4)   Relationship to valid wetlands disturbance permit. Notwithstanding
the provisions of divisions (C)(2) and (C)(3) above, if a valid wetlands
disturbance permit that has been filed with the proper authorities, pursuant to
and at the approximate same time as impact assessment approval, is pending a
final decision, the time limitation shall be tolled until the final decision
has been rendered.
      (5)   Lapse in construction. If construction improvements lapse for a
consecutive period of six months or more from the initial date of commencement,
the PLAN Director may require an update of the impact assessment. The duration
of a lapse in construction improvements shall be determined by the PLAN
Director.

      (1)   An application consisting entirely of minor work may be reviewed
and approved or disapproved by the HDPC Secretary.
      (2)   A list of work items designated by the HDPC as minor work is
available from the HDPC Secretary. The list may be changed or updated as
necessary by a majority of the HDPC.
      (3)   The HDPC Secretary shall review all minor work applications within
ten business days of receipt of a complete application.

      (1)   The HDPC will review and approve, approve with conditions, or
disapprove a COA application.
      (2)   The COA process may include conceptual, preliminary, and/or final
plan reviews. HDPC approval of the conceptual and/or preliminary plan does not
guarantee approval of the final plan. An approval of the final plan, but not
the conceptual or preliminary plans, results in a vested right.
      (3)   The HDPC will take final action upon a complete and fully
documented COA application within a reasonable amount of time.
      (4)   The HDPC may postpone the issuance of a COA for demolition for 90
days in order to find an alternative to the demolition or to find an entity
willing to save the building or salvage architectural materials.
      (5)   When the HDPC approves a COA application subject to conditions, the
HDPC Secretary shall verify the applicant has met the conditions prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
   (C)   Substantial economic hardship exemption.
      (1)   Circumstances. A property owner may apply for an exemption based on
the substantial hardship of maintaining the property according to the design
guidelines. Substantial hardship shall be considered by the HDPC where one or
more of the following unusual and compelling circumstances exist:
         (a)   The property cannot reasonably be maintained in the manner
dictated by the design guidelines due to economic constraints;
         (b)   There are no other reasonable means of saving the property from
deterioration or collapse; or
         (c)   The property is owned by a nonprofit organization and it is not
feasible, financially or physically, to achieve the charitable purposes of the
organization while appropriately maintaining the property.
      (2)   Evidence. If the property owner wishes to make a claim of
substantial economic hardship (as defined herein) owing to the effects of this
chapter, the property owner must submit evidence describing the circumstances
of hardship. Evidence may include:
         (a)   Nature of ownership (individual, business, or nonprofit) or
legal possession, custody, and control;
         (b)   Financial resources of the owner and/or parties in interest
(such as tax returns for the past two years);
         (c)   Cost of repairs;
         (d)   Assessed value of the land and improvements;
         (e)   Real estate taxes for the past two years;
         (f)   Amount paid for the property, date of purchase, and party from
whom purchased, including a description of the relationship between the owner
and the person from whom the property was purchased, or other means of
acquisition of title, such as by gift or inheritance;
         (g)   Annual debt service, if any, for previous two years;
         (h)   Any listing of the property for sale or rent, price asked, and
offers received, if any;
         (i)   Annual gross income from the property for the previous two years
(if the property is income-producing);
         (j)   Itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two
years, including proof that adequate and competent management procedures were
followed (if the property is income-producing); and
         (k)   Annual cash flow, if any, for the previous two years (if the
property is income-producing).
      (3)   In the event the HDPC finds substantial economic hardship in
meeting the guidelines, the finding shall be accompanied by a recommended plan
to relieve the economic hardship. This plan may include loans or grants from
public, private, or nonprofit sources, acquisition by purchase or eminent
domain, or relaxation of the provisions of this chapter sufficient to mitigate
substantial economic hardship.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1266 REVIEW CRITERIA.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The Historic District Preservation Commission or the HDPC

upon the specific criteria in Subchapter B, Part 4, Subpart 4.3 and the Old
Village Historic District Guidelines.
      (2)   The HDPC, or HDPC Secretary in the case of minor work, shall not
consider:
         (a)   The use of the building;
         (b)   The interior of the building; or
         (c)   Vegetative landscaping, except living fences.
      (3)   The HDPC, or HDPC Secretary in the case of minor work, shall not
impose conditions on an application except to prevent developments that are not
in harmony with the prevailing character of the streetscape or the district in
general, or are obviously incongruous with the character, integrity, or style
of a building or site.
   (B)   Disapproval of a COA application.
      (1)   A COA application shall be disapproved if the demolition or partial
demolition, alterations and/or additions to existing structures, erection of
new structures, alteration of site, or other factors listed within are
considered in violation of the specific criteria in
Subchapter B, Part 4, Subpart 4.3 or the Old Village Historic District
Guidelines, as applicable.
      (2)   Reasons for disapproval of an application shall be clearly listed
in the motion to disapprove the COA. The motion shall cite the exact section(s)
of the ordinance or design review guidelines the application violates.
      (3)   In the case of staff disapproval, staff shall provide a written
explanation citing the exact section(s) of the ordinance or design review
guidelines the application violates.
   (C)   Demolition. Permits for full demolition without replacement are only
allowed for accessory structures and are allowed for primary structures. The
HDPC shall review all requests for demolition based on the following criteria:
      (1)   Historic buildings and structures. Historic properties comprised of
buildings and structures designated through nomination by inclusion in a survey
or survey update, or by individual nomination, shall be afforded the highest
degree of preservation. Demolition may only be allowed if one or more of the
following conditions are met, with the burden of proof falling upon the
applicant:
         (a)   Where the public safety and welfare requires the removal of the
building;
         (b)   If the building or structure cannot be economically
rehabilitated on the site to provide a reasonable income or residential
environment compared to other structures in the general area; or
         (c)   A finding of substantial economic hardship (see §
156.1265(C)) is established by the HDPC.
      (2)   Buildings and structures lacking historic designation status. In
the case of buildings or structures lacking historic property designation, the
HDPC may, at its discretion, first make a determination that the building or
structure is worthy of individual designation as an historic property pursuant
to the provisions of §
156.1477(B). If no such determination is made, demolition may then be allowed
if one or more of the following conditions are met, with the burden of proof
falling upon the applicant:
         (a)   Where the public safety and welfare requires the removal of the
building;
         (b)   The structure cannot be economically rehabilitated on the site
to provide a reasonable income or residential environment compared to other
structures in the general area;
         (c)   A finding of substantial economic hardship is established by the
HDPC; or
         (d)   Where the proposed new development is more compatible with the
surrounding area, considering such factors as location and exterior design.
      (3)   Accessory buildings and structures. In the case of accessory
buildings and structures, demolition shall be allowed if one of the following
conditions is met, with the burden of proof falling upon the applicant:
         (a)   Where the building or structure is determined not to have any
historical significance; or
         (b)   Where the public safety and welfare requires the removal of the
building or structure.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1267 SCOPE OF APPROVAL.
   (A)   Generally. Approval of a COA application authorizes the applicant to
undertake the work specified in the COA once a building permit is issued for
the same.
   (B)   What COA does not authorize.
      (1)   The COA does not approve tree protection zone modification,
removal, relocation, or replacement. Tree protection zone modification,

Stormwater and drainage management plans are reviewed by the appropriate staff
pursuant to
Chapter 152.

construction plans or where the applicant intends to request new construction
plans in the future, the permit for demolition shall not be issued until new
construction plans have been approved by the HDPC and submitted for a building
permit.
      (2)   During demolition, nearby sites, structures, and, in the case of
partial demolitions, connecting structures, shall be protected. After
demolition, the site shall be cleared and cleaned.
   (D)   Validity. The COA is valid for a period of two years from the date of
approval by the HDPC or HDPC Secretary, as applicable, and thereafter for the
time prescribed by this title.
      (1)   At any time during the two-year period, or any subsequent vested
rights extensions, the Building Official may grant a building permit to the
applicant.
      (2)   Should the COA expire at any time prior to the application for a
building permit, a building permit shall not be issued until the applicant
provides a current COA.

      (2)   The HDPC Secretary shall provide the COA and draft minutes of the
hearing of the application to the applicant within ten days of approval of the

§ 156.1290 PURPOSE.
   This part establishes a procedure to avoid unnecessary hardships that could
result from a strict application of this chapter.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1291 APPLICABILITY.
   This part applies to an application for a variance. An applicant shall
obtain variance approval to construct, develop, or make a material change in
any lot, building, or structure that does not comply with the standards of this
chapter.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1292 INITIATION.
   (A)   Applicant eligibility. A variance application may be initiated by:

   (B)   Pre-application meeting. A pre-application meeting is required (see §
156.1079).
   (C)   Application requirements.
      (1)   A variance application is filed with the PLAN Department on or

peril to life and property, proceedings will not be stayed unless a restraining
order is granted by the Board or by a court of record on application.

(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1296 REVIEW CRITERIA.
   (A)   The Board may grant a variance in an individual case of unnecessary
hardship, if the Board makes and explains, in writing, all of the following
findings:
      (1)   There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to
the particular piece of property;
      (2)   These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the
vicinity;
      (3)   Because of these conditions, the application of the code to the
particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably
restrict the utilization of the property; and
      (4)   The authorization of a variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property or to the public good, and the character of the
district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance.
   (B)   The Board shall not grant a variance, the effect of which would be to:
      (1)   Allow the establishment of a use not otherwise permitted in a
zoning district;
      (2)   Extend physically a nonconforming use of land; or
      (3)   Change the zoning district boundaries shown on the Zoning Map.
   (C)   The fact that property may be utilized more profitably if a variance
is granted shall not be considered grounds for a variance.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1297 SCOPE OF APPROVAL.
   (A)   Generally. An approved variance application does not authorize
construction or development. Any construction or development that occurs after
approval of a variance application requires zoning permit approval, following
approval by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (B)   Approval based on submitted plans.
      (1)   Unless specifically modified by the Board's approval, relief
granted as the result of an appeal shall be in accordance with the specific
plans submitted with the application.
      (2)   Minor changes to the approved plans that do not affect the relief
granted may be allowed in order to meet other code requirements, if approved by
the Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Routine repairs and maintenance may be made to a structure
constructed pursuant to relief granted by the Board as required to preserve it
in sound condition. Any proposed changes to the structure shall be presented to
the Board Secretary for determination whether a new application is required.
   (C)   Vested rights.
      (1)   In order to complete additional applications and receive the
necessary permits for construction, variances are vested for a period of two
years, subject to the rights and restrictions contained within this title.
      (2)   Failure to receive the necessary permits within the prescribed
timeframe renders the variance approval void and of no force or effect.

   (A)   For a period of 12 months, the Board shall not accept a variance
application for a matter upon which it has rendered a final decision, except as
provided in the Board’s rules of procedure.
   (B)   Prior to the lapse of the 12-month timeframe and upon a majority vote
ascertaining changed facts or circumstances, the Board may accept such a
variance application for consideration.

County, by filing with the Clerk of Court a petition, in writing, setting forth
plainly, fully, and distinctly why the decision is contrary to law. The appeal
must be filed within 30 days after the decision of the Board is mailed.

Board of Zoning Appeals may appeal either:
         (a)   As provided in §

(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1616 HOW TO CALCULATE MAXIMUM DENSITY.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The calculation of maximum density:
         (a)   Is based on the gross area of all land within the boundaries of
a residential project, including land designated for support of the
development; that is, all areas for lots, parking areas, drives, roads,
drainage and utility easements, rights-of-way, sign easements, entrance
structure easements, and lands designated for private recreation;
         (b)   Includes freshwater wetlands; and
         (c)   Does not include tidally influenced saltwater wetlands.
      (2)   Other land area located within a parcel's boundaries, but outside
of the residential project boundaries not used for residential use, shall not
be included for the purpose of calculating residential density except as
provided in division (A)(3) below.
      (3)   In mixed use projects where non-residential uses are provided in
conjunction with, and are functionally integrated into, the residential uses,
the total area within the project boundaries of all such uses may be used to
calculate density.
   (B)   Accessory dwelling units. Accessory dwelling units are not included in
the calculation of density.
   (C)   Calculation. To calculate the maximum number of dwelling units or
bedrooms, as applicable, allowed in a development, multiply the gross lot area
by the maximum density standard for the zoning district. See Table 156.1616-1:
Example Calculation of Maximum Density (Dwelling Units per Acre).
   (D)   Rounding. When density calculations result in a fraction, the allowed
number of dwelling units or bedrooms, as applicable, is rounded down to the
next lowest whole number.

this code, lots shall not be filled in order to artificially increase building
height.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1626 HOW TO MEASURE HEIGHT.
   (A)   Height regulated in feet. Where this chapter regulates height in feet,
the height of a structure is the vertical distance measured from grade plane to
the average height of the highest roof surface.
   (B)   Height regulated in stories. Height, where not regulated in feet, is
regulated in stories.

SUBPART 2.7: IMPERVIOUS SURFACE COVERAGE
§ 156.1630 GENERALLY.
   This subpart describes how to calculate impervious surface coverage, which
is regulated in
Subchapter B and
Subchapter C.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1631 HOW TO CALCULATE IMPERVIOUS SURFACE COVERAGE.
   (A)   Impervious surface coverage is:
      (1)   Expressed as a percentage of lot area; and
      (2)   Calculated by dividing the total area of all impervious surfaces
within a lot by the total lot area, and multiplying the result by 100.
   (B)   When a lot contains tidally influenced saltwater wetlands/marsh or
open water beyond the delineated SCDES-BCM critical line, impervious surface
coverage is calculated using only the "high ground" of the lot and specifically
excluding the wetlands/marsh or open water.

SUBPART 2.8: LOT AREA, WIDTH,  AND DEPTH
§ 156.1635 GENERALLY.
   This subpart describes how to measure lot area, lot width, and lot depth.
Subchapter B and
Subchapter C regulate these metrics.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1636 HOW TO CALCULATE LOT AREA.
   (A)   The area of a lot:
      (1)   Is calculated in square feet by multiplying the lot depth by the
lot width; and
      (2)   Does not include any portion of a road right-of-way.
   (B)   When a lot is irregularly shaped, the calculation method varies based
on the lot shape and the information available (see www.mathopenref.com/
polygonirregulararea.html)
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1637 HOW TO MEASURE LOT WIDTH.
   (A)   Measurement.
      (1)   The width of a lot is the horizontal distance between the side lot
lines, measured:
         (a)   Parallel to the front lot line; or
         (b)   In the case of a curvilinear street, parallel to the chord of
the arc between the intersection of the side lot lines and the front lot line.
      (2)   The zoning district minimum lot width must be met at the front lot
line, except as specified in division (B) below.
   (B)   Lots on cul-de-sacs. For lots located on a cul-de-sac, the zoning
district minimum lot width must be met at the front setback for the district.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1638 HOW TO MEASURE LOT DEPTH.

SUBPART 2.9: SETBACKS AND YARDS
§ 156.1645 GENERALLY.
   (A)   Purpose. This subpart describes how to measure yards and setbacks.
Subchapter B and
Subchapter C regulate these metrics.
   (B)   Required yards cannot overlap. Required yards provided for one
structure shall not be used to meet yard requirements for another structure.
   (C)   Setbacks for lots subject to design review process. For lots subject
to
Subchapter H, setback distances from lot lines with street frontage are
determined through the design review process, using a build-to line of between
20 and 30 feet.
   (D)   Setbacks for lots in the Old Village Historic District. For lots
located within the Old Village Historic District (see
Subchapter B, Part 4, Subpart 4.3), setback distance is determined during the
certificate of appropriateness (COA) review process, with consideration of
existing conditions and setbacks of adjacent lots.
   (E)   Setbacks for postage stamp lots. Normal setback and yard requirements
do not apply to lot lines for “postage stamp” lots subdivided pursuant to the
provisions of §
155.047(C)(1)(a). The setback and yard requirements of the zoning district
classification apply to the perimeter of the larger parcel in which these lots
are located.
   (F)   Setbacks for the subdivision of lots with more than one dwelling unit.
Normal setback and yard requirements do not apply to lot lines for lots
resulting from the subdivision of lots with more than one dwelling unit
pursuant to the provisions of §
155.047(C)(1)(b).
   (G)   Determinations and interpretations. When making determinations or, if
necessary, interpretations under this subpart, the Zoning Administrator shall
consider the following characteristics of the lot and surrounding lots:
      (1)   The orientation of existing or proposed buildings containing the
principal use;
      (2)   The orientation of adjacent buildings and other buildings along the
street;
      (3)   The location of a dwelling’s curtilage;
      (4)   Means of gaining safe access;
      (5)   The relative dimensions of the lot and yards;
      (6)   Delivery of services to the lot, including mail and trash
collection;
      (7)   Setbacks on surrounding lots; and
      (8)   Other features related to site design and safe circulation.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1646 LOT ORIENTATION, YARDS, AND SETBACKS.
   (A)   A front yard is adjacent to the front lot line, and is typically
located along a street. A rear yard is adjacent to the rear lot line, and is
generally located parallel to the front yard. Side yards are adjacent to side
lot lines, and are generally located perpendicular to the front and rear yards.
   (B)   
Figure 156.1646-1: Typical Location of Yards and Setback Lines illustrates
yards and setback lines on typical lots. Setback lines are located parallel to
the associated lot line. The Zoning Administrator determines the location of
yards and setbacks on irregularly shaped lots using the criteria specified in
this section and in §
156.1645(G).
Figure 156.1646-2 depicts the typical location of yards and setback lines on
two types of irregularly shaped lots, marsh front lots and flag lots.
   (C)   Typically, the shorter lot dimensions are considered the front and
rear lot lines and the longer lot dimensions are considered the side lot lines.
This provides the most buildable area on a lot. However, where a lot has street
frontage that is wider than the lot is deep and was platted prior to adoption
of the Town Zoning Code on August 13, 1979:
      (1)   The front yard setback may be applied along the street frontage,
and the rear yard setback along the parallel lot line (longer side). The side
yard setbacks may be applied on lot lines of adjacent parcels (shorter side)
when consistent with the lots on either side of the subject lot or the majority
of the lots within the block; and
      (2)   The principal structure must conform with the setback adjustment.
If any portion of an existing or proposed principal structure does not comply
with the adjusted setbacks, a variance to allow the establishment of setbacks
must be approved by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (D)   In the case of new construction on a corner lot, the owner may
establish the location of the front and rear yards based on preference of
orientation, taking into consideration orientation of adjacent structures and
existing development patterns.

encroachments as allowed by § 156.1651) that generally faces a street and
extends across the entire width of a lot between the side lot lines.
      (2)   For lots without frontage on a street, the front lot line is the
lot line where access to the lot is provided.
      (3)   The horizontal distance between the principal structure and the
front lot line shall be at least equal to the minimum front setback for the
zoning district in which the lot is located (see

IMAGES/0-0-0-13151.png]
   (C)   Average front setbacks.
      (1)   The minimum front yard setback requirement for dwellings does not
apply on any lot where the average setback of existing buildings located,
wholly or in part, within 100 feet on each side of such lot within the same
block and zoning district and fronting on the same side of the street, is less
than the minimum required setback.
      (2)   In these cases, the setback on such lots may be less than the
required minimum setback, but not less than the average of the setbacks of the
aforementioned existing buildings.

   (B)   The horizontal distance between the principal structure and each side
lot line shall be at least equal to the minimum side setback required for the
zoning district in which the lot is located (see
Subchapter B).
   (C)   The side yard setback requirement applies where a side yard abuts a
street (corner lot). However, accessory buildings shall not be located closer
to the street than the front yard setback line of the adjacent lot.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1651 ENCROACHMENTS.

SUBCHAPTER O: BUILDING PERMIT ALLOCATION SYSTEM
§ 156.1690 TITLE.
   This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as the Building Permit
Allocation System (BPAS).
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1691 AUTHORITY.
   (A)   These regulations are adopted for the promotion of the public health,
safety, economy, good order, convenience, and general welfare of the Town of
Mount Pleasant under the authority granted by:
      (1)   S.C. Code Chapter 29 of Title 6 (otherwise known as the South
Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act of 1994); and
      (2)   The general police powers of municipalities granted pursuant to the
Constitution of the State of South Carolina and state legislation, including
the Home Rule Act (Act No. 283 of 1975) and S.C. Code § 5-7-30.
   (B)   Furthermore, the provisions of this subchapter shall not be construed
to limit the power and ability of the town to utilize any current laws, codes,
and regulations in substitution of, or in conjunction with, these provisions to
accomplish its intended purpose.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1692 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this subchapter is to create a building permit
allocation system to distribute certain building permits at a reasonable rate
and in a manner intended to limit the pace of construction of certain dwelling
units over a fixed period. The purpose of the system is to respond to a variety
of growth and development forces which affect the town’s ability to meet
community expectations and demands. Some factors and considerations supporting
the need for the BPAS are as follows:
      (1)   The Town of Mount Pleasant is a desirable place to live and work
due to its position in the Greater Charleston metropolitan area. The town’s
convenient location, level and quality of municipal infrastructure and
services, climate, and access to beaches and other recreational areas have
generated continued high and unsustainable levels of residential growth;
      (2)   Like other fast-growing communities, the Town of Mount Pleasant
continues to face infrastructure stresses brought on by continued residential
growth. Maintaining pace with the demands of increasing numbers of housing
remains a significant community issue;
      (3)   Considering the town’s coastal location and physical geography as
defined by the ocean and major rivers, movement of people and goods depends
upon a limited network of major roadways. Growth greatly affects the town’s
road system as daily activities generate traffic and considerable congestion on
primary road corridors which struggle to handle daily traffic volumes,
especially at certain peak periods during each day. This situation is projected
to worsen as the region continues to grow;
      (4)   The rate of growth has outpaced the availability of funding from
the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) to install necessary
transportation infrastructure, especially roads;
      (5)   Town revenues do not support construction of needed capital
investments identified in the Capital Improvements Plan (CIP), necessitating
difficult budgeting decisions that Town Council faces. This may also affect
public safety in the event of evacuation in advance of a hurricane or during
another natural emergency;
      (6)   To manage the effects of growth and to assure quality, well-
designed development in the future, the town has commissioned, adopted, and
implemented various studies and plans to identify needs and assist in providing
required infrastructure and services to support its citizenry in a cost-
effective manner, without raising ad valorem taxes. These include new or
updated versions of the Comprehensive Plan, the Long-Range Transportation Plan,
the Capital Improvements Plan, and similar plan documents;
      (7)   The annual CIP assesses the infrastructure needs of the town and
prioritizes capital projects to fund using the town’s goals and objectives,
with the need for infrastructure driven by population growth or changes in the
levels of service; and,
      (8)   If the town’s population rate of growth is not adequately managed,
Town Council may be forced to either significantly increase property taxes to
respond to service and infrastructure demands or reduce the present levels of
service for town facilities and services. Either response will generate
negative financial or quality of life impacts since infrastructure is directly
connected to the quality of life in the town.
   (B)   Intent. In designing and implementing the building permit allocation
system, the town has incorporated appropriate mechanisms to recognize different
categories of residential development, account for already-approved residential
development covered by the lawfully enacted Carolina Park and Liberty Hill
Farms development agreements, provide equity and fairness, allow for reasonable
flexibility, and not exclude the less fortunate from the opportunity for
suitable, reasonably priced housing in the town.
      (1)   These provisions are intended to better manage and address the
effects of growth that have resulted in increased traffic, congestion, and
burdens upon the infrastructure system and the ability of the town to provide
other public services.
      (2)   During the lifespan of the BPAS, the town is fully committed to the
appropriation of funds and the construction and installation of needed capital
improvements which will serve existing and future residents.
      (3)   In implementing the BPAS, the town has sought to devise a plan that
does not disrupt existing residential development patterns in the town and
which utilizes a means of distributing permits that recognizes and reasonably
accommodates, without undue delay, prior expenditures and expectations of
owners and developers of property.
      (4)   The BPAS is intended to manage the construction of dwelling units
through the allocation of residential building permits. Detached house, duplex,
and townhouse residential units represent individual dwelling units and
therefore require one permit for each unit. Because multiplex dwellings require
a single building permit for each building constructed, regardless of the
number of units within each building, the plan of distribution takes this into
account. While each building only requires a single building permit for
construction, an individual permit allocation shall be assigned to each
separate dwelling unit in a multiplex dwelling.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1693 JURISDICTION; APPLICABILITY.
   (A)   The regulations in this subchapter shall apply to any building permit
application for a residential dwelling unit to be placed on a vacant lot or
parcel in the corporate limits of the Town of Mount Pleasant on which a
residence(s) did not exist as of the date of adoption of this system.
   (B)   The permits issued pursuant to this system pertain to new residential
construction only and include buildings that meet the definitions of DETACHED
HOUSE DWELLING, DUPLEX DWELLING, TOWNHOUSE DWELLING, TRIPLEX DWELLING, QUADPLEX
DWELLING, MULTIPLEX DWELLING, and ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT contained in this
chapter.
   (C)   Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to affect or otherwise
limit the approved use, plans, and construction of a dwelling unit(s) for which
a building permit has already been issued prior to the effective date of these
provisions.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1694 IMPLEMENTATION AND ADMINISTRATION OF BUILDING PERMIT ALLOCATION
SYSTEM.
   (A)   The BPAS shall be implemented so that the demands of growth are met in
as timely a manner as possible.
   (B)   For purposes of this subchapter, an allocation is equivalent to a
building permit. No separate application for an allocation is required prior to
submission of a building permit application.
   (C)   The administration of the BPAS is the responsibility of the Town of
Mount Pleasant Director of Planning, Land Use, and Neighborhoods. The Director
is authorized to issue and maintain explanatory materials, necessary forms and
applications, and appropriate procedures to effectively administer this
subchapter.
   (D)   The Town Planning Director shall ensure that the Department processes
complete applications and issues building permits in a timely manner, maintains
appropriate records and data, and effectively administers any amendments to
this subchapter.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1695 AVAILABILITY AND ALLOCATION OF PERMITS.
   (A)   The overall number of residential building permits allocated under
this program is established by the Town Council to maintain a more sustainable
rate of growth and avoid any spikes or peaks in residential construction. The
distribution of permit allocations will be handled utilizing different dwelling
unit categories as outlined in §
156.1696.
   (B)   Permits shall be issued on a semi-annual basis in the chronological
order in which applications are received (commonly referred to as “first come,
first serve”) by the Department of Engineering and Development Services.
   (C)   One-half of the allocated permits will be available on January 1 and
the other half will be made available on July 1 of each year. Each six-month
period represents an allocation cycle.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1696 PERMIT ALLOCATIONS.
   (A)   Dwelling unit types. The number of new dwelling units allocated for
the duration of this program shall be managed using different categories of
dwelling unit types, with categorical limits on the respective number of
permits.
      (1)   Category A, detached house, townhouse, and duplex dwellings. On an
annual basis, a total number of permits shall be made available for the
construction of buildings meeting the definition of DWELLING, DETACHED HOUSE;”
DWELLING, TOWNHOUSE; and DWELLING, DUPLEX.
      (2)   Category B, accessory dwelling unit. On an annual basis, a total
number of permits shall be reserved and made available exclusively for the
construction of buildings meeting the definition of ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT.
      (3)   Category C, triplex, quadplex, and multiplex dwellings. During the
term of the program, a total number of permits shall be made available for the
construction of buildings meeting the definition of DWELLING, TRIPLEX;
DWELLING, QUADPLEX; and DWELLING, MULTIPLEX. This category is independent of
the form of ownership and includes units known as “condominiums” and/or in a
“horizontal property regime” as defined by state law.
   (B)   Established allocations and limitations on number of applications.
      (1)   Exclusive of the dwelling units already allowed by the Carolina
Park and Liberty Hill Farms development agreements, the annual number of
available residential permits is established at a total of 600 dwelling units
to yield a more manageable average annual growth rate. Annual allocations for
Categories A and B are provided in
Table 156.1696-1: Dwelling Type Categorical Allocations, 2024-2029. The number
of triplex, quadplex, and multiplex allocations for the duration of the program
and the total allocation for all unit types is illustrated in Table 156.1696-2:
Program Totals, 2024-2029.
      (2)   Regardless of the total number of available allocations established
in this section, the number of permit applications that may be submitted for
any single development/subdivision or combination of phases in a single
development/subdivision shall be limited to no more than 25 per semi-annual
allocation cycle for the Category A (Detached House, Townhouse, and Duplex)
dwelling types.

   (C)   Management of permit allocations. Any permits allocated for a given
cycle but not issued during that cycle shall be carried over and will be made
available with the next or subsequent allocation cycles. Alternatively, if the
number of permit applications exceeds the available amount of building permits
during an allocation cycle, such applications shall maintain their position on
a waiting list and shall be administered during the next allocation cycle.
   (D)   Transfer of allocations prohibited. If all permits are not issued
during any allocation period, available permits identified in the established
categories of dwelling units in division (A) above shall not be transferred
between categories to another type of dwelling unit.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1697 APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Application requirements and specific procedures will be maintained on
file in the office of the Building Official.
   (B)   Permit requests will be considered for completed applications only.
   (C)   Applications for a building permit will be accepted at any time during
the allocation cycle, starting on the first day of a semi-annual allocation
cycle.
   (D)   If the number of building permit applications exceeds the available
supply for the semiannual allocation cycle, no further permits will be issued.
   (E)   Each permit application shall be made pursuant to a specific set of
plans for a specific lot or parcel. Plan substitutions are not allowed. Minor
revisions are allowed only to plans under review or that have been issued a
building permit upon approval of the Building Official. Substantial revisions
may require resubmittal.
   (F)   Permits will be issued only in the applicant’s name.
      (1)   For purposes of this system, the applicant is the owner of record
of the lot for which the permit is sought and who has a present possessory
interest in the lot, to include the right of unfettered access and authority to
convey.
      (2)   For purposes of this system, an applicant and any person, firm,
corporation, partnership, or other entity in which the applicant holds an
interest, shall be considered the same applicant. For purposes of this system,
an applicant and his or her spouse and unemancipated children under 21, shall
be considered the same applicant.
      (3)   Proof of ownership and such other information as may be reasonably
requested to determine an applicant’s eligibility for a permit must be supplied
upon request. Proof of ownership, including, but not limited to, affidavits
detailing information such as business relationships and membership in entities
like LLCs and corporations, may be routinely required. The town will consider
substance, not mere form, in the interpretation of this section to ensure that
an applicant is an owner, in law and in fact.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1698 COMMENCEMENT OF CONSTRUCTION.
   (A)   Construction authorized under permits issued pursuant to this
allocation system shall commence within six months from the date the Building
Official issues the building permit. Otherwise, the permit will become invalid
and be made available within the allocation cycle.
   (B)   Construction may be considered to have begun upon the initiation of
site work and foundation construction, provided additional improvements
progress in a reasonable timeframe toward completion of the project.
   (C)   A lapse of construction activities for a period of six months shall
invalidate the permit and the allocation will become available as a new
allocation under this system.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1699 EXEMPTIONS.
   (A)   Additions, renovations, or replacement. Permit allocation does not
apply to additions or renovations to an existing residential building.
Replacement of a residential building on a lot where one has existed within the
past five years from the date of application is also exempt from permit
allocation.
   (B)   Affordable housing units. For purposes of this system, housing units
to provide dwellings for either low income or lower income employees in the
workforce are not included in the allocation specified in this subchapter and
are in addition to the number of annual permits regulated by this subchapter.
      (1)   These units are intended to provide affordable housing ownership
opportunities for persons whose incomes are either:
         (a)   Less than 80% of the area median family income (AMI); or
         (b)   Range between 80% and 120% of the area median family income
(AMI) for the Charleston/North Charleston metropolitan statistical area.
      (2)   The monthly mortgage payments for the owner of the dwelling unit
shall not exceed 28% of 80% of the gross median family monthly income as
reflected in the sale price using the Fannie Mae Foundation Mortgage Calculator
(or comparable methodology), assuming a 10% down payment and a specified
interest rate. The specified interest rate shall be determined by selecting the
lowest 30-year fixed mortgage rate reported by area lending institutions at the
time when the updated U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development income
limits become available.
      (3)   The income limits and maximum sales prices for low income families
and owner-occupied dwelling unit established by the U.S. Census Bureau, the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the Fannie Mae
Foundation, shall be used to determine the provision of low income or lower
income workforce housing. The maximum sale price shall be updated yearly,
commencing in 2023, as the current U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development income limits become available.
      (4)   Applying similar federal requirements in Title 26 US Code § 42 to
qualify for low-income housing credits, the dwelling unit must remain at the
affordable workforce housing price for ten years. Resale of affordable
workforce dwelling units shall be limited by deed restriction to the original
sales price, adjusted for inflation, and to a purchaser eligible, as described
in this section, for a period of not less than ten years after issuance of the
certificate of occupancy. Funding sources and other factors may require a
longer term of afford ability. The increase permitted for inflation shall be
based upon the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
      (5)   Affidavits will be required that set forth the sale prices of the
units and verify that the units are, in fact, available to workforce housing
purchasers, and will initially be owned and occupied by persons qualified per
the provisions of this section.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1700 MONITORING AND EVALUATION.
   (A)   Town Council shall evaluate the system twice per year. This evaluation
shall include an assessment of the need for specific annual allocations,
progress on installation of programmed capital improvements, effect on low
income or affordable workforce housing, and all other aspects of the system.
   (B)   To facilitate the evaluation, the Director of Planning, Land Use, and
Neighborhoods shall provide a report to Town Council setting forth the number
of permits sought, the number of permits issued, a description of any
significant administrative problems which arose over the assessment period, the
progress of the implementation of the Capital Improvements Program, any
recommendations for changes or revisions to this subchapter to improve its
effectiveness or administration, and such other relevant information as they
may deem useful or that the Council may request.
   (C)   Town Council may adjust or modify the total allocation of permits or
the categorical allocations.
   (D)   Town Council may terminate the program at any time based upon the
results of an assessment or other conditions that suggest the need to eliminate
the system.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1701 APPEALS.
   Appeals from the provisions of this system are made directly to the Town
Board of Zoning Appeals pursuant to the procedure outlined in other sections of
this chapter, with the criteria for the granting of a variance those set forth
in
Subchapter I, Part 15.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1702 LIBERAL CONSTRUCTION.
   The provisions of this subchapter shall be liberally construed to
effectively carry out its stated purposes, which are found and declared to be
in the furtherance of the public health, safety, economy, convenience, and
general welfare for the harmonious, orderly, and progressive development of
land within the town.
(Ord. passed 1-14-25)
§ 156.1703 SEVERABILITY; CONFLICT.
   (A)   All provisions are severable, such that if any provision or the
administration of this system is held invalid, the invalidity does not affect
other provisions or applications of this system that can still be given effect.
   (B)   In the event of a conflict with other provisions in this Code, the
provisions contained in this subchapter shall be controlling.

§ 157.010 SHORT TITLE; LEGISLATIVE FINDING AND INTENT; AUTHORIZATION FOR
DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS; PROVISION ARE SUPPLEMENTAL TO THOSE EXTANT.
   (A)   This ordinance may be cited as the "Town of Mount Pleasant Development
Agreement Ordinance."
   (B)   The town finds:
      (1)   The lack of certainty in the approval of development can result in
a waste of economic and land resources, can discourage sound capital
improvement planning and financing, can cause the cost of housing and
development to escalate, and can discourage commitment to comprehensive
planning.
      (2)   Assurance to a developer that upon receipt of its development
permits it may proceed in accordance with existing laws and policies, subject
to the conditions of a development agreement, strengthens the public planning
process, encourages sound capital improvement planning and financing, assists
in assuring there are adequate capital facilities for the development,
encourages private participation in comprehensive planning, reduces the
economic costs of development, allows for orderly planning of public facilities
and services and allows for the equitable allocation of the cost of public
services.
      (3)   Because the development approval process involves the expenditure
of considerable sums of money, predictability encourages the maximum efficient
utilization of resources at the least economic cost to the public.
      (4)   Public benefits derived from development agreements may include,
but are not limited to, affordable housing, design standards, and on and off-
site infrastructure and other improvements. These public benefits will be
negotiated in return for the vesting of development rights for a specific
period.
      (5)   Land planning and development involve review and action by multiple
governmental agencies, the use of development agreements may facilitate the
cooperation and coordination of the requirements and needs of the various
governmental agencies having jurisdiction over land development.
      (6)   Development agreements will encourage the vesting of property
rights by protecting such rights from the effect of subsequently enacted local
legislation or from the effects of changing policies and procedures of local
government agencies which may conflict with any term or provision of the
development agreement or in any way hinder, restrict or prevent the development
of the project. Development agreements will provide a reasonable certainty as
to the lawful requirements that must be met in protecting vested property
rights, while maintaining the authority and duty of government to enforce laws
and regulations which promote the public safety, health, and general welfare of
the citizens of our town.
   (C)   It is the intent and responsibility of the Town Council to encourage a
stronger commitment to comprehensive and capital facilities planning, ensure
the provision of adequate public facilities for development, encourage the
efficient use of resources, and reduce the economic cost of development.
   (D)   This intent is effected by authorizing the town to enter into
development agreements with developers, subject to the procedures and
requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   This chapter must be regarded as supplemental and additional to the
powers conferred upon the town by other laws and must not be regarded as in
derogation of any powers existing on the effective date of this chapter.
