Newberry County Council shall not have the authority to increase or decrease
the duties of county-wide elected officials whose duties are prescribed by
state statute except to the extent allowed by state statute.
§ 10.12 ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.
   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention of
the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning can be
attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words were clearly
intended to express the intent, the spelling shall be corrected and the word or
words supplied, omitted, or substituted as will conform with the manifest

words were contained in the text as originally published. No alteration shall

funds and may operate 1 or more bookmobiles over routes determined by the
Board;

regulations established by the County Council;

Council a budget for the ensuing fiscal year adequate to fund the operation and

addressed by County ordinance, the County Administrator shall administratively
establish appropriate criteria for persons under his or her direction and
control to serve as Code Enforcement officers, and the County Administrator
shall be empowered to relieve a person of such authority if, in his or her
judgment, such action is warranted.

authority and duty to administer oaths to and to commission all Code

§ 30.06 USE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS IN COUNTY BUILDINGS.
   (A)   Purpose. The possession of lighted smoking materials in public places
is a nuisance, and is hazardous to the public health, safety, comfort,
convenience, and indoor environment of those who use public buildings.
Likewise, the use of nonsmokable tobacco products, such as snuff and chewing
tobacco, require periodic spitting of saliva laden with tobacco products which
also is offensive to the public, and because it offers the possibility of
communicating disease and creating slippery floor surfaces and other unsanitary
conditions, is offensive to the public health, safety, comfort, and convenience
of those who use public buildings owned and/or controlled by Newberry County.
The purpose of this section is to regulate the use of tobacco products inside
public buildings and to provide penalties for the violation of this section.
   (B)   Definition. For the purpose of this section, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.
      TOBACCO PRODUCTS. Cigarettes, cigars, pipes containing loose tobacco,
chewing tobacco, snuff, and any other form of tobacco not specified
hereinbefore.
   (C)   Offense. The possession of lit cigarettes, cigars, or pipes anywhere
in a public building owned and/or controlled by Newberry County in this section
shall be illegal, unless otherwise authorized by this section. The chewing of
tobacco or the possession of tobacco in the oral cavity while in a public
building owned and/or controlled by Newberry County shall be illegal, unless
otherwise authorized by this section. It shall not be an offense under this
section to possess unlit cigarettes, cigars, or pipes, or to possess chewing
tobacco or snuff that is carried in its original package, and not used in the
oral cavity. This section does prohibit the chewing or carrying in the mouth of
unlit cigars or cigarettes while in public buildings owned and/or controlled by
Newberry County.
   (D)   Exceptions.
      (1)   The agency head in charge of a public building, or the County
Administrator, may designate areas on the outside of a public building for use
by the employees, and members of the public, for the smoking of tobacco
products or for otherwise indulging in tobacco products during employee break
periods, or on occasions when the public has business in the public building.
      (2)   The Sheriff, as custodian of the Newberry County Detention Center,
because of the requirements of jail security, is authorized to set aside an
interior room in the jail for smoking and other use of tobacco, provided,
however, that the room shall be arranged in such a way that the smoke-
contaminated air shall be vented to the outside of the building and shall not
be allowed to enter into the ventilation system for the jail structure.
   (E)   Enforcement procedure. Persons accused of violating this section can
be brought before a court of competent jurisdiction either by arrest, if the
perpetrator violates this section in the presence of a duly commissioned law
enforcement officer, by arrest warrant, or by uniform or ordinance summons, as
authorized by state law, upon adoption by Newberry County of a system for the
implementation of the uniform ordinance summons provisions for violations of
county ordinances as provided by S.C. Code § 56-7-80, as amended. Upon adoption
of those provisions, alleged violators shall not be subject to immediate
custodial arrest or to arrest by arrest warrant, but shall be issued ordinance
summonses, without being required to immediately post bond, and shall be
required to appear in court at a specified time and date, all as provided by
S.C. Code § 56-7-80. Any persons who shall violate the provisions of S.C. Code
§ 56-7-80 shall be subject to the penalties provided therein.
   (F)   Notice to public. The public buildings which are subject to the
restrictions of this section shall be designated as such by the Newberry County
Administrator by the posting of 1 or more signs, at least 1 of which is to be
at or near the main entrance to the building. The signs shall notify persons
that the use of tobacco products, both of the smoking type and nonsmoking type,
is prohibited in that building. The buildings to be designated include, but are
not limited to, the following:
      (1)   Newberry County Courthouse, Courthouse Annex and Auditor’s and
Treasurer’s Building;
      (2)   The Community Hall (old Courthouse);

make available to him or her for use on the public works of Newberry County,
including maintaining county buildings, maintaining county roads and bridges,

   (B)   The County Administrator, or the department head as he or she shall

protected from the risk of prisoners escaping from the bounds of their
confinement; further, the County Administrator shall assign and utilize the
prisoners only in accordance with the rules and regulations established by the
South Carolina Department of Corrections.
   (C)   Pursuant to the Litter Control Act of 1978, codified as S.C. Code §
44-67-10, the Newberry County Administrator is authorized and empowered to
contract with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control
(DHEC) for the use of prisoners for litter removal along public roads, and
other appropriate areas authorized by law, in accordance with regulations of
the South Carolina Department of Corrections and DHEC.
   (D)   Pursuant to S.C. Code § 24-3-30, the Newberry County Administrator,
upon approval by the Newberry County Council, is authorized to negotiate with
and enter into contracts with the municipal authorities of any city or town
within the County of Newberry for the use on the highways, streets, and other
public works of any such municipality of inmates incarcerated in the Newberry
County Jail, and which are made available for the purposes by the Newberry
County Sheriff. Any such agreement with a city or town shall contain adequate
provisions for the proper supervision, utilization, care, and control of the
inmates, in accordance with the laws and regulations of the State of South
Carolina.
   (E)   In the event that the Newberry County Council enters into an agreement
with the Sheriff of Newberry County, pursuant to S.C. Code § 24-5-12, whereby
the powers and duties relating to the custody of the County Jail are devolved
on to the Newberry County Council, then the Newberry County Administrator shall
take all of the actions provided by this section, without the necessity of the
approval of the Newberry County Sheriff.
   (F)   Pursuant to the provisions of S.C. Code § 24-3-20(C), Newberry County
Council hereby approves the use of the prisoners confined at the county jail,
who are serving a sentence of 90 days or less, in the performing of litter
removal functions within the county. The Newberry County Administrator is
hereby authorized to utilize the prisoners for the litter removal function, to

RULES OF PROCEDURE
§ 31.25 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEBATE; FORMAL DEBATE. Discussion among members of Council on the merits of
the pending question. FORMAL DEBATE can be terminated only by action of Council
(motions to adjourn, to table, for the previous question, and the like).
   INFORMAL DEBATE; CONVERSATION. Discussion among members of the Council not
subsequent to a motion. INFORMAL DISCUSSION is a privilege granted by the
Chairperson at his or her discretion. Parliamentary rules governing debate do
not apply until a motion is made.
   MEETINGS OF COUNCIL; EXECUTIVE SESSIONS. Executive sessions can only be held
upon a majority vote of the Council after the subject matter has been
announced. Meeting of Council attended only by Council members, the County
Administrator, and County Attorney, together with employees or other persons
invited to attend who may have information to share or testimony to give
regarding the subject, or appropriate, being discussed. EXECUTIVE SESSIONS are
appropriate only for consideration of matters concerning personalities such as
employees or appointments, contract negotiations or bids, and legal matters. No
record need be made of executive proceedings, but the decision or result should
be reduced to writing and entered in the minutes of Council. When announced in
the regular meeting session, the Council must vote to end the session and
return to the regular session.
   MEETINGS OF COUNCIL; REGULAR SESSIONS. All meetings at which business is
transacted shall be public meetings. A record of the proceedings and all
actions taken shall be recorded in the permanent public minutes of the Council.
The meetings shall be fixed by the Council and can be changed or postponed by a
majority vote of all members.
   MEETINGS OF COUNCIL; SPECIAL SESSIONS. Three members of the Council may
request the Chairperson to call a special meeting to consider emergencies and
pertinent information which cannot be delayed until the next regular meeting.
At least 24-hours’ advance notice shall be given for the sessions.
   MOTION OF THE PREVIOUS QUESTION. Any member may move to previous question.
This motion does not involve action on the main motion itself, but rather
anticipates the closing of debate and a vote on the main motion. The question
is called upon a 2/3 vote of the members present and voting. Alternatively, the
Chair may call the previous question if it appears that no member would like to
speak further to the matter. Any members may request that the Chairperson call
the question.
   MOTION TO AMEND. A motion to strike and/or add to any part of a main motion,
or to rephrase a motion. An amendment may be hostile to the intent of the main
motion, but it must be germane to the subject of the motion. A motion to amend
is appropriate in order to alter the effect of a main motion without
drastically changing this structure or approach of the main motion. An
amendment is voted on independently before voting on the main motion.
   MOTION TO CONTINUE. Postpones consideration of a matter to the next regular
session of Council. The motion to continue is most appropriately made before
any other motion is introduced to deal with the matter at hand. After a motion
is made on a matter, a motion to postpone to a definite time is more
appropriate.
   MOTION TO DEFER. Postpones consideration of a matter until it is returned to
the floor. Any matter deferred shall be placed on the pending list and may be
recalled at the appropriate time during any subsequent meeting by a main motion
and a second.
   MOTION TO LAY ON THE TABLE. Postpones consideration of a matter
indefinitely. Any matter tabled may be returned to the floor at any subsequent
meeting by being placed on the agenda in the same manner as a matter of new
business or by unanimous consent of all members present.
   MOTION TO POSTPONE. Postpones consideration of a matter to a certain time
specified in the motion (e.g., I move to postpone this matter until March 2.)
Any matter postponed shall automatically be placed on the agenda for the date
specified or the next meeting if not specified.
   MOTION TO RECONSIDER. Opens the floor to a new main motion contrary to a
previous action. A motion to reconsider is not itself a main motion to alter
the previous action. If the motion is to reverse a previous action, then at
least 5 members must vote to reconsider, and the motion must be made by the
previous winning side.
   PERSONAL APPEARANCES. Appearances before County Council by persons who have
been asked by the Council or the Administrator to appear before Council to
address an issue, or by persons who have requested time to make an appearance
before Council and whose request has been granted before the Agenda is
published.
   PUBLIC COMMENTS. Comments offered by those members of the public who sign a
sign-in sheet immediately before a County Council meeting for recognition to
speak on an issue.
   SUBSTITUTE MOTION. A motion to strike a primary motion in its entirety and
insert a new motion in lieu thereof. A substitute motion should be inconsistent
with, and must be germane to the subject of, the primary motion. A substitute
motion is appropriate in order to change drastically the structure or approach
of the main motion. Simpler changes should be submitted as amendments. Since
the substitute motion replaces the primary motion, it becomes itself a main
motion and may be amended, tabled, and the like. The substitute motion is
properly voted on before the primary motion. Passage of the substitute disposes
of the primary motion and of any previous substitute motion.

he or she is allowed by the Chair to explain his or her action.
   (C)   The Chairperson shall decide all questions of order without debate, or

amended Agenda item (19), each Council member will be given an opportunity to
respond to any comments which have been made during the meeting, or to make
other comments.
   (E)   If repeated calls do not produce order, the Chairperson may call by

her conduct but may be ordered by the Chairperson to withdraw while Council
considers punishment or other proceeding to be had.
   (F)   In case of any disturbance or disorderly conduct by any persons
present, the Chairperson shall have the power to order the chamber cleared, and

§ 31.29 PARLIAMENTARY PROCEDURE.
   (A)   When debate is in order. Debate among members of the Council is in
order only after a motion has been stated by the Chairperson and seconded.
   (B)   Nondebatable motions. Certain parliamentary motions must be decided
without formal debate. These are:
      (1)   To adjourn or recede;
      (2)   To continue;
      (3)   To lay on the table;
      (4)   To postpone indefinitely or to a day certain;
      (5)   To suspend or depart from the agenda, or to return to it; and
      (6)   For the previous question.
   (C)   Informal debate. Immediately after receiving a nondebatable motion,
and at other times when no motion is on the floor, the Chairperson may allow
the conversation as he or she deems appropriate, but all the informal
discussion remains subject to his or her discretion; he or she may call for the
vote on the matter at hand or terminate discussion at any time, and in the
instances his or her decision may not be appealed.
   (D)   Temporary suspension of business. The following instances may suspend
any matter before the Council temporarily:
      (1)   Point of order;
      (2)   Point of personal privilege;
      (3)   Question of recess; and
      (4)   Other incidental questions, such as of reading papers, dividing a
question, withdrawing a motion, or excusing a member from voting.
   (E)   Motions in order during formal debate. When a motion has been stated
and seconded and debate has begun, no motion except the following shall be in
order:
      (1)   To adjourn or recede;
      (2)   To continue;
      (3)   To table;
      (4)   For the previous question;
      (5)   To postpone indefinitely;
      (6)   To postpone to a certain day;
      (7)   To recur to the agenda;
      (8)   To substitute a motion germane to the matter at hand; and
      (9)   To amend.
   (F)   Substitute motions. No more than 2 motions may be received in
substitute for the motion on the floor. Any substitute motion defeated by a
vote of Council shall be counted as 1 of 2 permissible substitute motions, but
any substitute motion which fails for lack of a second shall not be so counted.
   (G)   No dilatory motions. The Chairperson shall entertain no motion the
effect of which will be unnecessarily to delay the business of Council.
   (H)   Repeated motions. Once 1 of the following motions has been made and
rejected, no motion of the same effect shall again be allowed with regard to
the same question;
      (1)   To continue;

      (3)   To defer; or
      (4)   To table.
   (I)   Division of a question. Any member may call for the division of the
question. Council may then divide it if the question can be so comprehended
that, 1 part being taken away, the rest can stand entire for decision. A motion
to divide the question shall require a second and shall be effective upon the
vote of a majority of members present and voting; provided, however, that a
motion to strike out and insert may not be divided, but that rejection of a
motion to strike out shall not preclude a motion to strike out and insert.
   (J)   Withdrawal of a question. The member who introduced a motion may
withdraw it before decision on it or on any amendment to it, so long as the
member seconding the motion shall not object; provided, however, that no motion
may be withdrawn after the previous question has been called.
   (K)   Reconsideration. After a question has been decided, any member who
voted with the prevailing side may move for reconsideration, and any member may
second the motion. However, if Council either shall refuse to reconsider or
shall affirm its first decision by a vote of 5 members to reconsider, then no
further reconsideration shall be in order except by unanimous consent. The
motion to reconsider shall have precedence over all other main motions to
rescind, but must be by a vote of at least 5 members.
   (L)   Resumption of debate. If debate on a question is continued or
postponed by action of Council, that question shall be resumed as the first
item of business in its proper category on the agenda at the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Council, unless another date certain is specified in
the action to continue or postpone.
   (M)   Suspension of the rules. Any member may request, as a matter of
privilege, a suspension of any rule contained in this chapter. The rules shall
be suspended upon the consent of majority of the members present.
   (N)   Parliamentary practice. In all particulars not determined by these
rules, the practice of the Council shall be guided by Robert’s Rules of Order,
10th Edition.

be furnished, but the raw data may be made available for the requesting party
to analyze as he or she see fit.

   (B)   Notice inviting bids. The Purchasing Director shall invite bids
through the following methods:
      (1)   Advertisement in a form prescribed by the County Administrator or
his or her designee in a newspaper of general circulation in the county, giving
a brief description of the things to be purchased, the time and place where
bids will be opened, and a location or telephone number where bid forms and
complete specifications may be secured;
      (2)   Written invitations to bid, mailed to all appropriate vendors
included in the bidders list (numbering at least 3). The notice inviting bids
shall set forth in detail all requirements and conditions which will be
considered in awarding the contract; and/or
      (3)   Delivery to interested bidders who specifically request an
invitation to bid from the Purchasing Director. The Purchasing Director is
authorized to deliver the information to prospective bidders by any of the
following methods: in person, by mail, by facsimile (fax), or via the internet.

attached to a bid form provided by the purchasing department and shall be
sealed, marked Sealed Bid, and mailed or otherwise delivered to the Purchasing
Director by the time specified in the invitation to bid. Late bids shall not be
considered unless the delay was caused by improper handling by county
employees. All bids shall be accompanied by a statement of noncollusion from
the bidder, in substantially the following form: Bidder certifies under penalty
of law that bidder has not colluded with any other person in the submission of
this bid to the County of Newberry.
   (D)   Bid surety. Bid surety shall be required as specified in §§

this requirement. The bid bond is returned to unsuccessful bidders shortly
after bids are opened and the successful bidder determined. The bid bond of the
successful bidder is returned to that bidder when the bidder timely enters into
the contract with the county and when any required performance and payment
bonds are submitted to and accepted by the county.
   (E)   Opening of bids. All bids shall be opened publicly and tabulated. The
tabulation shall be available for public inspection during normal business
hours for at least 30 days after the opening of bids.
   (F)   Procedure in case of identical low bids. Before opening of bids, the
Purchasing Director shall review with bidders the method of awarding contracts
if the lowest responsible bids are identical in material detail. The method
shall be to award the bid giving first priority to a bidder with a place of
business in Newberry County, and if such is not determinative, then based on
the factors set forth in §
34.49(B). If a decision cannot be made on this basis, the County Administrator
may direct the Purchasing Director to re-advertise for bids in such situations,
or, if practicable, to split the contract between the bidders submitting
identical low bids.
   (G)   Forfeiture of bid surety. If the successful bidder does not enter into
a contract within 10 days after mailing of notice of award of contract, then as
liquidated damages, he or she shall forfeit his or her bid bond or other surety
which accompanied his or her bid, unless the county is responsible for the
delay. He or she shall also be held liable for any cost in excess of his or her
bid surety which the county incurs in awarding the bid to the next lowest
bidder or in otherwise purchasing the goods or services elsewhere. All
invitations to bid and bid forms will include this language. In such an event,
the bid may then be awarded to the next lowest, responsible bidder.
   (H)   Protested solicitations and awards.
      (1)   Right to protest. With regard to any goods or services valued at
over $15,000 procured through the sealed bid method only, any actual or
prospective bidder, offerer, contractor, or subcontractor who is aggrieved in
connection with the solicitation or award of a contract may protest to the
Purchasing Director. The protest, setting forth the grievance, shall be
submitted in writing within 10 days after the aggrieved persons know or should
have known of the facts giving rise thereto.
      (2)   Authority to resolve protests. The Purchasing Director shall have
authority, with the advice and consent of the County Administrator or designee,
to attempt to settle and resolve a protest of an aggrieved bidder, offerer,
contractor, or subcontractor, actual or prospective, concerning the
solicitation or award of a contract without cost to the county. This authority
shall be utilized in a manner consistent with regulations or laws governing the
procurement of supplies, services, and construction for the county.
      (3)   Decision. If the protest is not resolved by mutual agreement, the
Purchasing Director shall promptly issue a decision in writing within 5 working
days. The decision shall state the reasons for the action taken.
      (4)   Notice of decision. A copy of this decision under division (H)(3)
above shall be mailed or otherwise furnished immediately to the protestant and
any other party intervening.
      (5)   Finality of decision. A decision under division (H)(3) above shall
be final and conclusive, or unless any person adversely affected by the
decision requests a review, in writing, setting forth the grievance to the
County Administrator, or unless the County Administrator decides to review the
decision for his or her own reasons. If not resolved by the County
Administrator within 10 working days, the protestant may, within 15 working
days from date of the adverse decision is issued, request a review by the
County Council. County Council, as soon thereafter as practicable, may review
the file and make its decision based solely on the review or it may review the
matter de novo, and hold a hearing to review the file and/or to receive the
testimony of witnesses, in its sole discretion. The burden of proof in the
review by County Council is on the protestant. Council shall determine the
particular procedures it wishes to follow in making the review. The decision of
the Council on all matters shall be final.
      (6)   Request for review.  The request for a review shall not stay the
purchase or contract unless the County Administrator or the County Council
determines that there is good cause for the stay, or that the stay is advisable
based on legal considerations.

§ 34.37 COMPETITIVE SEALED PROPOSALS.
   (A)   Conditions for use. When the Purchasing Director recommends to the
County Administrator or his or her designee and it is determined by the County
Administrator or his or her designee that the use of competitive sealed bidding
is not practicable or advantageous to the county, competitive sealed proposals
may be used.
   (B)   Proposal opening. Proposals shall be opened and only the names of the
companies disclosed. Contents of competing offerers shall not be disclosed
during the process of negotiation. Proposals shall be open for public
inspection after award of the contract. Confidential proprietary material
marked as such in the proposal shall not be disclosed.
   (C)   Discussion with responsible offerers. Discussions may be conducted for
the purpose of clarification and a full understanding of the requirements.
Offerers shall be accorded fair and equal treatment.
   (D)   Evaluation factors. The request for proposal shall state the
evaluation factors in order of importance.
   (E)   Award.
      (1)   The award shall be made to the offerer whose proposal is determined
to be the most advantageous to the county, taking into consideration the
evaluation factors set forth in the proposal.

made.

§ 34.38 REQUEST FOR QUALIFICATIONS; PROFESSIONAL SERVICES; PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT
AND SELECTION PROCESS.
   (A)   Public announcement. It is the policy of the county to announce
publicly all requirements for professional services and to negotiate the
contracts on the basis of demonstrated competence and qualifications at fair
and reasonable prices. In the procurement of professional services such as
architect, engineer, land-surveying services, and other similar professional
services, the Purchasing Director may request firms to submit a statement of
qualifications and performance data, or other information relating to the
training, competence, and experience of the provider of the services.
   (B)   Selection process. A selection committee composed of 3 members,
including the Purchasing Director, the Administrator, or designee, and the head
of a using agency in need of the architect-engineer or land-surveying services,
or other professional services shall conduct discussions with 3 or more firms,
whenever possible, regarding the proposed contract and the relative utility of
alternative methods of approach for furnishing the required services and shall
select from among them no less than 2 of the firms deemed most qualified to
provide the required services. The selection shall be made in order of
preference, based on criteria established and published by the selection
committee. Provided, however, in the event that the County of Newberry has an
ongoing professional relationship with a provider of those services required by
the county, the County Administrator, in his or her discretion, may negotiate
with the provider for the provision of the required services. Provided further,
the County Administrator may select the provider of professional services in
any event if the anticipated cost is $25,000 or less and not included with the
current budget year, or $50,000 or less if the amount is included in the
current budget year. For services in excess of $25,000 when not included with
the current budget year, or $50,000 or less if included in the current budget
year, the County Council shall select the provider of the services.
   (C)   Negotiation. Except as provided in division (B) above, the Purchasing
Director shall negotiate a contract with the advice and consent of the
Administrator or his or her designee, with the firm so selected to be the most
qualified for architect-engineer, land surveying, or other professional
services at compensation, which the Purchasing Director determines in writing
to be fair and reasonable to the county. In making this decision, the
Purchasing Director shall take into account the estimated value, the scope, the
complexity, and the professional nature of the services to be rendered. Should
the Purchasing Director be unable to negotiate a satisfactory contract with the
firm considered to be the most qualified at a price the Purchasing Director
determines to be fair and reasonable to the county, negotiations with that firm
shall be formally terminated. The Purchasing Director shall then undertake
negotiations with other firms as selected by the committee in the order
selected until an agreement is reached. At the completion of negotiations, a
tabulation of fees proposed by the organizations solicited will be prepared and
mailed or delivered to all interested parties.
   (D)   Competitive bidding. If the County Administrator determines that
competitive bidding should be used in the selection of the professional
services, the process may be used in lieu of the procedures set forth herein,
and in accordance with the bidding procedures set forth elsewhere in this
chapter.

   For the purpose of determining the low vendor, the Purchasing Director shall
grant local vendors (those vendors maintaining a place of business in Newberry
County) a 2% preference on the amount of their quotation or bid up to a maximum
total of $50,000. The preference would not apply to purchases totaling less
than $50. Preferences do not apply to either prime or subcontractors as relates
to construction contracts nor any item that may be purchased on state
contracts. Exception: road paving contracts, a 2% preference on the amount of
their quotation or bid up to a maximum total of $800,000. Provided, however,
that in the event the procurement is to be made pursuant to state or federal
guidelines which prohibit or restrict local preference, then in the
circumstances there shall be no local preference.

County Administrator or his or her designee shall be empowered to authorize the
Coordinator to secure by open market procedure as herein set forth, at the
lowest obtainable price, any supplies or contractual services regardless of the
amount of the expenditure.
      (2)   Recorded explanation. A full report of the circumstances of an
emergency purchase shall be filed by the Coordinator with the County
Administrator or designee.
   (B)   By head of department. In case of actual emergency, the head of any
using department or agency may purchase directly any supplies and services
whose immediate procurement is essential to prevent delays in the work of the
using agency which may vitally affect the life, health, safety, or welfare of
citizens.
      (1)   Recorded explanation. The head of the department or agency shall
send to the Purchasing Director a requisition and a copy of the delivery record
together with a full written report of the circumstances of the emergency. The
report shall be filed with the County Administrator or designee as provided in
division (A)(2) above.
      (2)   Emergency procedure. The County Council may prescribe by rules and
regulations any additional procedures under which emergency purchases by heads
of using agencies may be made.

§ 34.43 STATE AND FEDERAL PURCHASING, AND OTHER COOPERATIVE PURCHASING.
   (A)   As an alternative to the procedures described in this section, the
Purchasing Director may purchase any supplies, materials, equipment, or
contractual services through the State Purchasing Office of the Division of
General Services, GSA, or the Houston Galveston Area Council (H-GAC)
cooperative purchasing program; provided, however, that any such purchases
estimated to cost in excess of $5,000 up to $25,000 in the current budget year,
or not exceeding $50,000 if budgeted in the current budget year, shall be
approved by the County Administrator or his or her designee, and any such
purchase estimated to cost in the aggregate in excess of $25,000 (unbudgeted)
or $50,000 (budgeted) in the current budget year shall be approved by County
Council. Provided, however, items for which a specific appropriation has been
made are deemed to be approved by County Council, and the County Administrator
is authorized to purchase same from State Purchasing GSA, or H-GAC. Multiple
vehicle purchases are to be considered in the aggregate amount of all the
vehicles so purchased by a using agency.
   (B)   The Sheriff may be authorized under programs administered by the
Federal Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and other
programs to purchase certain items from programs approved or administered by
the Federal Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, and/or
the GSA, or perhaps through other federal agencies, at preferential federal
government contract prices, and in the event the Sheriff is authorized to make
the purchases, but shall first obtain a purchase order, purchase order number,
or direct payment number, as is necessary, from the Purchasing Director and the
check for the purchase will be issued through the office of the county's
Finance Director, so that the county will have current and accurate records of
the expenditures.
   (C)   Likewise, the Emergency Preparedness Director or other county agencies
may be eligible to purchase items from programs administered by the GSA or
other federal agency, H-GAC, and in the event, if the price is advantageous to
the county, the purchase may be made, subject to approval by the County
Administrator or his or her designee, provided, however, that the purchasing
county agency shall first obtain a purchase order, purchase order number, or
direct payment number, as is necessary, from the Purchasing Director and the
check for the purchase will be issued through the office of the county’s
Finance Director, so that the county will have current and accurate Purchasing
Director records of the expenditures.

§ 34.44 PURCHASE NEGOTIATIONS.
   (A)   Generally. When lack of price or product competition renders the
purposes of competitive bidding ineffective, the Purchasing Director may
purchase supplies, materials, equipment, or contractual services through
negotiation with a vendor up to $5,000 on his or her authority, and for amounts
in excess of that, the Purchasing Director shall consult with and obtain the
approval of the County Administrator or his or her designee, provided, however,
for sole source purchased to be purchased with special source funds, the
elected official in charge of the expenditure of those funds shall be
authorized to approve the purchases by the Purchasing Director.
   (B)   When permissible. Purchase by negotiation may be made when 1 of the
following types of conditions exist:
      (1)   Items are obtained from only 1 source, and there are no acceptable
equivalents;
      (2)   Bids are received, but prices are unreasonable;
      (3)   Emergencies exist;
      (4)   A contract already exists on a family of items that must be

published prices being offered;
      (8)   There are reasonable indications of collusive bidding; or
      (9)   Contracts are renewed if provided for in the original bid
invitation.
   (C)   Negotiated purchases. Written records shall be maintained for a period

§ 34.46 PURCHASE ORDER OR DIRECT PAYMENT NUMBER REQUIRED.
   Any purchase made pursuant to this chapter with funds under the control of
the County Treasurer, whether from tax revenues, special source revenues, bond
proceeds, or other sources, shall be recorded in the county financial records
by purchase order number, or direct payment number, with reference to the
quantity and description of each item to be purchased, and the budget account
to which the purchase is to be charged, except those items purchased by
contract or individually by an employee who seeks reimbursement from the Petty

§ 34.47 SALE OR TRANSFER OF SURPLUS COUNTY PROPERTY.
   (A)   Any items of personal or real property belonging to the county, which
are declared by the County Administrator to be obsolete or surplus, may be sold
to the highest responsible bidder by advertising for sealed bids or by public
auction. Surplus property, in the discretion of the Administrator, may be
transferred to other county agencies or transferred to or loaned to entities
supported by county funds; in addition, at the discretion of the County
Administrator, surplus property may also be traded in or exchanged for other
property needed by the county. In connection with the sale of surplus property,
the Purchasing Director shall ensure that the procedures described in this
section are followed, according to the estimated dollar salvage value of the
goods to be sold. Vehicle or heavy equipment trade-ins must be approved by
County Council, or its designee.
(Ord. 01-02-04, passed 1-7-2004)
   (B)   The county has determined that the value of used computer equipment
after 3 or more years of use is generally less than $100, and there is a risk
that confidential county data will be released to the public if computers are
sold in the same manner as other surplus county property. If the County
Administrator determines that a computer, and its peripherals has reached the
end of its useful life to the county and is surplus property, and he or she
determines that it has an anticipated surplus sale value of $100 or less, then
the County Administrator may authorize the department heads or elected
officials to let their employees who used that computer equipment to purchase
it, for personal use only, for the value determined, provided that the employee
assumes the responsibility for removing all county data from the computer
before removing from the county and signs an agreement that the computer
equipment will not be resold as all or further transferred outside of his or
her immediate family.
   (C)   The County Administrator is authorized to investigate the advantages
to the county of selling any of its surplus equipment and property (personal
and real) via an appropriately competitive internet sales mechanism, and he or
she is authorized to enter into preliminary contracts for the sale of select
surplus property, so that he or she can investigate the efficacy of such
methods of selling surplus property, including surplus heavy equipment, and
report on same to Council. If such methods prove to be advantageous to the
county, then further sales via the internet may be authorized by Council.

§ 34.48 PURCHASING FILES.
   (A)   Generally. The Purchasing Director shall develop and maintain a list
of vendors who offer supplies, materials, equipment, or contractual services
normally required by county agencies. The Purchasing Director shall record on
the bidders list any significant history of trade with a vendor, whether
favorable or unfavorable, for the purpose of determining whether a given vendor
is a responsible bidder. The status of a given vendor may be reviewed from time
to time by the Purchasing Director.

time to time a file of catalogues for supplies, materials, and equipment
normally required by county agencies.

maintain a file reflecting specifications for all standard supplies, materials,
and equipment normally used by county agencies. The specifications shall be the
sole criteria of acceptability for all items of the types for which they are
maintained. Using agencies should not specify additional characteristics on
standard items unless the additional specifications (e.g., brand, specific
color, unusual size, and the like) are justified to the satisfaction of the
Purchasing Director, provided, however, that the Purchasing Director is not
authorized to interfere with the performance of the duties of an elected
official in the administration of these specifications in the purchasing of
equipment, materials, services, and supplies. The Purchasing Director should
develop standard nomenclature for the purpose of communication with using
agencies concerning their requirements.

subdivided to avoid the requirements of this chapter, provided, however, that
individual items may be purchased from different bidders if:
      (1)   The requirements of this chapter are followed with respect to the
entire estimated cost of all items for which bids are invited; and
      (2)   The practice is consistent with the terms of the notice inviting
bids.
   (B)   Award to other than low bidder. It is the policy of Newberry County to
award all contracts or purchases to the lowest responsive, responsible bidder,
unless a combination of the following factors outweighs the single factor of
cost, in which event justification of the selection will be required to be made
to, and approval received from, the County Administrator or his or her
designee:
       (1)   The ability of the bidder to perform the contract or provide the

interference;
      (2)   The quality, availability, and adaptability of the goods or
services for the use of the subject of the contract;

or picked up or the service is to be rendered; and
      (7)   The best interests of the citizens of the county.
   (C)   Price escalation clauses. The awarding authority may enter into
contracts containing price escalation clauses, provided that the escalations
may reasonably be expected not to raise the average price of goods or services
higher than prices offered by other bidders, and further provided that the
contracts contain a nonappropriation clause.
   (D)   Cancellation of contract. The awarding authority shall have the right
to cancel any purchase or contract when the vendor is found to have violated or
attempted to violate the provisions of this chapter or in any of the following
instances:
      (1)   If the vendor fails to make delivery within the time specified in
the contract;
      (2)   If the vendor fails to provide service when service is part of the
contract;
      (3)   If any supplies, materials, or equipment delivered under the
contract are rejected and are not promptly replaced by the vendor (if there are
repeated rejections, the contract may be cancelled, even though the vendor
agrees to replace the items promptly);
      (4)   If the vendor agrees to cancellation; or
      (5)   If the contract is obtained by fraud, collusion, conspiracy, or by
any method which is in conflict with statutory or constitutional provisions of
the state.

§ 34.50 PERSONAL INTERESTS.
   (A)   Conflicts of interest. Any purchase or contract within the purview of
this chapter in which the Purchasing Director or any officer or employee of the
county is financially interested, directly or indirectly, or which is, in any
other manner, in conflict with state or local ethics laws, as they may be
amended from time to time, shall be void if the other party knew or should have
known of the interest or conflict; provided, however, that, before the
execution of a purchase or contract, the County Administrator shall have the
authority to waive compliance with this section when he or she finds such
interest to be so remote or indirect as to be inconsequential and not in
violation of law.
      (1)   No employee or elected official of the county may bid on a county
contract if that individual is authorized to exercise decision making authority
or responsibility with regard to that contract for the county, and any such
person is declared to have a conflict of interest;
      (2)   No County Council member may bid on, or be a subcontractor on, any
county contract;
      (3)   It is further declared that any person, corporation or other legal
entity which is involved in active or threatened litigation with the county, or
any of its officials or agencies, over a contractual or other matter (other
than the contesting of a tax assessment or contesting a minor traffic violation
or minor code violation), has a conflict of interest for purposes of the
Competitive Purchasing procedures set forth in Chapter 34 of the Newberry
County Code of Ordinances; and
      (4)   That any such person, corporation or other legal entity with a
conflict of interest is debarred from bidding on county proposals for the
acquisition of goods or services until such litigation or threat of litigation
is finally resolved.
   (B)   Gratuities.
      (1)   Acceptance prohibited. The acceptance of any gratuity in the form
of cash, merchandise, or any other thing of value by an employee of the county
from any person, firm, or corporation to which any purchase or contract is or
might be awarded, in violation of state ethics laws, shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter and may be cause for removal or other disciplinary
action. State and local ethics laws govern fully in this regard.
      (2)   Other prohibited. The offer of any gratuity in violation of state
ethics laws by any actual or prospective vendor or contractor shall be cause
for canceling any contract involved, for declaring the vendor or contractor an
irresponsible bidder or removal of the vendor from the vendor files and bidders
list.

PERFORMANCE, PAYMENT, AND BID BONDS; MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS
§ 34.65 PERFORMANCE, PAYMENT, AND BID BONDS, AND PROOF OR INSURANCE COVERAGE.
   (A)   Performance bonds. The awarding authority shall require at least a
100% performance bond issued by a commercial surety company for every
construction contract expected to cost $100,000 or over. Any commercial surety
company issuing a performance bond shall have an A minimum rating of
performance as stated in the most current publication of Best Key Rating Guide,
Property Liability. For any construction contract estimated to cost less than
$100,000, the awarding authority may, in its discretion, require a performance
bond in a form satisfactory to it.
   (B)   Payment bonds. Whenever the awarding authority, acting in the name of
Newberry County or through any of its elected officials, departments, or
agencies, awards or enters into a contract for the improvement of real property
for a sum in excess of $50,000, a labor and material bond shall be supplied by
the contractor for the full amount of the contract, with the bond secured by
cash or by a commercial surety with an A minimum rating of performance as
stated in the most current publication of Best Key Rating Guide, Property
Liability. If a contract is less than $100,000, the awarding authority may
permit the use of a B+ rated bond, if it justifies the use in writing. Newberry
County may not require that the labor and material bond be furnished through a
particular surety company or through a particular agent or broker.
   (C)   Bid bonds. For purchases in excess of $25,000 awarded pursuant to the
procedures set forth in
§§ 34.36,
34.37, or
34.44, and for any construction contracts for the improvement of real property,
the bid or proposal shall be accompanied by a bid bond in the form of a
cashier's check in the amount of 5% of the contract amount. The disposition of
the bid bonds for purchases in excess of $25,000 will be as set forth in
§ 34.36. In the case of construction contracts, the bid bonds will be returned
to the unsuccessful bidders shortly after bids are opened and the successful
bidder determined. The bid bond of the successful bidder will be returned to
that bidder when the bidder timely enters into the contract with the county and
when any required performance and payment bonds are submitted to and accepted
by the county. Bid bonds are forfeited to the county as liquidated damages when
the entity to whom the contract is awarded fails to enter into the contract or
otherwise fails to commence performance of its contractual obligations within
the times required by its bid or in the bid specifications, or in the proposal
submitted and accepted, or in the negotiated agreement, as the case may be.
   (D)   Form of cash surety. Any requirement for the submission of cash or a
cashier's check in connection with providing of a bid bond or other surety
under this chapter may be satisfied by the submission of a bank check payable
to the County of Newberry issued by a commercial bank from 1 of its offices in
South Carolina in a form satisfactory to the county, or by the deposit of cash
in the required amount, or by an unconditional letter of credit in favor of
Newberry County issued by a commercial bank from 1 of its offices in South
Carolina in a form satisfactory to the county.
   (E)   The County Administrator and/or the Purchasing Director are authorized
and directed to obtain from a successful bidder, or a from a submitter of a
proposal for services who is to be awarded a contract, proof of current Workers
Compensation coverage and of general liability or automobile liability or other
insurance coverage, as may be required by the bid specifications or by the
request for proposals, before issuing a Notice to Proceed or finally awarding

   (A)   Generally. All vending machines, food service operations, or other
concessions to be placed and operated in any building or on any property owned

Council, no vending machine, pay telephone, or other concession device shall be

CONCLUDING PROVISIONS
§ 34.85 COUNTY ADMINISTRATOR.
   Nothing contained in this chapter shall diminish the statutory authority of
the County Administrator, who shall retain ultimate responsibility for the
implementation of the policies of County Council as expressed in this chapter.
The County Administrator shall supervise and direct the Purchasing Director in
the performance of his or her duties, and he or she may elect to perform any of
the duties assigned to the Purchasing Director herein, if he or she deems it to
be in the best interests of Newberry County.
(Ord. 01-02-04, passed 1-7-2004; Am. Ord. 10-42-06, passed 11-15-2006)
§ 34.86 NONAPPROPRIATION CLAUSES.
   The county recognizes that the actions of a Council in a current budget year
cannot bind a future Council to a particular course of action in a future
budget year, except in certain specific instances, such as the issuance of
general obligation indebtedness. For that reason, each contract entered into by
the county that requires payment to be made in a future budget year must
contain a nonappropriation clause. As defined hereinbefore, such a clause
essentially provides that if a future Council fails to appropriate sufficient
funds to meet a contractual obligation for that future budget year, the
contract can be terminated without penalty to the county, and without limiting
the county's ability to appropriate other funds for the provision of similar
goods or services in that future budget year or years. Contracts that require
payment in the current budget year for delivery of a product or service in a
future budget year are not subject to this provision.
(Ord. 01-02-04, passed 1-7-2004)
§ 34.87 RESTORING BIDDER TO BIDDERS LIST.
   In the event any bidder is determined to be an irresponsible bidder or is
otherwise debarred from bidding on goods, services, or equipment needed by the
county, then after the passage of at least 6 months from the final action
disqualifying the bidder from bidding on, or otherwise providing, goods,
services, or equipment to the county, the person or firm may petition the
County Administrator to be restored to the bidders list for goods, services, or
equipment, and the Administrator may require the bidder to demonstrate
financial responsibility or ability to comply with all county bidding and
procurement requirements for those items the bidder wishes to bid for, as a
condition to restoring the bidder to the bidders list, and the Administrator's
decision shall be issued in writing and shall be final.
(Ord. 01-02-04, passed 1-7-2004)
§ 34.88 INCORPORATION OF STATE LAW.
   Any provision of state law which is required to apply to county procurement
procedures shall be deemed to be incorporated herein by reference, unless state
law makes the adoption of the provision voluntary or discretionary, or mandates
further action by Council for implementation.

otherwise expressly exempt from paying solid waste disposal fees pursuant to
this Code of Ordinances, shall pay at the Transfer Station a per ton solid
waste disposal, or tipping, fee established by County Council in its annual
fiscal year budget ordinance for general appropriations. A new fee may be
established by County Council either by an amendment to the annual budget
ordinance after its enactment for a fiscal year, or by resolution during the
fiscal year. Should County Council fail to establish a new tonnage fee in this
manner, the per ton fee for the prior fiscal year shall continue. Every
business engaged in making, fabricating, or changing things into new forms for
use or in refining, rectifying, or combining different materials for use shall
be held to be a manufacturer; and
   (B)   Each truck other than private vehicles (cars/pickups) going across the
scales at the transfer station will have a county disposal sticker which the
county will sell for $5. If a vehicle has no sticker, it will be a cash
transaction at the scales. Individuals who bring cars/pickups with solid waste
will pay a minimum charge of $2 cash or by weight if over 100 pounds; however,
they will pay nothing if they bring their tax receipt showing that they paid
the solid waste fee. There is no charge for white goods, tires, or oil
(commercial vendors see tire policy). Businesses and nonprofit organizations
that have annual contracts with commercial solid waste removal services will
not have to pay any user fees and may obtain a waiver or refund of the fees by
providing a copy of the annual contract to the County Auditor, except for
housing.

NOISE
§ 90.01 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of
§§ 90.01 et seq., the following definitions shall apply unless the context

also considered to be NOISE-SENSITIVE AREAS.
(Ord. 02-09-05, passed 2-16-2005)
§ 90.02 INTENT.
   It is the intent of Newberry County Council to replace the provision of the
existing county noise control ordinance, Ordinance No. 197, with the provisions
of
§§ 90.01 et seq., and to provide reasonable and practicable standards for the
control of noise in the unincorporated areas of Newberry County, and the
penalties for violations of
§§ 90.01 et seq. Any duly commissioned law enforcement officer or duly
authorized Code Enforcement Officer may make a charge for a violation of
§§ 90.01 et seq., if he or she has probable cause to do so, regardless of
whether or not a complaint from a citizen or resident has been made.
(Ord. 02-09-05, passed 2-16-2005)
§ 90.03 VIOLATIONS DECLARED NUISANCES.
   Any unreasonably loud, disturbing, irritating, or unnecessary noise which
causes material distress, discomfort, or injury to a person or persons of
ordinary sensibilities in the immediate vicinity thereof is hereby declared to
be a nuisance and is prohibited; these noises include, but are not limited to,
noises which unreasonably interfere with the ability of a person of ordinary
sensibilities to sleep within his or her own dwelling place. Any noise of a
character, intensity, and continued duration which substantially interferes
with the comfortable enjoyment of private dwellings by persons of ordinary
sensibilities is hereby declared to be a nuisance. In ameliorating the
nuisance, residents of nearby dwellings who suffer from the nuisance are first
encouraged to request of the party creating the nuisance, to the extent that
prudence and safety allows, that the nuisance be halted, however it is not a
prerequisite for citing the offender for a violation of
§§ 90.01 et seq.
(Ord. 02-09-05, passed 2-16-2005) Penalty, see
§ 90.99
§ 90.04 EXCESSIVE NOISE; GENERALLY.

limited to, noises made by motor vehicles, mechanical devices, electrical
devices, electronic devices, human voice, musical instruments, animals, and all
activities accessory to residential living.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to make or continue or cause to be
made or continued any loud, irritating, or unseemly noise, or series of noises,
which unreasonably causes discomfort or annoyance to any person of ordinary
sensibilities in any unincorporated nonresidential area of Newberry County.
   (C)   In determining whether an occurrence constitutes a violation under
§§ 90.01 et seq., a court or other authority should consider, in addition to
all other logically relevant factors, the following:
      (1)   The intensity, tone, and other characteristics of the noise;
      (2)   The general characteristics of the area in which the noise is
occurring, including the uses for which the property is zoned by Newberry
County;
      (3)   The time of day or night that the noise is occurring;
      (4)   The reasonable expectation of quiet that could be expected by
individuals on public or private property surrounding the area in which the
noise is occurring;
      (5)   Any previous request by neighbors and/or law enforcement officers
for the abatement of the noise;
      (6)   In the case of all motorized vehicles, including, without
limitation, off-road vehicles, motorcycles, and all watercraft, whether or not
the vehicles are equipped with mufflers and/or the suppression devices which
keep exhaust noises down to a level equal to or below that which the
manufacturers of the vehicles provided as original equipment; and
      (7)   Also in the case of motor vehicles, whether or not the noise
emanating from the vehicles has the volume as to cause the driver of the
vehicle not to hear emergency sirens or warning horns from a safe distance.

accompanied by a surety in the form of a commercial bond or letter of credit or
cash deposit in the amount specified in §
91.20(B)(7), or in such greater amount determined by the county to be
sufficient to cover any estimated cost of repairs for a period of 2 years from
the date of acceptance (“warranty period”).
         (b)   In the event that the road, as constructed, does not continue to
meet the minimum standards approved for such road during the entire 2-year
dedication period, the county will be entitled to pursue its remedies under the
bond or other surety given to the county, and if such are insufficient to bring
the road up to standards, then the county may pursue civil remedies against the
developer, contractor, grantor(s), or other responsible party, and shall be
entitled to collect all of its attorneys’ fees and court costs from such
responsible party in so doing.
         (c)   If the acceptance of the road by the county was procured by
fraudulent act, or if the road cannot be brought into compliance with the funds
available from the surety and from other resources readily obtainable from the
responsible party, then the county may seek a court order authorizing it to
revoke its acceptance of such road and to remove it from the public road
system, in addition to any other remedies it may have pursued or been entitled
to pursue. If such relief is sought, the county shall be entitled to collect
all of its attorneys’ fees and court costs in pursuing such relief, whether or
not it is successful in obtaining such relief.
      (5)   The amount of surety to be provided to repairs required during the
dedication period is as follows:
         (a)   For triple treatment roads, $10,000 per 1/4 mile;

construction methods, or other conditions or circumstances affecting the road,
and the amount of the necessary surety shall be determined by the Director of
Public Works.
         (d)   Any aggrieved person may petition the County Administrator
within 30 days of the determination adverse to the person so aggrieved by the
Director of Public Works for a review of the amount and quality of the surety
required. The County Administrator’s determination is final.
   (C)   Seeding.

§ 91.29 POLICY STATEMENTS.
   (A)   The final acceptance of a road by the county does not imply the road
will be widened or stabilized at any time. Types of road accepted by the county
shall be:
      (1)   Triple treatment; and
      (2)   Asphalt.
   (B)   No paving will be allowed on wet surfaces or when the temperature is
below 45°F or shade temperature is 40°F. Paving is not permitted during the
months of December, January, and February.
   (C)   Roads in existing subdivisions which have already been paved to county
standards, but which have less than the required width of right-of-way, may be
accepted into the county road system, upon a further determination by County
Council that special circumstances exist which justify the acceptance of the
road right-of-way, and that the customary right-of- way width is not readily
available for acquisition.
   (D)   The developer of a subdivision may be required to sell 50% of the
parcels of a subdivided tract before the county will accept the roads therein,
but this requirement may be waived by Newberry County Council for good cause
shown. The purpose of this provision is to keep the county from accepting
financial responsibility for new roads which may be damaged by the heavy truck
traffic generally associated with the development of property and construction
of new homes or businesses, and which roads may need extensive, costly repairs
after being exposed to such traffic.
   (E)   Concerning roads in approved subdivisions, in the event there is any
material difference between the requirements of this chapter and the chapter
providing standards for road acceptance and construction in subdivisions, the
provisions of the subdivision regulations shall govern. The provisions of this
chapter shall govern in all other situations.

PETITIONING PROCEDURES FOR ROAD PAVING
§ 91.50 COUNTY ROADS ONLY.
   The road for which paving is requested must be a road already included in
the county's road maintenance system, as determined by County Public Works.
(Ord. 03-05-09, passed 4-5-2009)
§ 91.51 NECESSARY RIGHT-OF-WAY.
   (A)   The property owner initiating a paving request is responsible for
securing rights-of-way/ easements from all affected property owners. County
staff’s role in the right-of-way/easement acquisition process is limited to the
following items:
      (1)   Providing petitioners with official petition documents;
      (2)   Generating property owner name and address information (as
available through the County Tax Assessor's property records);
      (3)   Staking approximate right-of-way for initial review by affected
property owners;
      (4)   Commissioning property surveys to finalize right-of-way dimensions
and location; and
      (5)   Assisting in the preparation/execution of required right-of-way/
easement documents.
   (B)   The granting of right-of-way by property owners for county road paving
projects is voluntary, and requires unanimous agreement among the affected
property owners (a mere majority will not suffice).
      (1)   The county will condemn easements/ rights-of-way only to address
safety issues identified by Public Works.
      (2)   In such cases, the county will condemn only the minimum property
necessary to address the safety issues, not enough to accommodate a wholesale
improvement of the roadway.
(Ord. 03-05-09, passed 4-5-2009)
§ 91.52 APPLICATION PROCESS.
   (A)   Submission of request by property owner to county staff.
      (1)   Any affected property owner, i.e., anyone who owns property
adjoining an unpaved county road, may obtain from the County Administrator's
office a Request for Road Paving Consideration form (“request form").
      (2)   Once completed by the petitioning property owner, this form is
forwarded to the Public Works Director, who verifies that the road is a county
road and determines whether the requested road improvements require a right-of-
way of 40 feet (for cul-de-sacs), 50 feet (for through roads), or more, based
on topography, sight lines, road layout, safety conditions, and other criteria.
      (3)   Outfall ditches and drainage easements may also be required.
      (4)   The Public Works Director amends the request form with this
information and arranges for the staking of the approximate right-of-way
dimensions for initial review by affected property owners.
   (B)   Return of request form by county staff to property owner. 
      (1)   Staff returns the request form, as amended under division (A)(4)
immediately above, to the petitioning property owner.
      (2)   Staff supplies the petitioning property owner with a list of all
affected property owners and their contact information, consisting only of
mailing addresses, as shown in public records of the County Tax Assessor, and
an official petition form (Petition of Intent to Grant Right of Way form) to be
used for indicating the intent of affected property owners to grant the
necessary rights-of-way/easements for the project.
   (C)   Securing required signatures.
      (1)   The petitioning property owner is responsible for establishing the
unanimous intent of all affected property owners to grant the required right-
of-way (as staked by Public Works for initial review) by having them properly
sign the Petition of Intent to Grant Right of Way form.
      (2)   No county road will be paved or otherwise significantly improved
(other than regular scraping and the amending of an existing gravel base, where
needed) unless the Petition of Intent to Grant Right of Way is signed by all
affected property owners and the subsequent rights-of-way/easements are
obtained and recorded.
      (3)   There must be only one original petition circulated for signatures,
which must be bound or stapled.
      (4)   In order to guard against the making of copies, each page attached
shall show “Page    of    " (where the first blank represents the number of the
current page; the second, the total number of pages in the petition).
      (5)   Required signatures may only be from affected property owners and
must include all owners of each affected parcel, no matter how slight the
owner's interest, as shown on the deed recorded at the office of the Clerk of
Court for Newberry County.
   (D)   Legal right-of-way/easement documentation.
      (1)   The County Attorney prepares the easement forms to be properly
executed by affected property owners granting the necessary rights-of-way/
easements.
      (2)   The petitioning property owner is responsible for coordinating/
scheduling this work with the County Attorney.
      (3)   Once unanimous consent granting all necessary rights-of-way/
easements is executed and recorded, the easement/right-of-way documents and the
county-commissioned survey/plat of the road are filed in the office of the
Clerk of Court for Newberry County.
      (4)   The Public Works Director, County Attorney, and County
Administrator then certify to the CTC (County Transportation Committee) and to
County Council that the appropriate right-of-way is established.
      (5)   If the petition omits any signature of any affected property owner,
it is returned to the petitioning property owner for completion.
(Ord. 03-05-09, passed 4-5-2009)
§ 91.53 CONSIDERATION PROCESS.
   (A)   The County Transportation Committee (“CTC”) maintains a list
prioritizing the paving of those roads for which the necessary rights-of-way/
easements have been acquired.
      (1)   Prioritization is based on a point system involving numerous
criteria.
      (2)   Each road for which the required rights-of-way/easements are
verified receives a total number of points based on these criteria.
      (3)   Public Works contacts the petitioning property owner once his or
her road is officially assigned these points by the CTC.
   (B)   The petitioning property owner is provided a date-stamped list of
roads meeting the right-of-way prerequisite, ranked according to the CTC's
ranking/ prioritization system.
      (1)   This list will include, in ranked order, the county road that the
petitioning property owner has requested be paved.
      (2)   At all times, the CTC's ranking/ prioritization document will
remain a public document.
(Ord. 03-05-09, passed 4-5-2009)
§ 91.54 NO GUARANTEE OF PAVING.
   Neither the CTC nor Council guarantees the paving of a road for which the
required rights-of-way/ easements have been successfully obtained and recorded.
The funding appropriated for the paving of county roads is limited, and it is
expended based on objectively-determined priorities and criteria of the CTC.
Commonly, there are more proposed projects than there are resources to fund
them. It is certain, however, that no county road will be paved unless the
required rights-of-way/easements are properly obtained and recorded.
(Ord. 03-05-09, passed 4-5-2009)
§ 91.55 METHOD OF PAVING.
   The type of paving surface and specification used in paving any county road
with CTC-appropriated funding is entirely at the discretion of the CTC, based
upon the recommendations of the CTC's engineer.

   It is hereby found and declared by the Newberry County Council, the
governing body of Newberry County, South Carolina, as follows.
   (A)   The storage, handling, and dispensing of hazardous substances in
Newberry County has the potential for creating a dangerous situation that may
adversely affect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the
county.
   (B)   There is the need to utilize and take advantage of the existing
database concerning the location and use of hazardous substances in Newberry

   (A)   Euthanization. Newberry County Animal Care and Control is authorized
to humanely euthanize a stray animal before the end of the 5-day holding period
if health conditions exist which cause the animal to needlessly suffer. The
same applies if the temperament of the animal makes it unsafe to house because
of the hazard posed to employees and visitors at Newberry County Animal Care
and Control.
   (B)   Adoption. If the animal is generally healthy and has a good
disposition, at the end of the 5-day holding period it may be deemed to be
abandoned and may be placed for adoption into a new home, provided, however,

any time before an adoption is final. If not adopted in a reasonable time, the
animal may be humanely euthanized.

agreement as promulgated by Newberry County Animal Care and Control.

unwanted animals to the animal shelter during the hours of 10:00 a.m. through
4:00 p.m., Monday through Friday. They will be required to sign a custody
surrender form. There will be no charge for in-county residents to dispose of
their unwanted animals by this means. If, after signing the agreement
surrendering their pet, the owner changes his or her mind and wants the animal
back, the former owner will be required to adopt the animal back for a fee of
$85, thus ensuring that the animal will be properly vaccinated and spayed or
neutered before being released from the animal shelter.

§ 96.096 REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO DANGEROUS ANIMALS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person who owns or cares for a dangerous
animal to allow the animal to remain unconfined on the premises. Confined shall
mean secured indoors or in an outdoor secure fence or pen. A pen will be
considered secure if the pen or run area are locked and the pen is clearly
marked as containing a dangerous animal. It must be designed to prevent the
entry of the public as well as to prevent the escape of the animal (S.C. Code §
47-3-720).
   (B)   The pen must have walls at least 6 feet high and a secure top. The
corners of the pen must be embedded in concrete or cement a minimum of 6 inches
deep.
   (C)   An animal considered dangerous is not permitted to leave the premises
unless safely restrained (S.C. Code § 47-3-730).
   (D)   It is unlawful to harbor an animal for fighting or attacking humans or
domestic animals. This means for the purpose of fighting or train, torment,
badger, bait, or use an animal for the purpose of causing or encouraging the
animal to unprovoked attacks (S.C. Code § 47-3-740(A)).
   (E)   It is unlawful to possess a dangerous animal with the intent to sell,
offer for sale, breed, buy, or attempt to buy an known dangerous animal,
however, this section does not apply to person who is licensed to possess and
breed such an animal under the classifications specified and regulated by the
United States Department of Agriculture under the Animal Welfare Act as
codified in Title 7 of the United States Code. (S.C. Code § 47-3-740(B)).
   (F)   In the case the Newberry County Animal Care and Control or Newberry
County Sheriff's Office has probable cause to believe that a dangerous animal
is being harbored or cared for, the court may order the animal seized and
impounded (S.C. Code § 47-3-750).
   (G)   A person who owns a dangerous animal must meet the S.C. Code § 47-3-
760, stating that the animal must be registered with the Newberry County

issued as a part of the registration process, and the owner must have a minimum
$50,000 liability insurance policy or surety bond in the case that the animal
inflicted injuries on someone.
   (H)   If a court deems the animal dangerous, it may be impounded giving the
owner time to comply with the Newberry County and State of South Carolina
dangerous animal regulations. If the owner does not comply, the court may order
the animal taken into the custody of Newberry County Animal Care and Control at
which time it may be humanely euthanized.
   (I)   In the case that a dangerous animal is loose in an area,
representatives from Newberry County Animal Care and Control will make
reasonable attempts to catch and restrain the animal to protect the public. If
the animal is unable to be captured (by physical means and trapping), then as a
last resort an order can be sought from the Chief Magistrate or other
Magistrate on duty and upon the execution of an appropriate written order, the
animal may be destroyed as humanely as possible. In this case, an Officer from
Newberry County Sheriff's Office will be assigned to destroy the animal, and
may utilize a weapon issued by Newberry County Animal Care and Control for that
purpose, or a weapon supplied by the Sheriff's Office, and an Animal Control
Officer will accompany the Officer to positively identify the animal, so that

GENERAL REGULATIONS
§ 96.110 SANITATION.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any pet owner to allow the excrement of their
animal(s) to accumulate so that it may be offensive by sight or smell to the
public, or other property owners so that they cannot utilize or enjoy their
property. All owners should dispose of waste in a sanitary matter. If a
complaint is received by Newberry County Animal Care and Control, they will
investigate and the property owner will be warned and given a time frame to
take care of the problem.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any pet owner to allow their pet's excreta to
be discharged and remain on private or public property other than that of the

waste.
   (C)   In the case of excrement remaining on the pet owner's property, it
shall be unlawful for a person to allow their animal's environment to
accumulate an amount of excrement that is detrimental to the health of the
animal or of the public.
(Ord. 10-32-05, passed 10-5-2005)
§ 96.111 DUTY TO INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS AND RIGHT OF ENTRY AND IMPOUNDMENT.
   (A)   If a complaint has been filed with Newberry County Animal Care and
Control or through Newberry County Sheriff's Office regarding the welfare of an
animal(s), or if the agency or the Sheriffs Department has reason to believe
that a violation of this chapter is occurring, or has occurred, the Sheriff's
deputies and/or Animal Control Officers have the right and the duty to
investigate such complaints, and to seek permission from the person in charge
of such premises to enter the portion of the premises where the violation is
believed to exist and investigate the complaint, so long as they do not violate
any law against trespassing. Provided however, that an offense that is in plain
view from a place where an officer has a right to be may be investigated
without the owner's permission, in accordance with state law. Complaints are
not public records and the complainant is not to be revealed except upon court
order.
   (B)   If an illegal condition is believed to exist, but not in plain view,
and if further investigation is required and consent can not be obtained to
come on to the premises to perform the investigation, a search warrant may be
applied for and obtained from a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (C)   Search warrants shall be served by duly commissioned law enforcement
officers, who may be accompanied during any such search by employees of
Newberry County Animal Care and Control. In exigent circumstances, and to the
extent necessary to avoid needlessly endangering the lives and safety of the
public or the officers, law enforcement officers and/or the employees of
Newberry County Animal Care and Control are authorized to enter premises
without express permission and to take such action as may be reasonably
necessary to abate the dangerous condition believed to be then and there
existing.
   (D)   All officers investigating violations of this chapter or any state law
relating to animals or otherwise, or who observe a violation while on other
lawful business, have the full protection of S.C. Code § 47-3-770, as amended,
and are considered to lawfully be on a person's premises if they meet the
provisions of that code section.
   (E)   Any officer investigating the report of an animal biting a human
being, and upon reasonably establishing that an animal inflicted such a bite,
shall have the right to impound the animal which is identified to the officer
as having inflicted the bite, and to place the animal in quarantine for the
period required by state law, or within 5 days, to seek an order from the court
concerning its disposition. The owner, if known, shall be notified of such
impoundment by leaving a written notice on the front door of the dwelling place
on the property of the owner, or by such other method as is customarily
employed to give actual notice to an individual of a taking. Telephonic notice
may be used to supplement written notice of the impoundment.
(Ord. 10-32-05, passed 10-5-2005)
§ 96.112 TRAPS.
   (A)   If an animal is not approachable (whether due to shyness or bad
disposition,) Newberry County Animal Care and Control is authorized to set
traps to attempt to catch the animal so that it may be transported back to the
animal shelter. Any person tampering with traps or releasing problem animals
after they have been caught in a trap is subject to prosecution for violating
this subchapter or for interfering with an officer in the performance of his or
her official duty.
   (B)   Because Newberry County Animal Care and Control does not transport
animals that are determined to be privately owned, the public is offered the
opportunity to lease a trap for a fee of $25. A lease is signed, and the
deposit is held, pending the return of the trap in the same condition that it
was leased in. If the lessee does not return the trap, their deposit will be
retained as liquidated damages, and not refunded.
   (C)   In the case of strays that need to be trapped, Newberry County Animal
Care and Control will take trap requests for strays and nuisance animals and
the traps will be delivered on Mondays as they are available. The property
owners requesting the trap are expected to call in by 9:00 a.m. the following
business day and report activity on their trap. Failure to call in will be
considered inactivity, and the trap will be pulled off the property. Otherwise,
the trap shall remain on the property until Friday, upon which all traps will
be pulled and returned to the shelter.
(Ord. 10-32-05, passed 10-5-2005)
§ 96.113 EUTHANASIA.
   (A)   All animals not adopted (whether surrendered as a stray or as an owned
animal) may be humanely euthanized if the animal shelter needs kennel and cage
space. An animal may also be euthanized if it has a health complication or a
temperament that endangers Newberry County Animal Care and Control employees.
All animals will be euthanized using a euthanasia solution so that they
immediately go to sleep. After death, they will be packaged and transported to
the county transfer station.
   (B)   Newberry County Animal Care and Control does not offer euthanasia as a
public service. Persons wishing to have their animal euthanized must take it to

§ 97.05 INDIVIDUAL ALARM ACTIVATIONS,

“intentional without an emergency situation,” shall cause a written report to
be filed with the fire department. The written report shall include the date,
location, time and person responsible for the activation. Any person who
violates this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and can be subject to a
fine not to exceed $150 and/or up to 30 days in jail. Any person who violated

(Ord. 05-10-2022, passed 6-1-2022)
§ 97.06 GOVERNMENT IMMUNITY.
   Having a fire alarm system is not intended to, nor will it, create a
contract, duty or obligation, either express or implied, of response. Any and
all liability and consequential damage resulting for the failure to respond to
a notification is hereby disclaimed and governmental immunity as provided by
law is retained. By having a fire alarm system, the owner acknowledges that
fire department response may be based on factors such as availability of fire
department units, priority of calls, weather conditions, traffic conditions,
emergency conditions and staffing levels. The county, its officers, employees
and agents, shall not assume any duty or responsibility for the installation,
maintenance, operation, repair or effectiveness of any privately owned fire
alarm system, those duties and responsibilities being solely those of the owner
of the premises

§ 111.03 REGULATIONS.
   (A)   Location. Sexually-oriented businesses shall be located only in
accordance with the following:
      (1)   At least 1,000 feet from any residential use, church, day-care
center, retirement center, nursing care facility, hospital, public or private
elementary or secondary education school, public park, public library,
cemetery, or family-oriented recreation facility, including, but not limited
to, a public swimming pool, a roller skating rink, or a motion picture

regular basis, regardless of jurisdiction;
      (2)   At least 1,000 feet from any other sexually-oriented business,
regardless of jurisdiction. Each sexually-oriented business is considered a
separate business regardless of ownership; and
      (3)   Measurements of distance separation shall be in a straight line
from the closest points of the buildings or outdoor areas in which the
sexually-oriented business activity takes place to either:
         (a)   The closest point of the building in which the residential use,
public library, motion picture establishment, or other sexually-oriented
business is located; or
         (b)   The closest point of the property line of a church, day-care
center, public or private elementary or secondary education school, public
park, or cemetery.
   (B)   Signage and exterior decoration/design.
      (1)   It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of any sexually-
oriented business or any other person to erect, construct, or maintain any sign
other than as provided herein.
      (2)   Signs and exterior decoration/design shall contain no photographs,
silhouettes, drawings, titles, graphic or pictorial representations in any
manner of nudity or state of nudity, semi-nudity or state of semi-nudity,
specified sexual activities, or specified anatomical areas.
      (3)   Each sexually-oriented business must display at least 1 sign,
easily discernible prior to entering the establishment, which identifies it as
such by using the word adult (for example, adult bookstore, adult cabaret,
adult entertainment, and the like).
   (C)   Inspections.
      (1)   Representatives of the Sheriff's Department or other County Code
Departments of Agencies shall be allowed to inspect the premises of a sexually-
oriented business for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the law at any
time it is occupied or open for business.
      (2)   Sexually-oriented businesses shall submit to the Sheriff’s
Department a site plan drawn to a designated scale or drawn with marked
dimensions. The site plan need not be professionally prepared, but must be
drawn to an accuracy of plus or minus 6 inches. The site plan must include
information and exhibits as deemed necessary by the Sheriff in order to
determine that the proposed use complies with this chapter and to facilitate
any inspections. No alteration to the interior configuration of the site may be
made without the prior approval of the Sheriff or his or her designee. All site
plans and revised site plans submitted to the Sheriff's Department shall
include a $25 processing fee.
      (3)   All existing sexually-oriented businesses must provide a site plan
and processing fee within 3 months of the enactment of this chapter.
   (D)   No fondling or caressing. Live entertainment presented by some
sexually-oriented businesses involves a considerable amount of bodily contact
between patrons and semi-nude and nude employees and dancers, including
physical contact, such as hugging, kissing, and sexual fondling of employees
and patrons. Many sexually-oriented businesses have couch or straddle dancing,
and in these dances, employees sometimes do those things as sit in a patron's
lap, place their breasts against the patron's face while physical contact is
maintained, and gyrate in such a manner as to simulate sexual intercourse. This
behavior can lead to prostitution. Newberry County Council recognizes that
preventing prostitution and the spread of sexually-transmitted diseases are
clearly within its police powers: Southeastern Promotions. Inc. v. Conrad, 341
F.Supp. 465, 477 (E.D. Tenn. 1972), rev'd on other grounds, 420 U.S. 546
(1975). Newberry County Council believes that prohibiting physical contact
between performers and patrons at a sexually-oriented business establishment is
a reasonable and effective means of addressing these legitimate governmental
interests. It is a misdemeanor for any nude or semi-nude employee or dancer to
fondle or caress any patron, and it is a misdemeanor for a patron to fondle or
caress any nude or semi-nude employee or dancer.
   (E)   Six-foot distance rule. No nude or semi-nude employee or dancer shall
perform live entertainment within 6 feet of any patron, nor shall any patron
experience live entertainment within 6 feet of any nude or semi-nude employee
or dancer, in a sexually-oriented business. Sexually-oriented businesses with
live entertainment shall conspicuously post a sign that advises patrons that
they must be at least 6 feet away from nude or semi-nude employees and nude or
semi-nude dancers at all times.
   (F)   Restrictions on giving gratuities to nude or semi-nude dancers or nude
or semi-nude employees. No patron shall personally pay or personally give a
gratuity to any nude or semi-nude dancer, or nude or semi-nude employee of a
sexually-oriented business establishment. Gratuities can be placed in
containers at a location away from the dancers, or handed to clothed employees.
In the alternative, sexually-oriented businesses could charge a cover charge
and prohibit all gratuities. No nude or semi-nude dancer, or nude or semi-nude
employee, of a sexually-oriented business shall solicit or accept any pay or
gratuity personally from a patron. Sexually-oriented businesses with nude or
semi-nude dancers, or nude or semi-nude employees shall conspicuously post a
sign that advises patrons that gratuities to be paid personally to nude or
semi-nude dancers, and nude or semi-nude employees, are prohibited.
   (G)   Interior configuration. A person who operates or causes to be operated
a sexually-oriented business, as defined in this chapter, which exhibits on the
premises in a viewing room of less than 150 square feet of floor space, a film,
videocassette, or other video reproduction which depicts specified sexual
activities or specified anatomical areas or which allows specified sexual
activities to occur in a separate room in the establishment shall comply with
the following requirements.
      (1)   The site plan shall specify the location of 1 or more manager's
stations and the location of all overhead lighting fixtures, and designating
any portion of the premises in which patrons will not be permitted. A manager's
station may not exceed 32 square feet of floor area.
      (2)   It is the duty of the owners and operator of the premises to ensure
that at least 1 employee is on duty and situated in each manager's station at
all times that any patron is present inside the premises.
      (3)   The interior of the premises shall be configured in such a manner
that there is an unobstructed view from a manager's station of every area of
the premises to which any patron is permitted access for any purpose, excluding
restrooms. Restrooms may not contain video reproduction equipment. If the
premises has 2 or more manager's stations designated, then the interior of the
premises shall be configured in such a manner that there is an unobstructed
view of each area of the premises to which any patron is permitted access for
any purpose from at least 1 of the manager's stations. The view required in
this division (G) must be by direct line of sight from the manager's station.
      (4)   It shall be the duty of the owners and operator, and also the duty
of any agents and employees present in the premises, to ensure that the view
area specified in division (G)(3) above remains unobstructed by any doors,
walls, merchandise, display racks, or other materials at all times and to
ensure that no patron is permitted access to any area of the premises which has
been designated as an area in which patrons will not be permitted in the site
plan filed pursuant to division (G)(1) above.
      (5)   No viewing room, nor any room or enclosed area that cannot be
viewed from the manager's station, may be occupied by more than 1 person at any
time.
      (6)   The premises shall be equipped with overhead lighting fixtures of
sufficient intensity to illuminate every place to which patrons are permitted
access at an illumination of not less than 1 candle foot as measured at the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 152.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   The Legislature of the State of South Carolina has in S.C. Code of Laws,
Title 4, Chapters 9 (Article 1) and 25 as well as Title 6, Chapter 29, and
amendments thereto, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the County Council of Newberry County,
South Carolina does ordain as follows in this chapter.
(Ord. 06-33-03, passed 6-11-2003; Am. Ord. 07-15-11, passed 9-7-2011)
§ 152.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The special flood hazard areas of Newberry County are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life, property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures of flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   Furthermore, these flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in flood plains causing increases in flood heights and velocities,
and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(Ord. 06-33-03, passed 6-11-2003; Am. Ord. 07-15-11, passed 9-7-2011)
§ 152.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (A)   It is the purpose of this chapter to protect human life and health,
minimize property damage, and encourage appropriate construction practices to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions by requiring that
uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. Uses of the
flood plain which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or
erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or erosion are
restricted or prohibited. These provisions attempt to control the alteration of
natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which
are involved in the accommodation of flood waters, and control filling,
grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage or
erosion. Additionally, this chapter prevents or regulates the construction of
flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase
flood hazards to other lands.
   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are to protect human life and health,
to help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in a manner as to minimize flood blight areas,
and to ensure that potential home buyers are notified that property is in a
flood area. The provisions of this chapter are intended to minimize damage to
public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric,
telephone, and sewer lines; streets and bridges located in the flood plain; and
prolonged business interruptions. Also, an important flood plain management
objective of this chapter is to minimize expenditure of public money for costly
flood control projects and rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding.
   (C)   (1)   Flood plains are an important asset to the community.
      (2)   They perform vital natural functions such as temporary storage of
floodwaters, moderation of peak flood flows, maintenance of water quality,
groundwater recharge, prevention of erosion, habitat for diverse natural
wildlife populations, recreational opportunities, and aesthetic quality.
      (3)   These functions are best served if flood plains are kept in their
natural state.
      (4)   Wherever possible, the natural characteristics of flood plains and
their associated wetlands and water bodies should be preserved and enhanced.
Decisions to alter flood plains, especially floodways and stream channels,
should be the result of careful planning processes which evaluate resource
conditions and human needs.

§ 152.04 LANDS TO WHICH THE CHAPTER APPLIES.
   (A)   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of Newberry County as identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in its Flood Insurance Study, dated 6-20-2019 , with
accompanying maps and other supporting data that are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of this chapter.
   (B)   In accordance with §
152.23(J), the best available data for Lake Murray establishes the base flood
elevation at 362.5 feet National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) and for Lake
Greenwood establishes the base flood elevation at 440.0 feet North American
Vertical Datum (NAVD).

§ 152.07 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be considered as minimum requirements, liberally construed in favor of the
governing body, and deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted
under state law. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair
any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this
chapter and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restrictions shall prevail.

chapter shall not be affected and shall remain in force.
(Ord. 07-15-11, passed 9-7-2011)
§ 152.09 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
consideration. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within the areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter
shall not create liability on the part of Newberry County or by any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder.

completed before 12-11-1990.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete slabs).

for purposes of flood plain management. FREEBOARD tends to compensate for the
many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights greater than the
height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway conditions, such as
wave action, bridge openings, and the hydrological effect of urbanization of
the watershed.
   FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE. A use which cannot perform its intended purpose
unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term

inventories because it was believed that the structures or districts have the
potential for meeting the historic structure criteria of the DOI.
      (3)   In order for these structures to meet NFIP historic structure
criteria, it must be demonstrated and evidenced that the South Carolina
Department of Archives and History has individually determined that the
structure or district meets DOI historic structure criteria.
   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC). Applies to all new and renewed flood
insurance policies effective on and after June 1, 1997. The NFIP shall enable
the purchase of insurance to cover the cost of compliance with land use and
control measures established under Section 1361. It provides coverage for the
payment of a claim to help pay for the cost to comply with state or community
floodplain management laws or ordinances after a flood event in which a
building had been declared substantially or repetitively damaged.
   LIMITED STORAGE. An area used for storage and intended to be limited to
incidental items which can withstand exposure to the elements and have low
flood damage potential. Such an area must be of flood-resistant or breakaway
material, void of utilities except for essential lighting and cannot be

      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   REPETITIVE LOSS. A building covered by a contract for flood insurance that
has incurred flood- related damages on two occasions during a 10-year period
ending on the date of the event for which a second claim is made, in which the
cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of
the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.
   SECTION 1316 OF THE NATIONAL FLOOD INSURANCE ACT OF 1968. The act provides
that no new flood insurance shall be provided for any property found by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency to have been declared by a state or local
authority to be in violation of state or local ordinances.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. No. 97-348),
being 16 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq., includes substantial improvement, and means
the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement
was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure (including a manufactured
home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of
piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or
the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction
does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor
does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it
include excavation for footings, piers, or foundations, or the erection of
temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of
accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or
not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or
other structural part of the building, whether or not that alteration affects
the external dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, a manufactured home, including a
gas or liquid storage tank, or other manmade facility or infrastructure that is
principally above ground.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the  structure before the damage occurred.
Such repairs may be undertaken successively and their costs counted
cumulatively. Please refer to the definition of “substantial improvement.”
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the
market value of the structure before the start of construction of the
improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred substantial
damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
      (2)   The term does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project of improvement to a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
      (3)   Permits shall be cumulative for a period of 5 years. If the
improvement project is conducted in phases, the total of all costs associated
with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the first permit, shall be
utilized to determine whether substantial improvement will occur.
   SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. Where
the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, or improvement of the streets,
utilities, and pads equals or exceeds 50% of the value of the streets,
utilities, and pads before the repair, reconstruction, or improvement
commenced.
   VARIANCE. The grant of relief from a term or terms of this chapter.
   VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with these regulations.

of a watercourse, and submit evidence of the notification to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency;
      (2)   In addition to the notifications required for watercourse
alterations per division (C)(1) above, written reports of maintenance records
must be maintained to show that maintenance has been provided within the
altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying
capacity is maintained. This maintenance must consist of a comprehensive
program of periodic inspections, and routine channel clearing and dredging, or
other related functions. The assurance shall consist of a description of
maintenance activities, frequency of performance, and the local official
responsible for maintenance performance. Records shall be kept on file for FEMA
inspection;
      (3)   If the proposed project will modify the configuration of the
watercourse, floodway, or base flood elevation for which a detailed Flood
Insurance Study has been developed, the applicant shall apply for and must
receive approval for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision with the Federal
Emergency Management Agency prior to the start of construction.
      Within 60 days of completion of an alteration of a watercourse,
referenced in the certification requirements of §
152.22(B)(3), the applicant shall submit as-built certification, by a
registered professional engineer, to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (D)   Floodway encroachments. Prevent encroachments within floodways unless
the certification and flood hazard reduction provisions of §
152.36(E) are met.
   (E)   Adjoining floodplains. Cooperate with neighboring communities with
respect to the management of adjoining floodplains and/or flood-related erosion
areas in order to prevent aggravation of existing hazards.
   (F)   Notifying adjacent communities. Notify adjacent communities prior to
permitting substantial commercial developments and large subdivisions to be
undertaken in areas of special flood hazard and/or flood-related erosion
hazards.

of the lowest floor of all new or substantially improved structures, in
accordance with administrative procedures outlined in §
152.23(B)(2).
      (2)   Obtain the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to
which the new or substantially improved structures have been floodproofed, in
accordance with the floodproofing certification outlined in §
152.23(B)(1).
      (3)   When floodproofing is utilized for a particular structure, obtain
certifications from a registered professional engineer or architect in
accordance with the non-residential construction requirements outlined in §
152.36(B).
   (H)   Map interpretation. Where interpretation is needed as to the exact
location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where
there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions), make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the
location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the
interpretation as provided in this chapter.
   (I)   Prevailing authority. Where a map boundary showing an area of special
flood hazard and field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations for flood
protection elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table,
etc.) shall prevail. The correct information should be submitted to FEMA as per
the map maintenance activity requirements outlined in §
152.36(G)(2).

values served by floodplains. Proposed developments must go through an eight-
step review process. Evidence of compliance with the executive order must be
submitted as part of the permit review process.
   (Q)   Substantial damage determination.  Perform an assessment of damage
from any origin to the structure using FEMA's Residential Substantial Damage
Estimator (RSDE) software to determine if the damage equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   (R)   Substantial improvement determinations. Perform an assessment of
permit applications for improvements or repairs to be made to a building or
structure that equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure
before the start of construction. Cost of work counted for determining if and
when substantial improvement to a structure occurs shall be cumulative for a
period of 5 years. If the improvement project is conducted in phases, the total
of all costs associated with each phase, beginning with the issuance of the
first permit, shall be utilized to determine whether “substantial improvement”
will occur. The market values shall be determined by one of the following
methods:
      (1)   The current assessed building value as determined by the county's
assessor's office or the value of an appraisal performed by a licensed
appraiser at the expense of the owner within the past 6 months.
      (2)   One or more certified appraisals from a registered professional
licensed appraiser in accordance with the laws of South Carolina. The appraisal
shall indicate actual replacement value of the building or structure in its
pre-improvement condition, less the cost of site improvements and depreciation
for functionality and obsolescence.
      (3)   Real estate purchase contract within 6 months prior to the date of
the application for a permit.

§ 152.24 ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES.
   (A)   Inspections of work in progress. As the work pursuant to a permit
progresses, the local administrator shall make as many inspections of the work
as may be necessary to ensure that the work is being done according to the
provisions of the local ordinance and the terms of the permit. In exercising
this power, the administrator has a right, upon presentation of proper
credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction at
any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other enforcement action.
   (B)   Stop-work orders. Whenever a building or part thereof is being
constructed, reconstructed, altered, or repaired in violation of this chapter,
the administrator may order the work to be immediately stopped. The stop-work
order shall be in writing and directed to the person doing the work. The stop-
work order shall state the specific work to be stopped, the specific reasons
for the stoppage, and the conditions under which the work may be resumed.
Violation of a stop-work order constitutes a misdemeanor.
   (C)   Revocation of permits. The local administrator may revoke and require
the return of the development permit by notifying the permit holder in writing,
stating the reason for the revocation. Permits shall be revoked for any
substantial departure from the approved application, plans, or specifications;
for refusal or failure to comply with the requirements of state or local laws;
or for false statements or misrepresentations made in securing the permit. Any
permit mistakenly issued in violation of an applicable state or local law may
also be revoked.
   (D)   Periodic inspections. The local administrator and each member of his
or her inspections department shall have a right, upon presentation of proper
credentials, to enter on any premises within the territorial jurisdiction of
the department at any reasonable hour for the purposes of inspection or other
enforcement action.
   (E)   Violations to be corrected. When the local administrator finds
violations of applicable state and local laws, it shall be his or her duty to
notify the owner or occupant of the building of the violation. The owner or
occupant shall immediately remedy each of the violations of law on the property
he or she owns.
   (F)   Actions in event of failure to take corrective action. If the owner of
a building or property shall fail to take prompt corrective action, the
administrator shall give him or her written notice, by certified or registered
mail to his or her last known address or by personal service, that:
      (1)   The building or property is in violation of this chapter;
      (2)   A hearing will be held before the local administrator at a
designated place and time, not later than 10 days after the date of the notice,
at which time the owner shall be entitled to be heard in person or by counsel
and to present arguments and evidence pertaining to the matter; and
      (3)   Following the hearing, the local administrator may issue the order
to alter, vacate, or demolish the building; or to remove fill as appears
appropriate.
   (G)   Order to take corrective action. If, upon a hearing held pursuant to
the notice prescribed above, the administrator shall find that the building or
development is in violation of this chapter, he or she shall make an order in
writing to the owner, requiring the owner to remedy the violation within such
period, not less than 60 days, the administrator may prescribe; provided that
where the administrator finds that there is imminent danger to life or other
property, he or she may order that corrective action be taken in the lesser
period as may be feasible.
   (H)   Appeal. Any owner who has received an order to take corrective action
may appeal from the order to the local elected governing body by giving notice
of appeal in writing to the administrator and the Clerk to Council within 10
days following issuance of the final order. In the absence of an appeal, the
order of the administrator shall be final. The local governing body shall hear
an appeal within a reasonable time and may affirm, modify and affirm, or revoke
the order.
   (I)   Failure to comply with order. If the owner of a building or property
fails to comply with an order to take corrective action from which no appeal
has been taken, or fails to comply with an order of the governing body
following an appeal, he or she shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be
punished in the discretion of the court.
   (J)   Denial of flood insurance under the NFIP. If a structure is declared
in violation of the ordinance and after all other penalties are exhausted to
achieve compliance with the ordinance then the local administrator shall notify
the Federal Emergency Management Agency to initiate a Section 1316 of the
National Flood Insurance Act of 1968 action against the structure upon the
finding that the violator refused to bring the violation into compliance with
the ordinance. Once a violation has been remedied the local administrator shall
notify FEMA of the remedy and ask that Section 1316 be rescinded.
   (K)   The following documents are incorporated by reference and may be used
by the local administrator to provide further guidance and interpretation of
this chapter as found on FEMA's website at www.fema.gov:

PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION
§ 152.35 GENERAL STANDARDS.
   Development may not occur in the Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) where
alternative locations exist due to the inherent hazards and risks involved.
Before a permit is issued, the applicant shall demonstrate that new structures
cannot be located out of the SFHA and that encroachments onto the SFHA are
minimized. In all areas of special flood hazard, the following provisions are
required:
   (A)   Reasonably safe from flooding. Review all permit applications to
determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from
flooding.
   (B)   Anchoring. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
   (C)   Flood resistant materials and equipment. All new construction and
substantial improvements shall be constructed with flood-resistant materials
and utility equipment resistant to flood damage in accordance with Technical
Bulletin 2, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements, dated 8/08, and
available from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
   (D)   Minimize flood damage. All new construction and substantial
improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood
damages.
   (E)   Critical development. Critical development shall be elevated to the
500-year flood elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood
elevation (where records are available), whichever is greater. If no data
exists establishing the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known
historical flood elevation, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and
hydraulic engineering analysis that generates 500-year flood elevation data.
   (F)   Utilities. Electrical, ventilation, plumbing, heating and air
conditioning equipment (including ductwork), and other service facilities shall
be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of base flood plus 3 feet. These
requirements do not preclude the installation of outdoor faucets for shower
heads, sinks, hoses, and the like, as long as cut-off devices and back flow
devices are installed to prevent contamination to the service components and
thereby minimize any flood damages to the building.
(Am. Ord. 04-12-04, passed 4-7-2004)
   (G)   Water supply systems.   All new and replacement water supply systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the system.
   (H)   Sanitary sewage systems. New and replacement sanitary sewage systems
shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into
the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters. On-site waste
disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them
or contamination from them during flooding.
   (I)   Gas or liquid storage tanks. All gas or liquid storage tanks, either
located above ground or buried, shall be anchored to prevent floatation and
lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (J)   Alteration, repair, reconstruction, or improvements. Any alteration,
repair, reconstruction, or improvement to a structure which is in compliance
with the provisions of this chapter shall meet the requirements of new
construction as contained in this chapter. This includes post-FIRM development
and structures.
   (K)   Nonconforming buildings or uses. Nonconforming buildings or uses may
not be enlarged, replaced, or rebuilt unless the enlargement or reconstruction
is accomplished in conformance with the provisions of this chapter. Provided,
however, nothing in this chapter shall prevent the repair, reconstruction, or
replacement of an existing building or structure located totally or partially
within the floodway, provided that the bulk of the building or structure below
base flood elevation in the floodway is not increased, and provided that the
repair, reconstruction, or replacement meets all of the other requirements of
this chapter.
   (L)   Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). A building must meet the
specific standards for flood plain construction outlined in §
152.36, as well as any applicable ADA requirements. The ADA is not
justification for issuing a variance or otherwise waiving these requirements.
Also, the cost of improvements required to meet the ADA provisions shall be
included in the costs of the improvements for calculating substantial
improvement.

§ 152.36 SPECIFIC STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazard (Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, V, and VE)
where base flood elevation data has been provided, as set forth in §
152.04 or outlined in the duties and responsibilities of the local
administrator §
152. 23, the following provisions are required.
   (A)   Residential construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any residential structure (including manufactured homes) shall have the
lowest floor elevated no lower than 3 feet above the base flood elevation. No
basements are permitted. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings
requirements in division (D).
   (B)   Nonresidential construction.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or nonresidential structure (including manufactured homes) shall
have the lowest floor elevated no lower than 3 feet above the level of the base
flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a
structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces, shall be provided in accordance with the elevated buildings
requirements in division (D). No basements are permitted. Structures located in
A-Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation provided that all areas of the
structure below the required elevation are watertight with walls substantially
impermeable to the passage of water, using structural components having the
capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of
buoyancy.
      (2)   A registered, professional engineer or architect shall certify that
the standards of this division (B)(2) are satisfied. The certifications shall
be provided to the official as set forth in the floodproofing certification
requirements in §
152.22(B)(1). A variance may be considered for wet-floodproofing agricultural
structures in accordance with the criteria outlined in §
152.53. Agricultural structures not meeting the criteria of §
152.53 must meet the nonresidential construction standards and all other
applicable provisions of this chapter. Structures which are floodproofed are
required to have an approved maintenance plan with an annual exercise. The
local administrator must approve the maintenance plan and notification of the
annual exercise shall be provided to same.
   (C)   Manufactured homes.
      (1)   Manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on
sites outside a manufactured home park or subdivision, in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park
or subdivision, or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on
which a manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a
flood, must be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of

collapse, and lateral movement. For the purpose of this requirement,
manufactured homes must be anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement in accordance with Section 40-29-10 of the South Carolina Manufactured
Housing Board Regulations, as amended. Additionally, when the elevation
requirement would be met by an elevation of the chassis at least 36 inches or
less above the grade at the sight, the chassis shall be supported by reinforced
piers or engineered foundation. When the elevation of the chassis is above 36
inches in height, an engineering certification is required.
      (4)   An evacuation plan must be developed for evacuation of all
residents of all new, substantially improved, or substantially damaged
manufactured home parks or subdivisions located within flood-prone areas. This
plan shall be filed with and approved by the local administrator and the local

elevated buildings that include fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor
that are usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access, or limited
storage in an area other than a basement, and which are subject to flooding
shall be designed to preclude finished space and be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of floodwaters.
      (1)   Designs. Designs for complying with this requirement must either be
certified by a professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed all of the
following minimum criteria:
         (a)   Provide a minimum of 2 openings on different walls having a
total net area of not less than 1 square inch for every square foot of enclosed
area subject to flooding.
         (b)   The bottom of each opening must be no more than 1 foot above the
higher of the interior or exterior grade immediately under the opening.
         (c)   Only the portions of openings that are below the base flood

coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in
both directions.
         (e)   Fill placed around foundation walls must be graded so that the
grade inside the enclosed area is equal to or higher than the adjacent grade
outside the building on at least one side of the building.
      (2)   Hazardous velocities. - Hydrodynamic pressure must be considered in
the design of any foundation system where velocity waters or the potential for
debris flow exists. If flood velocities are excessive (greater than 5 feet per
second), foundation systems other than solid foundations walls should be
considered so that obstructions to damaging flood flows are minimized.
      (3)   Enclosures below lowest floor.
         (a)   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or
entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
         (b)   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished
or partitioned into separate rooms, must be void of utilities except for
essential lighting as required for safety, and cannot be temperature
controlled.
         (c)   One wet location switch and/or outlet connected to a ground
fault interrupt breaker may be installed below the required lowest floor
elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in §
152.36(A), (B) and (C).

elevation specified in the specific standards outlined in §
152.36(A), (B), (C) and (D) should be of flood resistant materials.
   (E)   Floodways.  Located within areas of special flood hazard established
in §
152.04, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters that carry debris and
potential projectiles and has erosion potential. The following provisions shall
apply within such areas:
      (1)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements, additions, and other developments shall be permitted unless:
         (a)   It has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic
analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the
proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in the flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood. Such certification and technical data
shall be presented to the local administrator.
         (b)   A conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR) has been approved
by FEMA. A letter of map revision must be obtained upon completion of the
proposed development.
      (2)   If Division (E)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of §§
152.35 through

152.36(E)(1) are met.
      (4)   Permissible uses within floodways may include: general farming,
pasture, outdoor plant nurseries, horticulture, forestry, wildlife sanctuary,
game farm, and other similar agricultural, wildlife, and related uses. Also,
lawns, gardens, play areas, picnic grounds, and hiking and horseback riding
trails are acceptable uses, provided that they do not employ structures or
fill. Substantial development of a permissible use may require a no-impact
certification. The uses listed in this subsection are permissible only if and
to the extent that they do not cause any increase in base flood elevations or
changes to the floodway configuration.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles.  
      (1)   A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is:
         (a)   On wheels or jacking system;
         (b)   Attached to the site only by quick-disconnect type utilities and
security devices; and
         (c)   Has no permanently attached additions.
      (2)   Recreational vehicles placed on sites shall either be:
         (a)   On site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; or
         (b)   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or meet the
development permit and certification requirements of §
152.22, general standards outlined in §
152.35, and manufactured homes standards in §
152.36(C) and (D).
   (G)   Map maintenance activities. The National Flood Insurance Program
(NFIP) requires flood data to be reviewed and approved by FEMA. This ensures
that flood maps, studies and other data identified in §
152.04 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data. The following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to submit new technical data.

processing fees for these map revisions shall also be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         (c)   The Local Administrator shall require a conditional letter of
map revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         (d)   Floodplain development permits issued by the Local Administrator
shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a letter of map revision from
FEMA for any development proposal subject to §
152.36(G).
      (2)   Right to submit new technical data. The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the local jurisdiction
and may be submitted at any time.
   (H)   Accessory structures.

§ 152.37 STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT ESTABLISHED BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS AND
FLOODWAYS.
   Located within the areas of special flood hazard (Zones A and V) established
in §
152.04 are small streams where no base flood data has been provided or where no
floodways have been identified. The following provisions apply within such
areas:
   (A)   In all areas of special flood hazard where base flood elevation data
are not available, the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic
engineering analysis that generates base flood elevations for all subdivision
proposals and other proposed developments containing at least 50 lots or 5
acres, whichever is less.
   (B)   No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and new development shall be permitted within 100 feet of the
stream bank unless certification with supporting technical data by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachments shall
not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base
flood discharge.
   (C)   If division (A) above is satisfied and base flood elevation data is
available from other sources, all new construction and substantial improvements
within such areas shall comply with all applicable flood hazard ordinance
provisions of §§
152.35 through
152.39 and shall be elevated or floodproofed in accordance with elevations
established in accordance with §
152.23(K).
   (D)   Data from preliminary, draft, and final Flood Insurance Studies
constitutes best available data. Refer to FEMA Floodplain Management Technical
Bulletin 1 -98 Use of Flood Insurance Study (FIS) Data as Available Data. If an
appeal is pending on the study in accordance with 44 CFR Ch. 1, Part 67.5 and
67.6, the data does not have to be used.
   (E)   When base flood elevation (BFE) data is not available from a federal,
state, or other source one of the following methods may be used to determine a
BFE. For further information regarding the methods for determining BFEs listed
below, refer to FEMA's manual Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate
Zone A Areas:
      (1)   Contour interpolation.
         (a)   Superimpose approximate Zone A boundaries onto a topographic map
and estimate a BFE.
         (b)   Add one-half of the contour interval of the topographic map that
is used to the BFE.
      (2)   Data extrapolation. A BFE can be determined if a site within 500
feet upstream of a reach of a stream reach for which a 100-year profile has
been computed by detailed methods, and the floodplain and channel bottom slope
characteristics are relatively similar to the downstream reaches. No hydraulic
structures shall be present.
      (3)   Hydrologic and hydraulic calculations. Perform hydrologic and
hydraulic calculations to determine BFEs using FEMA approved methods and
software.

§ 152.54 AGRICULTURAL STRUCTURES.
   Variances may be issued to wet floodproof an agricultural structure if it is
used solely for agricultural purposes. In order to minimize flood damages
during the base flood and the threat to public health and safety, the structure
must meet all of the conditions and considerations of §
152.57, this section, and the following standards.
   (A)   Use of the structure must be limited to agricultural purposes as
listed below:
      (1)   Pole frame buildings with open or closed sides used exclusively for
the storage of farm machinery and equipment;
      (2)   Steel grain bins and steel frame corn cribs;
      (3)   General purpose barns for the temporary feeding of livestock which
are open on at least 1 side;
      (4)   For livestock confinement buildings, poultry houses, dairy
operations, and similar livestock operations, variances may not be issued for
structures that were substantially damaged. New construction or substantial
improvement of the structures must meet the elevation requirements of §
152.36(B); and
      (5)   Detached garages and storage sheds solely used for parking and
limited storage in connection with agricultural uses only, which are no greater
than 400 square feet in area.
   (B)   The agricultural structure must be built or rebuilt, in the case of an
existing building that is substantially damaged, with flood-resistant materials
for the exterior and interior building components and elements below the base
flood elevation.
   (C)   The agricultural structure must be adequately anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. All of the structure's components
must be capable of resisting specific flood-related forces including
hydrostatic, buoyancy, hydrodynamic, and debris impact forces. Where flood
velocities exceed 5 feet per second, fast-flowing floodwaters can exert
considerable pressure on the building's enclosure walls or foundation walls.
   (D)   The agricultural structure must meet the venting requirement of §
152.36(D).
   (E)   Any mechanical, electrical, or other utility equipment must be located

watertight, floodproofed enclosure which is capable of resisting damage during
flood conditions in accordance with §
152.35(F).
   (F)   The agricultural structure must comply with the floodway encroachment
provisions of §
152.36(E).
   (G)   Major equipment, machinery, or other contents must be protected. Such
protection may include protective watertight floodproofed areas within the
building, the use of equipment hoists for readily elevating contents,
permanently elevating contents on pedestals or shelves above the base flood
elevation, or determining that property owners can safely remove contents
without risk to lives and that the contents will be located to a specified site
out of the flood plain.

(Ord. 06-11-16, passed 9-21-2016)
§ 153.030 NONCONFORMITIES.
   (A)   In general.
      (1)   Nonconformities as defined in this section are declared to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the districts established by this chapter.
It is the intent of this section to allow nonconformities to continue until
they are removed, but not to encourage their proliferation.
      (2)   Any parcel of land, use of land, easement, building or structure
lawfully existing on the date of any text change in this chapter, or on the
date of a zoning map change that does not conform to the use or dimensional
requirements of the district in which it is located may be continued and
maintained in accordance with the provisions of this section and other
applicable provisions of this chapter.
      (3)   A nonconformity shall not be changed to any other nonconformity
unless the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that the new proposed nonconformity is
more in character with the uses and development patterns in the zoning district
in which it is located. In approving such a request, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accordance with
the purpose of this section.
      (4)   A nonconformity shall only be extended, enlarged, or intensified in
conformity with this section.
      (5)   Nonconforming off-premises advertising signs may be rebuilt
provided all structural requirements detailed in this section are met.
   (B)   Nonconforming lots.
      (1)   Vacant lots. Vacant lots for which plats or deeds have been
recorded in the Office of the Clerk of Court for Newberry County, which fail to
comply with the minimum area or other dimensional requirements of the districts
in which they are located may be used for any of the uses permitted in the
district in which it is located, provided that:
         (a)   Where the lot area is not more than 20% below the minimum
specified in this chapter, and other dimensional requirements are otherwise
complied with, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to issue a certificate of
zoning compliance.
         (b)   Where the lot area is more than 20% below the minimum specified
in this chapter, or other dimensional requirements cannot be met, the Board of
Zoning Appeals may, in its discretion, approve as a variance such dimensions as
shall conform as closely as possible to the required dimensions.
      (2)   Recombination of nonconforming vacant lots. When the owner of a
nonconforming vacant lot also owns land adjacent to the nonconforming lot, and
the adjacent land or portion thereof can be combined with the nonconforming
vacant lot to create a conforming lot or a more conforming lot (without
creating other nonconformities), such owner shall, before selling or beginning
any construction thereon, so combine the nonconforming lot and the adjacent
land to create such lot.
      (3)   Nonconforming occupied lots. Nonconforming lots occupied by
buildings or structures that fail to comply with the dimensional requirements
for the district in which they are located may continue to be used, provided
the specific nonconformity is not increased. The minimum yard requirements of
this chapter shall not be construed as prohibiting the conversion of an
existing building that does not meet the minimum yard requirements to another
permitted use, so long as no further encroachment is made into the required
yards.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses.
      (1)   Nonconforming uses of land or structures may continue only in
accordance with the provisions of this section.
      (2)   A nonconforming use shall not be expanded. Expansion shall include
an intensification of use, a physical expansion that results in increased
capacity or activity associated with the use, an extension of the hours of
operation or number of days of activity and any similar change in activity or
location. A nonconforming use of land outside a building shall not be extended,
enlarged, or intensified on additional land after the effective date of this
chapter.
      (3)   A nonconforming use shall not be moved from one location on a site
to another location on the same site unless the property owner can demonstrate
to the satisfaction of the Zoning Administrator that the relocation of the use
will not increase the impacts of such use on the public, will not adversely
affect adjacent properties, and will not have the effect of making the
nonconformity more permanent.
      (4)   A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use unless
the new use conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is
located. Once a nonconforming use is changed to a conforming use, a
nonconforming use shall not be re-established.
      (5)   Where a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period
of 180 days, then the use shall not be re-established or resumed and any
subsequent use of the land or structure shall conform to the requirements of
these regulations; provided, however, that commercial and industrial businesses
established at the time this chapter is adopted or amended are exempt from this
provision. Owners of manufactured homes that have been abandoned for a period
not less than 6 months, and which are older than June 15, 1976, shall remove
them permanently from all land/lots of Newberry County unless the owner can
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board of Zoning Appeals that they will
take significant steps to bring the unit into compliance with this chapter.
      (6)   No structural changes shall be made in any structure occupied by a
nonconforming use except as follows:
         (a)   Those structural changes ordered by an authorized official in
order to ensure the safety of the structure shall be permitted.
         (b)   Maintenance and repairs to keep a structure in sound condition
shall be permitted.
         (c)   Structural changes necessary to convert the nonconforming use to
a conforming use shall be permitted.
         (d)   An existing nonconforming residential structure may be enlarged
or altered provided that no additional dwelling units result. Any such
enlargement or alterations shall be in compliance with all yard requirements of
the district and/or use.
         (e)   The structure and its accompanying use may be moved to another
location on the lot so long as the structure meets all applicable requirements
of the district.
         (f)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
structure that were manifestly arranged or designed for the use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this chapter.
   (D)   Nonconforming structures.
      (1)   A nonconforming structure, devoted to a use permitted in the zoning
district in which it is located, may continue in accordance with the provisions
of this section.
      (2)   Normal repair and maintenance may be performed to allow the
continuation of a nonconforming structure.
      (3)   Enlargement of a nonconforming structure for its current use on any
property less than 2 acres in size may be allowed, provided that the following
conditions shall apply:
         (a)   The original lot size must not be increased in order to
accommodate the enlargement.
         (b)   The enlargement must not create or require additional on-site
parking, and must not intensify the nonconforming use such that it creates
peripheral off-site parking needs.
         (c)   The enlargement must not create additional noise, exterior
lighting, or odor.
         (d)   The enlargement must not be accompanied by or made in
conjunction with changes in operating hours.
         (e)   The enlargement must not create or be accompanied by changes in
dimensions for lot access or signage.
         (f)   The enlargement must not violate yard or setback requirements
for the existing district.
      (4)   Structural changes necessary to convert the nonconforming use to a
conforming use shall be permitted.
      (5)   A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless it thereafter
conforms to the standards of the zoning district in which it is located.
      (6)   A nonconforming structure may be rebuilt, altered, or repaired in

a use which is in conformity with the provision of this chapter or for a use
authorized by order of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (B)   Purpose of the permit. The process of applying for and receiving a
zoning permit serves to determine that the work and use as planned will meet
the requirements of the zoning ordinance if conducted and completed according
to the description provided by the applicant in the permit application. A
zoning permit shall be required prior to issuance of building permits or any
other work on or use of the land as described in division (A) above.
   (C)   Fees for permits. A fee established by regulation of County Council
shall be paid for each zoning permit or certificate of zoning compliance issued

required by the Zoning Administrator to determine conformance with this
chapter, including, but not limited to, existing or proposed buildings or

not begun within 6 months from the date of the permit and no valid building
permit is outstanding for the work authorized by the zoning permit, or within
the time specified by a special exception, the permit shall expire and be null
and void. Once a zoning permit has expired, construction on the property in
question cannot proceed until a new zoning permit has been issued.
   (F)   Right of appeal. If a request for a zoning permit from the Zoning
Administrator is disapproved or if a ruling of the Zoning Administrator is

stating the proposed use conforms to the requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   Purpose of the certificate of zoning compliance. The process of

this chapter relating to the use, construction or alteration of buildings or
structures or the use of the land so the spirit of the chapter shall be
observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done.
   (B)   Anyone requesting a variance shall file such with the Zoning
Administrator on a form provided by the Zoning Administrator. Applications

order all of the following findings and conclusions:
      (1)   There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to a
particular piece of property;
      (2)   These conditions do not generally apply to other property in the
vicinity or in that district;
      (3)   Because of these conditions, the application of the chapter to a
particular piece of property would effectively prohibit or unreasonably
restrict use of the property;
      (4)   The authorization of the variance will not be a substantial
detriment to adjacent property or to public good, and the character of the
district will not be harmed by the granting of the variance; and

use not otherwise permitted in the zoning district; would not extend physically
a nonconforming use of the land; would not change the zoning district
boundaries shown on the official zoning map.
   (D)   The fact that property may be utilized more profitably, should a
variance be granted, may not be considered grounds for a variance.
   (E)   In granting a variance, the Board may attach to it the conditions
regarding the location, character, or other features of the proposed building,
structure or use as the Board may consider advisable to protect establish
property values in the surrounding area, or to promote the public health,
safety, or general welfare.
   (F)   Failure to begin or complete an action for which a variance is granted
within the time limit specified as a condition of the variance shall void the

§ 153.068 PURPOSE OF DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The zoning districts established in this chapter are for the
purposes of guiding development in accordance with existing and future needs
and promoting public health, safety, morals, convenience, order, appearance,
prosperity, and general welfare, and all of the purposes set forth in S.C. Code
§§ 6-29-710 et seq. This section sets forth the general purposes of the various
zoning districts, however the specific regulations relating to permitted uses,
conditional uses, and special exceptions are set forth in §
153.073 - Zoning District Table of Permitted uses, §§
153.088 et seq. - Conditional Uses, and §§
153.136 et seq. - Special Exceptions.
      (2)   The residential district regulations are designed to encourage a
stable and healthy environment for residential purposes and to discourage
encroachment by commercial, industrial, or other uses adversely affecting the
residential character of the district. Any reference to residential districts
in this chapter includes only the RS, RSV, RSM and RG districts.
   (B)   Primary zoning districts. Each primary use district serves a different
purpose and imposes its own set of requirements and restrictions on the use of
land in addition to the general requirements and restrictions imposed on all
land or uses within the county.
      (1)   R2 - Rural District. The district is intended to be rural in
nature, allowing low density residential uses including manufactured housing on
individual properties, as well as home occupations, family day care,
agriculture, forestry, hunting, and religious uses, but also accommodating
complementary and associated uses such as recreation, government services, and
appropriate service, commercial and industrial uses.
      (2)   RS - Single-Family Residential District. The RS District is
intended to be residential with single-family, site-built dwellings and low
population densities. Compatible uses such as home occupations, K-12 education,
limited recreation, and religious uses are also allowed. Manufactured homes and
businesses are not permitted.
      (3)   RSV - Single-Family Residential District. The RSV District is
intended to be residential with detached single-family, site-built dwellings,
typically in platted subdivisions, with low population densities. Compatible
uses such as home occupations, K-12 education, limited recreation, religious
uses, and limited use of recreational vehicles on a temporary basis for
recreation are also allowed. Manufactured homes are not permitted.
      (4)   RSM - Single-Family Residential District. The RSM District is
intended to be residential with detached single-family dwellings, including
manufactured homes on individual properties, and low population densities.
Compatible uses such as home occupations, K-12 education, and limited
recreation and religious uses are also allowed.
      (5)   RG - General Residential District. The RG District is intended to
accommodate a wide range of residential uses including detached single-family
(site-built and manufactured homes), duplexes, multi-family, townhouses, and
patio homes at higher population densities. Compatible uses such as home
occupations, K-12 education, day care, recreation, and religious uses are also
allowed. Manufactured home parks may be permitted as a special exception.
      (6)   LC - Limited Commercial District. The LC District is intended to
accommodate a range of residential and lower intensity non-residential uses
including office, institutional, single-family and multi-family residential,
healthcare, food service, accommodations, and neighborhood commercial and
service uses. The district is generally characterized by a mixture of
residential and business uses along major thoroughfares.
      (7)   GC - General Commercial District. The GC District is intended to
accommodate a variety of general commercial and non-residential uses
characterized primarily by retail, including shopping centers; wholesale;
offices; educational institutions; healthcare, including hospitals; arts and
entertainment; and service establishments in commercially-oriented areas.
      (8)   IND - Industrial District. The IND District is established to
accommodate a wide variety of industrial uses involving research,
manufacturing, processing, assembly, warehouses, and mining.
      (9)   PDD - Planned Development District. PDDs are individually
designated by Council by zoning amendment, for which an approved development
plan constitutes the district regulations. The district is intended to use the
factors of efficiency, economy, flexibility, creative site design, improved
appearance, mixture of uses, and maximize benefits from open space, safe and
efficient vehicular and pedestrian access in a development characterized by a
unified site design for mixed uses. A Planned Development District must include
a mixture of residential and non-residential uses, and may be proposed in any
part of the county.
   (C)   Overlay Districts. Overlay districts are established to provide for
certain additional requirements or to establish special development
requirements for permitted uses. Where overlay districts exist and there is a
conflict between the requirements specified between the overlay and the
underlying (primary) district, the standards of the overlay district shall
prevail. Otherwise, the standards of the underlying (primary) district shall
also be in effect for any area additional zoned as an overlay district.
      (1)   CPO - Corridor Protection Overlay District. The corridor protection
overlay district is designed to preserve and enhance the overall visual
appearance and quality of important roadway corridors within the county in
order to preserve property values, promote economic development, and protect
the image of Newberry County.
      (2)   AP - Airport Land Use and Height Restriction Overlay District. The
purpose of the Airport Land Use and Height Restriction Overlay District
(Airport Overlay District) is to promote compatibility between airport
operations and neighboring land uses and to protect public health and safety by
preventing the establishment of obstructions and hazards to aircraft in the
vicinity of the Newberry County Airport.

(Ord. 06-11-16, passed 9-21-2016)
§ 153.071 INTERPRETATION OF ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   (A)   Generally. Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of any zoning
district, the following general rules of interpretation shall apply. It is the
duty of the Zoning Administrator to interpret the location of zoning district

153.048(C)(6)(a).
   (B)   General rules of interpretation.
      (1)   District boundaries indicated as approximately following the center
lines of streets, highways, or alleys shall be construed to follow the center
lines.
      (2)   District boundaries indicated as approximately following platted
property lines shall be construed as following the property lines.
      (3)   District boundaries indicated as approximately following county

or subsequent amendment into 2 different zoning districts, the district least
restrictive in the opinion of the owner shall be deemed to apply to the whole
thereof. Provided, however, that in no case shall a zoning district boundary
line dividing the lot be extended into either district in excess of 50 feet
beyond the district boundary line dividing the lot.
(Ord. 06-11-16, passed 9-21-2016)
§ 153.072 LOT DIVIDED BY ZONING DISTRICT BOUNDARIES.
   No structure or accessory use may be placed, structurally altered, or have a

153.067 are set forth in the table of permitted uses provided in division (D).
   (B)   Determination of use category.
      (1)    The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), 2017,
as amended, is the basis for determining the use of property permitted in the
various zoning districts. The Zoning Administrator shall make a determination
as to whether or not any proposed use is permitted within the County's zoning
jurisdiction based on the uses listed in division (D) of this section. Whenever
it is not clear whether a proposed use is or is not permitted, the Zoning
Administrator shall consult the 2017 North American Industrial Classification
System (NAICS) to help make a determination. Any use not specifically listed in
this section and any proposed use not substantially similar to a listed use as
determined by the Zoning Administrator after consultation with the County
Administrator and County Attorney shall be deemed to be prohibited.
      (2)   Uses not listed in the NAICS codes are identified by the symbol
“NA” (Not Applicable) in the NAICS column.
      (3)   Where the symbol “P” is shown, the use to which it refers is
permitted as a use by right in the indicated district, provided it complies
fully with all applicable development standards of this chapter.

conditionally permitted in the indicated district, subject to applicable
conditions and requirements provided in §§

permitted only if reviewed and approved as a special exception, in accordance
with the special exception provisions in §§
153.136 - Special Exceptions and upon compliance with the general conditions
provided in that section. Special exception uses are subject to all other
applicable regulations of this zoning ordinance.
      (6)   Where a dash (-) is shown on the table, the use to which it refers
is not permitted in the indicated district.
   (C)   Determination of principal use. When multiple principal uses are
proposed for a development site, each principal use shall be classified
separately by the Zoning Administrator and shall be subject to all applicable
regulations for that use.

§ 153.074 PDD - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Planned Development Districts.
      (1)   Planned development districts shall permit a mixture of different
types of housing with compatible commercial uses, shopping centers, office
parks and other mixed use developments.
      (2)   Flexibility in design, character, and quality of development and
preservation of natural and scenic features are made possible through the
approval of a plan which describes the specific uses, densities, setbacks, and
other requirements for a planned development district.
      (3)   The approved plan shall constitute the district regulations for a
particular planned development district.
   (B)   PDD Requirements. The following regulations shall apply in all PDD
districts. Whenever there is a conflict between these regulations and any other
regulations in this chapter, the most stringent shall prevail.
      (1)   Permitted uses in PDDs. Any combination (mix) of uses meeting the
objectives of this section may be established in a PDD upon review and approval
by the Planning Commission and County Council. Once approved, these uses and no
others shall be permitted. Said uses shall be identified as listed per §
153.073(D) - Zoning District Table of Permitted Uses. The list of approved uses
shall be binding on the applicant and any successor in title, so long as PDD
zoning applies to the land, unless otherwise amended by chapter.
      (2)   Mixture of uses required. For PDDs that are or are planned to be
primarily residential, a minimum of 10% of the total gross area of the PDD must
be reserved for office, retail, service, live-work units and other non-
residential uses that serve the needs of project residents and others in the
vicinity of the development. For PDDs that exist or are planned to be primarily
non-residential, a minimum of 10% of the total gross area of the PDD must be
reserved for residential uses.
      (3)   Establishment of PDD Districts.
         (a)   PDDs shall be established on the official zoning map by the same
procedure as for amendments generally as provided in §
153.054 and in accordance with the requirements of this section.
         (b)   The developer/applicant shall arrange for preliminary meetings
with the Zoning Administrator prior to submitting an application for rezoning.
         (c)   The Planning Commission will review the conceptual plan and text
to ensure conformity with this section and applicable requirements of the
Newberry County Subdivision Regulations, Chapter 154; to consider the comments
of the staff review; and to obtain and consider public comments concerning the
proposed PDD.
         (d)   Upon approval by County Council, the conceptual plan along with
all supporting documentation and text shall constitute the PDD ordinance.
      (4)   Infrastructure. The developer is authorized to begin construction
of streets and infrastructure following verification that the preliminary plat
complies with all requirements specified by County Council, the Planning
Commission, SC DHEC,
Chapter 154 - Subdivision Regulations, and other approved conditions including
recording of restrictive covenants.
      (5)   Plat approval. Preliminary and final plat approval shall also
comply with
Chapter 154 - Subdivision Regulations.
      (6)   Mapping. Each PDD shall be identified on the zoning map and in the
zoning ordinance by a prefix and number indicating the particular district, as
for example “PDD-1,” together with whatever other identification appears
appropriate.
      (7)   Conceptual plan and text requirements.
         (a)   A conceptual plan meeting the requirements for site plans
contained in §
153.049(D) - Application requirements for permits shall be submitted along with
a conceptual land use plan for the entire site. A complete application shall
also include the following:
            1.   Additional site plan information provided to scale including:
topography, vegetation, drainage, flood plains, wetlands, waterways,
landscaping, open spaces, walkways, means of ingress and egress, vehicular
circulation, utility services, structures and buildings, signs and lighting,
berms, buffers, setbacks, screening devices, surrounding development, and any
other information that may reasonably be required for review.
            2.   Proposed restrictive covenants and property owners'
association documents to be recorded to ensure the establishment of any
property owners association required to maintain common areas and to verify
that no conflicts exist between the requirements of the PDD and those contained
within the restrictive covenants. Notwithstanding this provision, Newberry
County has no authority or responsibility to enforce deed restrictions.
            3.   A preliminary development schedule for the completion of
roads, infrastructure, buffer yards, and any other proposed improvements for
general use.
         (b)   The Planning Commission may establish additional requirements
for conceptual plan approval and, in special cases, may waive a particular
requirement if, in the opinion of the Planning Commission, the inclusion of
that requirement is not essential to a proper assessment of the project.
      (8)   Minimum area required. Minimum area requirements for establishing a
PDD shall be 10 contiguous acres in all districts.
      (9)   Development standards.
         (a)   Density and height requirements. Residential density, setbacks,
impervious surface ratios, and building heights shall be based on the scale of
the project in relation to its surroundings and its impact on existing and
proposed support facilities. A 20-foot setback will be required along the
perimeter of all property lines. The setback from any existing street shall be
the lesser of 35 feet or the average setback of existing adjacent houses that
front on the same street within 100 feet in either direction of the proposed
building. Maximum density is 8 units per acre. Maximum impervious surface ratio
is 70%.
         (b)   Overall site design. The overall site design shall be consistent
and compatible with adopted plans and policies for the area in which the
project is located and with adjacent residential neighborhoods and coordinated
with existing infrastructure such as roads and sidewalks.
         (c)   Parking and loading. Off-street parking and loading spaces for
each PDD shall comply with the requirements of §§
153.197 et seq. - Parking and Loading Regulations, as applicable, for the
various uses proposed for the PDD. Dense development may require supplemental
parking areas or wider streets to allow on-street parking in addition to off-
street parking requirements.
         (d)   Buffers. A buffer area at least 20 feet in width shall be
provided along the exterior perimeter property line. Buffers are not required
in the interior of the PDD.
         (e)   Streets and infrastructure. Streets within a PDD must meet the
design and construction standards required by the Subdivision Regulations in
Chapter 154 of the Newberry County Code of Ordinances.
         (f)   Signage. Signage permitted shall be consistent, appropriately
scaled and aesthetically compatible with the proposed PDD and shall comply with
the requirements of §§
153.213 et seq. - Sign Regulations.
         (g)   Open space. The site design shall include designated common open
space at a percentage appropriate for the size and configuration of the
development. Such open space shall comply with the requirements of §
153.185 - Open Space.
      (10)   Financial guarantees. Where public improvements and/or common
amenities or infrastructure are proposed, such improvements shall be installed
in accordance with a development schedule to be approved as part of the PDD
Plan and designed to specifications as required by
Chapter 154 Subdivision Regulations. Whenever a land subdivision, as regulated
by
Chapter 154, is required to implement a PDD, a preliminary plat shall be
prepared for review that conforms to all of the requirements of the PDD
approval, including the approved conceptual plan and development schedule. No
development shall take place onsite until such plat has been approved by the
county.
      (11)   Administrative action. Building and zoning permits shall not be
issued until the PDD is approved by County Council, and approved plats, the
approved plan, and all required restrictive covenants are filed for record with
the Clerk of Court for Newberry County, and all required bonds are posted with
the Clerk to Council.
      (12)   Changes in approved PDD plans. Except as provided below, approved
PDD plans shall be binding on the owner and any successor in title.
         (a)   Minor changes. Changes proposed in writing by the applicant
which do not alter district boundaries and which involve revision or minor
characteristics of the PDD such as revision of floor plans, facades,
landscaping, drainage structures, and features which do not substantially alter
the approved plan concept, anticipated offsite impacts, or violate any
applicable regulations may be approved by the Zoning Administrator. The
authority given to the Zoning Administrator to grant such minor changes shall
be construed to be permissive and not mandatory and the Zoning Administrator
may decline to allow such change. In the event this occurs, the applicant shall
have the right to request a major change to the PDD as stipulated in division
(b) below.
         (b)   Major changes. Changes proposed in writing by the applicant
which alter district boundaries or which substantially alter the
characteristics of the PDD shall be submitted under normal zoning amendment
procedures applicable to establishment of the PDD.
      (13)   Expiration of time limits on PDD Amendments. The final approved
plan for a PDD shall be in effect for a period of 2 years or other specified
development schedule. The owner of an approved PDD may apply in writing before
the end of the 2-year approval period or other specified development schedule
to the Newberry County Planning Commission for an annual 1-year extension. The
Planning Commission may approve applications for up to 5 annual extensions of
the approval period if a timely and proper written application has been filed
with the Planning Commission. If no such application is made, the approval
period or extension shall expire at the end of the approval or extension
period.
      (14)   Failure to begin; failure to progress; failure to complete. If the
responsible party fails to begin, fails to progress, or fails to complete
development as agreed in the descriptive statement, County Council may charge
the developer with violation of the zoning ordinance, may rezone the property,
or may take any combination of these actions. In any event, if the planned
development is not initiated within 2 years of its establishment, the Planning

         (a)   Height restriction zones established. In order to carry out this
chapter, certain zones are hereby created and established by FAR Part 77, which
include all of the land lying beneath the approach surfaces, transitional
surfaces, horizontal surface, and conical surface as they apply to the Newberry
County Airport, for the existing runway configurations as per the Airport
Layout Plan approved by the FAA on June, 15 2012. Graphic representation of
these zones is provided as designated in §
153.075(E)(2). An area located in more than 1 of the following zones is
considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive height limitation.
The various zones, for both the existing and ultimate runway configurations,
are hereby established and defined as follows:
            1.   Part 77 airspace zones:
               A.   Approach zones. The approach zones are the areas beneath
the Part 77 approach surfaces, as defined by 14 C.F.R. Part 77, § 77.19(d), or
in successor federal regulations.
               B.   Primary zone. The primary zone is that area of the primary
surface, as defined by 14 C.F.R. Part 77, § 77.19(c), or in successor Federal
regulations.
               C.   Transitional zones. The transitional zones are the areas
beneath the Part 77 transitional surfaces, as defined by 14 C.F.R. Part 77, §
77.19(e), or in successor federal regulations.
               D.   Horizontal zone. The horizontal zone is the area beneath
the Part 77 horizontal surfaces, as defined by 14 C.F.R. Part 77, § 77.19(a),
or in successor Federal regulations.
               E.   Conical zone. The conical zone is the areas beneath the
Part 77 conical surfaces, as defined by 14 C.F.R. Part 77, § 77.19(b), or in
successor federal regulations.
         (b)   Height limitations. No structure or tree shall be erected,
altered, allowed to grow or maintained in the height restriction zones to a
height in excess of the height limit as determined by the airspace surface
limitations, including dimensional and slope definitions, appearing on the maps
referred to in Section 50 of this Document. The property owner of a tree,
determined to be an airport hazard, shall be responsible for bringing such tree
into conformance with this chapter.
      (5)   Land use restrictions and limitations.
         (a)   Land use restriction zones established. In order to carry out
the requirements of this Airport Overlay District, certain zones are hereby
created and established, which include land lying beneath the Airport Land Use
Restriction Zones as they apply to the Newberry County Airport. Graphical
representation of these zones is provided as designated in §
153.075(E)(2). An area located in more than 1 of the zones described herein is
considered to be only in the zone with the more restrictive limitation. There
are hereby created and established the following Airport Land Use Restriction
Zones:
            1.   Zone A. Zone A is the Runway Protection Zone, as defined in
the FAA Advisory Circular 150/5300-13A, Section 310, or in successor FAA
advisory circulars.
            2.   Zone B1. Zone B1 is that portion of the Approach Zone, from
the outer edge of Zone A to where each approach surface is 150 feet of height
above their respective runway end elevations.
            3.   Zone B2. Zone B2 is that portion of the Approach Zone, from
the outer edge of Zone B1 to the end of the Approach Zone, or 10,000 feet from
inner edge of the Approach Zone, whichever it reaches first.
            4.   Zone C. Zone C is formed by offsetting the primary surface
edge outward by 1,050 feet, and extending each of its ends to its respective
runway end's approach zone, or extended and squared off at the outer edge of
Zone B1, whichever that extension reaches first.
            5.   Zone D. Zone D is those areas of the Transitional and
Horizontal Zones not part of Zones A, B1, B2, or C.
            6.   Zone E. Zone E is identical in area, dimensions, and location
to the Conical Zone. Each zone is defined geographically for both the existing
and ultimate runway configurations, as per the FAA-approved Airport Layout Plan
dated June 15, 2012, and the zones are composited into the single Airport Land
Use Restriction Zones map such that the most restrictive zone and criteria are
applied. The order of the zones from most restrictive to least is A, B1, C, B2,
D, and E.
         (b)   Land use limitations. Such applicable land use limitations are
hereby established for each of the Airport Land Use Restriction Zones in order
to prevent incompatible land uses which would compromise aeronautical activity
at the Newberry County Airport, to protect people and property on the ground in
case of an accident, to limit population and building density in the runway
approach areas, to create sufficient open space, and to restrict those uses
which may be hazardous to the operational safety of aircraft operating to and
from the Newberry County Airport, and minimize injury to the occupants of
aircraft involved in accidents. The land use limitations within Zones A, B1,
B2, C, D, and E as provided in §
153.075(E)(5)(c) Newberry County Airport Overlay District Land Use Matrix Table
shall apply to those portions of the parcel contained within the underlying
Airport Overlay District zones as indicated on the attached Newberry County
Airport Land Use Restriction Zones Map.
         (c)   Newberry County Airport Overlay District Land use Matrix Table.

         (d)   Conditional uses. For all land uses shown as conditional in §
153.075(E)(6)(c) - Land Use Matrix Table, the following conditions apply, as
applicable.
            1.   C1. Allowed only if use does not interfere with normal airport
operations (as defined by the FAA/South Carolina Aeronautics Commission).
            2.   C2. Prohibits uses that constitute a hazard to flight,
including but not limited to tall physical objects, glare, dust, or other
visual or electric interference to a pilot and aircraft, and uses that may
attract hazardous wildlife.
            3.   C3. Use intensity restricted to 5 or less persons per acres;
or equivalent per household.
            4.   C4. Use intensity restricted to 15 or less persons per acre;
or equivalent per household.
            5.   C5. Use intensity restricted to 25 or less persons per acre in
structures/buildings; and 50 or less persons per acre outdoors.
            6.   C6. Use intensity restricted to 100 or less persons per acre.
            7.   C7. Residential land uses permitted, with residential fair
disclosure required.
         (e)   Other land use requirements. Future applications made to
Newberry County requesting approval of manmade structures, which also require
filing a notice with the FAA as per 14 C.F.R. Part 77, § 77.9, or in successor
federal regulations, shall first submit a FAA form 7460-1, Notice of Proposed
Construction or Alteration, to the FAA for a review of impacts to airspace in
the vicinity of the Airport, prior to placing of the request on the Planning
Commission meeting agenda. If the FAA determines an adverse impact to the
airport's airspace may occur, the FAA decision should serve as governing height
limitation for such a man-made structure.
      (7)   Nonconformities.
         (a)   1.   Nonconformities - regulations not retroactive. This
regulation shall not be construed to require the alteration of any lot or
removal, lowering, or other change or alteration of any structure or tree not
conforming to the regulations as of the effective date of this chapter, or
otherwise interfere with the continuance of a nonconforming use. Nothing
contained herein shall require any change in the construction, or intended use
of any property or structure for which the construction or alteration was
started or for which a building permit was acquired prior to the effective date
of this chapter.
            2.   Notwithstanding the preceding provision of this section, the
owner of any existing nonconforming structure or tree is hereby required to
allow the installations operation and maintenance thereon of such markers and
lights as shall be deemed necessary by the Newberry County Airport Commission
to indicate to the operators of aircraft in the vicinity of the airport the
presence of such obstruction. Such markers and lights shall be installed,
operated and maintained at the expense of the Newberry County Airport.
Reference FAA Advisory Circular 70-7460-1K, or successor advisory circulars,
for further guidance.
         (b)   Existing structures in Airport Overlay District. Except as
specifically provided in this section, it is not permissible for any person to
engage in any activity that causes an increase in the extent of nonconformity
of a nonconforming situation. Physical alteration of structures or the
placement of new structures on open land is unlawful if they result in an
increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use or greater
nonconformity with respect to land use limitation.
            1.   Abandoned structures. Whenever the Newberry County Building
and Inspection Department Manager determines that a nonconforming structure has
been abandoned or more than 80% torn down (or damaged more than 80% of the
current county tax value), physically deteriorated, or decayed, no permit shall
be granted that would allow such structure to otherwise deviate from the height
and land use regulations.
            2.   Temporary structures. Temporary structures constructed or
erected incidental to a development, and solely used for the designated
purpose, can only remain while needed and for a maximum of 1 year.
(Ord. 06-11-16, passed 9-21-2016)
§ 153.076 LAND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS.
   (A)   Findings. The County Council finds that the General Assembly has
enacted legislation known as the “South Carolina Local Government Development
Agreement Act”, codified as S.C. Code § 6-31-10 et seq., authorizing, in
certain circumstances, the execution of land development agreements to
encourage comprehensive and capital facilities planning, to ensure the
provision of adequate public facilities for development, to encourage the
efficient use of resources, and to reduce the economic cost of development. The
County Council finds and determines that land development agreements may be
useful to both the private and public sector by providing certainty in zoning,
by setting forth a reasonable schedule of development and by enhancing the
opportunity for comprehensive, planned development, and enacts this section in
furtherance of the authority evolved upon it by the South Carolina Local
Development Agreement Act.
   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.

planning for and all other activity customarily associated with it unless
otherwise specified.
      DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. Includes a building permit, zoning permit,
subdivision approval, rezoning certification, special exception, variance, or
any other official action of local government having the effect of permitting
the development of property
      GOVERNING BODY. The County Council of Newberry County. South Carolina.
      LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATIONS. Ordinances and regulations enacted by the

government zoning, rezoning, sub-division, building construction, or sign
regulations or any other regulation controlling the development of property.
      LAWS. All ordinances, resolutions, regulations, comprehensive plans, land
development regulations, policies and rules adopted by the  governing body, or
its affiliated committees, boards or commissions, affecting the development of
property, including laws governing permitted use of property, governing
density, and governing design, improve-ment and construction standards and
specifications.

must specify which laws in force at the time of the execution of the agreement
shall apply for the term of the agreement. Subsequently enacted laws shall be
applicable to property subject to a land development agreement, unless the
agreement specifies otherwise, or unless, after a public hearing, the County
Council determines that the application of such laws would materially alter or
disrupt the development of the property as contemplated by the agreement, or as
otherwise provided by the South Carolina Local Government Development Agreement

Administrator may request, and as may be otherwise provided in the agreement.
      (2)   If as a result of any periodic review, it appears that a person
subject thereto has committed a material breach of the terms or conditions of
the agreement, such circumstance shall be reported to the County Council by the
Zoning Administrator.
      (3)   Upon receipt of such report, the County Council, or such committee
to which the matter may be referred by Council, if it concurs with the Zoning
Administrator’s report, shall serve written notice to the applicable party,
setting forth with reasonable particularity the nature of the breach and the
evidence supporting the finding and determination of the breach, and providing
the applicable party a reasonable time in which to cure the breach.
      (4)   If such party fails to cure the material breach within the cure
period, the County Council, or the committee to which the matter has been
referred, may unilaterally terminate or modify the land development agreement,

applicable party an opportunity to either rebut the finding and determination
or to consent to an amended development agreement to address the concerns of
the County Council or the committee with respect to its findings and
determination, and has otherwise complied with the provisions of the
development agreement pertaining to a material breach.

amended or cancelled by mutual consent of the parties to the agreement, or by
their successors in interest.

are binding upon, and the benefits of the land development agreement shall

development agreement, the provisions of the agreement shall be modified or
suspended, as necessary, to comply with the state or federal laws or
regulations.
   (N)   Technical codes. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any
and all building, housing, electrical, plumbing and gas codes, now in effect or
hereafter adopted by the County Council, shall apply to any properties subject
to a land development agreement.
   (O)   Enabling legislation. In the event that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that the state act, or any part thereof, invalid
or unenforceable, or in the event that the General Assembly shall amend or
repeal the state act, in whole or in part, each development agreement shall be
reviewed to determine if such change in the state act results in a substantial
impairment of the rights or obligations of any of the parties to the
development agreement. Any party whose rights or obligations under a
development agreement have been substantially impaired by a change in the state
act shall have the right to immediately terminate the agreement as to all
parties thereto by written notice to the parties to the development agreement.

interpretation to the orientation of the yards.
      (1)   Through lots. If both the front and rear yards of a lot abut public
streets, then the rear building line shall respect the alignment of buildings
on the back street while the front building line shall respect the alignment of
buildings on the fronting street.
      (2)   Corner lots with 2 frontages. In the case of corner lots with 2
frontages, a front yard of the required depth shall be provided on the frontage
of the street having the higher traffic volume. Where the traffic volumes on
both streets are approximately equal, the required depth shall be provided on
the street frontage having the minimum lot width. A second front yard of half
the depth required generally for front yards in the district shall be provided
on the other frontage.
      (3)   Corner lots with more than 2 frontages. In the case of corner lots
with more than 2 frontages, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the front
yard requirements, subject to the following limitations:
         (a)   At least 1 front yard shall be provided having full depth
required generally in the district; and
         (b)   No other front yard on the lot shall have less than half of the
full depth required for a front yard.
      (4)   Irregularly shaped lots. On irregularly shaped lots, the location
of required front, side, and rear yards will be determined by the Zoning
Administrator. The determination will be based on the spirit and intent of this
chapter to achieve an appropriate spacing of buildings and orientation to the
street(s). The rear lot line of triangular or otherwise irregularly shaped lots
shall be a line at least 10 feet in length and entirely within the lot,
parallel to and at a maximum distance from the front lot.

roofs over such structures and devices are permitted within required front
yards, provided that they do not constitute a substantial impediment to
visibility across the yards which would contribute to the creation of traffic
hazards, and further provided that servicing operations in connection therewith
can be conducted so as not to interfere with public use of adjacent sidewalks
or public streets.
   (H)   Above-ground sewer backflow prevention devices are expressly
prohibited in the established front yards of buildings.

§ 153.171 SETBACK AND YARD MEASUREMENTS, BUILDABLE AREA.
   (A)   General setback and yard measurements.  The required front, side and
rear setbacks (yards) for individual properties, as set forth for the
particular zoning district within which a given property is located, shall be
measured inward toward the center of said property from all points along the
front, side and rear property lines of the property. Once the required yard
areas of a given lot have been established, the remaining area of the lot which
is not included in any required front, side or rear lot shall be known as the
buildable area within which the approved structure(s) shall be placed. Where a
property abuts a street right-of-way or access easement, the setback shall be
measured from the edge of the right-of-way line or access easement.

BUFFERS, SCREENING AND LANDSCAPING REQUIREMENTS
§ 153.182 BUFFERS.
   (A)   Intent. The purpose of a buffer is to help provide transition between
different types of land uses, to protect significant water bodies, and to break
up and soften the appearance of paved surfaces and provide shade in parking
areas. Notwithstanding any other requirements of this section, buffers shall be
required as follows.
   (B)   Applicability. Buffers shall be required where applicable whenever new
development is approved or an existing use is expanded by more than 25%.
   (C)   Modification of buffer requirements. The requirements of this section
may be further modified by other applicable sections of this zoning ordinance,
including, but not limited to, those provided in §§
153.088 et seq. - Conditional Uses and §§
153.136 et seq. - Special Exceptions. Where requirements differ, the more
restrictive requirement shall apply.
   (D)   Location. Buffers shall not be located on any portion of an existing
street or right-of-way; however, they may occupy part or all of any required
front, side or rear yard setback. Property buffers shall be located on the
outer perimeter of a lot or parcel, extending to the lot or parcel boundary
line.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1635.jpg]
 
   (E)   Use of buffers. A buffer may be used for passive recreation. All other
uses are prohibited, including off-street parking. However, where permitted,
freestanding signs may be installed in required buffers. Otherwise, only
landscaping and approved fences, berms and walls shall be permitted within a
required buffer area.
   (F)   Existing vegetation. Except when necessary to provide access to a site
or to ensure the safety and security of people and property, every reasonable
effort shall be made to protect and retain existing trees and shrubs within
areas of required buffers not actually lying in planned roadways, drainage
ways, building foundation sites and construction activity areas on all
development sites and on sites where a nonresidential use is expanded by more
than 25%.
   (G)   Exceptions to buffer requirements.
      (1)   Where the location of existing permanent buildings on an existing
site reduces the area available for a buffer, buffer requirements shall be met
to the maximum extent practicable.
      (2)   In the event that unusual topography or elevation of a development
site, the size of the parcel to be developed, the soil or sub-surface condition
of the site would make strict adherence to the requirements of this section
serve no meaningful purpose, the Zoning Administrator may alter the
requirements of this section as long as the existing features of the
development site comply with the spirit and intent herein. Such alteration may
occur only at the request of the property owner who shall provide adequate
explanation and evidence that such conditions apply.
      (3)    When an activity is located on a parcel which is separated from
surrounding protected property by existing road or railroad rights-of-way, by
utility rights-of-way, or by water bodies, then the buffering restrictions
applicable to that activity shall be measured across such separation from the
protected property lines.
   (H)   Property buffers.
      (1)   Property buffers shall be required along all applicable property
boundaries for new development sites, redevelopment sites, and whenever an
existing commercial or industrial use is expanded by more than 25%. Buffers for
expansions of existing commercial or industrial uses shall only be required for
the expanded area and/or structure.
      (2)    The property buffer width shall be established for applicable new
or expanded development as follows:

   (I)   Road buffers. 
      (1)   Road buffers shall be required for properties along all road
corridors identified in the Corridor Protection Overlay District for all new
industrial and commercial uses, all industrial and commercial uses expanded by
more than 25%, and all large subdivisions (10 or more lots).
      (2)   Road buffers shall be no less than 6 feet in width at any point and
average 8 feet in width, as measured perpendicularly to the road being
buffered, along the entire length of the property.
   (J)   Stream and wetland buffers. Land-disturbing activities for
construction in, on, or under a lake or natural watercourse shall be planned
and conducted to minimize the extent and duration of disturbance of the stream
channel or lake bed. Where relocation of a stream is an essential part of the
proposed activity, the relocation shall be planned and executed to minimize
changes in the stream flow characteristics, except where the developer or
landowner demonstrates that the significant alteration of the flow
characteristics is justified.
      (1)   An undisturbed, natural buffer shall be maintained along each
perennial stream within the county's jurisdiction. The minimum buffer width
shall be 50 feet from each side of the stream as measured from the top of the
bank.
      (2)   No land-disturbing activities shall take place within a stream
buffer or delineated wetland area, except for required streets and associated
facilities, utility mains and easements, and/or greenways and pedestrian paths.
Roads and golf courses may cross a buffer, provided they do not cross at an
angle of less than 60 degrees.
      (3)   Streams, wetlands, and required buffers shall be shown on all site
plans and subdivision plats for approval and recording.
(Ord. 06-11-16, passed 9-21-2016)
§ 153.183 SCREENING.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of screening is to provide a visual barrier
between an unsightly or out of scale feature or incompatible land uses or
activities and the view from public streets and abutting properties.
   (B)   Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to all
required screening in this zoning ordinance, including screening required in §§
153.088 et seq. - Conditional Uses and §§
153.136 et seq. - Special Exceptions. Screening shall be required where
applicable whenever new development is approved or an existing use is expanded
by more than 25%.
   (C)   Opaque screening required. Unless otherwise specified in this section,
all required screening shall be visually opaque. An opaque screen is intended
to exclude visual contact with the screened feature, land use or activity from
any protected property, public street, or right-of-way. An opaque screen may be
composed of a wall, fence, building, berm, or a combination thereof; as
approved by the Zoning Administrator. A wall, fence, or building, or
combination thereof, must be used to screen features. Natural areas, as
detailed below, may also be used to screen land uses or activities.
      (1)   Natural areas. Where an existing vegetated area is located on the
same property as the proposed development; is within or includes the required
buffer; and is of sufficient height, length and depth and contains adequate and
sufficient healthy vegetation to provide a visually opaque screen as required
in this section, the Zoning Administrator may determine that further
improvements shall not be required. Such area must remain intact and be
protected throughout all phases of development, including any land disturbance,
per the requirements in §
153.184(C)(2). Such areas may not be used for the screening of features.
   (D)   Height of required screening. The height of required screening shall
be sufficient to block the view of the feature, land use or activity for which
the screening is required from the protected property, public street, or right-
of-way that is to be provided such protection as approved by the Zoning
Administrator; however, all required screening shall be opaque to a minimum
height of 6 feet above grade and shall not be required to exceed 8 feet in
height above grade.
   (E)   Length of required screening. The length of a required screen shall be
that which is necessary to screen the feature, land use or activity from
protected properties, streets, and rights-of-way as provided in this section,
however screening cannot obstruct the line of sight for vehicular traffic and
must comply with the requirements of §
153.032 - Visibility Requirements, Sight Triangle. The Zoning Administrator may
approve accommodations for reasonable access to the property.
      (1)   Where an existing residential property is to be afforded screening
protection and the adjacent property line exceeds 200 feet in length, the
screen need only extend 100 feet beyond either extent of the existing use to be
protected by screening to meet the screening requirements of this section. The
extent of the existing use shall include any primary structures, and structures
and associated area accessory to the primary use afforded such protection.
      (2)   Where a vacant residentially zoned property is to be afforded
screening protection and the adjacent property line of the proposed use exceeds
200 feet in length, the following requirements shall apply to meet the
screening requirements of this section. The extent of the proposed use shall
include any structures, parking, and outdoor storage or work areas associated
with the proposed use.
         (a)   If the proposed use is included in the use category Commercial -
Wholesale or the use Manufacturing - Limited as provided in §
153.073(D), the screen need only extend 25 feet beyond either extent of the
proposed use.
         (b)   If the proposed use is included in the use category of
Commercial - Retail or is any Manufacturing use other than those included in
the Manufacturing - Limited use as provided in §
153.073(D), the screen need only extend 50 feet beyond either extent of the
proposed use.
   (F)   Screening required as a condition. All screening required by §§
153.088 et seq. - Conditional Uses and §§
153.136 et seq. - Special Exceptions, except for screening required for
features as provided in division (G) below, must be installed within the
required buffer between the land use or activity to be screened and the
adjacent property, road, road right-of-way, or use being provided such
protection. Where a land use or activity is to be screened, the opaque screen
may be composed of a wall, fence, building, berm, or a combination thereof; as
approved by the Zoning Administrator. Natural areas, as provided in division
(C)(1), may be used to screen land uses or activities.
   (G)   Features for which screening is required. Screening to minimize views
from adjacent properties, roads and public rights-of-way shall be required for
the following features, and additional features as provided in §§
153.088 et seq. - Conditional Uses and §§
153.136 et seq. - Special Exceptions. To maximize site line obstruction, a
screen shall be placed immediately adjacent to the feature to be screened
except as otherwise approved by the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning
Administrator may approve accommodations for reasonable access, use, and
maintenance of the features and equipment, as necessary.
      (1)   Mechanical equipment for all uses other than single-family
residential and duplexes at ground level and mounted on roofs, including, but
not limited to HVAC equipment, transformers and generators.
         (a)   Roof mounted mechanical equipment shall not be visible in any
direction from any adjacent existing residential properties, properties in
residential zoning districts, roads and public rights-of-way. Where it can be
clearly demonstrated that such equipment is not visible from any adjacent
existing residential properties, properties in residential zoning districts,
roads and public rights-of-way, the Zoning Administrator may waive screening
requirements.
         (b)   Screening of roof-mounted equipment shall be accomplished by
solid and permanent roof-mounted screens, compatible with the architectural
style, materials and color of the building upon which the equipment is located.
      (2)   Service areas for all uses other than single-family residential and
duplexes, including, but not limited to, garbage and trash collection areas,
exposed non-power utility fixtures, power utility substations, and delivery and
loading areas.
      (3)   Open, outdoor storage of materials, including, but not limited to,
materials used in assembly, fabrication or processing, and waste materials, in
the R2, LC, GC and IND districts as provided in §
153.117 - Open Storage.
      (4)   Communications towers as provided in §
153.108 - Communications Towers and Antennas or §
153.053 - Special Exception.
      (5)   Junked vehicle storage as provided in §
153.099 - Junked Vehicle Storage.
      (6)   Transport containers used as accessory storage as provided in §
153.118 - Transport Containers as Accessory Storage.
   (H)   Land uses for which screening is required. Screening to minimize views
between the following new land uses or land uses expanded by more than 25%
shall be required. Where a land use or activity is to be screened, the opaque
screen may be composed of a wall, fence, building, berm, or a combination
thereof; as approved by the Zoning Administrator. Natural areas, as provided in
division (C)(1), may be used to screen land uses or activities.
      (1)   Commercial uses. An opaque screen is required between all
structures and facilities related to commercial uses and all adjacent existing
residential uses or residentially zoned properties. The screen shall be
installed within the required buffers between the commercial use and any
adjacent existing residential uses or residentially zoned properties.
      (2)   Industrial uses. An opaque screen is required between all
structures and facilities related to industrial uses and all adjacent existing
residential uses and residentially zoned properties. The screen shall be
installed within the required buffers between the industrial use and any
adjacent existing residential uses or residentially zoned properties.
   (I)   Berms. The following standards shall apply to all berms.
      (1)   No structures, including fences and walls, shall be placed on a
berm unless approved by the Zoning Administrator as part of the landscaping
requirements for a development site.
      (2)   Berms shall not be used for the display of vehicles or other
merchandise.
      (3)   If included in the landscape design, berms shall:
         (a)   Have a minimum height of 2 feet, a minimum crown width of 2
feet, and a side slope with a width to height ratio of no greater than 3 to 1.
No berm shall exceed 4 feet in height, not including associated landscaping.
         (b)   Be designed and constructed with an undulating appearance which
mimics, as much as is practicable, a natural topographical feature of the site.
         (c)   Be substantially planted and covered with live vegetation. No
berm shall consist entirely of turf grass, ground cover, mulch or similar
material.
         (d)   Be fully installed, planted, stabilized and maintained prior to
issuance of a certificate of zoning compliance or occupancy.
         (e)   Be designed to prevent standing water and not to impede the flow
of stormwater from adjacent properties.
   (J)   Fences and walls. All fences and walls shall meet the requirements of
§
153.033 - Fences and Walls. Chain-link fences with strips composed of wood,
plastic, metal, or other material are expressly prohibited for use in meeting
screening requirements, unless otherwise required by this chapter.
(Ord. 06-11-16, passed 9-21-2016)
§ 153.184 LANDSCAPING.
   In order to promote careful landscaping of outdoor areas, soften and enhance
the manmade environment, reduce summer heat and provide shade, and to assist
with stormwater drainage, the following minimum standards shall apply in all
zoning districts where landscaping is required, unless otherwise noted.
   (A)   General standards.
      (1)   All required plantings installed shall be:
         (a)   Nursery grown stock that is free from pests or growth problems;

and standards set forth by the American Nursery and Landscape Association, ANSI
Z60.1-2004, as amended;
         (c)   Installed in a manner that is not intrusive to above and below
ground utilities; and
         (d)   Selected from the list of preferred plant species for Newberry
County unless otherwise certified by a licensed landscape architect or arborist
as suitable for Newberry County's climate and comparable in habit and growth
rate to a plant included in the list of preferred plant species for Newberry
County.
      (2)   All required landscaping shall be included in the required site
plan as provided in §
153.184(G) - Site plan required.
      (3)   The use of native species and related cultivars is encouraged.
      (4)   Clustering and/or random spacing of plants and trees is encouraged
to produce a natural appearance in the landscape, except where uniformity is
required for opaque screening.
      (5)   Landscaping, including berms, shall be installed and maintained so
as not to interfere with the sight distance requirements of this zoning
ordinance or the sight distance needs of vehicular traffic in parking areas and
at entrance and exit locations.
      (6)   Shrubs and trees shall be installed no closer than 2 feet to a
curb, gutter, sidewalk or building. Small maturing trees shall be planted no
closer than 10 feet to a building, medium maturing trees no closer than 20 feet
to a building and large maturing trees no closer than 25 feet to a building,
unless otherwise required in §
153.184 - Landscaping.
      (7)   Shrubs shall not be planted within 6 feet of tree trunks.
      (8)   In landscaped areas adjacent to parking spaces or street curbs, no
plant material with the potential to reach over 6 inches in height may be
located within 12 inches of the curb or other protective barrier. This is
intended to protect planted materials from damage by car bumpers and car doors.
      (9)   The Zoning Administrator will conduct inspections as needed to
determine that required landscaping is properly installed and maintained as
provided in this chapter.
   (B)   Tree size. The following standards shall apply to all required trees
at the time of planting.
 
Required Tree Size at Time of Planting
Type                 Minimum Caliper1
Large Maturing Tree  1.5 inches
Medium Maturing Tree 1.5 inches
Small Maturing Tree  1.0 inches
1   Caliper shall be measured 6 inches above the ground
 
   (C)   Existing vegetation. Except when necessary to provide access to a site
or to insure the safety and security of people and property, every reasonable
effort shall be made to protect and retain existing vegetation in required
buffers and setbacks, except in planned roadways, driveways, and drainage ways.
       (1)   Existing vegetation incorporated into landscaping requirements.
Existing vegetation may count towards meeting the landscaping requirements of
this section as long as such are:
          (a)   Free from pests or structural problems;
         (b)   Clearly shown on the site plan;
         (c)   Approved by the Zoning Administrator prior to development as
meeting the intent of the landscaping requirements;

existing vegetation shall be submitted and approved by the Zoning Administrator
prior to clearing, grading or development of the site.
          (b)   Protection during development required. All existing trees
included in tree requirements for parking lots must be protected from damage by
the property owner by the establishment of a tree protection zone. A tree
protection zone for each tree, at a minimum, shall be equal to a 2 foot radius
on the ground for every inch of diameter at breast height (DBH) of the tree.
The tree protection zone 2017 S-13shall be protected by a sturdy, durable, and
visible fence installed before any land disturbance begins and in place during
all phases of development and construction. Each tree protection zone must be
designated as such with signs posted visibly on all sides of the fenced
protection area, with lettering and colors that provide maximum readability in
terms of distance and contrast.
   (D)   Irrigation. All newly-planted and relocated trees and plant material
shall be watered by permanent irrigation systems and shall be watered
sufficiently to ensure healthy growth and longevity in the landscape.
    (E)   Exceptions. The Zoning Administrator may alter the requirements of
this section as long as the existing features complement or enhance the spirit
and intent herein, to reasonably accommodate the following circumstances.
       (1)   In the event that unusual topography or elevation of a development
site, the size of the parcel to be developed, the soil or sub-surface condition
of the site, or other existing conditions on the site would make strict
adherence to the requirements of this section serve no meaningful purpose or
would make it physically impractical to install and maintain the required
landscaping. Such alterations may occur only at the request of the property
owner, who shall submit a plan to the Zoning Administrator showing existing
site features that would prevent adherence to the requirements of this section,
the requirements of this chapter that would be difficult or impossible to meet,
and proposed alternatives to the requirements that would ensure that the spirit
and intent of these landscaping regulations will be met.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may require changes to any planting
schedule or plant size requirement and may require plant substitution when, in
their opinion, the size, nature, and/or spacing of plantings will compromise
the safety and security of the public.
      (3)   The Zoning Administrator may approve revisions to landscaping in an
approved site plan in order to accommodate seasonal planting problems or a lack
of plant availability as long as:
         (a)   There is no significant reduction in the quantity of plant
material;
         (b)   There is no significant change in the size or location of plant
materials; and
         (c)   The plant substitutions are of the same general category and
have the same general design characteristics (growth rate, habit, etc.) as the
materials being replaced.
   (F)   Landscape and tree installation and maintenance responsibility. All
landscape materials required or installed voluntarily by the developer, whether
used for screening, property buffers, road buffers, or other required
landscaping areas shall be properly installed and maintained by the property
owner. Maintenance includes all actions necessary to keep landscaping materials
healthy, neat and orderly in appearance, and free of litter and debris. Any
landscape material lost, stolen, or vandalized, or which has died or become
irreparably or irreversibly damaged, by disease, pests, or for any other reason
shall be removed and replaced unless, in the determination of the Zoning
Administrator, the maturity of the remaining vegetation compensates for the
loss of an individual shrub or tree, thereby causing the intent of the
landscape standard to still be met without replacement.
    (G)   Site plan required. A site plan, drawn to scale, is required for all
landscaped areas as required in §
153.184 - Landscaping. The site plan shall include the following elements.
      (1)   A scale bar and north arrow.
      (2)   Property boundaries for the project site.
      (3)   Location of adjacent property lines of existing residential uses
and residentially zoned properties.
      (4)   Existing adjacent streets (including names) and rights-of-way.
      (5)   Existing berms, walls, fences, and natural areas/vegetation to be
incorporated into the required landscaping and screening.
      (6)   Required buffers and setbacks on the project site.
      (7)   Existing and proposed above ground utility lines that would impact
required tree planting.
      (8)   Location, dimensions, and composition (plants, ground covers,
materials, etc.) of all required landscaping, to include plant species and
size, and all proposed berms, fences, or walls.
      (9)   Proposed driveways, roads, parking lot design (including spaces,
medians, walkways, curbs, etc.), additional parking not in a parking lot,
loading areas, and other areas of note within required buffers and planting
areas.
   (H)   Landscaping in the Corridor Protection Overlay District. The
landscaping standards included in this section shall apply, as appropriate, to
all required landscaped areas in the Corridor Protection Overlay District
(CPO). Landscaping shall be provided for all new industrial and commercial uses
and large subdivisions (10 or more lots) and all industrial and commercial uses
expanded by more than 25% that are located within the CPO.
      (1)   Road buffers. The following landscaping is required within required
road buffers in the CPO as identified in §
153.182(I) - Road Buffers.
         (a)   Large maturing trees shall be planted unless overhead utility
lines or other factors require the use of medium or small maturing trees, as
approved by the Zoning Administrator. Fractions generated by applying the
minimum number of plants to the actual linear footage of the buffer shall be
rounded up to the next whole number. (For example, 125 feet of buffer length
would be required to have 2 large trees or 3 medium trees or 4 small trees.)
Existing trees may be included in this calculation, if the trees are healthy
and structurally sound, are more than 12 inches in diameter at breast height in
size, and are located within the road buffer area. The planting schedule for
road buffers shall be as follows:
 
PLANTING SCHEDULE FOR ROAD BUFFERS
Type                  Minimum Number Per Linear Foot of Road Buffer
Large Maturing Trees  0.015
Medium Maturing Trees 0.04
Small Maturing Trees  0.06
 
         (b)   In addition to the tree planting requirements, a minimum of 30%
of the buffer area shall be planted in a combination of approved shrubs,
perennials, ornamental grasses, live ground cover, or turfgrass, except that
additional plantings may not be required in significant forested areas
maintained within the road buffer if so approved by the Zoning Administrator.
All other areas, including bare ground under trees, shall be covered in a
minimum of 3 inches of mulch, turfgrass, live ground cover, or a combination of
these elements. Spacing and arrangement of plant material must be primarily
based on the mature dimensions of the plants. Plant materials shall be designed
and installed in a manner that provides variability of height at maturity.
         (c)   Berms shall be allowed to augment required road buffer plantings
as long as a minimum of 50% of all required trees and plantings shall be
planted along the street front portion of the berm.
   (I)   Parking lot tree canopy. The intent of the parking lot tree canopy
requirements is to break up and soften the appearance of expanses of paved
areas and reduce ambient temperatures within off-street parking lots by
providing shade.
      (1)   Applicability. The following standards shall apply to all new off-
street parking areas with 10 or more parking spaces and all expansions to
existing parking areas which add 10 or more spaces, unless otherwise noted. In
an expansion, only the area of expansion is required to be included in the
calculations provided in this section.
      (2)   Required trees. 
         (a)   Large maturing trees must be provided in each of-street parking
lot at a minimum average density of 1 tree for every 10 parking spaces in the
lot. Fractions shall be rounded to the nearest whole number.
         (b)   Existing trees. Existing trees may be included in this
calculation, if the trees are healthy and structurally sound, are more than 12
inches in diameter at breast height in size, and are located within the tree
planting area as described in divisions (3) and (6).
      (3)   Parking lot perimeter. A buffer of at least 10 feet in width
immediately surrounding the off-street parking area, except where the lot is
permitted to abut or directly adjoin a building and excluding access points, is
required for all off-street parking as regulated by this section. Large
maturing trees as required in division (I)(2) - Required Trees may be planted
in such buffer areas, as specified in the following subsections.
      (4)   Responsibility for installation. The property owner of the
developing property shall be responsible for all required tree installation and
maintenance.
      (5)   Tree size. Required trees shall be large maturing trees, however
smaller trees must be substituted for required large trees whenever a larger
tree would interfere with existing overhead utility lines.
      (6)   Tree location. A minimum of 1 large maturing tree shall be located
within 100 feet of every parking space. The measurement shall be taken at
breast height for each tree.
         (a)   No tree may be planted closer than 3.5 feet to the back of a
curb or the paved portion of the parking lot.
         (b)   No required tree shall be planted or installed within an
underground or overhead utility easement or a drainage easement without the
consent of the county and the easement holder at the time of site plan
approval.

IMAGES/0-0-0-1639.jpg]
 
   (7)   Tree planting areas. Each planting area for a required tree shall be
pervious, a minimum of 100 square feet in size, and no less than 6 feet in
width at any point, with an average width of 8 feet.
   (8)   Planting areas - design and materials. The area between and
immediately surrounding required trees and in tree islands shall be designed
and installed in an orderly and attractive manner conducive to the ongoing
health of the plant materials, and shall include ground cover, mulch, or
plantings including, but not limited to: small maturing shrubs (no more than 2
feet tall at maturity), annuals, perennials, ornamental grasses, turf grasses,
or a minimum of 3 inches of landscaping mulch. Bare ground, including areas
under trees, shall not be visible within these areas.
   (9)   Tree planting, maintenance and replacement. Required trees shall be
properly maintained by the property owners. Maintenance includes all actions
necessary to keep trees healthy, neat and orderly in appearance.
         (a)   Any trees lost, stolen, vandalized or irreparably or
irreversibly damaged, to include disease or pest infestation, or dead shall be
removed and replaced. In the event that any tree functioning to meet the
standards of division (I) is severely damaged due to an unusual weather
occurrence or natural catastrophe, the owner shall have 1 growing season to
replace or replant.
         (b)   Any tree with a diameter at breast height of at least 12 inches
which is damaged or removed shall be replaced with a tree which at maturity
will have a diameter at breast height of equal size to that tree it is
replacing. The size at planting of such replacement tree shall meet the
requirements of division (I)(5) - tree size. Replacement trees shall be planted
within close vicinity of the tree they are replacing. If the area is too small
or in any way not conducive to the health and growth of the new tree, the
Zoning Administrator may approve a more suitable location on the site.
         (c)   All trees shall be installed and maintained to current industry
standards as provided by American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and/or
the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) Best Management Practices
Series.
         (d)   In no instance will Newberry County be responsible for the
maintenance of any vegetation located on any property that is not owned by the
county.
   (J)   Time for installation of required landscaping and trees.
      (1)   Time limit. All landscaping as required by this zoning ordinance
shall be completed in accordance with the approved site plan prior to issuance
of a certificate of occupancy for the site.
      (2)   Extensions and exceptions. The Newberry County Zoning Administrator
may grant exceptions and extensions to the above time limit under the following
conditions:
         (a)    Extensions may be granted due to unusual environmental
conditions, such as drought, ice, over-saturated soil (deep mud), or
inappropriate planting;
         (b)    Exceptions may be granted due to the substitution or
unavailability of tree or plant species or acceptable tree size as specified on
the site plan; and
         (c)   Exceptions may be granted due to circumstances beyond the
developer's or property owner's control, such as incomplete construction or
utility work to occur in a proposed landscaped area within 30 days after
expected site completion. Exceptions may be granted provided that the developer
or property owner submits a letter from the utility company to the county
stating the estimated installation date.
       (3)   Inspections. A permanent certificate of occupancy for the
development shall not be issued unless the landscaping required under this
section is installed in accordance with these standards and in accordance with
the approved site plan or subdivision plat.
(Ord. 06-11-16, passed 9-21-2016)
§ 153.185 OPEN SPACE.
   The following standards shall apply to all required open space unless
otherwise noted.
   (A)   In residential cluster developments, multi-family developments,
equestrian subdivisions, manufactured home parks, planned development
districts, and major subdivisions as defined in
Chapter 154 - Land Development Regulations of the Newberry County Code of
Ordinances:
      (1)   No existing development shall be expanded or enlarged unless the
minimum open space requirements of this section are met.
      (2)   Required buffers may be included in open space if held in common
ownership.
   (B)   Open space requirements shall be calculated using the open space
ratio.
   (C)   Open space may include recreational areas, wooded areas, and
environmental open space. Environmental open space is defined as any pervious
area set aside for the protection, enhancement, or creation of water quality
buffers, wildlife habitat, view corridors, flood hazard mitigation, or similar
environmental features and may or may not include public access.
   (D)   All required open space shall be well buffered from moving vehicles.
   (E)   Required open space shall be substantially clustered around the edges
of the development to buffer the development against adjacent tracts of land,
especially land used for agriculture and low density residential development.
   (F)   The land used for required open space shall have an average slope of
5% or less with no portion of the land exceeding a 15% slope.
   (G)   Open space areas set aside in residential cluster developments may be
used for onsite treatment of stormwater.
   (H)   Required open space may be public or private. The planning,
construction, and maintenance of privately owned facilities shall adhere to the
following:
      (1)   Private open space intended to count towards the open space
requirements of this section shall be held and maintained by a legally
constituted homeowner's association or corporation. Land designated as open
space may not be separately sold, subdivided or developed.
      (2)   Public open space may be held by any private non-profit
organization created for such purposes that has been approved by the County
Council. Public open space shall:
         (a)   Have direct access from public streets;
         (b)   Be visible and easily accessible; and
         (c)   Have multiple points of entry.
      (3)   High maintenance cost facilities such as swimming pools shall not
be counted in determining compliance with the minimum open space requirements
of this section. Bridges along pedestrian and bicycle paths and similar high
cost facilities shall not be permitted as an integral part of any required open
space or recreational area unless no feasible alternative exists.
      (4)   Each phase of a phased development shall meet the minimum
requirements for open space. All plans for such developments shall demonstrate
compliance for each phase. No certificates of occupancy shall be issued until
all such required facilities have been installed or bonded by the developer and
approved by the county.
      (5)   The responsibility for the perpetual maintenance of open space
shall be with the owner. Maintenance for required open spaces shall include
ensuring that no hazards, nuisances or unhealthy conditions exist; and keeping
the property neat and orderly in appearance and free of litter and debris.
Failure to adequately maintain open space shall constitute a violation of this
chapter and shall subject the owner to any and all remedies permitted herein.
(Ord. 06-11-16, passed 9-21-2016)
PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS
§ 153.197 OFF-STREET PARKING REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Permanent off-street parking for all structures and uses of land,
except parking for individual single-family residences, shall conform to the
minimum requirements of §
153.198 - Off-Street Parking Table. These standards, to be used as a guide to
the Zoning Administrator, are based on parking standards for general land use
categories. The developer is ultimately responsible for ensuring that
sufficient parking is provided.
      (2)   Required off-street parking must be provided on the same lot or
parcel or within 400 feet of the main entrance of the principal use for which
it is required, either:
            (a)   In a parking facility under the same ownership as the such
principal use;
            (b)   Offsite in an area approved by the county as shared parking
for the use; or
            (c)   Where such parking is to be provided by a public garage or
facility, as approved by the Zoning Administrator. Shared parking areas are
encouraged and shall be permitted whenever the Zoning Administrator determines
that the minimum parking requirements can be met for each use.
      (3)   Required off-street parking shall meet the requirements of §
153.184(I) - Parking Lot Tree Canopy.
      (4)   A plan must be submitted for all proposed off-street parking that
clearly delineates the location and dimensions of parking spaces, aisles,
maneuvering areas, stacking spaces, and driveways. The plan shall provide the
location and description of all required trees and tree planting areas as
required in §
153.184(I) - Parking Lot Tree Canopy.
      (5)   Off-street parking is permitted in required yard and setback areas
as provided in this section, but shall not be permitted in any required buffer
area.
      (6)   Expansions to an existing parking area which increase the parking
capacity by 10 or more spaces shall be required to comply with all applicable
requirements of this section and §
153.184(I) - Parking Lot Tree Canopy.
   (B)   Off-street parking extending into residential zoning district.
Required off-street parking for a commercial or industrial use may extend up to
120 feet into a residential zoning district, provided:
      (1)   The parking area adjoins the property on which the principal
commercial or industrial use is located; and
      (2)   The parking area access is to the same street as the principal use.
   (C)   Combined parking areas. Combined parking areas serving 2 or more
principal uses shall contain spaces equal in number to the total of spaces
required for all principal uses served. This requirement also applies if the
principal uses are the same or have the same parking requirements.
      (1)   The Zoning Administrator may accept a lower number of parking
spaces than required in §
153.201 - Off-street Parking Table (or a specific number of spaces for a use
not listed) based upon applicant-submitted parking data such as a shared
parking analysis or appropriate standards from the Institute of Traffic
Engineers (ITE) or other credible sources, provided the following:
         (a)   If the Zoning Administrator accepts the lower number of parking
spaces than is required in §
153.201 - Off-street Parking Table, the plan for the site must be designed to
accommodate all required parking, and all areas set aside to accommodate
unconstructed parking. Should the Zoning Administrator determine that the
originally constructed parking is insufficient, he shall order that the
unconstructed parking and/or loading be provided and a certificate of occupancy
for such obtained within 12 months of such order. The design and location of
these unconstructed parking spaces shall meet design standards as provided in
this chapter and the following:
            1.   The area necessary to accommodate these unconstructed spaces
shall not be included as part of the site's minimum open space requirement.
            2.   The area necessary to accommodate these unconstructed spaces
shall be included in the impervious coverage for the site and accounted for in
the drainage design.
            3.   Until or unless such spaces are needed, as determined by the
Zoning Administrator, the area shall be maintained as open space, and the
clearing of trees and other vegetation and subsequent adherence to the
requirements of §
153.184(I) - Parking Lot Tree Canopy and §
153.182 - Buffers, shall not occur until or unless such additional parking is
required to be constructed.
         (b)   Any shared parking analysis shall follow the guidelines provided
in the most recent edition of the Urban Land Institute's “Shared Parking”
publication. Any off-site parking to be used shall require the recording of a
perpetual easement prior to occupancy in the Office of the Register of Deeds of
Newberry County, the form and substance of which must be approved by the Zoning
Administrator.
   (D)   Calculation of off-street parking requirements.
      (1)   The number of parking spaces required shall be calculated so that
fractional portions of parking spaces are considered a full space (i.e. 56.12
parking spaces shall be calculated as 57 total spaces).
      (2)   Calculation for required off-street parking for any bar, lounge,
nightclub, or restaurant shall take into account all indoor and outdoor seating
areas.
   (E)   Change or expansion of an existing use.
      (1)   Change in the use of an existing structure or site shall require
compliance with the minimum parking requirements applicable to the new use.
However, if the new use also requires additional buffer area or parking lot
canopy, the Zoning Administrator may permit a maximum 20% reduction in the
required number of spaces to accommodate additional buffer area or trees.
      (2)   Any expansion of an existing building or use shall require review
by the Zoning Administrator to determine additional off-street parking
necessary to accommodate the expansion area or change, per the requirements of
§
153.198 - Off-street Parking Table.
      (3)   Any addition of dwelling units, personnel, seats, chairs, boat
slips, or other similar changes shall require review by the Zoning
Administrator to determine additional parking necessary to accommodate that
addition or change, per the requirements of §
153.198 - Off-street Parking Table.
   (F)   Parking for uses not listed in table. Parking for uses not expressly
provided for in §
153.198 - Off-street Parking Table shall be determined by the Zoning
Administrator, who shall apply the unit of measurement set forth in the table
for a use that he deems to be most similar to the proposed use.

   Off-street parking spaces shall meet the following design standards.
   (A)   Parking space dimensions. Parking stalls, except for parking for the
physically handicapped as outlined in division (D), shall be not less than 9
feet by 19 feet, except that a maximum of 10% of the total number of stalls may
be 8.5 feet by 18 feet. However, the dimensions of all parallel parking stalls
shall be not less than 9 feet by 24 feet.
   (B)   Minimum parking aisle widths. Parking aisles shall be 24 feet in width
if serving 2-way traffic and 12 feet in width if serving 1-way traffic.
      (1)   No parking aisle serving the general public that contains more than
10 parking spaces shall dead end. Any parking aisle that dead ends shall be
provided a suitable turnaround.
      (2)   Driveways shall not exceed 24 feet in width at the street.
      (3)   All off-street parking shall be served by interior circulation
drives. No private off-street parking spaces shall directly connect to public
streets. This standard shall not apply to single-family detached residential,
duplex, patio home and townhouse developments.
   (C)   Construction requirements.
      (1)   Paving - larger parking areas. All off-street parking areas for 10
or more vehicles shall be paved with asphalt, concrete, brick pavers, or
approved pervious pavement and pavers as detailed in division (C)(3), except
for areas used for overflow, special events, and peak parking, and parking
areas serving single-family detached and duplex housing. However, parking
designed to accommodate the regular parking of heavy construction and
industrial vehicles shall be allowed to pave those areas with suitable gravel.
Any parking on such site intended to park automobiles, small service vehicles,
and similar passenger vehicles shall be paved.
      (2)   Paving - small parking areas. Surfaces for all driveways and off-
street parking areas for less than 10 vehicles may consist of asphalt,
concrete, crushed stone, gravel, approved pervious pavement and pavers as
detailed in division (C)(3), or other similar material approved by the Zoning
Administrator, except for areas used for overflow, special events, and peak
parking, and parking areas serving single-family detached and duplex housing.
      (3)   Pervious pavement and pavers. Permeable pavements are permitted
including interlocking paving systems and porous pavement, provided handicapped
spaces and pathways are designed and installed to meet Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) requirements. Open-grid pavers may be used in peripheral
and overflow parking areas.
      (4)   Any non-paved surface used for overflow, special events, and peak
parking that cannot be maintained with healthy, living turf grass or similar
live ground cover shall be paved with approved permeable pavers.
      (5)   Parking lot construction shall be designed to minimize off-site
storm water runoff.
      (6)   Driveways and parking areas shall be paved with a minimum 10 foot
wide apron made of asphalt, concrete, brick pavers, or similar hard material
approved by the Zoning Administrator and suitable for driveway use, which
extends at least 10 feet from the edge of the public street to prevent washout
into the public street and to protect the edge of pavement. This standard shall
not apply to single-family residential and duplex uses.
      (7)   On-site turnaround required. On-site turnaround area adequate to
accommodate typical passenger vehicles shall be provided for all parking
spaces. This standard shall not apply to single-family detached residential,
duplex, patio home and townhouse developments.
      (8)   Marking. Off-street parking, except for single-family detached
residential use, shall be clearly marked on the ground by painted lines, curbs
or other means to indicate individual spaces. Signs or markers, as approved by
the Zoning Administrator, shall be used as necessary to ensure efficient and
safe vehicle operation on the lot.
      (9)   Circulation. All off-street parking shall be served by interior
circulation drives. No private off-street parking spaces shall directly connect
to public streets. This standard shall not apply to single-family detached
residential, duplex, patio home and townhouse developments.
      (10)   Connectivity. New parking areas on adjacent non-residential and
non-industrial properties shall be connected unless the Zoning Administrator
determines that topography or other natural features or other factors prevents
it.
   (D)   Parking for the physically handicapped. Parking for the physically
handicapped shall be provided per the requirements of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (ADA) of 1990, as amended; and the International Building
Code, as amended and adopted by Newberry County. Each space shall be paved,
prominently outlined in blue paint, and shall include appropriate signage
provided per the requirements of the ADA and the International Building Code.
   (E)   Lighting requirements. Adequate lighting shall be provided if off-
street parking spaces are to be used at night. Equipment for lighting parking
facilities shall be shielded so as to prevent sky glow and light trespass onto
adjacent residential areas, public streets and rights-of-way.
   (F)   Tree canopy. Off-street parking areas for 10 or more vehicles shall be
landscaped and buffer areas provided in accordance with the provisions of §
153.184(I) - Parking Lot Canopy.
   (G)   Drive-thru stacking. In addition to required parking spaces, drive-
thru facilities shall provide a minimum of 5 stacking spaces per drive-thru
facility, window, or bay, with the following exceptions. Stacking spaces shall
be located entirely outside of a required driveway or parking aisle needed to
access required parking spaces.
      (1)   Fast food restaurants shall have an additional 5 stacking spaces. A
minimum of 5 of the total stacking spaces shall be located at or prior to the

SIGN REGULATIONS
§ 153.213 PURPOSE, INTENT AND APPLICABILITY.
   In order to ensure that signage is designed and placed to minimize the
distractions and obstruction of view that contribute to traffic hazards and
endanger public safety, and to prevent signs from dominating the visual
appearance of the areas in which they are located, the following standards
shall apply to all signs in all zoning districts unless otherwise noted.
(Ord. 06-11-16, passed 9-21-2016)
§ 153.214 PERMIT REQUIRED.
   It shall be unlawful to construct, enlarge, modify, move, or to replace any
sign or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a zoning permit for
such sign from the county. Notwithstanding this provision, changing or
replacing the permanent copy on an existing lawful sign shall not require a
permit, provided the copy change does not change the nature of the sign so as
to render it in violation of this chapter.

§ 153.215 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The following provisions shall apply to all signs as noted.
   (A)   Materials. Signs must be constructed of durable materials approved by
the Zoning Administrator, and maintained in good condition. All signs, except
for banners, flags, temporary signs, and window signs conforming in all
respects to the requirements of this chapter shall be constructed of permanent
materials and shall be permanently attached to the ground, a building, or
another structure by direct attachment to a rigid wall, frame, or structure.
Deficiencies such as chipped paint, broken plastic, missing letters and exposed
light bulbs shall be evidence of a lack of maintenance. All temporary signs
shall be constructed of materials and printed on by inks capable of
withstanding normal weather conditions.
   (B)   Code compliance required. All signs shall be constructed and installed
in accordance with the applicable provisions of the International Building
Code.
   (C)   Sign illumination. Devices illuminating signs shall be placed and
shielded in a manner such that the illuminating rays or reflections shall not
be directed into any residence, residential district, sleeping room in any
district, or public right-of-way. Light produced by a changeable copy billboard
(otherwise known as electronic billboards) should not exceed 0.3 Foot-candles
over ambient light levels. Furthermore, such billboard must be able to
automatically adjust as ambient light levels change. An automatic light-sensing
device (such as photocell or similar technology) should be utilized for
adjusting the electronic billboard's brightness. Sunset-sunrise tables and
manual methods of controlling brightness are not acceptable as a primary means
of controlling brightness. If light levels are suspected to exceed required
light levels by the Zoning Administrator through observation, the property
owner will be required to conduct and document light level tests as needed to
demonstrate that the light generated does not exceed the values established.
Such tests must be conducted by a qualified professional with proven expertise
in the area of light level measurement and testing.
   (D)   Sign height. Unless otherwise regulated herein, no freestanding sign
shall extend more than 40 feet above the surrounding grade.
   (E)   Sign placement. All signs shall be placed at least 10 feet from any
street right-of-way as measured from the closest part of the sign, unless
otherwise noted in this section.
   (F)   Measuring setbacks and distances. All measurements for setbacks and
location as stated in this subchapter shall be taken from the outermost portion
of a sign to the nearest portion of the feature from which the setback or
distance is to be measured, such as property lines, rights-of-way and other
signs.
   (G)   Computation of sign dimensions. 
      (1)   Computation of sign height. The height of a sign shall be computed
as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be
the lower of:
         (a)   Existing grade prior to construction; or
         (b)   The newly established grade after construction, exclusive of any
filling, berming, mounding, or excavating. In cases in which the normal grade
cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be computed on the
assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base of the sign is
equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a public street or
the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the principal structure on
the lot, whichever is lower.

      (2)   Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only 1 face)
shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, or
combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of the display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative
fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets these zoning regulations
and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
      (3)   Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign
with more than 1 face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign
faces visible from any 1 point at the same time, and when such sign faces are
part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches apart, the sign
area shall be computed by the measurement of one of the faces.

   (H)   Obstructions prohibited. No sign shall be placed so as to obstruct the
clear sight triangle at a street intersection nor shall any sign obstruct the
view of motorists entering or leaving an off-street parking area.
   (I)   Forfeiture of illegal signs placed on or over public property. Any
sign installed or placed on or over public property, except in conformance with
the requirements of this chapter, shall be forfeited to the public and be
subject to confiscation and disposal. In addition to other remedies provided by
this chapter, the county shall have the right to recover from the sign owner
and/or installer the full costs of removal and disposal of such sign.
   (J)   Placement on trees, utility poles, towers, natural features, and the
like prohibited. No sign shall be painted or attached to a tree, fence, utility
pole, tower, tank, roof, rock, bridge, street sign or other similar natural or
manmade feature. This prohibition shall not apply to "no trespassing" or
boundary marker signs posted on trees on private property or utility and
official community identification signs posted on water towers.

§ 153.216 PROHIBITED SIGNS.
   (A)   Signs imitating traffic or emergency signals. No private sign which
imitates or gives the appearance of an official traffic or emergency sign or
signal shall be permitted.
   (B)    Distracting signs. No private sign which uses flashing, blinking,
scrolling or moving lights, text or graphics shall be permitted, except as may
be permitted in §
153.219(A).
   (C)   Sign lighting incompatible with a residential district. Sign lighting
shall not trespass onto adjacent properties or create glare that is dangerous
to passing motorists or interferes with the use and enjoyment of adjacent
residential properties.
   (D)   Portable signs. Portable signs are prohibited.
   (E)   Signs in right-of-way. Signs extending into the public right-of-way
other than those expressly permitted by this chapter or otherwise approved by
the Newberry County Director of Public Works or SCDOT, if placed along public
streets.
   (F)   Obstructive signs. Any sign which obstructs the view of motorists,
pedestrians, or cyclists using any street, sidewalk, bike path, or driveway, or
which obstructs the approach to any street intersection or railroad crossing,
or which interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic sign, device, or
signal. In addition, any sign that is illuminated or is highly reflective that
hampers the vision of motorists or cyclists shall be prohibited.

Editor’s note:
   On December 29, 1988, the County Council adopted two subdivision ordinances.
Ord. 105 established a plan of subdivision regulations for the county. As
authorized by 1988 Act No. 583, Ord. 104 designated only one particular area of
the county as the initial subdivision district in which these regulations were
applicable. Responding the prospect of increasing growth and the need for more
orderly development, the County Council, on April 19, 2006, adopted Ord. 04-09-
06, which repealed Ord. 104 so that these subdivision regulations can be
applied to the entire unincorporated area of the county.
GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 154.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   The public health, safety, economy, good order, appearance,
convenience, morals, and general welfare require the harmonious, orderly, and
progressive development of land within Newberry County.
   (B)   In furtherance of this general intent, the regulation of land
subdivisions by Newberry County Council is adopted for the following purposes,
among others:
      (1)   To encourage the development of an economically sound and stable
county;
      (2)   To assure the timely provision of required streets, utilities, and
other facilities and services to new land developments;
      (3)   To assure the adequate provision of safe and convenient traffic
access and circulation, both vehicular and pedestrian, in and through new land
developments;
      (4)   To assure the provision of needed public open spaces and building
sites in new land developments through the dedication or reservation of land
for recreational, educational, and other public purposes; and
      (5)   To assure, in general, the wise and timely development of new areas
in the county.
(Ord. 105, passed 12-29-1988)

§ 154.004 JURISDICTION.
   (A)   These subdivision regulations shall apply to all subdivisions of land
within the unincorporated areas of Newberry County, and to the areas within
those incorporated municipalities, which by contract
with the county, consent to have these regulations apply to subdivisions within
such municipalities.
   (B)   No land shall be subdivided within the unincorporated area of Newberry
County until either:
      (1)   An application for exemption has been approved by the
administrative official; or

exemption by the administrative official, he or she may submit the application
for exemption to the Planning Commission at its next regular meeting. The

where appropriate, to discuss the proposed subdivision with those officials who
must eventually approve those aspects of the subdivision plat coming within
their jurisdiction.
   (B)   Application procedure and requirements. Prior to subdividing land, an
owner of the land, or his or her representative, shall file an application for
approval of a sketch plat. The application shall:

   (C)   Approval of sketch plat. After reviewing the sketch plat, the
administrative official will advise the applicant within 15 days after
application that the sketch plat is approved, disapproved, or approved with
certain modifications. If approved, the approval shall constitute authorization
to prepare and submit a preliminary plat. If the administrative official fails
to act on the sketch plat within 15 days after application, the sketch plat
shall be deemed approved and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by
the Planning Commission upon demand; provided, however, that the subdivider may
waive this requirement and consent in writing to extension of the period.

of fact, being promptly delivered to the applicant and to the land owner.
Notice of the hearing at which the Planning Commission is to consider the
sketch plat will be mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
person designated to receive notice of the hearing on behalf of the applicant

after submission of the preliminary plat; otherwise, the plat shall be deemed
to have been approved and a certificate to that effect shall be issued by the
Planning Commission on demand; provided, however, that the applicant for the
Planning Commission's approval may waive this requirement and consent in
writing to an extension of the period. The grounds of disapproval of any

the reasons for the disapproval shall be delivered in writing, return receipt
requested, to the applicant and the land owner within 10 days of the Planning
Commission's decision.
      (3)   It is expressly understood that the Planning Commission shall not

may, however, seek to bring agreement in case of conflicts between the various
reviewing agencies, or a reviewing agency and the subdivider.
      (4)   All plats submitted to the Planning Commission shall contain the
name, address, and telephone number of a designated contact person. At least 10
days prior to the meeting in which the Planning Commission will act on the
preliminary plat, a notice of the hearing shall be sent to certified mail to
the contact person. The notice shall specify the date, time, and location of
the meeting.
      (5)   Any appeal of the Planning Commission's decision shall be made to
the County Council who shall hear the appeal, and in its discretion hear oral
argument on the appeal, and make its decision known to the appellant and the
Planning Commission. Any appeal to County Council must be in writing and filed
with County Council within 10 days after the notice of the decision of the
Planning Commission has been delivered to the subdivider. The County Council
must render its decision as to whether or not the appeal shall be heard within
the 20-day period thereafter. Failure to act by County Council within the 20-
day period shall constitute a denial of the appeal and the ruling of the
Planning Commission shall be the final administrative decision in the matter.
If County Council determines to give a formal hearing on the appeal, the
applicant shall be notified by certified mail, return receipt requested, mailed
at least 5 days before the hearing. The Council shall have the discretion to
consider or not consider any oral argument by the applicant or other interested
parties.

authorization by the Planning Commission. Also noted shall be the date on which
the Planning Commission granted approval and the date of written notification
to the subdivider or his or her authorized agent.
      (7)   Approval of a preliminary subdivision plat shall not constitute
approval of the final subdivision plat. Application for approval of the final
(record) plat will be considered only after the requirements for final plat
approval as specified herein have been fulfilled and after all other specified
conditions have been met. Upon approval of the preliminary subdivision plat by
the Planning Commission, the subdivider may proceed to comply with the other
requirements of these regulations and the preparation of the final subdivision
plat.
   (C)   Effective period of preliminary approval. The approval of a
preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of 1 year, at the end of which
time final approval on the subdivision must have been obtained from the
Planning Commission, although the plat need not yet be signed and filed with
the County Clerk of Court. Any plat not receiving final approval within the
period of time set forth herein shall be required to resubmit a new plat for
preliminary approval subject to all new subdivision regulations.
   (D)   Model homes, sales offices, and community buildings. For the purpose
of allowing the early construction of model homes, sales offices, and community
buildings, the Planning Commission, at its discretion, may authorize the
issuance of building permits for these structures, provided:
      (1)   Preliminary plat approval has been obtained;
      (2)   The building permit may only be issued to the developer or, if the
developer does not have a contractor's license, to a third-party licensed
contractor with the prior approval of the county;
      (3)   All building permits issued at this time are for speculative
commercial ventures only. The issuance of the permit does not guarantee the
developer the right to sell, convey, or occupy the structure;
      (4)   The number of structures permitted under this division (D) shall be
limited to 4, or a number not to exceed 10% of the lots depicted in the
preliminary plat, whichever is greater; and

REQUIREMENTS FOR IMPROVEMENTS, RESERVATIONS, AND DESIGN OF TRADITIONAL
SUBDIVISIONS
§ 154.055 GENERAL IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Conformance to applicable rules and regulations. In addition to the
requirements established herein, all subdivision plats shall comply with the
following laws, rules, and regulations:
      (1)   All applicable statutory provisions;
      (2)   All other applicable laws of the appropriate jurisdictions;
      (3)   The Official Master Plan, Official Map, Public Utilities Plan, and
Capital Improvements Program of the local government, including all streets,
drainage systems, and parks shown on the Official Map or Master Plan as
adopted;
      (4)   The special requirements of these regulations and any rules of the
Health Department and/or appropriate state agencies;
      (5)   The rules of the State Department of Highways and Public
Transportation, if the subdivision or any lot contained therein abuts a state
highway or connecting street;
      (6)   The rules of the appropriate local jurisdiction if the subdivision
or any lot contained therein abuts a street maintained by the jurisdiction;
      (7)   The standards and regulations adopted by the County Engineer and
all boards, commissions, agencies, and officials of Newberry County; and
      (8)   Plat approval may be withheld if a subdivision is not in conformity
with the above guides or policy and purposes of these regulations established
in
§ 154.001.
   (B)   Self-imposed restrictions. If the owner places restrictions on any of
the land contained in the subdivision greater than those required by these
regulations, the restrictions or reference thereto may be required to be
indicated on the subdivision plat, or the Planning Commission may require that
restrictive covenants be recorded with the County Clerk of Court in a form to
be approved by the Newberry County Attorney.
   (C)   Plats straddling municipal boundaries. Whenever access to the
subdivision is required across land in another local government, the Planning
Commission may request assurance from the County Attorney that access is
legally established, and from the County Engineer that the access road is
adequately improved, or that a performance bond has been duly executed and is
sufficient in amount to assure the construction of the access road. In general,
lot lines should be laid out so as not to cross municipal or county boundary
lines.
   (D)   Monuments. A steel or iron pipe or reinforcing rod not less than 1/
2 inch in diameter and 30 inches in length, or a cement bench mark or other
bench mark approved by the State of South Carolina, be set at each change in
direction of the boundary survey of the subdivision, excluding water courses,
and at all lot corners. A monument shall also be set at a point of curve, point
of intersection, property corner, point of tangency and reference point. All
markers shall be driven to within 12 inches of the finished grade or flush as
conditions may require.
   (E)   Subdivision name. The proposed name of the subdivision shall not
duplicate, or too closely approximate phonetically, the name of any other
subdivision in the area covered by these regulations. The Planning Commission
shall have final authority to designate the name of the subdivision which shall
be determined at sketch plat approval.
   (F)   Natural gas. When gas lines are located in a street right-of-way,
where possible, such lines shall be located outside the portion of the street
to be surfaced to prevent having to cut into the paved surface to serve
abutting properties.
   (G)   Street name signs. Street name signs shall be installed at all
intersections within a subdivision. The location and design shall be approved
by the Planning Commission and shall meet all county specifications.
   (H)   Sediment control. The Newberry County Engineer shall review
subdivision proposals to ensure conformance with the Sediment Control Ordinance
for Newberry County, South Carolina. Also refer to
§ 154.041(C).
(Ord. 105, passed 12-29-1988) Penalty, see
§ 154.999
§ 154.056 LOT IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be

securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with health
regulations and in providing driveway access to buildings on the lots from an
approved street.
   (B)   Lot dimensions.
      (1)   Lot width. The minimum lot width at the building setback line shall
be as shown on the following table in division (C) below. The width between
side lot lines at the point where they intersect with the street right-of-way
shall be not less than 75% of the required width (see division (B)(3) below for
flag lot requirements). Where lots front on the turn-around of a cul-de-sac,
the width between side lot lines where they intersect with the street right-of-
way shall not be less than 20 feet. Corner lots shall be at least 5 feet wider
than interior lots; provided, however, the maximum required width of a corner
lot shall be 100 feet.
      (2)   Minimum lot area. The minimum lot area shall be as shown in the
following schedule unless the Health Department requires greater lot
dimensions.
      (3)   Flag lots. Flag lots are allowed, subject to the following
restrictions.
         (a)   The area of the access appendage may not count toward the
minimum square footage required for the lot.
         (b)   Access easements (easements across other parcels of land to gain
access for a landlocked parcel) are not allowed.
         (c)   All driveway connections to public roads must comply with South
Carolina Department of Highways and Public Transportation regulations.
         (d)   The access appendage for a lot smaller than 2 acres shall be at
least 20 feet wide along its entire length.
         (e)   The access appendage for a lot 2 acres or larger shall be at
least 50 feet wide along its entire length.
         (f)   The access appendage of a 2 acre or larger flag lot shall be
directly aligned with or separated at least 150 feet from any existing or
proposed road, as measured from center line to center line. Adequate sight
distance shall be provided from the driveway along the intersecting road right-
of-way.
         (g)   The access appendage of a flag lot may not be contiguous to the
access appendage of another flag lot, unless both flag lots are each less than
2 acres. The paired flag lots may not be further subdivided.
         (h)   Successive flag lot access appendages or pairs of flag lot
access appendages along a continuous road right-of-way shall be separated by a
minimum of 100 feet of frontage (measured from access appendage center line to
center line) along the road right-of-way.
         (i)   The access appendage of a flag lot shall not exceed 400 feet in
total length.
      (4)   Minimum building setback line. In the absence of other regulations
which would apply, the minimum building setback line from the street right-of-
way shall be no less than 30 feet.

NOTES TO TABLE:
* As approved by the Health Department
** Required
 
   (D)   Street access.
      (1)   All lots hereafter established shall front or abut on a street,
either an existing publicly-owned and maintained street or a new public street
which conforms to the requirements of these regulations, or a private street
with the approval of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   The Planning Commission, in cases where the developer can
demonstrate that physical or legal factors beyond his or her control preclude
the building of roads to the standards of this chapter, or where the nature of
the development would require the limiting of access, may approve private
roads. The following requirements for private roads shall apply.
         (a)   The developer must institute adequate legal and financial means
to ensure that the upkeep of these roads will not become the responsibility of
Newberry County or the State of South Carolina.
         (b)   Private streets shall be constructed to the roadbed, road
surface, and pavement width standards of the South Carolina Department of
Highways and Public Transportation.
         (c)   Through roads that connect existing roads may not be approved if
they are likely to be used by the general public.
         (d)   The Planning Commission may impose additional requirements to
ensure adequate access by residents on private roads.
   (E)   Lot drainage. Lots shall be laid out so as to provide positive
drainage away from all buildings, and individual lot drainage shall be
coordinated with the general storm drainage pattern for the area. Drainage
shall be designed so as to avoid concentration of storm drainage water from
each lot to adjacent lots.
   (F)   Fencing. Each subdivider and/or developer shall be required to furnish
and install fences wherever the Planning Commission determines that an
unreasonably hazardous condition may exist. The fences shall be constructed
according to standards established by the County Engineer and shall be noted as
to height and material on the final plat. No final plat shall be approved until
the fence improvements have been duly installed.
   (G)   Water bodies and watercourses. If a tract being subdivided contains a
water body, or portion thereof, lot lines shall be so drawn as to distribute
the entire ownership of the water body among the adjacent lots. The Planning
Commission may approve an alternative plan whereby the ownership of and
responsibility for safe maintenance of the water body is so placed that it will
not become a local government responsibility. No more than 25% of the minimum
area of a lot required under this chapter may be satisfied by land which is
under water. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the
street by which it has access, provisions shall be made for installation of a
culvert or other structure of design approved by the County Engineer.
   (H)   Easements. Easements having a minimum width of 7½ feet and located
along the side or rear lot lines shall be provided as required for utility
lines and underground mains and cables.
(Ord. 105, passed 12-29-1988) Penalty, see
§ 154.999
§ 154.057 STREETS.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Frontage on improved streets. No subdivision shall be approved
unless the area to be subdivided shall have frontage on and access from an
existing street which is:
         (a)   An existing state, county, or city owned and maintained street;
or
         (b)   A street shown upon a plat approved by the Planning Commission
and recorded in the County Clerk of Court's office. The street or highway must
be suitably improved as required by these regulations and specifications, or be
secured by a performance bond required under these subdivision regulations with
the width and right-of-way required by these subdivision regulations.
      (2)   Grading and improvement plan. All public roads shall be graded and
improved and conform to the standards established for roads by the Newberry
County Council. All roadway designs and specifications shall be approved by the
County Engineer, in accordance with the construction plans required to be
submitted prior to final plat approval.
      (3)   Topography and arrangement.
         (a)   Roads shall be related appropriately to the topography.
         (b)   Minor streets shall be curved whenever possible to avoid
uniformity of lot appearance. All streets shall be arranged so as to obtain as
many as possible of the building sites at, or above, the grades of the streets.
Grades of streets shall conform as closely as possible to the original
topography. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided. Specific
standards are contained in the design standards of these regulations.
         (c)   The location and width of all proposed streets shall be in
conformity with official plans and maps and with existing amended plans of the
Planning Commission.
         (d)   All thoroughfares shall be properly related to special traffic
generators such as industries, business districts, schools, churches, and
shopping centers; to population densities; and to the pattern of existing and
proposed land uses.
         (e)   Minor streets shall be laid out to conform as much as possible
to the topography, to discourage use by through traffic, to permit efficient
drainage and utility systems, and to require the minimum number of streets
necessary to provide convenient and safe access to property.
         (f)   The rigid rectangular gridiron street pattern need not
necessarily be adhered to, and the use of curvilinear streets, cul-de-sacs, or
U-shaped streets shall be encouraged where the use will result in a more
desirable layout.
         (g)   Street extensions:
            1.   The street layout of the proposed subdivision shall provide
for the continuation or projection of streets already existing in areas
adjacent to the area being subdivided unless the Planning Commission deems the
continuation or extension undesirable for specific reasons of topography or
design;
            2.   Where the Planning Commission determines that it is necessary
to provide street access to adjoining properties, and that other means of
access are not reasonably available to the adjoining properties, proposed
streets shall be extended by dedication to the boundaries of the properties.
Where the Planning Commission deems it necessary, the dead-end streets shall be
provided with an approved temporary turnaround having a radius of at least 40
feet; and
            3.   The street system for the proposed subdivision shall provide
for extending existing streets at the same or greater width, but in no case
shall a street extension be of less width than the minimum width required in
these regulations for a street in its category.
         (h)   In business and industrial developments, the streets and other
accessways shall be planned in connection with the grouping of buildings,
location of rail facilities, and the provision of alleys, truck loading and
maneuvering areas, and walks and parking areas so as to minimize conflict of
movement between the various types of traffic, including pedestrian.
      (4)   Blocks.
         (a)   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide for 2 tiers of
lots of appropriate depths. Exceptions to this prescribed block width shall be
permitted in blocks adjacent to major streets, railroads, or waterways.
         (b)   The lengths, widths, and shapes of blocks shall be such as are
appropriate for the locality and the type of development contemplated, but
block lengths in residential areas shall not exceed 2,000 feet, nor be less
than 400 feet in length. Wherever practicable, blocks along major arterials and
collector streets shall be not less than 1,000 feet in length.
         (c)   In long blocks, the Planning Commission may require the
reservation of an easement through the block to accommodate utilities, drainage
facilities, or pedestrian traffic.
         (d)   Pedestrianways or crosswalks, not less than 10 feet wide, may be
required by the Planning Commission through the center of blocks more than 800
feet long where deemed essential to provide circulation or access to schools,
playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation, or other community facilities.
         (e)   Blocks designed for industrial uses shall be of a length and
width as may be determined suitable by the Planning Commission for prospective
use.
      (5)   Access to primary arterials. Where a subdivision borders on or
contains an existing or proposed primary arterial, the Planning Commission may
require that access to the streets be limited by 1 of the following means:
         (a)   The subdivision of lots so as to back onto the primary arterial
and front onto a parallel local street; no access shall be provided from the
primary arterial, and screening shall be provided in a strip of land along the
rear property line of the lots;
         (b)   A series of cul-de-sacs, U-shaped streets, or short loops
entered from and designed generally at right angles to such a parallel street,
with the rear lines of their terminal lots backing onto the major arterial; or
         (c)   A marginal access or service road (separated from the primary
arterial by a planting or grass strip and having access thereto at suitable
points).
      (6)   Street names.
         (a)   Streets or roads that are extensions of, or obviously in
alignment with, existing named streets shall bear that name.
         (b)   The names of new streets and roads shall be subject to the
Planning Commission and approval of County Council and shall not duplicate or
be similar in sound to existing names, irrespective of the use of the suffix
street, avenue, circle, way, boulevard, drive, place, or court or the like.
      (7)   Permanent dead-end streets.
         (a)   Where a road does not extend to the boundary of the subdivision
and its continuation is not required by the Planning Commission for access to
adjoining property, its terminus shall normally not be nearer to the boundary
than 50 feet.
         (b)   However, the Planning Commission may require the reservation of
an appropriate easement to accommodate drainage facilities, pedestrian traffic,
or utilities.
         (c)   A cul-de-sac turnaround shall be provided at the end of a
permanent dead-end street in accordance with county construction standards and
specifications. (See division (B) below.)
         (d)   For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and
fire protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited in
length in accordance with the design standards of these regulations.
      (8)   Alleys. Service alleys or drives may be required in multiple
dwellings, commercial and industrial developments, and shall have a minimum
surface treatment width of 15 feet, but shall not be provided in 1- and 2-
family residential developments unless the subdivider provides evidence
satisfactory to the Planning Commission of the need for alleys.
   (B)   Design standards.
      (1)   Generally.
         (a)   In order to provide for streets of suitable location, width, and
improvement to accommodate prospective traffic and afford satisfactory access
to policy, firefighting, sanitation and road-maintenance equipment, and to
coordinate so as to compose a convenient system and avoid undue hardships to
adjoining properties, the following design standards for streets are hereby
required (street classification may be indicated on the Major Thoroughfare
Plan, or Official Map; otherwise, it shall be determined by the Planning
Commission).

NOTES TO TABLE:
(1) Pavement widths shown do not provide for on-street parking; service lanes
are intended only for loading and unloading of passengers and goods and for
disabled vehicles and not for the storage of vehicles.
(2) An 18-inch wide grass strip should be provided between the right-of-way
boundary and the outside edge or back of any sidewalk constructed within the
right-of-way. This arrangement will permit the placing of utility poles back
of the sidewalk and at the same time retain a grass strip between the
sidewalk and the curb or edge of pavement; both of these features are highly
desirable, particularly from a safety viewpoint.
(3) Measured from the back of each curb or from the low point of valley
gutter to low point of valley gutter.
(4) Measured from edge of paving to edge of paving when a typical State
Highway Department farm-to-market road section is used.

         (b)   Primary and secondary arterial design standards are as required
by the Major Thoroughfare Plan or Official Map and the South Carolina
Department of Highways and Public Transportation. Normally, the streets will
require reservation or dedication of right-of-way by the subdivider and
improvements by others.
      (2)   Road surfacing and improvements.
         (a)   After sewer and water utilities have been installed by the
developer, the applicant shall construct curbs and gutter or valley gutters and
shall surface or cause to be surfaced, roadways to the widths prescribed in
these regulations. The surfacing shall be of a character as is suitable for the
expected traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the expected
traffic and in harmony with similar improvements in the surrounding areas.
Types of surface shall be as determined by the County Engineer. Adequate
provision shall be made for culverts, drains, and bridges.
         (b)   All road surfaces, shoulders, drainage improvements and
structures, curbs, turnarounds, and sidewalks shall conform to all construction
standards and specifications proposed by the Planning Commission, County
Engineer, and approved by Newberry County Council and shall be incorporated
into the construction plans required to be submitted by the developer for plat
approval. All roads shall be hard surfaced (portland cement, concrete,
asphaltic concrete, or bituminous wearing) in all new subdivisions and
expansions of, existing subdivisions. The Planning Commission may allow an
alternate surfacing material for rural residential minor streets where it may
be shown that an extreme hardship exists and where the surface is approved by
the County Engineer.
      (3)   Excess right-of-way. Right-of-way widths in excess of the standards
designated in these regulations shall be required whenever, due to topography,
additional width is necessary to provide adequate earth slopes. The slopes
shall not be in excess of 2 to 1.
      (4)   Railroads and limited access highways. Railroad rights-of-way and
limited access highways where so located as to affect the subdivision of
adjoining lands shall be treated as follows:
         (a)   In residential developments, a buffer strip at least 25 feet in
depth in addition to the normal depth of the lot required in the district shall
be provided adjacent to the railroad right-of-way or limited access highway.
This strip shall be part of the platted lots and shall be designated on the
plat: This strip is reserved for screening. The placement of structures hereon
is prohibited.
         (b)   In developments proposed for business, commercial, or industrial
uses, the nearest street extending parallel or approximately parallel to the
railroad shall, whenever practicable, be at a sufficient distance therefrom to
ensure suitable depth for commercial or industrial sites.
         (c)   Streets parallel to the railroad when intersecting a street
which crosses the railroad at grade shall, to the extent practicable, be at a
distance of at least 150 feet from the railroad right-of-way. The distance
shall be determined with due consideration of the minimum distance required for
future separation of grades by means of appropriate approach gradients.
      (5)   Intersections.
         (a)   Streets shall be laid out so as to intersect as nearly as
possible at right angles. A proposed intersection of 2 new streets at an angle
of less than 75 degrees shall not be acceptable. An oblique street should be
curved approaching an intersection and should be approximately at right angles
for 100 feet from the center line of the through street. Not more than 2
streets shall intersect at any 1 point unless specifically approved by the
Planning Commission.
         (b)   Proposed new intersections along 1 side of an existing street
shall, whenever practicable, coincide with any existing intersections on the
opposite side of the street. Street jogs with center line offsets of less than
150 feet shall not be permitted, except where the intersected street has
separated dual drives without median breaks at either intersection. Where
opposing streets intersect collector streets, their alignment shall be
continuous. Intersection of streets shall be at least 800 feet apart.
         (c)   Minimum curb radius at the intersection of 2 minor streets shall
be at least 20 feet; and minimum curb radius at an intersection involving a
collector street shall be at least 25 feet. Alley intersections and abrupt
changes in alignment within a block shall have the corners cut off in
accordance with standard engineering practice to permit safe vehicular
movement.
         (d)   Intersections shall be designed with a flat grade whenever
practical. In hilly or rolling areas, at the approach to an intersection, a
leveling area shall be provided having not greater than a 3% rate at a distance
of 60 feet, measured from the nearest right-of-way line of the intersecting
street.
         (e)   Where any street intersection will involve earth banks or
existing vegetation inside any lot corner that would create a traffic hazard by
limiting visibility, the developer shall cut the ground and/or vegetation
(including trees) in connection with the grading of the public right-of-way to
the extent deemed necessary to provide an adequate sight distance.
         (f)   The cross-slopes on all streets, including intersections, shall
be no greater than 3% and no less than 0.5%.
      (6)   Bridges. Bridges of primary benefit to the applicant, as determined
by the Planning Commission, shall be constructed at the full expense of the
applicant and meet the design requirements of the County Engineer.
   (C)   Road dedications and reservations.
      (1)   Street systems in new subdivisions shall be laid out so as to
eliminate or avoid new perimeter half-streets. Where an existing half-street is
adjacent to a new subdivision, the other half of the street shall be improved
and dedicated by the subdivider. The Planning Commission may authorize a new
perimeter street where the subdivider improves and dedicates the entire
required street right-of-way width within his or her own subdivision
boundaries.
      (2)   Where a subdivision borders an existing narrow road or when the
Master Plan or Official Map indicate plans for realignment or widening a road
that would require use of some of the land in the subdivision, the applicant
shall be required to improve and dedicate at his or her expense the areas for
widening or realignment of the roads. The frontage roads and streets shall be
improved and dedicated by the applicant at his or her own expense to the full
width as required by these subdivision regulations.
      (3)   (a)   When a subdivision contains a part or all of the proposed
location of a new street shown in the local governments major thoroughfare
plan, the necessary right-of-way shall be reserved for this new street and the
design of the subdivision shall reflect the future existence of this street.
Dedication of this right-of-way is not required. However, this reserved right-
of-way shall not count in satisfying the setback and lot size requirements of
this chapter.
         (b)   When calculations indicate that curb capacities are exceeded at
a point, no further allowance shall be made for flow beyond that point, and
basins shall be used to intercept flow at that point. Surface water drainage
patterns shall be shown for each block.
   (D)   Nature of storm water facilities.
      (1)   Location. The applicant may be required by the Planning Commission
to carry away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist
either previously to, or as a result of, the subdivision. The drainage
facilities shall be located in the road right-of-way where feasible, or in
perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width, and shall be constructed
in accordance with the local governments standards and specifications.
      (2)   Accessibility to public storm sewers.
         (a)   Where a public storm sewer is accessible, the applicant shall
install storm sewer facilities, or if no outlets are within a reasonable
distance, adequate provision shall be made for the disposal of storm waters,
subject to the specifications of the County Engineer. Inspection of facilities
shall be conducted by the County Engineer.
         (b)   If a connection to a public storm sewer will be provided
eventually, as determined by the County Engineer and the Planning Commission,
the developer shall make arrangements for future storm water disposal by a
public utility system at the time the plat receives final approval. Provision
for the connection shall be incorporated by inclusion in the performance bond
required for the subdivision plat.
      (3)   Accommodation of upstream drainage areas. A culvert or other
drainage facility shall in each case be large enough to accommodate potential
run-off from its entire upstream drainage area, whether inside or outside the
subdivision. The County Engineer shall determine the necessary size of the
facility, based on the provisions of the construction standards and
specifications assuming conditions of maximum potential watershed development
expected in the Master Plan.
      (4)   Effect on downstream drainage areas. The County Engineer shall also
study the effect of each subdivision on existing downstream drainage facilities
outside the area of the subdivision. Local government drainage studies,
together with the other studies as shall be appropriate, shall serve as a guide
to needed improvement. Where it is anticipated that the additional run-off
incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an existing
downstream drainage facility, the Planning Commission may withhold approval of
the subdivision until provision has been made for the improvement of the
potential condition in the sum as the Planning Commission shall determine. No
subdivision shall be approved unless adequate drainage will be provided to an
adequate drainage watercourse or facility.
      (5)   Flood plain areas. Whenever a plat is submitted for an area which
is subject to inundation by a 100-year frequency flood, the Planning Commission
may approve the subdivision, provided that the applicant fills the affected
area (according to a method approved by the County Engineer) so as to provide a
building site on all lots which is at least 1 foot above the 100-year frequency
flood level. The Planning Commission may also approve other methods of flood
prevention which provide an equivalent degree of protection. In no case,
however, shall the Planning Commission permit any filling or impeding of the
water in the floodway of any watercourse.
   (E)   Dedication of drainage easements.
      (1)   General requirements. Where a subdivision is traversed by a
watercourse, drainageway, channel, or stream, there shall be provided a storm
water easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially to the lines
of the watercourse, and of the width and construction or both as will be
adequate for the purpose. Wherever possible, it is desirable that the drainage
be maintained by an open channel with landscaped banks and adequate width for
maximum potential volume of flow.
      (2)   Drainage easements.
         (a)   Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of drainage facilities within road rights-of-way,
perpetual unobstructed easements at least 12 feet in width for the drainage
facilities shall be provided across property outside the road lines and with
satisfactory access to the road. Easements shall be indicated on the plat.
Drainage easements shall be carried from the road to a natural watercourse or
to other drainage facilities.
         (b)   When a proposed drainage system will increase the maximum flow
of water across private land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage
rights must be secured and indicated on the plat.
         (c)   Low-lying lands along watercourses subject to flooding or
overflowing during storm periods, included in areas for dedication, shall be
preserved and retained in their natural state as drainage ways.

§ 154.999
§ 154.058 WATER FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements.
      (1)   Necessary action shall be taken by the applicant to extend an
existing public water system for the purpose of providing a water supply system
capable of providing domestic water use and fire protection.
      (2)   Where a public water main is accessible, the subdivider shall
install adequate water facilities (including fire hydrants) subject to the
specifications of the state or local authorities. All water mains with fire
hydrants shall be at least 6 inches in diameter.
      (3)   Water main extensions shall be approved by the officially
designated agency of the state or local government.
      (4)   To facilitate the above, the location of all fire hydrants, all
water supply improvements, and the boundary lines of proposed districts,
indicating all improvements proposed to be served, shall be shown on the
preliminary plat, and the cost of installing same shall be included in any bond
to be furnished by the developer.
      (5)   When the water main is located under the street surface to serve
the abutting lots, a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to
serve each lot before the street is surfaced.
   (B)   Individual wells and central water systems.
      (1)   In rural residential subdivisions, at the discretion of the
Planning Commission, if a public water system is not available, individual
wells may be used or a central water system provided in such a manner that an
adequate supply of potable water will be available to every lot in the
subdivision. Individual wells and central water systems shall be approved by
the appropriate health authorities. Orders of approval shall be submitted to
the Planning Commission.
      (2)   If the Planning Commission requires that a connection to a public
water main be eventually provided as a condition to approval of an individual
well or central water system, the applicant shall make arrangements for future
water service at the time the plat received final approval. Performance or cash
bonds may be required to insure compliance.
   (C)   Fire hydrants. Fire hydrants shall be required for all subdivisions,
except those coming under division (B) above. Fire hydrants shall be located no
more than 1,000 feet apart and within 500 feet of any structure and shall be
approved by the applicable protection unit. To eliminate future street
openings, all underground utilities for fire hydrants, together with the fire
hydrants themselves and all other supply improvements, shall be installed
before any final paving of a street shown on the subdivision plat.
(Ord. 105, passed 12-29-1988) Penalty, see
§ 154.999
§ 154.059 SEWERAGE FACILITIES.
   (A)   General requirements. The applicant shall install sanitary sewer
facilities in a manner prescribed by the local government construction
standards and specifications. All plans shall be designed in accordance with
the rules, regulations, and standards of the County Engineer, Health
Department, and other appropriate agency. Plans shall be approved by the above
agencies.
   (B)   Central sewerage system requirements.
      (1)   Where public sanitary sewerage systems are reasonably accessible,
the applicant shall connect with same and provide sewers accessible to each lot
in the subdivision. When the sewer line is located in a street right-of-way and
it will be necessary to cut into the street surface to serve the abutting lots,
a connection shall be stubbed out to the property line to serve each lot prior
to surfacing the street.
      (2)   Where public sanitary sewerage systems are not reasonably
accessible but will become available within a reasonable time (not to exceed 5
years), the applicant may choose 1 of the following alternatives:
         (a)   Central sewerage system, the maintenance cost to be assessed
against each property benefitted. Where plans for future public sanitary
sewerage systems exist, the applicant shall install the sewer lines, laterals,
and mains to be in permanent conformance with the plans and ready for
connection to the public sewer mains; or
         (b)   Individual disposal systems, provided the applicant shall
install sanitary sewer lines, laterals, and mains from the street curb to a
point in the subdivision boundary where a future connection with the public
sewer main shall be made. Sewer lines shall be laid from the house to the
street line, and a connection shall be available in the home to connect when
the public sewers become available. The sewer systems shall be capped until
ready for use and shall conform to all plans for installation of the public
sewer system, where such exist, and shall be ready for connection to the public
sewer main.
      (3)   Where sanitary sewer systems are not reasonably accessible and will
not become available for a period in excess of 15 years, the applicant may
install sewerage systems as follows:
         (a)   Urban residential subdivisions - a central sewerage system only.
No individual disposal system will be permitted. Where plans exist for a public
sewer system to be built, for a period in excess of 5 years, the applicant
shall install all sewer lines, laterals, and mains to be in permanent
conformance with the plans and ready for connection to the public sewer main;
and
         (b)   Rural residential subdivisions - individual disposal systems or
central sewerage systems may be used.
   (C)   Individual disposal system requirements. If public sewer facilities
are not available and individual disposal systems are proposed, minimum lot
areas shall conform to the requirements of this chapter and percolation tests
and test holes shall be made as directed by the local government Health Officer
and the results submitted to the Health Department. The individual disposal
system, including the size of the septic tanks and size of the tile fields or
other secondary treatment device, shall also be approved by the Health Officer.
   (D)   Design criteria for sanitary sewers.
      (1)   These design criteria are not intended to cover extraordinary
situations. Deviations will be allowed and may be required in those instances
where considered justified by the County Engineer.
      (2)   Sanitary sewer shall be designed and installed to the design
standards and specifications of the city, county, or public service district
into whose sewer system the subdivision is connecting and all design standards
and specifications of the appropriate State Health Agency controlling sewer
systems.

§ 154.060 SIDEWALKS.
   (A)   Required improvements.
      (1)   Sidewalks shall be included within the dedicated nonpavement right-
of-way of all roads as shown in the table in division (B) below.
      (2)   Sidewalks shall be improved as required in
§ 154.057(B)(2). of these regulations. A median strip of grassed or landscaped
areas at least 2 feet wide is recommended to separate all sidewalks from
adjacent curbs or the edge of street pavement.
   (B)   Pedestrian accesses.
      (1)   The Planning Commission may require, in order to facilitate
pedestrian access from the roads to schools, parks, playgrounds, or other
nearby roads, perpetual unobstructed easements at least 20 feet in width.
      (2)   Easements shall be indicated on the plat.

§ 154.062 NONRESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   (A)   Generally. If a proposed subdivision includes land that is proposed
for commercial or industrial purposes, the layout of the subdivisions with
respect to the land shall make the provision as the Planning Commission may
require.
   (B)   Standards. In addition to the principles and standards in these
regulations, which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Commission that the
street, parcel, and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses
anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following
principles and standards shall be observed.
      (1)   Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and
dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated.
      (2)   Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate
the type volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereupon.
      (3)   Special requirements may be imposed by Newberry County with respect
to street, curb, gutter, and sidewalk design and construction.
      (4)   Special requirements may be imposed by the local government with
respect to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer, and
storm water drainage.
      (5)   Every effort shall be made to protect adjacent residential areas
from potential nuisance from a proposed commercial or industrial subdivision,
including the provision of extra depth in parcels packing up on existing or
potential residential development and provisions for a permanently landscaped
buffer strip when necessary.
      (6)   Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic,
shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or
potential residential areas.

§ 154.063 SURETY IN LIEU OF COMPLETION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   In lieu of the completion of the physical development and installation
of the required improvements previous to the final approval of a plat, the
County Council, or its designee, may accept a bond, in an amount and with
surety and conditions satisfactory to the Council or its designee, providing
for and securing to the county the actual construction and installation of the
improvements and utilities within a period specified by the Newberry County
Council, or its designee, and expressed in the bond.
   (B)   The nature and the amount of the surety and procedure shall be as
determined by the County Council.
   (C)   The bonding of a subdivision project prior to final plat approval

§ 154.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   Except as otherwise provided herein, the owner or agent of the owner,
of any land to be subdivided within the municipality or county who transfers or
sells the land by reference to or exhibition of or by other use of a plat of
subdivision of the land before the plat has been approved by the Planning
Commission and recorded in the office of the Clerk of Court in and for the

   (C)   Notwithstanding any other provision in this chapter, Newberry County
recognizes that the development of subdivisions requires a substantial
investment of money by a developer, and that it is necessary to advertise and
promote a development from the very earliest planning stages; therefore, it is
the intent of these regulations that a developer may take lot reservations, for
a price not to exceed 15% of the proposed final lot price, provided that no
actual ownership interest in a separate lot may be conveyed by deed, or other
legal instrument conveying a possessory interest, to a proposed buyer until the
final plat has been approved as provided in these regulations. All the
agreements, or other agreements for the transfer of a future possessory
interest, shall contain a provision that all the moneys paid to the developer,
or to his or her agents, shall be held in a separate escrow account in a

period not to exceed 2 years from the date of the instrument. Upon demand by
Newberry County, its administrative official, or its Planning Commission, the
developer, or its agents, shall supply a certified statement of the amounts
held in the escrow account, or accounts, and the names and addresses of the
persons who paid the funds, or who otherwise have a beneficial interest

PREPARATION.
   General requirements for all Stormwater Management and Sediment Control
Plans will include, but are not limited to the following:
   (A)   Select land where the drainage pattern, topography and soils are
favorable for the intended use. Tracts of land vary in suitability for

soil helps in identifying and evaluating potential problems.
   (B)   Expose the smallest practical area of land to the elements for the
least possible time during development.
   (C)   When feasible, retain and protect natural vegetation. Save topsoil,
where practical, for replacing on graded areas.
   (D)   Use temporary plant cover, mulching, or structures to control runoff
and protect areas subject to erosion during construction.
   (E)   Wherever possible, utilize natural drainage structures, with minimal
or no manmade improvements, to handle the increase run-off from development.
   (F)   Engineer the drainage systems of the development according to the
Newberry County Development Guidelines.
   (G)   Use sediment basins, filter fencing, rock check dams, and/or other
forms of silt traps, where required, to remove heavy sediment loads from runoff
waters leaving the disturbed area.
   (H)   Install the permanent vegetative cover and the long-term erosion
protection structures as soon as practical in the development process.
(Am. Ord. 06-21-05, passed 6-15-2006)
§ 155.036 SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PERMANENT STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PORTION
OF THE STORMWATER MANAGEMENT AND SEDIMENT CONTROL PLAN APPROVAL PROCESS.
   Specific Requirements for the permanent stormwater management portion of the
Stormwater Management and Sediment Control Plan approval process will include,
but are not limited to the following:
   (A)   Stormwater management must be addressed on a watershed basis to
provide a cost effective water quantity and water quality solution to the
specific watershed problems.
   (B)   All storm drainage systems will be classified based on the size of the
contributing drainage basin or sub-watershed as follows:
      (1)   Minor drainage systems: Zero to < 40 acres.
         (a)   All street drainage, curb and gutters, pipe systems, culverts,
ditches and channels which drain less than 40 acres will be designed to carry
flows resulting from a 10-year frequency storm. Minimum allowable pipe diameter
shall be 15 inches.
         (b)   The plan shall identify all drainageways.
      (2)   Collector systems: Forty to < l00 acres.
         (a)   All drainage systems draining at least 40 acres but less than
100 acres shall be designed to carry flows resulting from a 25-year frequency
storm.
         (b)   The plan shall identify all drainageways.
      (3)   Major drainage channels: One hundred to < 300 acres. For all
drainage systems draining at least 100 acres but less than 300 acres,
encroachment upon major drainage channels and the adjacent overflow land shall
be avoided as much as possible. All unavoidable improvements such as channel
improvements, culverts or bridges along these channels shall be designed to
carry a flow resulting from a 50-year frequency storm. In a subdivision, an
easement sufficient to accommodate the flow from a 50-year frequency storm
shall be dedicated to Newberry County for scheduled maintenance of the channel,
and any other maintenance required may be permitted to be performed by a third
party, upon written request to the county. In all other development activities,
the plan shall identify all drainageways.
      (4)   County or FEMA flood plains: Three hundred and more acres.
         (a)   For all natural channels, creeks or rivers draining more than
300 acres, encroachment upon these channels and the adjacent overflow land
shall be avoided as much as possible. All unavoidable improvements such as
culverts or bridges along these channels shall be designed to carry a flow
resulting from a 100-year frequency storm.
         (b)   If there are no detailed flood studies and base flood elevations
available in these areas, the applicant shall provide a detailed flood study
delineating the 100-year flood plain and the floodway. One-hundred year flood
limits along with base flood elevation and the floodway will be shown on the
Stormwater Management and Sediment Control Plans and also on the final plat if
applicable. In a subdivision, the property line shall stop at the floodway line
and the floodway shall be dedicated to Newberry County. In all other
development activities, the plan shall identify all drainageways.
      (5)   Drainage systems to be analyzed and revised. All drainage systems
regardless of its size or classification shall be analyzed and revised as
necessary to ensure that overflow of the system would not result in a
likelihood of dwelling flooding, property damage or public access and/or
utility interruption be greater than 1% in any given year. All hydrological
computations shall be based on the contributing watershed being fully
developed.
   (C)   All hydrologic computations shall be accomplished using a volume based
hydrograph method acceptable to the Planning Engineer. The storm duration shall
be the 24-hour rainfall event, applicable SCS distribution with a 5-minute
burst duration time increment. The Rational or Modified Rational Method is
acceptable for sizing individual culverts or storm drains that are not part of
a pipe network or system and do not have a contributing drainage area greater
than 20 acres. The storm duration for this method shall be equal to the time of
concentration of the contributing drainage area or a minimum of 5 minutes,
which ever is greater.
   (D)   Stormwater management requirements for a specific project shall be
based on the entire area to be developed, or if phased, the initial submittal
shall control that area proposed in the initial phase and establish a procedure
and obligation for the total site control.
   (E)   (1)   Stormwater quantity control is an integral part of overall
stormwater management. Detention ponds to control the peak run-off and volume
may be required in area where there are known drainage problems or where the
downstream natural or manmade channels are inadequate to accommodate projected
run-off. The requirements for a detention pond and/or downstream capacity
improvements will be determined by the Planning Engineer, in accordance with
applicable state or federal regulations. Newberry County strongly encourages
developers and engineers to make use of existing natural channels in their
natural state, not to encroach into the natural flood prone areas and use
channel improvements and/or detention ponds only as a last resort.
      (2)   The following design criteria for flow control shall be used where
required by the Environmental Management Administrator:
         (a)   Post-development peak discharge rates shall not exceed pre-
development discharge rates for 2-, 10- and 25-year frequency, 24-hour duration
storm events unless the subject development is in a known problem watershed
such that additional flow will negatively impact the watershed or there is
insufficient flow capacity downstream in which case the peak discharge rate
after the development may be restricted up to 1/2 the pre-development rates or
whatever the system capacity downstream.
         (b)   Where ponds are the proposed method of control the person
responsible for the land disturbance shall submit to Newberry County, when
required, an analysis of the impact of stormwater flows downstream in the
watershed for the 2-, 10-, 25-, 50- and 100-year storm events. The analysis
shall include hydrologic and hydraulic calculations necessary to determine the
impact of hydrograph timing modifications of the proposed land disturbance,
with and without the pond. The results of the analysis will determine the need
to modify the pond or to eliminate the pond requirements. Lacking a clearly
defined downstream point of construction, the downstream impacts shall be
established, with the concurrence of Newberry County.
   (F)   Discharge velocities shall be reduced to provide a non-erosive
velocity flow from a structure, channel, or other control measure or the
velocity of the 10-year, 24-hour storm runoff in the receiving waterway prior
to the land disturbance, whichever is greater.
   (G)   All ponds, other than a retention or detention pond engineered as part
of a stormwater system, that impede, encroach or alter a major drainage channel
or flood plain must be capable of accommodating stormwater from a 100-year
storm event based on built-out conditions for the watershed.
   (H)   Where existing wetlands are intended as a component of an overall
stormwater management system, the approved Stormwater Management and Sediment
Control Plan shall not be implemented until all necessary federal and state
permits have been obtained.
   (I)   All stormwater management and sediment control practices shall be
designed, constructed and maintained with consideration for the proper control
of mosquitoes and other vectors.
(Am. Ord. 06-21-05, passed 6-15-2006)

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.001 PURPOSE.
   (A)   In addition to the burden placed on the county's public services,
nuisance properties present health, safety and quality of life concerns and
exist when the persons responsible for such properties fail to take corrective
actions to abate nuisance activities or a nuisance condition. Public nuisance
properties have a significant adverse effect on the quality of life, safety,
and health of the neighborhoods where they are located. Public nuisance
properties are a financial and operational burden on the county by generating
repeat calls for service to the properties. Public nuisance properties
adversely affect the value of adjacent properties.
   (B)   Pursuant to the county's home rule authority, public nuisance
properties are hereby declared to constitute a public nuisance and are subject
to enforcement and abatement as described herein. The nuisance abatement
process hereinafter set forth may be used by the county in conjunction with any
and all legal actions available to the governing body.
   (C)   It is the county's intent:
      (1)   To identify public nuisance activities and public nuisance
conditions.
      (2)   To hold accountable those persons responsible for such nuisance
activities and/or conditions on the property.
      (3)   To assist victims of crime and penalize those who commit crimes or
those who permit conditions to exist that give rise to crime or excessive calls
for service.
      (4)   To establish rules, procedures, and penalties to address property
owners and occupants that have public nuisance issues and fail to take
corrective measures.
      (5)   To work in partnership with the owners and occupants to address the
negative results caused by public nuisance activities and/or conditions and to
improve the vitality of neighborhoods by addressing excessive calls for
service.
      (6)   To encourage owners and operators to abate conditions considered a
nuisance through an administrative process which is separate from the
Magistrate Court system.
      (7)   To establish a means for the county to abate public nuisance
properties in the event the owner or occupant is unwilling or unable to correct
such conditions in a timely manner.

entrance of the designated unsafe structure a notice to read: "DANGER - THIS
BUILDING IS DECLARED UNSAFE FOR HUMAN OCCUPANCY."

or removal is completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written
permission of the Building Official or Code Enforcement Officer except for the
purpose of making required repairs or demolition of the building.
   (F)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, any building or
structure that has been determined to be an immediate danger to life, health,
safety or property shall be abated immediately in order to protect life,
health, safety or property. The Building Official or Code Enforcement Officer
may take any steps that are necessary to make the structure safe including, but
not limited to, demolition of the structure.
(Ord. 04-03-24, passed 5-15-2024)
§ 157.022 EXTENSION PROCESS.
   An extension of time to complete abatement may be granted if justified. Such

amend the standards of this chapter.
(Ord. 04-03-24, passed 5-15-2024)
§ 157.025 PUBLIC ABATEMENT PROCESS.
   In the event that any owner or occupant of any lot or premises upon which
there is a condition described in this chapter fails to remedy the condition
within the agreed upon timeframe, the county may, in its own discretion, do
such work and make improvements, or contract with an authorized third-party, as
is necessary to correct, remedy, or remove such condition or cause the same to
be done, paid therefor and charge the expenses incurred thereby to any and all
owners of such lot, in joint and severable liability for any and all expenses
incurred. Such work shall not relieve such person from prosecution or failure
to comply with such notice. Such expenses shall be assessed against the lot or
real estate upon which the work was done, or the improvements made through a
lien on property which shall be added to and collected in the same manner as
property taxes.
(Ord. 04-03-24, passed 5-15-2024)

constitute a repeat violation. The occurrence of a repeat violation shall waive
the county's requirement to provide a notice of violation and an abatement
period, if applicable, prior to issuance of an ordinance summons.
(Ord. 04-03-24, passed 5-15-2024)
§ 157.027 CORRECTION AGREEMENT.

into a correction agreement with the county. Such correction agreement shall
identify such person(s) responsible for the property and their agreement to
promptly take all reasonable actions, which shall be set forth in the

specified conditions. The county may give consideration to many factors when
entering into a correction agreement with owners including, but not limited to,
financial hardship. A correction agreement must be requested by the owner
following the issuance of a notice of violation. The county must be in receipt
of such request prior to the expiration of the abatement period specified in
the notice of violation and prior to the issuance of a summons to appear in
court. If the nuisance is not abated in accordance with the conditions of the
correction agreement, a citation shall be issued as outlined in §
157.999.

      (6)   The Board, when so appealed to and after a hearing, may vary the
application of any provisions of the adopted building and fire codes of
Newberry County to any particular case when, in its opinion, the enforcement
thereof would do manifest injustice and would be contrary to the spirit and
purpose of this or the technical codes or public interest, and also finds all
of the following:
         (a)   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the building, structure or service system involved and which are
not applicable to others.
         (b)   That the special conditions and circumstances do not result from
the action or inaction of the applicant.
         (c)   That granting the variance requested will not confer on the
applicant any special privilege that is denied by this code to other buildings,
structures or service system.
         (d)   That the variance granted is the minimum variance that will make
possible the reasonable use of the building, structure or service system.
         (e)   That the grant of the variance will be in harmony with the
general intent and purpose of this code and will not be detrimental to the
public health, safety and general welfare.
   (I)   Conditions of the variance. In granting the variance, the Board may
prescribe a reasonable time limit within which the action for which the
variance is required shall be commenced or completed or both. In addition, the
Board may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with
the building and fire codes of Newberry County. Violation of the conditions of
a variance shall be deemed a violation of the code.

in writing and shall indicate the vote on the decision. Every decision shall be

be open to public inspections; a certified copy shall be sent by registered
mail or otherwise delivered to the appellant.

unreasonable or unnecessary delay.

or disallowance of the Building Official, Fire Official, or Code Enforcement
Officer, such local official shall immediately take action in accordance with
such decision.
