GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 30.01 CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORD CHECK POLICIES.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to authorize the City law
enforcement to access Oregon State Police (OSP) criminal offender information
through the Law Enforcement Data System (LEDS) for applicants seeking
employment, elected officials, and/or volunteer work with the City, in
accordance with OAR 257-10-0025(l)(a).
   (B)   Procedure. All proceedings pursuant to this section shall be conducted
in accordance with ORS 181.555 and OAR 257-10-0025, which establishes
procedures for access to criminal record information possessed by the Oregon
State Police (OSP) through the Law Enforcement Data System (LEDS) and as
supplemented below.
      (1)   All applicants for employment, elected officials, and appointed
volunteers with the City will be required to authorize the City to conduct a
criminal offender information check through the OSP LEDS system.
      (2)   The City’s law enforcement will conduct the check on the
prospective employee or volunteer and report to the Department Head or Mayor
requesting the check advising if the check revealed “criminal record” or “no
criminal record.”
      (3)   The written criminal history record on persons that are not hired
or appointed as a volunteer will be retained in accordance with the
requirements of OAR 166-200-0305 for a period of three years and thereafter
will be destroyed by shredding.
      (4)   The criminal history record of applicants and volunteers with a
criminal history that are hired or appointed will become a part of the
confidential personnel file of that employee or volunteer. Access to
confidential personnel files is limited to authorized persons who have an
official need to access such files as sanctioned by law or regulation.
      (5)   Applicants for employment or appointment as a volunteer that have a
felony criminal history or a history of conviction of a misdemeanor involving
moral turpitude or theft will be closely examined by the selecting official(s)
to determine if the applicant possesses the required degree of public trust and
confidence. Each selection will, however, be made on an individual, case by
case basis, taking into account the applicant’s qualifications, the
requirements of the particular job or volunteer post applied for, and the
results of the criminal history check. Factors such as the age of the offender
at the time of the offense, the type of offense, and subsequent rehabilitation,
and the public sensitivity of the position under consideration shall be taken
into account in evaluating a criminal history report.
      (6)   Hiring an applicant or appointing a volunteer with a criminal
history record will require the approval of the City Administrator or governing
body, after full disclosure and consideration of the criminal history of the
applicant.
(Ord. 613, passed 6-6-2007)

employees of any corporation that is engaged principally in buying, selling, or
developing of real estate for profit. No more than two of said members shall be

member term expires.
   (B)   Although there is no limit upon the consecutive or nonconsecutive
terms served by a member, a member must re-apply each time to continue serving;

(Ord. 661, passed 5-6-2020)

member’s misconduct or nonperformance and recommend that it schedule and
conduct a hearing. The City Council shall then hold a hearing followed by a
vote whether to declare the position vacant. The City Council shall declare the

§ 30.39 POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Commission shall have the powers and duties which are now or may
hereafter be assigned to it by charter, ordinances, or resolution of this City
and general laws of this state, including the ORS Chapter 227. The Planning
Commission shall administer the development ordinance of the City, and may make

regarding land use, locations of thoroughfares, public buildings, parks, and
other public facilities, and regarding any other matter relating to the

§ 30.40 EXPENDITURES.

(Ord. 661, passed 5-6-2020)
§ 30.41 CONFLICT OF INTEREST, BIAS, AND EX-PARTE CONTACT.
   (A)   The Chairperson shall, prior to the beginning of every public hearing,
call for declarations of conflict of interest, bias, and ex-parte contact by
the Planning Commissioners. Commissioners shall declare all actual and
potential conflicts of interest with sufficient details to allow the Planning
Commissioners and public to determine a member’s ability to participate in a
public hearing. All declarations, including actual and potential conflicts of
interest, shall be recorded in the official minutes of the meeting. POTENTIAL
AND ACTUAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST are defined in detail in ORS Chapter 244, but
are generally defined as follows.
      (1)   ACTUAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. Any action or any decision or
recommendation by a person acting in a capacity as a public official, the
effect of which would be to the private pecuniary benefit or detriment of the
person or the person’s relative or any business with which the person or a
relative of the person is associated unless the pecuniary benefit or detriment
arises out of the following:
         (a)   An interest or membership in a particular business, industry,
occupation, or other class required by law as a prerequisite to the holding by
the person of the office or position;
         (b)   Any action in the person’s official capacity which would affect
to the same degree a class consisting of all inhabitants of the state or a
smaller class consisting of an industry, occupation, or other group including
one of which or in which the person, or the person’s relative or business with
which the person or the person’s relative is associated is a member or is
engaged; and
         (c)   Membership in or membership on the board of directors of a
nonprofit corporation that is tax-exempt under I.R.C. § 501(c) being 26 U.S.C.
§ 501(c).
      (2)   POTENTIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST. Any action or any decision or
recommendation by a person acting in a capacity as a public official, the
effect of which could be to the private pecuniary benefit or detriment of the
person or the person’s relative, or a business with which the person or the
person’s relative is associated, unless the pecuniary benefit or detriment
arises out of the following:
         (a)   An interest or membership in a particular business, industry,
occupation, or other class required by law as a prerequisite to the holding by
the person of the office or position;
         (b)   Any action in the person’s official capacity which would affect
to the same degree a class consisting of all inhabitants of the state or a
smaller class consisting of an industry, occupation, or other group including
one of which or in which the person or the person’s relative or business with
which the person or the person’s relative is associated is a member or is
engaged; and
         (c)   Membership in or membership on the board of directors of a
nonprofit corporation that is tax-exempt under I.R.C. § 501(c) being 26 U.S.C.
§ 501(c).
      (3)   RELATIVE.
         (a)   The spouse, parent, stepparent, child, sibling, stepsibling,
son-in-law, or daughter-in- law of the public official or candidate;
         (b)   The parent, stepparent, child, sibling, stepsibling, son-in-law,
or daughter-in-law of the spouse of the public official or candidate;
         (c)   Any individual for whom the public official or candidate has a
legal support obligation;
         (d)   Any individual for whom the public official provides benefits
arising from the public official’s public employment or from whom the public
official receives benefits arising from that individual’s employment; or
         (e)   Any individual from whom the candidate receives benefits arising
from that individual’s employment.
   (B)   When an actual conflict of interest has been declared, the
Commissioner shall recuse themselves from participating in the public hearing
and shall leave the room for the remainder of the agenda item. The Commissioner
may return for subsequent agenda items.
   (C)   When a potential conflict of interest has been declared, the
Commissioner shall indicate whether they are capable of being an impartial
participant.
   (D)   Any party may challenge the declarations made or not made by a member
of the Planning Commission. The Chairperson may poll fellow Planning
Commissioners whether they believe the declaring member is capable of
participating in an impartial manner. If the Planning Commission vote
determines that the Commissioner does have a conflict of interest and is not
capable of participating in an impartial manner, the Commissioner shall recuse
themselves and shall leave the room. The Commissioner may return for subsequent
agenda items.
(Ord. 661, passed 5-6-2020)
§ 30.42 PROCEDURES IN HANDLING PARLIAMENTARY MOTIONS AND VOTING.
   (A)   To make a motion, a Commissioner must be recognized by the Chairperson
when there is no other business on the floor. The Commissioner then says, “I
move to...”
   (B)   Another member of the Commission may second the motion. This can be
done without being recognized by the Chairperson. If no member seconds the
motion, the motion “dies” for lack of a second. The Chairperson will then move
on to the next item of business.
   (C)   If a motion is made and seconded, the Chairperson restates the motion.
This procedure is necessary for the motion to come before the Commission. Prior
to this step, the Chairperson can suggest changes in the motion and the mover
can amend or withdraw his, her, or their original motion. No debate can take
place until the Chairperson states the motion is on the floor. At this point,
the mover may withdraw the motion.
   (D)   The Commissioners then debate the motion. The original mover is
entitled to speak first. Each Commissioner may speak but should not have the
floor a second time until all who wish to speak have spoken once.
   (E)   The Chairperson then puts the question to a vote. When the debate
appears to have closed, the Chairperson may call for the question. If no one
takes the floor, the Chairperson restates the motion and calls for a vote. The
Chairperson will decide the method of voting. Unless otherwise specified by the
Chairperson, the vote will be by polling of the Commissioners.
      (1)   Voice vote. The ayes are called first and then the nays. This is
the standard method of voting within Commission meetings.
      (2)   Polling of the Commissioners. Whenever the Chairperson shall call
for a polling of the members of the Commission, the order of polling shall be a
random order determined by the person recording the poll.
      (3)   Majority. A vote succeeds by a majority vote of the members
present.
      (4)   Tie vote. In the case of a tie vote, the motion dies due to lack of
majority.
      (5)   Abstentions. Abstentions, including a statement by the Commissioner
abstaining noting his, her, or their reason, shall be recorded in the meeting
minutes.
   (F)   The Chairperson announces the voting results. This step is included to
ensure the Commissioners, staff, and members of the public understand the
outcome of the vote and so that City Staff can accurately reflect the action
taken in the minutes and for the record.
(Ord. 661, passed 5-6-2020)
§ 30.43 DECORUM.
   (A)   Every Commissioner desiring to speak to an issue will address the
Chairperson and, upon recognition, will confine remarks to the issue under
debate. Except by permission of the Chairperson, a Commissioner shall address
any remarks to the Planning Commission and not to the audience.
   (B)   Commissioners questioning, seeking clarification, or soliciting a
recommendation from City Staff will direct the concern to the appropriate staff
member. The City Staff member may respond as requested or redirect the inquiry
to another member of the staff.
   (C)   Upon recognition and permission of the Chairperson, a person in the
audience may address the Commission relative to any matter being considered by
the Commission at that time. All persons speaking in a Planning Commission
meeting shall state his or her name and address; limit comments to the issue
under discussion; limit remarks to three minutes; and be courteous to the
Commissioners, staff, and audience. Members of the public wishing to speak
during a public hearing may only do so during the designated public testimony
period, under the rules stated by the Chair upon opening the hearing and
pursuant to procedures adopted by the City and the Oregon Revised Statutes.
Failure to do so may result in forfeiture of the remaining comment period or
removal from the meeting.
   (D)   The City Administrator or, in his or her absence, an appropriate
designee, will assist the Chairperson (or acting Chairperson) in maintaining
the order and decorum at all meetings.
(Ord. 661, passed 5-6-2020)
§ 30.44 HEARINGS.
   All hearings conducted by the Planning Commission shall be pursuant to
procedures adopted by the City and the Oregon Revised Statutes for the conduct
of hearings.

PUBLIC SAFETY FEE
§ 31.15 PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (A)   The principal purpose of the public safety fee adopted under this
subchapter is to safeguard, facilitate, and encourage the health, safety, and
welfare of the residents and businesses of the City. The City Council finds
that continuous and consistent police services provide a multitude of economic
and social benefits to the public, including, but not limited to:
      (1)   Increased police protection;
      (2)   Prevention of crime;
      (3)   Enhanced protection of property;
      (4)   Promotion of business and industry; and
      (5)   Promotion of community spirit and growth.
   (B)   It is the intent of this subchapter to provide a funding mechanism to
help pay for the benefits conferred on City residents and businesses by the
provision of an adequate level of police protection and public safety within
the City.
   (C)   The public safety fee enacted in this subchapter is intended to
supplement existing funding and is not intended to provide full funding for
police services. In the event that the public safety fee revenues collected are
insufficient to offset the costs of police services, additional funding may be
allocated by the City Council from other non-dedicated City funds, provided,
however, the City Council may direct the reimbursement to such other non-
dedicated City funds if additional public safety fee revenues are collected.
(Ord. 656, passed 7-3-2018; Ord. 659, passed 12-5-2018)
§ 31.16 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   DEVELOPED PROPERTY. A parcel of real property, or portion thereof, on which
improvements have been constructed. Improvements include, but are not limited
to, buildings, structures, parking lots, and outside storage.
   NON-RESIDENTIAL UNIT. A developed property which is primarily not for
personal domestic accommodation, including, but not limited to, business or
commercial enterprise. A non-residential structure which provides facilities
for one or more businesses or tenants, including, but not limited to, permanent
provisions for access to the public, shall have each distinct unit or tenancy
considered as a separate NON-RESIDENTIAL UNIT. A business that leases storage
space does not create separate units for each storage space so long as the
lease does not provide for general public access to the storage space from
which the lessee runs a business.
   PERSON. A natural person, unincorporated association, tenancy in common,
partnership, corporation, limited liability company, cooperative, trust,
governmental agency (including the state but excluding the City), or other
entity in law or in fact.
   RESIDENTIAL UNIT. A developed property primarily used for personal domestic
accommodation which provides complete individual living facilities for one or
more persons, including, but not limited to, permanent provisions for living,
sleeping, and sanitation. A home business within a RESIDENTIAL UNIT is not a
separate non-residential unit. An accessory dwelling unit on a parcel is a
separate RESIDENTIAL UNIT. Each individual dwelling unit within a multi-family
residential property, condominium, or mobile home park is a separate
RESIDENTIAL UNIT. A business that provide long term assisted living care,
including, but not limited to, a long-term care facility, but that does not
provide full individualized living facilities for each dwelling unit is a
single non-residential unit, not separate residential units. Transient lodging
is not a RESIDENTIAL UNIT.
   RESPONSIBLE PARTY. The person owing the public safety fee. Unless another
RESPONSIBLE PARTY has agreed in writing to pay the public safety fee and a copy
of that writing is filed with the City, the person(s) paying the City’s utility
charges is the RESPONSIBLE PARTY. If there is no service to or billing for the
developed property or if service or billing has been discontinued, the
RESPONSIBLE PARTY is the person(s) having the right to occupy the property.
   TRANSIENT LODGING. A hotel, motel, or inn dwelling unit that is used for
temporary overnight human occupancy; a space used for parking a recreational
vehicle or erecting a tent during temporary periods of human occupancy; or
other dwelling units or portions of dwelling units that are used for temporary
human occupancy. For the purposes of this definition, TEMPORARY means less than
30 consecutive days.
(Ord. 656, passed 7-3-2018)
§ 31.17 ESTABLISHMENT AND IMPOSITION.

      (1)   The public safety fee shall be assessed to each residential unit
and to each non-residential unit.
      (2)   The obligation to pay the public safety fee exists when a person

is a developed property.

public safety fee.
      (4)   Undeveloped properties within the City are not subject to the
public safety fee.

amount of the public safety fee and all rates, deposits, penalties, and other
charges provided for under this subchapter.
      (2)   Such fees, rates, deposits, penalties, and other charges shall be
established by Council resolution without the necessity of amending this
subchapter, and such resolution when duly passed shall provide the lawful fee,

the public safety fee created by this subchapter; provided, however, the
requirements of law be complied with in connection therewith.
   (B)   The Council shall review the public safety fee rates on an annual
basis in preparation for the City’s annual budget. The fee rates should be
reviewed in conjunction with desired public safety service levels and the
associated costs of providing those service levels.
(Ord. 656, passed 7-3-2018)
§ 31.19 DEDICATION OF FUNDS.
   All public safety fee revenues shall be distinctly and clearly noted in the
City budget and shall only be used for the purposes stated within this
subchapter.
(Ord. 656, passed 7-3-2018)
§ 31.20 BILLING AND COLLECTION.
   (A)   The public safety fee shall be billed and collected monthly from the

item on the City monthly utility billing wherever feasible, unless otherwise
specified below.
   (B)   Unless another person responsible has agreed in writing to pay and a
copy of that writing is filed with the City, the person normally responsible
for paying the City’s water and sewer utility charges is responsible for paying
the public safety fee.
   (C)   In the event a developed property is not served by a domestic water
meter, sewer hook-up, or if water and sewer service is disconnected, the public
safety fee shall be paid by the persons having the right to occupy the
property.
   (D)   (1)   A presumption shall exist that a property is a developed
property under this subchapter when a property receives water service, receives
sewer service, is under lease, is issued a building permit, or receives an
occupancy permit.

for the property shall have the burden to show that the property is not a
developed property.
   (E)   There shall be no charge for an undeveloped property until such time
as building permits are issued for that property.

number of water meters serving that property.
   (G)   Monies received from responsible parties will first be credited toward
the public safety fee and then to other outstanding City charges.
   (H)   The City Council may, in its fee rate resolution, provide for
penalties for delinquency of payments to ensure prompt payment of public safety
fee billings.
(Ord. 656, passed 7-3-2018)
§ 31.21 PROGRAM ADMINISTRATION.
   The City Administrator shall be responsible for the administration of this

the City Administrator under this subchapter may appeal the decision to the
City Council in accordance with this section.

with the City Recorder a written notice of appeal together with a written
statement listing how the City erred, including any supporting documentation to
justify the appeal.
   (C)   The City Council shall make all reasonable attempts to resolve appeals
utilizing available existing information, including supporting documentation
filed with the appeal, within 35 days of the date the appeal was filed. If,
however, more detailed site-specific information is necessary, the City Council
may request the applicant provide additional information.
   (D)   The City Council shall file a report within 90 days of the date the
appeal was filed explaining the disposition of the appeal, along with the
rationale and supporting documentation for the decision reached.
   (E)   When a responsible party disputes an interpretation given by the City
as to a property’s classification or the responsible party’s liability for the
fee, if the appeal is successful, relief will be reassignment to a more
appropriate billing category. In such instances, a refund of fees to the
responsible party will be limited to any overpayment, retroactive to the filing
date of the appeal. In deciding such an appeal, factors to be taken into
consideration include, but are not limited to, availability of more accurate
information; equity relative to billing classifications assigned to other
developments of a similar nature; changed circumstances; and situations
uniquely affecting the party filing the appeal.
(Ord. 656, passed 7-3-2018)
§ 31.23 ENFORCEMENT.
   (A)   In the event funds received for payments on a City monthly service
bill are inadequate to satisfy in full all of the water, sewer, and public
safety charges, credit shall be given first to the public safety fee, second to
the sewer service charges, and third to charges for water service.
   (B)   In addition to other lawful enforcement procedures, the City may
enforce the collection of charges required by this subchapter by withholding
delivery of water to any premises where the public safety fee is delinquent.
   (C)   Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the City may
institute any necessary legal proceedings to enforce the provisions of this
subchapter, including, but not limited to, injunctive relief and collection of
charges owing. The City’s enforcement rights shall be cumulative.

year, the person shall notify the City Clerk's office, at least seven days
prior to shutoff, and pay in full all assessments in arrears at the office of
the City Recorder. The person shall establish with the City Clerk a date for
the resumption of service, which may be revised upon mutual written agreement
of the person and City Clerk. Only one revision is allowed. The water will be
turned off by Public Works and a lock will be installed on the meter.
      (1)   During the period of temporary discontinuance, the City will charge
a standby rate as set by Council resolution. The City Council establishes the
initial standby rate of $90 per month, which includes public safety and street
fees. This rate may be revised by Council resolution, as required.
      (2)   Upon the date established in the request, or as revised, the lock
shall be removed, service restored, and normal billing rates resumed.

   Projects shall be defined by the Public Works Superintendent and will
include those located in basins of the sanitary sewer system as identified by
the City’s adopted Waste Water Facilities Planning Study as high flow basins,
and such other areas as the Public Works Superintendent may designate or by
inclusion within the City’s Capital Improvement Plan for system repair and/or
replacement projects to reduce inflow and infiltration.
§ 53.46 INSPECTION OF BUILDING SEWERS.
   (A)   Inspection and investigation methods.
      (1)   The City may at any time inspect and investigate the condition of
building sewers using:
         (a)   Flow monitoring;
         (b)   Television inspection;
         (c)   Smoke testing;
         (d)   Dye testing;
         (e)   Air or water pressure tests;

         (h)   Indirect measurement; and/or
         (i)   Other appropriate methods.
      (2)   Investigation and inspection may additionally include public sewer
mains and manholes. Investigation and inspection methods shall not be harmful
to the operation of the system and may be used to identify, verify, and
quantify locations and amounts of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary
sewer system. The City shall determine the scope and methods to be used for the
portion of the system to be inspected.
   (B)   Inspection and investigation notice.
      (1)   Notice to property owners. Where inspection or investigation
methods such as building sewer television inspection or location require
physical entry onto private property by City Staff and equipment, the City
shall obtain permission to perform the inspection from the owner. If the
property owner refuses to allow the City to enter the property, the City may
obtain an administrative search warrant. Notice shall also be given to any
occupants as provided in division (B)(2) below.
      (2)   Notice to occupants. Where investigation methods such as smoke
testing are used that may impact structures or their occupants, the City shall
attempt to notify occupants prior to performing the investigation and inform
them of any precautions they may wish to take to reduce potential inconvenience
to themselves or the property. The City shall not be required to notify
property owners of inspections or investigations which do not require staff or
equipment to enter the property, in addition, notice shall be given by door
hangers or personal contact, and may be given by general press release.
§ 53.47 NOTICE OF DEFECTS AND REQUIRED CONNECTIONS.
   (A)   General. Where inspection or investigation reveals defects in the
building sewer on private property outside the City’s sewer main, no further
proof is needed for the City to require the building sewer be replaced to
current standards. The property owner shall be required to correct the defects
or pay a penalty in accordance with this chapter. The City shall inform the
property owner in writing of the type and location of the defect and of the
time in which correction of the defect is required. If the owner and sewer user
of the building sewer elects to dispute the opinion of the City, the owner may
test the service at his, her, or their own expense in the presence of the City.
The test shall meet the requirements of the Oregon State Plumbing Specialty
Code (OSPSC) and any other City standards that may apply. The results of the
test will be the basis of the final replacement decision, if it is determined
the building sewer is not defective, the City shall reimburse the property
owner for the reasonable cost of the test.
   (B)   Permit required. Any person intending to perform structural
maintenance work on a building sewer may do so only after obtaining all City
and other required permits.
   (C)   Notice of completion of repairs. The property owner shall notify the
City that the permitted corrections have been completed and shall request an
inspection from the City. The City retains the right to require additional
information from the property owner and to inspect the correction or repair to
assure that it has been done in accordance with all applicable rules and codes.
If the repair is found to be inadequate, the City shall notify the owner and
the owner shall make the necessary corrections. The City shall notify the
property owner of acceptance of the repair.
   (D)   Notice of defects; correction not required. Where inspection or
investigation reveals apparent flaws in a structure’s interior plumbing
(building drain), which do not contribute infiltration or inflow to the
sanitary sewer system, the City may, but is not required to, inform the
property owner of the type and location of such flaws, if known.
§ 53.48 REPAIR OF DEFECTS.
   (A)   The City shall determine the schedule for its sewer main and/or
lateral structural maintenance work in designated rehabilitation areas and may
perform work with its crews or by contract according to that schedule. Nothing
in this chapter shall require the City to modify its structural maintenance
schedule or compensate property owners for structural maintenance work
performed ahead of the City’s schedule.
   (B)   If, when performing structural maintenance on a lateral, the City
discovers that the condition, location, or material of the existing building
sewer pipe is such that a structurally sound connection at the right-of-way
line cannot be made without further repair or replacement on private property,
the City shall make a temporary connection, document the nature of the defect,
and secure the excavation area. The City shall provide written notice to the
property owner of the existence of the building sewer defect and temporary
connection. Unless the excavation area is a public safety hazard, the notice
shall provide a time certain not less than five nor more than ten days for the
property owner to complete the required repair on private property. Upon
expiration of such time, the City may backfill the excavation area. The City
shall not be required to correct defects or perform building sewer repair work
on private property nor shall it be responsible for any additional cost to the
property owner due to failure to perform repairs within the time specified in
the notice.
   (C)   If the investigation shows only a portion of the building sewer is
defective, the owner may elect to perform a spot repair. Spot repairs are
limited to concrete, cast iron, and PVC pipe material only. Upon completion of
the repair, the building sewer shall be tested and must pass the requirements
of the OSPSC and City standards. Tests for spot repairs are at the property
owner’s expense and are not reimbursable.
§ 53.49 ENFORCEMENT AND REMEDIES.
   (A)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Civil penalty. Failure to take action to correct identified defects
as required in these rules shall be deemed to be a public nuisance and a
violation of City ordinances for such nuisances. For any failure to correct
defects in a privately owned or maintained building sewer, the schedule of
civil penalties shall be as provided in this section. Penalties shall be
assessed beginning at the end of a 90-calendar day grace period following
mailing or posting a notice of defect to the property owner. The civil penalty
schedule shall be $50 per month, subject to any extensions or suspensions that
the City may approve pursuant to these rules.
      (2)   Suspension of penalty collection. If the property owner requests
it, the City may suspend collection of penalties for up to ten months to allow
the property owner additional time to make the required repair. Penalties will
continue to accrue during the suspension period. If corrective action has not
been taken within the ten-month suspension period, all accrued penalties shall
become due and payable on the first day of the first month following the
suspension period and monthly thereafter. The suspension of penalty period will
not be available to property owners with direct connection defects only.
   (B)   Other remedies. Any civil penalty imposed under these rules shall be
in addition to the collection of the regular sewer service fee or charge and
any other fines, penalties, damages, or legal remedies available to the City.
§ 53.50 INCENTIVE FOR TIMELY COMPLETION OF REPAIRS.
   (A)   Subject to budgetary limitations established by the City Council, the
City may offer a monetary incentive as provided in this section to encourage
property owners to make the required repairs quickly and to help offset the
cost of the repairs. The City shall not be required to offer or continue the
incentive program, except as authorized by the City Council.
   (B)   The incentive program, if offered, shall apply to the grace period
following the date of the notice of defect. If the property owner has requested
an inspection, but the inspection authority is unable to perform the inspection
within the time limits, the date of the documented inspection request shall be
used to determine the amount of the incentive.
   (C)   The City may approve and make payments to the property owners
completing repair of defects as provided in this section. If repairs are
completed and accepted within the grace period, the property owner shall be
eligible for a maximum monetary incentive equal to 10% of the pipe repair costs
up to a maximum limit of $250. Eligible repair costs are limited to those costs
for pipe material, excavation, and burying pipe in the soil between the
building and the connection to the lateral. This specifically excludes
landscape repairs, sidewalk repairs, driveway repairs, and other repair costs
incidental to replacing the pipe in the ground.
   (D)   (1)   Any property owner requesting a monetary incentive payment as
provided in this section shall submit a complete application to the City no
later than 60 days following inspection and acceptance of the repair by the
City.
      (2)   A complete application shall include:
         (a)   The name and address of the owner; and
         (b)   Certification by the applicant that repairs were not paid for by
a renter, lessor, or any other person.
§ 53.51 FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE.
   Upon application by a property owner required to repair a building sewer as
required by this chapter, the City Administrator is granted authority to enter
into a contract with the property owner for installment payments on the
following basis:
   (A)   The property owner shall select a licensed contractor to complete the
required work and provide the City with a cost estimate of the work to be
completed.
   (B)   Prior to authorizing the contractor to proceed with the work, the
property owner shall meet with the City Recorder (as City Treasurer) and sign
an application and agreement to pay the repair costs based on the estimate plus
25%. The application for installment payments shall be on the prescribed form
and shall constitute a lien upon the property.
   (C)   The application shall provide for a monthly payment for a period not
to exceed 24 months. Interest shall accrue on the balance due at the prime
interest rate plus 3.5%.
   (D)   At the time of completion and inspection of the repair work, the City
shall make payment to the property owner and contractor based on the actual
billing submitted to the owner by the contractor and adjust the monthly
installment payment to reflect the actual cost.

In the event such an application is rejected by the Public Works
Superintendent, such application may be appealed to the City Council at its
next regular meeting.
      (3)   A building permit shall not be issued until all applicable Systems
Development Charges (SDC) and associated charges have been paid. It shall be
the duty of the City Administrator or Public Works Superintendent to enforce
the provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   Sewer connection charges are those charged for any and all of the
following:
      (1)   Sewer connections to the City sewer system;
      (2)   Change in the use of an existing connection, including, but not
limited to, building additions or expansions which include sanitary facilities;
and
      (3)   Substantial increase(s) in the flow or alteration of the character
of wastewater to an existing connection.
   (C)   It is the responsibility of the Building Inspector to notify the
Public Works Superintendent in writing whenever a land parcel or a structure
falls within the classifications listed in division (B) above. The Public Works
Superintendent shall compute and file with the Building Inspector his or her
findings in regard to this matter.
§ 54.03 CONNECTION PERMIT DURATION AND FORFEITURE UPON EXPIRATION.
   A sewer connection permit expires 180 days following its date of issuance.
Failure to complete the sewer connection and obtain inspection and approval of
such connection by the City or designated approval authority, within 180-day
period or within any extension of time or reinstatement period as provided
below, shall result in forfeiture of all connection fees paid and the
nullification of the permit.
   (A) Upon submittal of a written request and fee (to be set by resolution) to
the City prior to the expiration of the 180-day period described above, the
City may, in its discretion, grant an extension of time up to 30 days from the
expiration date for good cause. Such request shall state the building permit
number and the reason for the extension request. The request shall be signed by
the property owner. Only one extension of time shall be allowed; thereafter,
the property owner must apply for permit reinstatement.
   (B)   An expired connection permit may be reinstated upon showing of good
cause for an additional 90-day period, provided the request for reinstatement
has been made within 90 days of the original expiration date of the permit. The
90-day reinstatement period shall begin from the expiration date of the
original permit. The application for reinstatement shall state the building
permit number, the reason for the need for reinstatement; shall be signed by
the property owner; and shall be accompanied by the reinstatement fee (to be
set by resolution). A permit may be reinstated only once.
   (C)   Permit fees will be computed at the rate in force at the time a
building permit has been applied for and the plan check fee paid.
§ 54.04 NEW SERVICE; PAYMENT GUARANTEE.
   (A)   In all new subdivisions and all new areas not served by existing sewer
lines where sanitary sewer service is required, the City Council may require
the payment or guarantee of payment of the SDC covering the construction and
installation of sanitary sewers in such areas.
   (B)   Such payments shall be made immediately upon demand and shall be
credited against SDC and charges, or the City Council may create a sanitary
sewer district, and after the costs have been determined and apportioned, cause
the premises to be assessed and such assessments entered in the docket of City
liens.
§ 54.05 SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT CHARGES; DESIGNATED; METHOD OF COMPUTATION; CREDITS.
   (A)   (1)   The System Development Charge (SDC) to connect to a City
sanitary sewer shall be computed by unit or Equivalent Dwelling Unit (EDU).
Unit charges will be computed based on classification of service at the rate
and charges as follows:
         (a)   1.   Residential method:
               a.   Single-family dwelling units, including manufactured homes:
CALCULATION: One EDU = One unit;
               b.   Duplexes, apartments, condominiums, dormitories,
convalescent/residential care facilities, hotels, and motels in which the units
include individual kitchens: CALCULATION: One EDU = One unit;
               c.   Dormitories, convalescent/residential care facilities,
hotels, and motels in which the units do not include individual kitchens:
CALCULATION: One EDU = Two units (in the case of convalescent/residential care
facilities, one unit=one bed);
               d.   Bed and breakfast facilities and other similar commercial
lodging facilities: CALCULATION: One EDU for the first five bedrooms plus one
EDU for every two bedrooms over five; and
               e.   Recreational vehicle park: CALCULATION: One EDU = Two
recreational vehicle spaces with sewer hookups.
            2.   The calculations for the residential method shall apply
whether the dwelling unit is occupied or not. The calculated charge includes
all facilities such as common laundries, kitchens, and recreation areas,
provided they are intended for the sole use of the residents and guests. If the
structure also contains commercial operations available for use by the general
public, the charges for those facilities used for commercial operations shall
be calculated using the fixture count method.
            3.   An individual manufactured home located on a platted site will
be charged for the SDC on the same basis as any other structure. A site for a
manufactured home unit located within a manufactured home park will not be
charged for each change of a manufactured home unit if the sanitary sewer
connection has a trap and vent system independent of the structure.
         (b)   Fixture count method:
            1.   This method shall apply to all nonresidential uses, when the
Industrial Method is not required to be used. The Fixture Count Method shall
apply to all commercial, nonmetered industrial uses, restaurants, laundries,
laundromats, schools, hospitals, public facilities, swimming pool filters, and
all other similar nonresidential uses. The fixture unit values shall be as
listed in division (A)(1)(b)(2) below. CALCULATION: One EDU = 16 fixture units;
            2.   a.   Fixture unit value shall be as shown below. Any fixture
unit rating not addressed in this table shall be calculated pursuant to the
current state’s Plumbing Specialty Code being OAR 918-750-0010 et seq.

   *Fixture unit values for garbage disposals of three-fourths horsepower or
less, installed in nonresidential applications, shall be based on the proposed
use of the facility. Uses associated with commercial food processing,
preparation, handling, or group food service (cafeterias) shall be charged 16
fixture units. Uses for individual employee support (e.g., employee lunchrooms)
shall not be separately charged.

               b.   Note that a separate water meter is required for car
washes, and that adjustments to the SDC for car washes may be made based on
actual water use after six months of operation.
            3.   Industrial method: Industrial connections are for those
structures used primarily for manufacturing. Minor and major industrial
connection and sewer service charges cover only the industrial waste/wastewater
portion of the industrial user’s discharge. The minor and major industrial user
must also pay connection and sewer service charges, based upon fixture units,
for its nonindustrial wastewater discharge. There are three industrial
categories as follows:
               a.   Category I. Dry industrial user does not generate or
discharge any industrial waste or wastewater. Industrial users that discharge
less than 50 gallons of industrial wastewater on any one day may be included in
this category with the approval of the Public Works Superintendent.
CALCULATION: One EDU = 16 fixture units or fraction thereof;
               b.   Category II. Minor metered water use or wastewater
discharge is less than 25,000 gallons per day (gpd). CALCULATION: One EDU = 300
gpd. If waste discharged is not known, then the fixture unit rates will be
used. Any adjustment in connection charge will be made after six months of
operation; and
               c.   Category III.
                  i.   Major metered water use or wastewater discharge is equal
to or greater than 25,000 gpd or strength of waste discharged is more than:
 
700 mg/l Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
300 mg/l Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
350 mg/l Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
8 mg/l Total Phosphorus (TP)
25 mg/l Ammonia (NH3)
 
                  ii.   The Public Works Superintendent shall select one or
more of the following calculations for determining the connection charge:
 
One EDU = 300 gpd average value
One EDU = 0.70 pounds BOD per day average value
One EDU = 1.4 pounds COD per day average value
One EDU = 0.70 pounds TSS per day average value
One EDU = 0.11 pounds NH3 per day average value
One EDU = 0.028 pounds TP per day average value
 
                  iii.   Such selection shall be made on the basis of the
impact the industrial user’s discharge is anticipated to have upon the sewerage
system and shall be aimed at ensuring that the industrial user in question pays
his or her fair share in light of the impact of its discharge, as determined by
the City. The City may, in its discretion, require the user to separate its
industrial wastewater discharge from its nonindustrial waste discharge.
      (2)   Large parcel depth over 120 feet or one-half block shall be subject
to additional unit charges for any units lying therein and the cost of sewer
line extensions required to service same.
      (3)   Where a sewer is financed and constructed by a developer for City
ownership and operation, the facility development fee will be waived and only
the SDC will be levied.
      (4)   All construction will conform to the applicable City and state’s
Plumbing Specialty Code standards. The City reserves the right to reject any
sewer constructed for connection to the sewer main.
   (B)   (1)   Whenever a SDC is computed on property for which the SDC has
been previously paid, a credit may, in the discretion of the Public Works
Superintendent, be allowed. The amount of credit shall be determined by the
Public Works Superintendent by taking into consideration the SDC calculation
method at the time of the payment of the earlier SDC along with the number of
existing and proposed Equivalent Dwelling Unit or EDUs and then computing the
extent and amount of the credit, if any.
      (2)   If records of such previous charges are not available, the burden
of proof shall be on the property owner to establish the amount of the earlier
charges. The exact manner of calculation of any credit allowed shall be in the
discretion of the Public Works Superintendent.
§ 54.06 SDC; DESIGNATED; METHOD OF COMPUTATION.
   (A)   Owners of property applying to connect facilities directly to the City
sanitary sewer system who will receive special and peculiar benefit from such
connection, but who have not directly contributed to the cost of the line to
which they will make connection shall, in addition to the regular sewer
connection charge, be charged and assessed for the special and peculiar benefit
the property received, as determined by the City. This charge shall be set by
Council resolution.
   (B)   The FDF is derived from a frontage rate multiplied by the number of
front feet. The minimum frontage assessment will be for 75 lineal feet.
   (C)   Frontage of large tracts (unplatted residential, commercial, and
industrial) shall be measured as the amount of developed portion along the
actual sewer line in cases where the sewer line crosses through the tract and
measured as street frontage of the developed portion where the sewer service is
from a street location.

SERVICE FEES
§ 54.25 OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE; FINDINGS.
   Pursuant to the general laws of the state and the powers granted by the
charter of the City, the City has heretofore acquired, constructed, and now
operates and maintains within the City a Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW),
sewers, equipment, and appurtenances necessary, useful, and convenient for a
complete sewer system, and the City Council declares its intention to operate
and maintain said sewer system and to acquire and construct additions and
improvements thereto, including maintenance and reconstruction, as may be
necessary, useful, and convenient for a complete wastewater collection system
and Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW).
§ 54.26 PURPOSE AND IMPOSITION OF CHARGES.
   There is levied and imposed upon all water users within the City using water
from the City’s water system just and equitable charges for service to such
premises by the sewer system in order to create a fund to provide adequate
maintenance and operation of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW),
wastewater collection system, and extensions and additions and improvements
thereto.
§ 54.27 BASIS FOR DETERMINATION; ANNUAL REVIEW.
   (A)   The charges to be established in a separate resolution are determined
to be just and equitable charges and are based upon the amount of water
actually discharged into the sanitary sewer system. Except as otherwise
provided in this chapter, the amount of water discharged into the sanitary
sewer system shall be determined by the water purchased by the water user from
the water system of the City.
   (B)   The City Council shall conduct an annual review of the sewer user
charges and revise them periodically by resolution to reflect the actual
operation and maintenance expenses of the sewer system, including lines, pump
stations, and the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW).
§ 54.28 SERVICE FEES.
   The monthly service (sewer user) charges are calculated on the basis of
water consumption and a fixed customer charge.
   (A)   The volume charge shall be established in a resolution based on water
consumption which shall be computed on the water consumption records of the
City. Customers will be charge for actual consumption except as modified in
later sections of this chapter.
   (B)   The customer service charge shall be established in a resolution
setting the rates to be charged. Each individual residence, business, or
industry shall be charged a customer charge. Multiple or mixed residences and
businesses served by an individual water service shall be each charged a
customer charge based on the total number of single-family living units and/or
commercial units that receive water service.
§ 54.29 CHARGES FOR USERS NOT CONNECTED TO THE CITY SEWER SYSTEM.
   (A)   Whenever a structure has sanitary sewer directly available to the
property, the sewer user will be charged for sewer service based on the sewer
user classification and the customer charge for said sewer as long as the
property is not connected to the sewer system. Directly available is defined as
a building within 150 feet of the public sewer system and not requiring an
easement or other access right-of-way to construct service lines to it.
   (B)   A credit on the System Development Charge will be granted for the
monthly sewer user fee paid.
§ 54.30 CHARGES FOR UNMETERED USERS.
   A residential sanitary sewer user who is not connected to the City water
system shall pay the flat fee rate charge established in the resolution adopted
by City Council. A residential user who is connected to the City water system
but whose water is not metered shall pay the flat rate charge of an amount to
be determined in relation to the water charge established by the City.
§ 54.31 CHURCHES AND EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.
   Such institutional buildings shall be classified and charged the residential
user’s rate in accordance with §
54.28.
§ 54.32 ADDITIONAL SURCHARGE FOR SPECIAL DISCHARGES.
   (A)   In addition to the rates above provided, there shall be an additional
surcharge for industrial users that generate wastewater discharge
concentrations in excess of:
 
250 mg/l Total Suspended Solids (TSS)
200 mg/l Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD)
500 mg/l Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD)
5 mg/l Total Phosphorus (TP)
20 mg/l Ammonia (NH3)
 
   (B)   The surcharge shall be established within the rate resolution adopted
by the City Council.
§ 54.33 REDUCED WHEN.
   (A)   Sewer charges provided for in this chapter are based upon water
purchased from the water system of the City.
   (B)   Said charges may be reduced when a portion of the water purchased is
not discharged into the sanitary sewer system of the City and the amount
thereof is measurable as follows:
      (1)   Based upon a water flow meter located in a sanitary sewer line;
      (2)   When a portion of the water purchased by a sewer user is not
discharged into the sanitary sewer system and the amount of said water can be
accurately metered;
      (3)   When water purchased by a sewer user is used in a manufacturing
process and the amount thereof is subject to accurate measurement based upon
metering or upon such records as are approved by the Public Works
Superintendent and are kept by the sewer user in the ordinary and usual course
of business; and
      (4)   When the water has leaked onto the ground or other surface and has
not entered the sewer system. Credit for water not discharged to the sanitary
sewer system shall be computed based upon water flow records prior to and after
the leak has been fixed.
§ 54.34 SEPTIC WASTE.
   Rates for disposal of septic waste from residential sources and chemical
toilet waste shall be set in the rate resolution. Nonresidential wastes will
not be accepted.
§ 54.35 BILLING AND COLLECTION.
   All charges provided in this chapter, or hereafter provided, shall be
charged, paid, and collected monthly at the rates established by resolution,
which are monthly rates, and shall be added to and shown on the regular monthly
water bill or billed directly by the City and collected accordingly.
§ 54.36 BASIS FOR DETERMINING CHARGES.
   The basis for determining charges as set forth in this chapter is adopted
for the purpose of financing the operation and maintenance of the wastewater
collection system and for the purpose of financing construction of additions,
improvements, and extensions of the City’s wastewater collection system and
Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW).
§ 54.37 CITY’S AUTHORITY NOT RESTRICTED.
   This chapter shall in no way restrict the City’s authority to restrict waste
that is deleterious to the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) and other
wastewater appurtenances.
§ 54.38 COLLECTION; PENALTY FOR DELINQUENT PAYMENT.
   The City may enforce the collection of rates and charges for use of
wastewater facilities as may be provided by the laws of the state or permitted
by the charter and ordinances of the City, and any delinquencies shall be
placed on the lien docket of the City and may be certified to the County
assessor for collection in the manner as provided by ORS 454.225. Rates and
charges for wastewater facilities as provided in this chapter shall be
collected monthly by the City, and if not paid on or before ten days from and
after the date the same is payable, said rates and charges shall be deemed to
be delinquent and subject to the same penalty as for the nonpayment of charges
for water.
§ 54.99 PENALTY.
   Any person, firm, or corporation violating any of the provisions of this
chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of not more than $500 for
each day that violation continues. Trial shall be before the court without a
jury with no right to appeal. The City reserves the right to seek such other

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 55.001 GENERAL DISCHARGE PROHIBITIONS.
   (A)   No sewer user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW
any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These
general prohibitions apply to all sewer users of the POTW whether or not they
are subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards or any other national, state,
or local pretreatment standards or requirements.
   (B)   No sewer user shall introduce or cause to be introduced into the POTW
the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:
      (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW,
including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of
less than 140°F (60°C) using the test methods specified in 40 C.F.R. § 261.21;
      (2)   Wastewater having a pH less than 6.0 or more than 11.0 SU, or
otherwise causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;
      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause obstruction
of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference but in no case solids greater
than one-half inch in any dimension;
      (4)   Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD and the
like), released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration
which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause
interference with the POTW;
      (5)   Wastewater having a temperature greater than 140°F (60°C), or which
will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in
interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the temperature at the
introduction into the treatment plant to exceed 104°F (40°C);
      (6)   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or pass through;
      (7)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or
fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker health and
safety problems;
      (8)   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated
by the Public Works Superintendent in accordance with §
55.011;
      (9)   Noxious or malodorous liquids, aldehydes, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life or to prevent entry
into the sewers for maintenance or repair;
      (10)   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed by the
treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the treatment plant’s
effluent, thereby violating the City’s NPDES permit;
      (11)   Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in
compliance with the current “Oregon Regulations for the Control of Radiation”
(OAR 333-120-0520);
      (12)   Stormwater, surface water, ground water, artesian well water, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling
water, and unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the Public
Works Superintendent;
      (13)   Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the pretreatment of
industrial wastes;
      (14)   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by the Public
Works Superintendent in a City control mechanism;
      (15)   Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other sources,
the treatment plant’s effluent to fail toxicity test;
      (16)   Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances which might
cause excessive foaming in the POTW;
      (17)   Fats, oils, or greases of animal or vegetable origin in amounts
that will cause interference or pass through; and/or
      (18)   Wastewater causing two readings on an explosion hazard meter at
the point of discharge into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, of more than
10% of the lower explosive limit or any single reading over 20% of the lower
explosive limit of the meter.
   (C)   (1)   The Public Works Superintendent may develop Best Management
Practices (BMPs), by ordinance or in industrial wastewater discharge permits or
general permits to implement the requirements of §
55.001.
      (2)   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this section
shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged
to the POTW.
§ 55.002 NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   Categorical industrial users (CIU) must comply with the Categorical
Pretreatment Standards found at 40 C.F.R Chapter I, Subchapter N, parts 401
through 471.
   (B)   Where a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms
of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the
Public Works Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits
in accordance with divisions (F) and (G) below.
   (C)   When the limits in a Categorical Pretreatment Standard are expressed
only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the Public Works
Superintendent may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed
either as mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for
purposes of calculating effluent limitations applicable to individual
industrial users.
   (D)   When wastewater subject to a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is
mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same Standard, the Public Works
Superintendent shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 C.F.R. §
403.6(e).
   (E)   When a Categorical Pretreatment Standard is expressed only in terms of
pollutant concentrations, an industrial user may request that the City convert
the limits to equivalent mass limits. The determination to convert
concentration limits to mass limits is within the discretion of the Public
Works Superintendent. The City may establish equivalent mass limits only if the
industrial user meets all the conditions set forth in divisions (E)(1)(a)
through (E)(1)(e) below.
      (1)   To be eligible for equivalent mass limits, the industrial user
must:
         (a)   Employ or demonstrate that it will employ water conservation
methods and technologies that substantially reduce water use during the term of
its industrial wastewater discharge permit;
         (b)   Currently use control and treatment technologies adequate to
achieve compliance with the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard, and
not have used dilution as a substitute for treatment;
         (c)   Provide sufficient information to establish the facility’s
actual average daily flow rate for all wastestreams, based on data from a
continuous effluent flow monitoring device, as well as the facility’s long-term
average production rate. Both the actual average daily flow rate and the long-
term average production rate must be representative of current operating
conditions;
         (d)   Not have daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant
levels that vary so significantly that equivalent mass limits are not
appropriate to control the discharge; and
         (e)   Have consistently complied with all applicable Categorical
Pretreatment Standards during the period prior to the industrial user’s request
for equivalent mass limits.
      (2)   An industrial user subject to equivalent mass limits must:
         (a)   Maintain and effectively operate control and treatment
technologies adequate to achieve compliance with the equivalent mass limits;
         (b)   Continue to record the facility’s flow rates through the use of
a continuous effluent flow monitoring device;
         (c)   Continue to record the facility’s production rates and notify
the Public Works Superintendent whenever production rates are expected to vary
by more than 20% from its baseline production rates determined in division (E)
(1)(c) above. Upon notification of a revised production rate, the Public Works
Superintendent will reassess the equivalent mass limit and revise the limit as
necessary to reflect changed conditions at the facility; and
         (d)   Continue to employ the same or comparable water conservation
methods and technologies as those implemented pursuant to divisions (E)(1)(a)
above so long as it discharges under an equivalent mass limit.
      (3)   When developing equivalent mass limits, the Public Works
Superintendent:
         (a)   Will calculate the equivalent mass limit by multiplying the
actual average daily flow rate of the regulated process(es) of the industrial
user by the concentration-based daily maximum and monthly average standard for
the applicable Categorical Pretreatment Standard and the appropriate unit
conversion factor;
         (b)   Upon notification of a revised production rate, will reassess
the equivalent mass limit and recalculate the limit as necessary to reflect
changed conditions at the facility; and
         (c)   May retain the same equivalent mass limit in subsequent
industrial wastewater discharger permit terms if the industrial user’s actual
average daily flow rate was reduced solely as a result of the implementation of
water conservation methods and technologies, and the actual average daily flow
rates used in the original calculation of the equivalent mass limit were not
based on the use of dilution as a substitute for treatment pursuant to §
55.006. The industrial user must also be in compliance with § 55.022 regarding
the prohibition of bypass.
   (F)   The Public Works Superintendent may convert the mass limits of the
Categorical Pretreatment Standards of 40 C.F.R. parts 414, 419, and 455 to
concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations applicable to
individual industrial users. The conversion is at the discretion of the Public
Works Superintendent.
   (G)   Once included in its permit, the industrial user must comply with the
equivalent limitations developed in this section in lieu of the promulgated
Categorical Standards from which the equivalent limitations were derived.
   (H)   Many Categorical Pretreatment Standards specify one limit for
calculating maximum daily discharge limitations and a second limit for
calculating maximum monthly average, or four-day average, limitations. Where
such standards are being applied, the same production or flow figure shall be
used in calculating both the average and the maximum equivalent limitation.
   (I)   Any industrial user operating under a permit incorporating equivalent
mass or concentration limits calculated from a production-based standard shall
notify the Public Works Superintendent within two business days after the
industrial user has a reasonable basis to know that the production level will
significantly change within the next calendar month. Any industrial user not
notifying the Public Works Superintendent of such anticipated change will be
required to meet the mass or concentration limits in its permit that were based
on the original estimate of the long-term average production rate.   
§ 55.003 STATE PRETREATMENT REQUIREMENTS.
   Industrial users must comply with applicable state pretreatment standards
and requirements set out in Oregon Administrative Rules (OAR) Chapter 340,
Division 45, § 0063 and incorporated herein.
§ 55.004 LOCAL LIMITS.
   (A)   The Public Works Superintendent is authorized to establish local
limits pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(c), and may modify and publish revisions
from time to time appropriately.
   (B)   The following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass
through and interference. No significant industrial user (SIU) shall discharge
wastewater containing in excess of the following limitations listed in Table 1
below:
Table 1 - Local Limits
Pollutant Units Local Limit
Pollutant         Units Local Limit
Arsenic           mg/l  0.3
Cadmium           mg/l  0.2
Chromium          mg/l  5.7
Copper            mg/l  2.1
Cyanide           mg/l  0.5
Fats, oil, grease mg/l  100
Lead              mg/l  0.6
Mercury           mg/l  0.04
Molybdenum        mg/l  0.6
Nickel            mg/l  1.8

Silver            mg/l  0.2
Total metals      mg/l  10.5
Zinc              mg/l  2.8
 
   (C)   The local limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged
to the POTW or where industrial process water enters a separate sampling vault
and is the designated sample point for the SIU and the City. All concentrations
for metallic substances are for total metal unless indicated otherwise. The
Public Works Superintendent may impose mass limitations in addition to the
concentration-based limitations above.
§ 55.005 CITY’S RIGHT OF REVISION.
   The City reserves the right to establish, by ordinance or in industrial
wastewater discharge permits or in general permits, more stringent standards or
requirements on discharges to the POTW consistent with the purpose of this
chapter.
§ 55.006 DILUTION.
   No industrial user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any
way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Public Works Superintendent may impose mass limitations on industrial users who
are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or
in other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
§ 55.007 DISPOSAL OF OIL AND GREASE.
   (A)   All new restaurants and industrial users employing a fats, oils, and/
or grease process shall install an approved oil/grease trap or interceptor
before discharging to the POTW. In the case of other uses including preexisting
restaurants and industrial users, grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be
provided when, in the opinion of the Public Works Superintendent, they are
necessary for:
      (1)   The proper handling of liquid wastes containing oil or grease in
excessive amounts as to cause plugging or maintenance problems within the
collection system;
      (2)   Any flammable wastes; and
      (3)   Other harmful pollutants.
   (B)   Such interceptors shall be so located as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning, inspection, and sampling, and shall be approved by the
Public Works Superintendent prior to installation.
   (C)   Grease and oil interceptors shall be constructed of impervious
materials capable of withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperatures.
They shall be of substantial construction, watertight, and equipped with easily
removable cover which, when bolted in place, shall be gastight and watertight.
   (D)   Where installed, all grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be
maintained by the owner, at his or her expense to provide continuously
efficient operation through periodic removal of accumulated grease, scum, oil,
or other floating substances and solids deposited in the interceptor. All
cleaning residues shall be satisfactorily disposed of in an approved,
environmentally acceptable manner. Authorized City employees shall be allowed
access to grease traps and interceptors for the purpose of inspection and/or to
verify compliance with this section. Fat waste, oil, or grease removed from
such a facility shall not be disposed of in the sanitary or storm sewer. A
record of disposal shall be submitted to the City for review within 15 business
days.
   (E)   The use of hot water, enzymes, bacteria, chemicals, or other agents or
devices for the purpose of causing the contents of a pretreatment device to be
discharged into the sanitary system, or to avoid the installation of a
pretreatment device is prohibited.
§ 55.008 PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.
   (A)   Industrial users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to
comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all Categorical
Pretreatment Standards, local limits, and the prohibitions set out in §
55.001 within the time limitations specified by EPA, the state, or the Public
Works Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the industrial user’s
expense.
   (B)   Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the Public Works Superintendent for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Public Works Superintendent before such facilities are
constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the industrial user from the responsibility of modifying such
facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the
provisions of this chapter.
§ 55.009 ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.
   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Public Works Superintendent may require
industrial users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods,
designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers,
relocate, and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams
from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to
protect the POTW and determine the industrial user’s compliance with the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Public Works Superintendent may require any person discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense,
a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow. An
industrial wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
   (C)   The Public Works Superintendent may require any person discharging
into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense
grease, oil, and sand interceptors when, in the opinion of the Public Works
Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater
containing excessive amounts of grease and oil or sand; except that such
interceptors shall not be required for residential users. All interception
units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Public Works
Superintendent, and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning,
sampling, and inspection. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and
repaired by the user at his, her, or their expense.
   (D)   In the event the City, during maintenance of public sewer lines,
records situations of grease accumulation in lines sufficient to restrict the
normal flow of waste, upstream users shall be inspected. If the Public Works
Superintendent determines that an upstream user is responsible for the grease
or oil discharge, the user will be required to cease discharge of the
prohibited waste. Additionally, the user may be required to install an
interceptor, maintain the interceptor, and may be charged for the cost of
cleaning the line. When an obstruction of the public line occurs, a violation
of 40 C.F.R. § 403.5(b)(3) or (6) and §
55.001(B) has occurred.
   (E)   Industrial users with the potential to discharge flammable substances
may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter.
§ 55.010 ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG DISCHARGE CONTROL PLANS.
   (A)   The Public Works Superintendent shall evaluate whether each SIU needs
an accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control
slug discharges. The Public Works Superintendent may require any industrial
user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such
other action that may be necessary to control slug discharges.
   (B)   An accidental discharge/slug discharge control plan shall address, at
a minimum, the following:
      (1)    Description of discharge practices, including not routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Public Works
Superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by §
55.056; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
§ 55.011 MOBILE WASTE HAULER PERMITS.
   Mobile waste haulers may discharge loads only at locations designated by the
Public Works Superintendent. The Public Works Superintendent may collect
samples of each hauled load to ensure compliance with applicable standards. The
Public Works Superintendent may require the mobile waste hauler to provide a
waste analysis of any load prior to discharge.
   (A)   Permit required. Any person proposing to be a mobile waste hauler and
any person the Public Works Superintendent has determined is likely to be a
mobile waste hauler shall secure a mobile waste hauler discharge permit from
the City. Any discharge by a mobile waste hauler without a permit is a
violation of this chapter. Such waste shall not violate §
55.001 or any other requirements established by the City.
   (B)   Application. Any new mobile waste hauler shall apply for a mobile
waste hauler permit at least 30 days prior to its initial discharge.

      (6)   Proof of adequate general liability and property damage insurance.
   (C)   Application review. The Public Works Superintendent shall evaluate the
data furnished by the applicant and may determine that additional information
or sampling of wastewater characteristics is necessary. If such a determination
is made, the applicant, unless the time period is extended, will be given 30
days to provide the required information or sampling, if it is not provided
within the designated time period, the application shall be denied. After
determining that the submitted application contains all the information
required by this section, the Public Works Superintendent shall consider the
submission, any additional evidence that may have been requested, and any other
available information relevant to the application. If the Public Works
Superintendent determines that the proposed discharge meets the requirements of
this chapter and the additional septage does not otherwise overload or cause
damage to any portion of the POTW; or will not create an imminent or potential
hazard to personnel, the Public Works Superintendent shall, within 30 days
after determining that the application is complete, issue a mobile waste hauler
discharge permit subject to appropriate conditions.
   (D)   Modification of permit. Conditions included in a mobile waste hauler
discharge permit shall remain in effect for that permit until it expires,

jurisdictional boundaries for the purpose of inspection, sampling, and any
other duties deemed necessary by the Public Works Superintendent; and
      (8)   A provision specifying remedies available for breach of the terms
of the intergovernmental agreement.
§ 55.051 BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS.
   (A)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a Categorical
Pretreatment Standard, or the final administrative decision on a category
determination under 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to discharge
to the POTW shall submit to the Public Works Superintendent a report which
contains the information listed in division (B) below. At least 90 days prior
to commencement of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become
categorical industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable
categorical standard shall submit to the Public Works Superintendent a report
which contains the information listed in division (B) below. A new source shall
report the method of pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable
categorical standards. A new source also shall give estimates of its
anticipated flow and quantity of pollutants to be discharged.
   (B)   Categorical industrial user (CIU) described above shall submit the
information set forth below:
      (1)   All information required in §
55.028(A)(1) through (A)(6);
      (2)   Measurement of pollutants:
         (a)   The CIU shall provide the information required in §
55.028(A)(7)(a) through 55.028(A)(7)(d).
         (b)   The CIU shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this division
(B).
         (c)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the regulated process
if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed with the regulated
wastewater prior to pretreatment, the CIU should measure the flows and
concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined wastestream formula in 40
C.F.R. § 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance with the pretreatment standards. Where
an alternate concentration or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with
40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the Control Authority.
         (d)   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with §
55.060.
         (e)   The Public Works Superintendent may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.
         (f)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date, and place of
sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such sampling and
analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant
discharges to the POTW.
      (3)   Compliance certification: A statement, reviewed by the CIU’s
authorized representative as defined in §
53.04 and certified by a qualified professional, indicating whether
pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and, if not,
whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional
pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements;
      (4)   Compliance schedule: If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be
required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the
CIU will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M must be provided. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule
pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in §
55.052; and
      (5)   Signature and report certification: All baseline monitoring reports
must be certified in accordance with §
55.064(A) and signed by an authorized representative as defined in §
53.04.
§ 55.052 COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE PROGRESS REPORTS.
   The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by
§
55.051(B)(4):
   (A)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates
for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction
and operation of additional pretreatment required for the industrial user to
meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not
limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans,
executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);
   (B)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
   (C)   The industrial user shall submit a progress report to the Public Works
Superintendent no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date of compliance including, at a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the industrial user to return to the
established schedule; and
   (D)   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress
reports to the Public Works Superintendent.
§ 55.053 REPORTS ON COMPLIANCE WITH CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD DEADLINE.
   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
Categorical Pretreatment Standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any categorical
industrial user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall
submit to the Public Works Superintendent a report containing the information
described in §§
55.028(A)(6) through (A)(7) and 55.051(B)(2). For categorical industrial user
subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance
with the procedures in §
55.002, this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the categorical
industrial user’s long-term production rate. For all other industrial users
subject to Categorical Pretreatment Standards expressed in terms of allowable
pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation),
this report shall include the industrial user’s actual production during the
appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and
certified in accordance with §
55.064(A). All sampling will be done in conformance with §
55.061.
§ 55.054 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   Except as specified in division (C) below, all significant industrial
users must, at a frequency determined by the Public Works Superintendent,
submit no less than twice per year (June and December (or on dates specified))
reports indicating the nature; concentration of pollutants in the discharge,
which are limited by pretreatment standards; and the measured or estimated
average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases where the
pretreatment standard requires compliance with a Best Management Practice (BMP)
or pollution prevention alternative, the significant industrial user must
submit documentation required by the Public Works Superintendent or the
pretreatment standard necessary to determine the compliance status of the
significant industrial user.
   (B)   (1)   The City may authorize an industrial user subject to a
Categorical Pretreatment Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a Categorical Pretreatment Standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. (See 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e)(2).)
      (2)   This authorization is subject to the following conditions.
         (a)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to
be present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility
provided that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable
categorical standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
         (b)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the industrial wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five years. The industrial user must submit a new request for the
waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent industrial
wastewater discharge permit. (See §
55.028(A)(8).)
         (c)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
         (d)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with §
55.004(A), and include the certification statement in §
55.064(A) in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(2)(ii).
         (e)   Nondetectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 C.F.R. part
136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis;
         (f)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Public Works
Superintendent must be included as a condition in the industrial user’s permit.
The reasons supporting the waiver and any information submitted by the
industrial user in its request for the waiver must be maintained by the Public
Works Superintendent for three years after expiration of the waiver;
         (g)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the
industrial user’s permit by the Public Works Superintendent, the industrial
user must certify on each report with the statement in §
55.064(B), that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its wastestream
due to activities of the industrial user;
         (h)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or
is expected to be present because of changes that occur in the industrial
user’s operations, the industrial user must immediately comply with the
monitoring requirements of §
55.054(A), or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Public
Works Superintendent, and notify the Public Works Superintendent; and
         (i)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in Categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as
otherwise specified in the Categorical Pretreatment Standard.
   (C)   (1)   The City may reduce the requirement for periodic compliance
reports §
55.036(A)(1) to a requirement to report no less frequently than once a year,
unless required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the state,
where the industrial user’s total categorical wastewater flow does not exceed
any of the following:
         (a)   POTW’s value for 0.01% of the POTWs design dry-weather hydraulic
capacity of the POTW or 5,000 gallons per day, whichever is smaller, as
measured by a continuous effluent flow monitoring device unless the industrial
user discharges in batches;
         (b)   POTW’s value for 0.01% of the design dry-weather organic
treatment capacity of the POTW; and
         (c)   POTWs value for 0.01% of the maximum allowable headworks loading
for any pollutant regulated by the applicable categorical pretreatment standard
for which approved local limits were developed in accordance with §
55.004.
      (2)   Reduced reporting is not available to industrial users that have in
the last two years been in Significant Noncompliance, as defined in §
55.078. In addition, reduced reporting is not available to an industrial user
with daily flow rates, production levels, or pollutant levels that vary so
significantly that, in the opinion of the Public Works Superintendent,
decreasing the reporting requirement for this industrial user would result in
data that are not representative of conditions occurring during the reporting
period.
   (D)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
55.064(A).
   (E)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the industrial user’s
discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of an industrial user to keep its monitoring facility in
good working order shall not be grounds for the industrial user to claim that
sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
   (F)   If an industrial user subject to the reporting requirement in this
section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location
more frequently than required by the Public Works Superintendent, using the
procedures prescribed in §
55.061, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
§ 55.055 REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.
   (A)   Each industrial user must notify the Public Works Superintendent of
any significant changes to the industrial user’s operations or system which
might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater including facility
closure at least 30 days before the change.
   (B)   The Public Works Superintendent may require the industrial user to
submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed
condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit
application under §
55.028.
   (C)   The Public Works Superintendent may issue an industrial wastewater
discharge permit under §
55.038 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under §
55.035 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
§ 55.056 REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.
   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges; discharges of a not routine, episodic nature; a non-
customary batch discharge; a slug discharge; or slug load that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the industrial user shall immediately
telephone and notify the Public Works Superintendent of the incident. This
notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste,
concentration, and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the
industrial user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the industrial user shall,
unless waived by the Public Works Superintendent, submit a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the industrial user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification
shall not relieve the industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other
liability which might be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural
resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such
notification relieve the industrial user of any fines, penalties, or other
liability which may be imposed pursuant to this subchapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the industrial user’s bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees, who could cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.
   (D)   Significant industrial users are required to notify the Public Works
Superintendent immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the
potential for a slug discharge.
§ 55.057 REPORTS FROM UNPERMITTED INDUSTRIAL USERS.
   All industrial user not required to obtain an industrial wastewater
discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the Public Works
Superintendent as the Public Works Superintendent may require.
§ 55.058 NOTICE OF VIOLATION; REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.
   If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the
industrial user must notify the Public Works Superintendent within 24 hours of
becoming aware of the violation. The industrial user shall also repeat the
sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the
Public Works Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the
violation. Resampling by the industrial user is not required if the City
performs sampling at the industrial user’s facility at least once a month, or
if the City performs sampling at the industrial user between the time when the
initial sampling was conducted and the time when the industrial user or the
City receives the results of this sampling, or if the City has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.
§ 55.059 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   (1)   Any industrial user who commences the discharge of hazardous
waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division
Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge
into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a
hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification must include the
name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 C.F.R. part 261, the EPA
hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or
other). If the industrial user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the
following information to the extent such information is known and readily
available to the industrial user:
         (a)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
         (b)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents
in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month; and
         (c)   An estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months.
      (2)   All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the
discharge commences. Any notification under this division (A) need be submitted
only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of
changed conditions must be submitted under §
55.055. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by industrial users subject to Categorical
Pretreatment Standards under the self monitoring requirements of §§
55.051,
55.053, and
55.054.
   (B)   (1)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A)
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as
specified in 40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
      (2)   Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in
a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in
40 C.F.R. §§ 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.
Subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges more than such
quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA being 42
U.S.C. §§ 6901 et seq. identifying additional characteristics of hazardous
waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial
user must notify the Public Works Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste
Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of
the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the
volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has
determined to be economically practical.
   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise permitted to be discharged by this subchapter, a permit issued
thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.
§ 55.060 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed
in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and
amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable Categorical
Pretreatment Standard. If 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA
determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
Public Works Superintendent or other parties approved by EPA.
§ 55.061 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   (A)   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on
data obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the
period covered by the report, based on data that is representative of
conditions occurring during the reporting period.
   (B)   (1)   Except as indicated in divisions (C) and (D) below, the
industrial user must collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional
composite sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or
grab sampling is authorized by the Public Works Superintendent. Where time-
proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the City, the
samples must be representative of the discharge.
      (2)   Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified in
40 C.F.R. part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the analysis as
follows:
         (a)   For cyanide, total phenols, and sulfides, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory or in the field;
         (b)   For volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be
composited in the laboratory.
      (3)   Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the City, as appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
   (C)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection
techniques.
   (D)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §§
55.051 and
55.053, in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b) and (d), a minimum of four
grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease,
sulfide, and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data
are available, the Public Works Superintendent may authorize a lower minimum.
For the reports required by §
55.054 in accordance with 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e) and 403.12(h), the industrial
user is required to collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and
assure compliance by with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
§ 55.062 DATE OF RECEIPT OF REPORTS.
   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked. For reports, which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail
facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of
the report shall govern.
§ 55.063 RECORDKEEPING.
   (A)   Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter
shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring
activities undertaken by the industrial user independent of such requirements,
and documentation associated with Best Management Practices established under §
55.001(C).
   (B)   (1)   Records shall include:
         (a)   The date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the
name of the person(s) taking the samples;
         (b)   The dates analyses were performed;
         (c)   Who performed the analyses;
         (d)   The analytical techniques or methods used; and
         (e)   The results of such analyses.
      (2)   These records shall remain available for a period of at least three
years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the industrial user or the City, or where the industrial
user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the Public
Works Superintendent.
§ 55.064 CERTIFICATION STATEMENTS.
   (A)   Certification of permit applications, industrial user reports, and
initial monitoring waiver. The following certification statement is required to
be signed and submitted by industrial users submitting permit applications in
accordance with §

ENFORCEMENT AND ADMINISTRATION
§ 55.075 RIGHT OF ENTRY; INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   (A)   The Public Works Superintendent shall have the right to enter the
premises of any industrial user to determine whether the industrial user is
complying with all requirements of this chapter and any industrial wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Industrial users shall allow the
Public Works Superintendent ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, photographing, records examination, and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
   (B)   Where an industrial user has security measures in force which require
proper identification and clearance before entry onto its premises, the
industrial user shall make necessary arrangements with security so that, upon
presentation of proper identification, the Public Works Superintendent shall be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific
responsibilities.
   (C)   The Public Works Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the
industrial user’s property, or require installation of, such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the industrial user’s
operations.
   (D)   The Public Works Superintendent may require the industrial user to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the industrial user at its own expense. All devices used
to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at manufacturer’s
required frequency to ensure their accuracy.
   (E)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
industrial user at the written or verbal request of the Public Works
Superintendent and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the industrial user.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Public Works Superintendent access
to the industrial user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.
§ 55.076 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the Public Works Superintendent has been refused access to a building,
structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate
probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or
that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection
and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this
chapter or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall
public health, safety, and welfare of the community, the Public Works
Superintendent may seek issuance of a search warrant through the City Attorney.
§ 55.077 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a industrial user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, industrial wastewater discharge
permits, general permits, and monitoring programs, and from the Public Works
Superintendent’s inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the
public without restriction, unless the industrial user specifically requests in
writing, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Public Works
Superintendent, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the
industrial user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but
shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for
uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement
proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics and other effluent data, as defined in 40 C.F.R. § 2.302,
shall not be recognized as confidential information and shall be available to
the public without restriction.
§ 55.078 SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (A)   The Public Works Superintendent shall publish annually, in a newspaper
of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the
jurisdictions served by the POTW, a list of the industrial users which, at any
time during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
   (B)   The term SIGNIFICANT NONCOMPLIANCE shall be applicable to all
significant industrial users (or any other industrial user that violates
divisions (B)(3), (B)(4), or (B)(8) below) and shall mean:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same pollutant
parameter taken during a six-month period exceed (by any magnitude) a numeric
pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits as defined
in §
53.04;
      (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement including instantaneous limits, as
defined by §
53.04, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement that
the Public Works Superintendent determines has caused, alone or in combination
with other discharges, interference or pass through, including endangering the
health of POTW personnel or the general public;
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the Public Works
Superintendent exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a compliance
schedule milestone contained in an industrial wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide within 45 days after the due date, any required
reports, including baseline monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
Categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines, periodic self-monitoring reports,
and reports on compliance with compliance schedules;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; or
      (8)   Any other violation(s), which may include a violation of Best
Management Practices, which the Public Works Superintendent determines will
adversely affect the operation or implementation of the pretreatment program.
§ 55.079 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Public Works Superintendent finds that an industrial user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Superintendent may serve
upon that industrial user a written notice of violation. Within five days of
the receipt of such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the industrial user to the Public Works
Superintendent. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the industrial
user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Public Works Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or
any other enforcement action, even if a Notice of Violation has not been
issued.
§ 55.080 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Public Works Superintendent may enter into consent orders, assurances of
compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any
industrial user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include
specific action to be taken by the industrial user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the
same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
55.082 and
55.083 and shall be judicially enforceable.
§ 55.081 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Public Works Superintendent may order an industrial user which has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Public Works
Superintendent and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken. Notice shall be served on the industrial user specifying the time and
place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such
action, and a request that the industrial user show cause why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be
served personally, by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested),
or by traceable carrier at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may
be served on any authorized representative of the industrial user as defined in
§
53.04 and required by §
55.030(A). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the industrial user.
§ 55.082 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Public Works Superintendent finds that an industrial user has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial
or general wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Superintendent may issue
an order to the industrial user responsible for the discharge directing that
the industrial user come into compliance within a specified time. If the
industrial user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer
service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or
other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance
orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompliance,
including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to
minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order
may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment
standard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the industrial
user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation.
Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for
taking any other action against the industrial user.
§ 55.083 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the Public Works Superintendent finds that an industrial user has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the industrial user’s past
violations are likely to recur, the Public Works Superintendent may issue an
order to the industrial user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the industrial user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking any other action
against the industrial user.
§ 55.084 ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.
   (A)   When the Public Works Superintendent finds that an industrial user has
violated or continues to violate any provision of this chapter, an industrial
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Superintendent may fine
such industrial user in an amount up to and including $1,000. Such fines shall
be assessed on a per-violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other
long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during
the period of violation.
   (B)   Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be
assessed an additional interest at 9% APR of the unpaid balance per month. A
lien against the industrial user’s property may be sought for unpaid charges,
fines, and penalties.
   (C)   Industrial users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request for the Public Works Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with
full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of receiving the fine. Where a
request has merit, the Public Works Superintendent may convene a hearing on the
matter. In the event the industrial user’s appeal is successful, the payment,
together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the
industrial user. The Public Works Superintendent may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.
   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the industrial user.
§ 55.085 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   (A)   The Public Works Superintendent may immediately suspend a industrial
user’s discharge, after informal notice to the industrial user, whenever such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge, which
reasonably appears to present, or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons. The Public Works Superintendent may also
immediately suspend an industrial user’s discharge, after notice and
opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the
POTW, or which presents or may present an endangerment to the environment.
      (1)   Any industrial user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of an industrial
user’s failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Public Works Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to
the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The Public
Works Superintendent may allow the industrial user to recommence its discharge
when the industrial user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Public
Works Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the
termination proceedings in §
55.086 are initiated against the industrial user.
      (2)   An industrial user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for
any discharge presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Public Works Superintendent
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under §§
55.081 or
55.086.
   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.
§ 55.086 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   (A)   In addition to the provisions in §
55.037, any industrial user who violates the following conditions is subject to
discharge termination:
      (1)   Violation of industrial wastewater discharge permit conditions;
      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;
      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the industrial user’s premises for
the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or
      (5)   Violation of the pretreatment standards in §
55.001.
   (B)   Such industrial user will be notified of the proposed termination of
its discharge and be offered an opportunity to show cause under §
55.081 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by
the Public Works Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for,
taking any other action against the industrial user.
§ 55.087 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.
   When the Public Works Superintendent finds that an industrial user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an industrial
wastewater discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Public Works Superintendent may
petition the Circuit Court for the County through the City Attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction or restraining order, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the
industrial wastewater discharge permit, the general permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this chapter on activities of the industrial user. The
Public Works Superintendent may also seek such other action as is appropriate
for legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the industrial
user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive relief or
for a restraining order shall not be a bar against or a prerequisite for taking
any other action against an industrial user.
§ 55.088 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Public
Works Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these actions
against a noncompliant industrial user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations
will generally be in accordance with the City’s enforcement response plan.
However, the Public Works Superintendent may take other action against any
industrial user when the circumstances warrant. Further, the Public Works
Superintendent is empowered to take more than one enforcement action against
any noncompliant industrial user.
§ 55.089 PAYMENT OF OUTSTANDING FEES AND PENALTIES.
   The Public Works Superintendent may decline to issue or reissue an
industrial wastewater discharge permit to any industrial user who has failed to
pay any outstanding fees, fines, or penalties incurred as a result of any
provision of this chapter, a previous industrial wastewater discharge permit,
or a previous general permit, or order issued hereunder.
§ 55.090 UPSET.
   (A)   For the purposes of this section, upset means an exceptional incident
in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with Categorical
Pretreatment Standards because of factors beyond the reasonable control of the
industrial user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the extent caused
by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper
operation.
   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought
for noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards if the requirements
of division (C) below are met.
   (C)   An industrial user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:
      (1)   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause(s)
of the upset;
      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workperson-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and
      (3)   The industrial user has submitted the following information to the
Public Works Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five days):
         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or,
if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
         (c)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the industrial user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
   (E)   Industrial users shall have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards.
   (F)   Industrial users shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with Categorical Pretreatment Standards
upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility
is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.
§ 55.091 PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.
   An industrial user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement
action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in §
55.001(A) or the specific prohibitions in §
55.001(B)(3) through (B)(18) if it can prove that it did not know, or have
reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges
from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either:
   (A)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the industrial
user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass
through or interference; or
   (B)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially
in nature or constituents from the industrial user’s prior discharge when the
City was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and, in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable biosolids use or disposal
requirements.
§ 55.092 BYPASS.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      BYPASS. The intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of an
industrial user’s treatment facility.
      SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property, damage
to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
   (B)   An industrial user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of divisions (C) and (D) below.
   (C)   (1)   If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Public Works Superintendent, at least ten
days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
      (2)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice to the Public Works
Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment
standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the
industrial user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Public Works
Superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.
   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Public Works Superintendent may
take an enforcement action against an industrial user for a bypass, unless:
         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate backup equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
         (c)   The industrial user submitted notices as required under division
(C) above.
      (2)   The Public Works Superintendent may approve an anticipated bypass,
after considering its adverse effects, if the Public Works Superintendent
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in division (D)(1)
above.
§ 55.093 WATER SUPPLY SEVERANCE.
   Whenever a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, general permit, or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, water
service to the user may be severed. Service will recommence, at the user’s
expense, only after the user has satisfactorily demonstrated his or her ability
to comply.
§ 55.999 PENALTY.
   (A)   (1)   An industrial user who has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of
Chapter 53,
Chapter 54, and this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall
be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty allowed under state law but
not less than $1,000 per violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other
long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during
the period of the violation.
      (2)   The Public Works Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys’
fees, court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages
incurred by the City.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the industrial user’s violation,
corrective actions by the industrial user, the compliance history of the
industrial user, and any other factor as justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against an industrial user.
   (B)   (1)   An industrial user who willfully or negligently violates any
provision of
Chapter 53,
Chapter 54, and this chapter, an industrial wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall, upon conviction, be guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor, punishable by
a fine of not more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not
more than one year or both.
      (2)   An industrial user who willfully or negligently introduces any
substance into the POTW which causes personal injury or property damage shall,
upon conviction, be guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor and be subject to a
penalty of at least $1,000, or be subject to imprisonment for not more than one
year or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any other cause of action
for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
      (3)   An industrial user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report, plan, or
other documentation filed, or required to be maintained, pursuant to
Chapter 53,
Chapter 54, and this chapter, industrial wastewater discharge permit, or order
issued hereunder, or who falsifies, tampers with, or knowingly renders
inaccurate any monitoring device or method required under
Chapter 53,
Chapter 54, and this chapter shall, upon conviction, be punished by a fine of
not more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than
one year or both.
      (4)   In the event of a second conviction, an industrial user shall be
punished by a fine of not more than $3,000 per violation, per day or
imprisonment for not more than three years or both.

§ 90.57 ABATEMENT.
   (A)   When any law enforcement officer or other City official authorized by
the City Administrator determines that a nuisance exists, such law enforcement
officer or authorized official may give written notice to the persons
responsible.
   (B)   The notice shall be given to:
      (1)   The owner of the premises on which the nuisance is alleged to
exist;
      (2)   The person in apparent possession or control of the premises; and
      (3)   The person who caused the nuisance. Failure of notice to one person
does not affect the responsibility of any other person who is notified.
   (C)   The notice shall direct the person notified to abate the nuisance
within ten days of the time the notice is sent or posted on the premises. A
longer notice period may also be given. The notice shall also inform the person
notified of his or her right to judicial review under this chapter.
   (D)   If a person is dissatisfied with the notice to abate, such person may
request judicial review by making a request to the City court for judicial
review within ten days of the time the notice to abate is sent or posted. The
request need not be in any particular form, except that it must:
      (1)   Be in writing;
      (2)   Identify the place and nature of the alleged nuisance;
      (3)   Specify the name and address of the person seeking judicial review;
and
      (4)   Identify the law enforcement officer or other City official
alleging that a nuisance exists. A copy of this notice shall be delivered to
the law enforcement officer or other City official alleging that a nuisance
exists.
   (E)   The judicial review shall be held on the first court day following
after the request for judicial review is made, or on the second court day after
the request for judicial review is made if the first court day is less than
five days from the date upon which the request for judicial review is made. The
day may be postponed by:
      (1)   Agreement of the parties; or
      (2)   Order of the court for good cause.
   (F) The court shall promptly notify:
      (1)   The person requesting the review; and
      (2)   The law enforcement officer or other City official alleging the
existence of a nuisance.
   (G)   At the judicial review, the court shall determine, based on a
preponderance of the evidence, whether a nuisance exists. If a nuisance exists,
the court shall order the responsible person to abate it within 72 hours or
within such longer time as the court determines, for good cause, should be
given. If the court finds there is no nuisance, it shall dismiss the matter.
   (H)   Any person who is directed by a law enforcement officer or other
authorized City official to abate a nuisance and does not seek judicial review
within the proper time thereby waives any further hearing or judicial
determination of the issue.
   (I)   If a person is directed by a law enforcement officer or other
authorized City official to abate a nuisance and neither requests judicial
review within the proper time nor abates the nuisance, or if the person fails
to abate the nuisance within 72 hours (or such further time allowed) when
ordered to do so by the court, then the City may abate the nuisance.
   (J)   There shall be no liability to the City for the abatement unless the
City acts in bad faith or causes manifestly unreasonable and unnecessary damage
in the abatement.
   (K)   In case of an apparent emergency, abatement may be made in a summary
manner without notice. In such case, however, the person aggrieved may request
judicial review of the abatement. In such judicial review, the abatement shall
be upheld if conducted without violation of division (J) above and if there was
substantial evidence of the emergency and the nuisance at the time it was
abated.
   (L)   The City reserves the right to abate any nuisance impeding or blocking
public rights-of-way, or City infrastructure, or public/private utilities,
without notice and at the City’s expense, if said nuisance is an immediate
hazard or may cause serious injury to the public.
(Ord. 652, passed 4-4-2018)
§ 90.58 JOINT RESPONSIBILITY.
   If more than one person is responsible, they shall be jointly and severally
liable for abating the nuisance or for the costs incurred by the City in
abating the nuisance.
(Ord. 652, passed 4-4-2018)
§ 90.59 ABATEMENT BY CITY.
   (A)   If, within the time allowed, the nuisance has not been abated by the
person responsible, the City Administrator, or his or her designee, may cause
the nuisance to be abated.
   (B)   The City Administrator, or his or her designee, will be responsible
for appropriate postings and notifications as required by this chapter.
   (C)   The City Administrator, or his or her designee, shall have the right,
at reasonable times, to enter into or upon property to investigate or cause the
removal of a nuisance.
   (D)   If the nuisance is not abated within the prescribed time, the law
enforcement shall be responsible for issuing citations to appear in court, as
appropriate under the circumstances. If abatement by the City is in order, the
City Administrator, or his or her designee, will notify the Public Works
Superintendent of the nature of the abatement required. If City crews are
utilized, the City Administrator, or his or her designee, will provide the City
Recorder with information required for the appropriate assessment of fees and
recording of liens.
   (E)   The City Recorder shall keep an accurate record of the expenses
incurred by the City in physically abating the nuisance and shall include
therein a charge of $10 or 10% of those expenses, whichever is greater, for
administrative overhead.
   (F)   In addition to the remedy of abatement provided herein to the City,
the person responsible shall also be subject to citation for civil infraction,
as provided herein.
(Ord. 652, passed 4-4-2018)
§ 90.60 ASSESSMENT OF COSTS.
   (A)   The City Recorder by certified or registered mail, postage prepaid,
shall forward to the person responsible a notice stating:
      (1)   The total cost of abatement, including the administrative overhead;
      (2)   That the cost as indicated will be assessed to and become a lien
against the property, unless paid within 30 days from the date of the notice;
and
      (3)   That, if the person responsible objects to the costs of the
abatement as indicated, that person may file a notice of objection with the
City Recorder not more than ten days from the date of the notice.
   (B)   Upon the expiration of ten days after the date of the notice, the
court, in the regular course of business, shall hear and determine any
objections to the costs assessed.
   (C)   If the costs of the abatement are not paid within 30 days from the
date of the notice, an assessment of the costs, as stated or as determined by
the court, shall be made and shall thereupon be entered in the docket of City
liens and, upon such entry being made, shall constitute a lien upon the
property from which the nuisance was removed or abated.
   (D)   The lien shall be enforced in the same manner as liens for street
improvements are enforced and shall bear interest at the legal rate. The
interest shall commence to run from the date of the entry of the lien in the
lien docket.
   (E)   An error in the name of the person responsible shall not void the
assessment nor will a failure to receive the notice of the proposed assessment
render the assessment void but it shall remain a valid lien against the
property. The City may also institute action for the recovery of said amount
against the author or continuer thereof or may pursue both remedies to recover
said money expended.
(Ord. 652, passed 4-4-2018)
§ 90.61 NOTICE.
   Any notice required in this chapter shall be sufficient if the person to be
notified is substantially apprised of the substance of the notice,
notwithstanding any minor deficiencies or irregularities of form. Actual
receipt of the notice is not required as long as a good faith effort is made to
deliver it.
(Ord. 652, passed 4-4-2018)
§ 90.62 SEPARATE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Each day’s violation of a provision of this chapter constitutes a
separate offense.
   (B)   The abatement of a nuisance is not a penalty for violating this
chapter, but is an additional remedy. The imposition of an assessment does not
relieve a person of the duty to abate the nuisance. However, abatement of a
nuisance within three working days of the date of notice to abate, or if a
written protest has been filed, then abatement within 72 hours of the court’s
determination that a nuisance exists will relieve the person responsible from
the imposition of a penalty.

COUNTY DOG CONTROL GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 91.050 POLICY.
   (A)   The Board of Commissioners of the County recognizes that ORS Chapter
609 grants non-home rule counties the power to regulate dogs by ordinance and
that on July 5,1929, the County was declared to be a dog control district by
vote of the electors of the County. Pursuant to the vote of the electors and to
ORS Chapter 609, the County is declared to be a dog control district.
   (B)   The Board further recognizes and finds that the regulation of dogs is
a matter of County concern, and therefore, ORS Chapter 203 provides a separate
and independent legal basis upon which to enact §§
91.050 through
91.055,
91.070,
91.071,
91.085 through
91.088,

91.215 through
91.218,
91.230 through
91.238, and
91.250 through
91.252. Pursuant to both ORS Chapter 609 and ORS Chapter 203, the Board finds
it necessary to implement a program for the licensing and regulation of dogs
and the facilities which house them; to protect the health, safety, and welfare
of the residents and citizens of the County; to recognize the property rights
of both owners and non-owners of dogs; and to provide for the control and
protection of dogs located within the County.
(County Ord. 692, passed 7-12-2001)
§ 91.051 PURPOSE.
   This chapter is enacted to provide a comprehensive procedure and program for
the implementation of the above described policy; to set forth all requirements
for licensing, regulation, care, and treatment of dogs; and to describe related

intended to supercede ORS Chapter 609 except as specifically provided in these
regulations, or in instances in which these regulations do not provide a
parallel rule, definition, or procedure.

dog with knowledge that it has killed or injured livestock contained in ORS
609.160.

presented to the court. A judgment by the court declaring a forfeiture of bail,
pursuant to this section, shall be deemed a conviction of the offense charged

they were notified of.

requirements impractical for any reason, they may appeal the decision to the
Public Works Superintendent.
      (4)   If sidewalk is not constructed within the time required by this
section, then the City may construct it for the full street frontage in front
of the property and proceed with the construction, assessment, and collections
of costs as provided for in this division (F) above.
   (I)   It is the duty of every property owner whose vacant or undeveloped
property abuts upon any street, which has been improved with a hard-surface

street designated as a “high pedestrian use street” to construct a concrete
curb and sidewalk conforming to City ordinances within one year after notice by
the Engineer. The Engineer shall identify “high pedestrian use streets” by
determining whether a certain street is a primary walking route to schools,
community buildings, or commercial areas and whether the absence of sidewalks
along those walking routes is a potential danger to pedestrians. The Engineer
may also apply other factors such as pedestrian counts, projects under
construction, or sites designed for development when identifying “high
pedestrian use streets.”

record of the expense as it applies to each parcel of land.
      (4)   Upon receipt of the record of costs specified in the above, the
Council shall by ordinance assess the cost of all work against the adjacent
property. The assessment shall be a lien against the property and may be
collected in the same manner as is provided by law for the collection of
unbonded liens for local improvements.
      (5)   The provisions of the Bancroft Bonding Act being ORS 223.205 et
seq. of the state shall not be applicable to assessments made under this
chapter unless the Council directs otherwise in the resolution ordering
alternative forms of financing by or under the direction of the City upon such
terms and provisions as the Council may deem appropriate.
   (M)   Any person who may desire to construct or is required to construct,
reconstruct, or repair any sidewalk, curb, or driveway shall obtain a permit
before commencing work; and such application shall specify the property along
which such walk, curb, or driveway is to be laid; the name of the person for
whom same is to be performed; and the time within which same is to be
completed. It is hereby the duty of the Engineer to issue permits and upon the
request of any person to whom a permit has been issued as herein provided and
within a reasonable time thereafter, to set the grade and line stakes for the
construction of any sidewalk, curb, or driveway in the City. No person shall
construct or cause to be constructed any sidewalk, curb, or driveway in the
City until such grade and line stakes have been set.
   (N)   The Engineer may authorize the installation of a meandering sidewalk
for aesthetic purposes provide that said walk does not substantially
inconvenience the general public nor create an apparent traffic or pedestrian
hazard.

thereto for any purpose, it shall be the duty of such person or persons to keep
the obstruction, excavation, or alteration properly safeguarded by substantial
signs, barricades, and flagperson necessary and to make use of lighting,
lighted lanterns, flashing lanterns, or other lights or flares from dusk to
daylight in conformity with such regulations as may be specified by the
Engineer. Whenever, in the opinion of the Engineer, the public safety is so
endangered by such obstructions, excavations, or alterations as to require
constant supervision to ensure that warning and traffic control devices are
functional and that traffic is safely and properly routed around such
barricades, the person or persons to whom a permit has been issued shall be
responsible for furnishing a night watchperson for that purpose. Twenty-four
hour notice shall be given before partial or complete closure of any travel
lane in any street or alley. Should an emergency situation arise where a 24-
hour notice is not feasible, every reasonable effort shall be made to notify
the Engineer in advance of occupation of the right-of-way.

§ 92.43 INHERENT RESPONSIBILITIES.
   (A)   All drainage ways and structures shall be left open for the free flow
of water during operations and after completion. No drainage system shall be
altered without prior approval of the Engineer.
   (B)   No mud, gravel, or debris shall be allowed to remain on the traveled
portion of the improved right-of-way. Provisions must be made to prevent the
migration of such material into the City storm drainage system.
   (C)   At the close of each work day, all waste material shall be removed
from the site. Traveled portions of the right-of-way shall be restored to a
condition acceptable to the Engineer. On hard-surfaced rights-of-way, this
restoration shall include permanent resurfacing, the placement of temporary
asphalt concrete, or an alternative approved by the Engineer.
   (D)   Any damage cause to existing utility lines shall be reported to the
applicable utility or the City, if City facilities are involved.
   (E)   Upon completion of the authorized activity, all surplus earth, rock,

property of the permit holder. Any and all areas disturbed as a result of the
activity within the right-of-way shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the
Engineer.
   (F)   It is the position of the City that it should not, at any time, assume
responsibility and costs involved in maintenance of failing street patches and
other such repairs made by any person or persons in connection with utility,
storm drain, water, and sanitary sewer installation and maintenance. Such
person or persons, therefore, shall be held responsible for the maintenance of
such repairs in a condition acceptable to the Engineer and for all present and
future cost incurred as a result of the permitted work and resultant repairs.

in every case refill any and all trenches or holes made by the person or
persons making the excavations; and it shall be required that the surface of
the street, alley, highway, sidewalk, or public place where such holes or
excavations have been made and refilled shall be left at the same grade and
restored to a condition meeting the current City standard for the area as it
existed before such excavations were made. Every effort shall be made to effect
permanent repairs immediately following project completion. “Time settling” of
trenches and holes is not an approved method and any time spent by City Staff
locating and alerting responsible persons to failing trench patches will be
charged to those persons.
(Ord. 622, passed 11-3-2010) Penalty, see §
92.99
§ 92.45 NOTICE OF COMPLETION.
   Within 48 hours of the completion of work authorized by permit issued in
accordance with this subchapter, the person or persons to whom the permit was
issued shall report to the Engineer that such work has been completed and shall
give such other information as he or she may require. The Engineer shall
thereupon examine the work and if he or she finds it to be fully and properly
restored he or she shall endorse his or her approval on the permit and arrange
the timely release of any related bond or deposit.
(Ord. 622, passed 11-3-2010)
§ 92.46 MORATORIUM AGAINST CUTS ON NEWLY IMPROVED STREETS.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to cut or open the surface of a
public street, sidewalk, or driveway that has been newly constructed,
reconstructed, slurry sealed, overlaid, or improved within the previous 60
months, commencing from the date of acceptance of the improvements.
   (B)   No permits shall be issued to excavate or cut in the street, sidewalk,
or driveway that has been improved within the last 60 months except in the case
of emergencies or when the Engineer grants an exemption. An emergency shall be
deemed to exist if the work is necessary for the presentation of life or
property or an urgency affecting the health and welfare of the City’s residents
or businesses occurs or in the case of failed pipelines or utility services
that affect public security or public safety.
   (C)   The Engineer may grant exemptions to the moratorium for emergency
repairs as provided in division (B) above or for the installation of needed
critical infrastructure or facilities where no other alternatives to cutting a
street, sidewalk, or driveway subject to the moratorium exist. When granting
exemptions, the Engineer may impose reasonable conditions to ensure the rapid
and complete restoration of the street, sidewalk, or driveway surface.
   (D)   If a street, sidewalk, or driveway subject to a moratorium is cut for
any reason, the Engineer shall determine the extent of the required repairs for
the damages caused by such a cut. If the Engineer determines that restoration
of the street, sidewalk, or driveway is not appropriate at a particular time
for reasons relating to weather or other short-term complications, the Engineer
may order a delay and/or the posting of bonds to insure completion of the work
when proper conditions allow for the restoration work.
   (E)   (1)   No person or persons shall make an excavation in or dig up any
street, alley, highway, sidewalk, or driveway subject to a moratorium without
having obtained a permit in writing for such purpose from the Engineer.
      (2)   An application for a permit shall be tried with the City on a form
prescribed by the City and shall contain such information and data as required
by it.
      (3)   Before any permit is issued, the applicant shall pay to the City a
permit fee as set by resolution of the City Council.
      (4)   All work done under a permit issued in compliance with this section
shall be done under the direction of the Engineer or Public Works
Superintendent. The Engineer or Public Works Superintendent may revoke a permit
issued under the provisions of this section at any time he or she is satisfied
that the work is not being performed according to the provision thereof. The
acceptance of a permit constitutes an agreement by the applicant to save the
City, its’ officers, employees, and agents harmless from any and all costs,
damages, and liabilities which may accrue or be claimed to accrue by reason of
any work performed under the permit.
(Ord. 622, passed 11-3-2010)
§ 92.47 RESTORATION GUIDELINES FOR STREETS SUBJECT TO A MORATORIUM.
   (A)   Street restoration for streets subject to a moratorium may include
repaving, surface grinding, base and sub-base repairs, or other related work as
needed, and may include partial to full-width surface restoration of the
street.
   (B)   The Engineer may require direct boring instead of street cuts to
minimize the restoration requirements and/or impacts to the street, sidewalk,
or driveway.
   (C)   The following guidelines are established for restoration work of
streets, sidewalks, and driveways.
      (1)   Recently improved, paved, or overlaid streets. Final resurfacing
shall include the grinding of existing surrounding pavement and repaving at a
minimum depth of two inches. For trenches perpendicular to traffic lanes, the
permittee shall grind ten feet on either side of the trench line for the full
width of any traffic lanes that have been cut. For trenches parallel to the
traffic lanes, the permittee shall grind the entire width of the traffic lane
for the full length of the trench with a minimum of ten feet on each end or as
directed by the Engineer. For trenches other than those perpendicular or
parallel to traffic lanes, the Engineer shall establish appropriate limits of
paving. At the discretion of the Engineer, a full-width slurry seal for the
entire block may be substituted for the required overlays in residential areas.
Transverse paving joints shall be perpendicular to the traffic lanes and
longitudinal paving joints shall not be allowed in vehicle wheel paths. The
placement of the surface course of the repaving shall be by self-propelled,
automatic leveling, multiple-width paving machine. Work shall meet all
applicable construction standards. The Engineer may modify the scope of work
stated above, including increasing the restoration requirements as he or she
shall deem reasonable to restore the street to a condition acceptable for the
volume of traffic served by the street cut.
      (2)   Recently slurry-sealed streets. Slurry seal shall be applied to the
patched area no sooner than 30 days and no later than 90 days after completion
of the pavement repair. The area of slurry seal shall be as described above for
recently unproved, paved, or overlaid streets.

   (A)   Any owner who disputes any interpretation given by the City as to the
category of use assigned to such owners property pursuant to this subchapter
may request a review and appeal such interpretation but only in accordance with
this section. The dispute must first be presented to the Engineer for review
and thereafter may be appealed to the City Council in accordance with this

review and notify the appellant not less than ten days prior to the date of
such Council review. The Council shall conduct a hearing during a public
meeting and determine whether there is substantial evidence in the record to
support the interpretation given by the Engineer. The Council may continue the
hearing for purposes of gathering additional information bearing on the issue.
The Council shall make a tentative oral decision and shall adopt a final
written decision together with appropriate findings in support. The decision of
Council with respects to the category of use shall be limited to whether the
appellant has been assigned to the appropriate category of use. If the Council
should determine that a different category of use should be assigned, it shall
so order, provide no refund of prior street maintenance fees shall be given.

92.01 through
92.06,
92.20 through
92.27, and
92.40 through

§ 111.01 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition shall apply unless
the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   SOLICIT and SOLICITATION. The entry onto real property used for residential
purposes by a person for the purpose of communicating with an occupant of the
property, whether the communication is verbal, visual, or in writing.
(Ord. 504, passed 2-13-1989)
§ 111.02 PURPOSE.
   The City Council finds it necessary and desirable to regulate solicitation
in order to provide an effective opportunity for the occupants of residential
property to protect themselves from the unwanted disruption of the peaceful and
quiet enjoyment of their property and right to privacy caused by solicitors, to
protect the rights to free speech guaranteed by the state and Federal
Constitutions for lawful solicitors, and to provide a means by which those
solicitors who choose to intrude upon and disrupt an occupant’s quiet enjoyment
of property can be held accountable for such violations. The City Council has
also been advised that based upon actual experiences in the City and in the
opinion of crime prevention specialists nationwide, there is a direct
connection between residential burglaries and unscrupulous solicitors. The
creation of a registration requirement will enable City officials and citizens
of the City to become informed concerning the individuals and organizations who
choose to solicit in the City. This chapter also provides a mechanism for
discouraging, through the civil infraction process, those solicitors who avoid
registration and provides a mechanism to identify and discourage those whom
would use solicitation as a form for criminal activity.
(Ord. 504, passed 2-13-1989)
§ 111.03 PROHIBITED ACTS.
   It is unlawful for any person to:

received actual or constructive consent of the occupant prior to entering the
real property. Constructive consent to enter real property may be implied from

have not posted a “No Solicitation” sign, pursuant to §
111.09.
   (C)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the entry into
a structure located on real property. The right to enter any structure must be
otherwise provided for by law.
   (D)   Officers, employees, or agents of a governmental entity while
performing activities within the scope of their office, employment, or agency
are exempt from the requirements of this chapter.
   (E)   No person may be charged with a violation of any divisions of §

for transient occupancy for 30 consecutive calendar days or less for dwelling,
lodging, or sleeping purposes. HOTEL includes any HOTEL, inn, tourist home,

   OCCUPANCY. The use or possession or the right to the use or possession, for
lodging or sleeping purposes, of any room or rooms or space in a hotel.
   OPERATOR. The person who is the proprietor of the hotel in any capacity.
Where the operator performs functions through a managing agent of any type or
character other than an employee, the managing agent shall be deemed an
operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and
liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this
chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall be considered to be
compliance by both.
   PERSON. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association,

the furnishing of rooms or room or space in a hotel.

deemed to be a TRANSIENT until the 30 days has expired, unless there is an
agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a
longer period of occupancy.
      (2)   In determining whether a person is a TRANSIENT, uninterrupted
periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of
the chapter codified in this chapter may be considered. A person who pays for

   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person at or near a fire to obstruct or

promptly an order of a member of the Fire District or law enforcement.

(Ord. 367, passed 2-5-1973) Penalty, see §

§ 133.06 LOITERING.
   (A)   A person commits a violation if he or she loiters or prowls in a
place, at a time, or in a manner not usual for law-abiding individuals under
circumstances that warrant alarm for the safety of persons or property in the
vicinity. Among the circumstances which may be considered in determining
whether alarm is warranted is the fact that the person takes flight upon
appearance of a law enforcement officer, refuses to identify himself or
herself, or manifestly endeavors to conceal himself or herself or any object.
Unless flight by the person or other circumstances makes it impractical, a law
enforcement officer shall, prior to any arrest for an offense under this
section, afford the person an opportunity to dispel any alarm which would
otherwise be warranted, by requesting the person to identify himself or herself
and to explain his or her presence or conduct. No person shall be convicted of
an offense under this section if the law enforcement officer did not comply
with the preceding sentence, or if it appears at trial that the explanation
given by the person was true and, if it had been believed by law enforcement
officer at the time, would have dispelled the alarm. Any law enforcement
officer may arrest any person suspected of being a loiterer or prowler without
a warrant if it reasonably appears that the delay in arresting the suspect
caused by obtaining a warrant would result in the suspect’s escape.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person, after being warned by law
enforcement officer, or where a “no loitering” sign or signs have been posted,
to loiter in or upon any public or quasi-public sidewalk, street, curb, cross-
walk, walkway area, mall, or that portion of private property utilized for
public use, so as to hinder or obstruct unreasonably the free passage of
pedestrians or vehicles thereon. It shall be unlawful for any person to block,
obstruct, or prevent free access to the entrance to any building open to the
public.
   (C)   It shall be unlawful for any person to loiter in or near any
thoroughfare or place open to the public for the purpose of inducing, enticing,
soliciting, or procuring another to commit an act of prostitution. Among the
circumstances which may be considered in determining whether such action is
consistent with the intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to
commit an act of prostitution are that the person is a known prostitute or
panderer and repeatedly beckons, in the attempt to stop or engage male or
female passersby in conversation, or repeatedly stops or attempts to stop motor
vehicles by engaging their operators by hailing, waving of arms, or other
bodily gestures. The violator’s conduct must be such as to demonstrate a
specific intent to induce, entice, solicit, or procure another to commit an act
of prostitution. No arrest shall be made for a violation of this division (C)
unless the arresting officer first affords the person an opportunity to explain
his or her conduct, no one shall be convicted of violating this division (C) if
it appears at trial that the explanation given was true and disclosed a lawful
purpose.
   (D)   For the purpose of this section, PUBLIC PLACE has the following
definition unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning: an area generally visible to public view, including streets,
sidewalks, bridges, alleys, plazas, parks, driveways, parking lots, automobiles
(whether moving or not), and buildings open to the general public, including

using other means of financing improvements, including federal and state
grants-in-aid, sewer charges or fees, revenue bonds, general obligation bonds,

as a credit on the appropriate assessment. If an assessment has been paid, the
person who paid it or that person’s legal representative shall be entitled to
payment of the rebate credit.

approval of the application.
   (B)   The Historic Landmarks Committee may approve, approve with conditions,
or delay the issuance of a demolition permit, moving permit, or building
permit. The Historic Landmarks Committee may delay a permit for up to 120 days

time it will provide the owner of the structure with possible alternatives for
demolition, including information concerning local, state, and federal
preservation programs.

following criteria:
      (1)   The City’s historic policies set forth in the comprehensive plan

the public or its occupants;
      (5)   Whether the historic landmark is a deterrent to an improvement
program of substantial benefit to the City which overrides the public interest
in its preservation;

hardship to the owner not outweighed by the public interest in the landmark’s
preservation; and
      (7)   Whether retention of the historic landmark would be in the best
interests of a majority of the citizens of the City, as determined by the
Historic Landmarks Committee, and, if not, whether the historic landmark may be
preserved by an alternative means such as through photography, item removal,
written description, measured drawings, sound retention, or other means of
limited or special preservation.
   (D)   If the structure for which a demolition permit request has been filed

Preservation Officer without processing the request through the Historic
Landmarks Committee.
   (E)   Any permit may be conditioned by the Historic Preservation Officer or
the Historic Landmarks Committee to secure interior and/or exterior
documentation of the landmark prior to the proposed action. Required
documentation shall consist of no less than 20 photographs of any affected area
in digital or print (with negatives) form. Any permit may also be conditioned
to preserve site landscaping such as individual plants or trees or to preserve

Building Inspector and call for a meeting of the Historic Landmarks Committee
to review the application.
      (1)   The Historic Landmarks Committee shall meet within 40 days of the
date the completed permit application was submitted to the Building Department.
The applicant shall be notified of the time and place of the review and is
encouraged to be present, although his or her presence shall not be necessary
for action on the plans. A failure to review within 40 days shall be considered
an approval of the application.
      (2)   If the Historic Landmarks Committee finds the proposed alterations
to be in compliance with §
153.10, it shall direct the Historic Preservation Officer to submit to the

§ 156.11 EXEMPTIONS, REDUCTIONS AND WAIVERS.
   (A)   Structures and uses established and existing on or before June 7,

§ 156.12 CREDITS.
   (A)   A system development charge shall be imposed when a change of use of a
parcel or structure occurs, but credit shall be given for uses that qualify for
an exemption pursuant to §
156.11. The system development charge shall be based upon the difference
between the system development charge calculated for the new use and the system
development charge calculated for the pre-existing use under the current
methodology. The credit so computed shall not exceed the calculated system
development charge. No refund shall be made on account of such credit.
   (B)   Credit shall also be given for the cost of a qualified public
improvement, upon acceptance by the City of that public improvement. The credit
provided for by this division (B) shall be only for the improvement fee charges
for the type of improvement being constructed and may be granted only for that
portion of such improvement that exceeds the City’s minimum standard facility
size or capacity needed to serve that development’s project or property. The
applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that a particular improvement
qualifies under this section. The request for credit shall be in writing no
later than 60 days after acceptance of the improvement by the City. The credit
shall not exceed the improvement fee even if the cost of the capital
improvement exceeds the applicable improvement fee.
   (C)   Credit shall be used within ten years from the date the credit is
given and not be transferable from one development to another, except in
compliance with standards adopted by the City Council.

those set forth in §
156.06.
   (B)   The City Administrator shall provide the City Council with an annual
accounting, based on the City’s fiscal year, for system development charges,
showing the total amount of system development charge revenues collected for
each type of facility and the projects funded from each account.
(Ord. 680, passed 6-7-2023)
§ 156.14 APPEAL PROCEDURE.

   (B)   Appeals of any other decision required or permitted to be made by the
City Administrator under this chapter must be filed within ten days of the

whether the City Administrator’s decision or the expenditure is in accordance
with this chapter and the provision of ORS 223.297 to 223.314 and may affirm,
modify or overrule the decision. If the Council determines that there has been
an improper expenditure of system development charge revenues, the Council
shall direct that a sum equal to the misspent amount shall be deposited within
one year to the credit of the account or fund from which it was spent.
(Ord. 680, passed 6-7-2023)
§ 156.15 PROHIBITED CONNECTION – VIOLATION.
   No person may connect to any City system unless the appropriate system
development charge has been paid. Any person found to be violating any
provision of this chapter shall be served by the City with written notice
stating the nature of the violation and providing a reasonable time limit for
the satisfactory correction. The offender shall, within the period of time
stated in such notice, permanently cease all violations. Any person who shall
continue any violation beyond the time limit provided for, upon conviction
thereof before the Municipal Judge, shall be fined in an amount equal to a
class A infraction for each violation. Each day in which any such violation
shall continue shall be deemed a separate offense. Any person violating any of
the provisions of this chapter shall become liable to the City for any expense,
loss, or damage occasioned by the City by reason of such violation.
