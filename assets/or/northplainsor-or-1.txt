   (C)   Special meetings. Special meetings may be called by the Presiding
Officer, by request of any three Council members or by the City Manager.

delivery.
(Prior Code, § 1.05.030)
   (D)   Executive sessions. Executive sessions may be called by the Presiding

   (C)   The Council has an obligation to be clear and simple in its procedures

§ 33.51 BALLOT TITLE; APPEAL.
   (A)   Prior to the end of the fifth business day after a prospective
initiative petition is filed and meets all legal requirements, the Recorder
will review the text of the proposed initiative to determine if it complies
with the single subject requirement and if it proposes city legislation.
   (B)   If the proposed text does not meet the requirements of division (A)
above, the Recorder will notify a chief petitioner by certified mail, return
receipt requested, that the prospective petition does not meet the single
subject or city legislation requirement.
   (C)   Any city elector dissatisfied with the Recorder’s determination may
file a petition for review in Circuit Court. The petition for review must be
filed not later than the seventh business day after the written determination
by the Recorder.
   (D)   If the proposed initiative meets the requirements of division (A)
above or a referendum petition is certified for circulation, the Recorder will
send two copies of the prospective petition to the City Attorney. The City
Attorney has five business days after receipt to prepare a ballot title for the
proposed measure for the voter’s pamphlet. The ballot title must conform to the
requirements of state law. The City Attorney or the City Administrator will
prepare an explanatory statement for the voter’s pamphlet.

receipt of the ballot title. The notice must state that a city elector may file
a petition for review of the ballot title not later than the date referred to

Recorder must certify the ballot title as prepared by the City Attorney or as
prescribed by the court to a chief petitioner.
   (G)   Any city elector filing a petition of review with the Circuit Court
must file a copy of the challenge with the Recorder not later than the end of
the business day next following the date the petition is filed with the Circuit
Court. This requirement does not invalidate a petition that is timely filed
with the Circuit Court.
   (H)   The procedures in divisions (A) through (G) above also apply to
referendum measures. However, the completion of these procedures is not a
prerequisite to the circulation of petitions for referendum measures under this

referendum measures.

public improvements may be granted only for the cost of that portion of such
improvement that exceeds the city’s minimum standard facility size or capacity
needed to serve the particular development project or property. The applicant
shall have the burden of demonstrating that a particular improvement qualifies
for credit under this section. The request for credit shall be filed in writing
no later than 60 days after acceptance of the improvement by the city.
      (3)   When establishing a methodology for a system development charge,
the city may provide for a credit against the improvement fee, the
reimbursement fee, or both, for capital improvements constructed as part of the
development which reduce the development’s demand upon existing capital
improvements and/or the need for future capital improvements, or a credit based
upon any other rationale the Council finds reasonable.
      (4)   When the construction of a qualified public improvement gives rise
to a credit amount greater than the improvement fee that would otherwise be
levied against the project receiving development approval, the excess credit
may be applied against improvement fees that accrue in subsequent phases of the
original development project. Credit shall not be transferable from one
development to another.
      (5)   Credits shall not be transferable from one type of system
development charge to another.
      (6)   Credits shall be used within ten years from the date the credit is
given.
(Prior Code, § 2.15.120)
   (B)   If an applicant pays system development charges and then does not
complete the project, the city will not refund the SDCs. If the applicant
requests refund of the SDCs, the city shall not refund the SDCs, but will
credit the property for the payment of such SDCs. If subsequent development of
the property does not occur within two years, the credit shall expire and SDC
payments will be required before subsequent development of the property may
occur.

list at least 45 days prior to the first hearing to adopt or amend a system
development charge, and the methodology supporting the adoption or amendment

days prior to removing a name from the list must notify the persons whose name
is to be deleted that a new written request for notification is required if the

Director also may require additional information in the return relevant to

and interest will be computed according to the shorter return period. Returns
and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason.
Sellers must hold in trust all taxes collected pursuant to this subchapter for
the city’s account until the seller makes payment to the Director. A separate
trust bank account is not required in order to comply with this provision.
   (E)   Every seller required to remit the tax imposed by this subchapter is
entitled to retain 5% of all taxes due to the city to defray the costs of
bookkeeping and remittance.

tax will be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in divisions (A)

month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties,

Director. The seller must file the claim within one year from the date of the
alleged incorrect payment to be eligible for a refund.
   (C)   The Director has 20 calendar days from the date of the claim’s receipt

making the determination, the Director will notify the claimant in writing of
the determination by mailing notice to the claimant at the address provided on
the claim form.
   (D)   If the Director determines the claim is valid, the claimant may either
claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the
amount that was overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously received or
collected by the city. The claimant must notify the Director of the claimant’s
choice no later than 15 days following the date the Director mailed the
determination and the claimant must do so in a manner prescribed by the
Director.
   (E)   If the claimant does not notify the Director of the claimant’s choice
within the 15-day period and the claimant is still in business, the city will
grant a credit against the tax liability for the next reporting period. If the
claimant is no longer in business, the city will mail a refund check to
claimant at the address provided in the claim form.

(Prior Code, § 2.30.090) (Ord. 423, passed 11-3-2014)
§ 34.059 ACTIONS TO COLLECT.
   (A)   Any tax required to be paid by any seller under the provisions of this
subchapter is a debt owed by the seller to the city. Any tax collected by a
seller that has not been paid to the city is a debt owed by the seller to the
city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this
subchapter is liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the
recovery of the amount owing.
   (B)   In lieu of filing an action for the recovery, the city, when taxes due
are more than 30 days delinquent, may submit any outstanding tax to a
collection agency.
   (C)   So long as the city has complied with the provisions set forth in ORS
697.105, if the city turns over a delinquent tax account to a collection
agency, it may add to the amount owing an amount equal to the collection agency
fees, not to exceed the greater of $50 or 50% of the outstanding tax, penalties
and interest owing.

cover the city’s general administrative and overhead costs. The deposit shall
be an estimate only and upon determination of the actual cost of the expenses

legal, administrative and engineering costs attributable thereto;
      (4)   An estimate of the unit cost (per square foot, per front foot or

benefitted properties;
      (5)   A recommendation as to the method of assessment to be used to
arrive at a fair apportionment of the whole or any portion of the cost of the
improvement to the properties specially benefitted;
      (6)   The description of each lot, parcel of land or portion thereof to
be specially benefitted, with the names of the record owners thereof and, when
readily available, the names of the contract purchasers thereof, as shown on
the books and records of the County Department of Revenue and Taxation. For
purposes of describing each lot or parcel of land under the provisions of this
section, it shall be sufficient to use the tax account number assigned to said
property and used by said Department of Revenue and Taxation or the book and

then the improvement shall be suspended for six months; and
   (C)   A description of the property to be specially benefitted by the
improvement, the owners of such property as shown on the books and records of
the County Department of Revenue and Taxation, and the Engineer’s estimate of
the total cost of the improvement to be paid for by special assessments to
benefitted properties. For the purpose of this division (C), it shall be
sufficient to describe the property to be specially benefitted by tax account
number assigned to the property and used by the Department of Revenue and
Taxation or the book and page designation as shown on the books and records of
the County Recorder.

1981)
§ 35.04 MANNER OF DOING WORK.
   The Council may provide in the improvement resolution that the construction
work may be done in whole, or in part, by the city, by a contract or by any
other governmental agency, or by any combination thereof.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.040) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.05 HEARING.
   At the time of the public hearing on the proposed improvement, if the
written remonstrances represent less than the amount of property required to
defeat the proposed improvement, then, on the basis of the hearing of written
remonstrances and oral objections, if any, the Council may, by motion, at the
time of the hearing or within 60 days thereafter, order the Engineer to prepare
the necessary plans and specifications for construction of the improvement and
require that the improvement be carried out in accordance with the resolution;
or the Council may, if the project was initiated by the Council’s motion and
not the petition of property owners, abandon the improvement on its own motion;
provided, however, that, an improvement unanimously declared by the Council to
be needed at once because of an emergency may be ordered by the Council, by
resolution, to be constructed over and notwithstanding the written
remonstrances which would otherwise defeat the project under the provisions of
this subchapter.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.050) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981; Ord. 124, passed 11-16-
1981)
§ 35.06 CALLS FOR BIDS.
   (A)   The Council may, in its discretion, direct the City Recorder to
advertise for bids for construction of all or any part of the improvement
project. In the event that any part of the work of the improvement is to be
done under contract bids, then the Council shall determine the time and manner
of advertisement for bids, and the contracts shall be let to the lowest
responsible bidder; provided that, the Council shall have the right to reject
all bids when they are deemed unreasonable or unsatisfactory for any reason.
The city shall provide for the bonding of all contractors for the faithful
performance of any contract let under its authority and the provisions thereof
in case of default shall be enforced by action in the name of the city.
   (B)   If the Council finds, upon opening bids for the work of such
improvement, that the lowest responsible bid is substantially in excess of the
Engineer’s estimate, it may, in its discretion, provide for holding a special
hearing of objections to the proceeding with the improvement on the basis of
such bid, and it may direct the City Recorder to publish one notice thereof in
a newspaper of general circulation in the city. At such special hearing, the
Council may determine to abandon the project as allowed in the initial public
hearings.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.060) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.07 ASSESSMENT ORDINANCES.
   If the Council determines that the local improvement shall be made, when the
estimated cost thereof is ascertained on the basis of the contract award or
city departmental cost, or after the work is done and the cost thereof has been
actually determined, the Council shall determine whether the property
benefitted shall bear all or a portion of the cost. The Recorder or other
person designated by the Council shall prepare the proposed assessment to the
respective lots within the assessment district and file it in the Recorder’s
office. Notice of such proposed assessment shall be mailed to the owner of each
lot proposed to be assessed at the owner’s address as shown on the County Tax
Assessor’s rolls, which notice shall state the amount of assessment proposed on
the owner’s property and shall fix a date by which time objections shall be
filed with the City Recorder. Any such objection shall state the grounds
thereof. The Council shall consider such objections and may adopt, correct,
modify or revise the proposed assessments and shall determine the amount of
assessment to be charged against each lot within the district, according to the
special and peculiar benefits accruing thereto from the improvement, and shall,
by ordinance, spread the assessments. The notice of proposed assessment shall
provide for a rate of interest to be paid on assessments bonded under the
Bancroft Bonding Act, being ORS 223.205 et seq., and ORS Ch. 223.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.070) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.08 METHOD OF ASSESSMENT; ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF FINANCING.
   (A)   The Council, in adopting a method of assessment of the costs of the
improvement, may:
      (1)   Use any just and reasonable method of determining the extent of any
improvement district consistent with the benefits derived;
      (2)   Use any method of apportioning the sum to be assessed as is just
and reasonable between the properties determined to be specially benefitted;
and
      (3)   Authorize payment by the city of all, or any part of, the cost of
any such improvement, when, in the opinion of the Council, the topographical or
physical conditions, or unusual or excessive public travel or other character
of the work involved bonds only a partial payment or no payment by the
benefitted property of the costs of the improvement.
   (B)   Notwithstanding other provisions of this subchapter, the Council
hereby authorizes the financing of local improvements by the issuance of
general obligation bonds in accordance with the procedures provided by state
law, except as otherwise provided herein. General obligation improvement bonds
may be issued when authorized by ordinance for each contract for the
construction of a local improvement district in an amount equal to:
      (1)   The amount to be paid by the city to the contractor for the
construction of a local improvement, not exceeding the bid price of each
contract, plus 15% for approved change orders; and
      (2)   All engineering, legal and administrative costs expended on the
local improvements.
   (C)   From time to time, the Council may, upon recommendation of the City
Recorder, call for bids on the interest rate for general obligation improvement
bonds on the estimated amount of the proposed assessments for local improvement
districts, authorized or to be authorized. Bids shall meet the conditions and
requirements provided for in the authorizing ordinance.
   (D)   Upon return of the bids, the Council may award to the highest and
best-qualified bidder offering the most advantageous interest rate the full
amount of general obligation improvement bonds to be issued for local
improvements specified in the ordinance requesting bids; provided further, the
Council may reject any and all bids.
   (E)   The ordinance authorizing the call for bids shall also authorize the
issuance of the general obligation improvement bonds to the successful bidder
as determined by the Council, subject to the provisions of this subchapter.
Thereafter, the City Recorder is authorized to deliver to the successful bidder
from time to time as he or she deems necessary, general obligation improvement
bonds in an amount equal to the estimated amount payable by the city, pursuant
to contracts for the construction of local improvements not exceeding the bid
price of each contract, plus 15% for approved change orders.
   (F)   General obligation improvement bonds shall be issued in denominations
as stated in the ordinance authorizing call for bids, shall be numbered
consecutively, shall be dated the first day of the month in which they are
delivered to the successful bidder and shall mature within the time provided by
state law. The successful bidder shall pay accrued interest from the date of
the bonds to the time of delivery.
   (G)   Upon completion of any local improvement contract and the spreading of
assessments upon the property benefitted thereby, all proceeds from the
collection of un-bonded assessments, the sale of improvement bonds and the
foreclosure of improvement liens for un-bonded assessments realized from the
local improvement with respect to which such general obligation improvement
bonds are issued, shall be transferred from the local improvement district
assessment fund created for that particular improvement and applied to the call
and payment of such bonds as rapidly as funds are available, as provided by
statute.
   (H)   (1)   Nothing contained in this subchapter shall preclude the Council
from using any other available means of financing improvements, including
federal and state grants-in-aid, sewer charges or fees, revenue bonds, general
obligation bonds or any other legal means of finance.
      (2)   In the event that such other means of financing improvements are
used, the Council may, in its discretion, levy special assessments according to
the benefits derived to cover any remaining part of the costs of the
improvement.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.080) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.09 REMEDIES.
   (A)   Subject to the curative provisions of §
35.16 of this chapter and the rights of the city to reassess as provided in §
35.17 of this chapter, proceedings for writs of review and suits in equity may
be filed not earlier than 30 days, nor later than 60 days, after the filing of
written objections, as provided herein.
   (B)   A property owner who has filed written objections with the City
Recorder prior to the public hearing may have the right to apply for a writ of
review based upon the City Council’s exercising its functions erroneously or
arbitrarily or exceeding its jurisdiction to the injury of some substantial
right of such owner, if the facts supporting such claim have been specifically
set forth in the written objections. A property owner who has filed written
objections with the City Recorder prior to the public hearing may commence a
suit for equitable relief based upon a total lack of jurisdiction on the part
of the city; and, if notice of the improvement shall not have been sent to the
owner, and if the owner did not have actual knowledge of the proposed
improvement prior to the hearing, then the owner may file written objections
alleging lack of jurisdiction with the City Recorder within 30 days after
receiving notice or knowledge of the improvement.
   (C)   No provision of this section shall be construed so as to lengthen any
period of redemption or so as to affect the running of any statute of
limitation. Any proceeding on a writ of review or suit in equity shall be
abated if proceedings are commenced and diligently pursued by the City Council
to remedy or cure the alleged errors or defects.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.090) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.10 NOTICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   Within ten days after the ordinance levying assessments has been passed, the
City Recorder shall send by registered or certified mail a notice of assessment
to the owner of the assessed property and shall publish notice of such
assessment twice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, the first
publication of which shall be made not later than ten days after the date of
the assessment ordinance. The notice of assessment shall recite the date of the
assessment ordinance and shall state that, upon the failure of the owner of the
property assessed to make application to pay the assessment in installments
within ten days from the date of the first publication of notice, or upon the
failure of the owner to pay the assessment in full within 30 days from the date
of the assessment ordinance, then interest will commence to run on the
assessment and that the property assessed will be subject to foreclosure; and
said notice shall further set forth a description of the property assessed, the
name of the owner of the property and the amount of each assessment.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.100) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.11 LIEN RECORDS AND FORECLOSURE PROCEEDINGS.
   (A)   After passage of the assessment ordinance by the Council, the City
Recorder shall enter in the docket of the city liens a statement of the amounts
assessed upon each particular lot, parcel of land or portion thereof, together
with a description of the improvement the name of the owners and the date of
the assessment ordinance.
   (B)   Upon such entry in the lien docket, the amount so entered shall become
a lien and charge upon the respective lots, parcels of land or portions
thereof, which have been assessed for such improvement.
   (C)   All assessment liens of the city shall be superior and prior to all
other liens or encumbrances on property insofar as the laws of the state
permit.
   (D)   Interest shall be charged at the rate of 10% per annum until paid on
all amounts not paid within 30 days from the date of such assessment ordinance;
and, after expiration of 30 days from the date of such assessment ordinance,
the city may proceed to foreclose or enforce collection of the assessment liens
in the manner provided by the general law of the state; provided, however,
that, the city may, at its option, enter a bid for the property being offered
at a foreclosure sale, which bid shall be prior to all bids, except those made
by persons who would be entitled under the laws of the state to redeem such
property.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.110) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.12 ERRORS IN ASSESSMENT CALCULATIONS.
   (A)   Claimed errors in the calculation of assessment shall be called to the
attention of the City Recorder, who shall determine whether there has been an
error in fact.
   (B)   If the Recorder shall find that there has been an error in fact, he or
she shall recommend to the Council an amendment to the assessment ordinance to
correct such error and, upon enactment of such amendment, the City Recorder
shall make the necessary correction in the docket of city liens and send a
correct notice of assessment by registered or certified mail.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.120) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.13 SUPPLEMENTAL ASSESSMENT.
   In the event that an assessment shall be made before the total cost of the
improvement is ascertained and, if it is found that the amount of the
assessment is insufficient to defray the expenses of the improvement, the
Council may, by motion, declare such insufficiency and prepare a proposed
supplemental assessment. The Council shall set a time for a hearing of
objections to such supplemental assessment and shall direct the City Recorder
to publish one notice thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the
city. After such hearing, the Council shall make a just and equitable
supplemental assessment by ordinance, which shall be entered in the docket of
city liens as provided by this subchapter, and notices of the supplemental
assessment shall be published and mailed, and the collection of the assessment
shall be made in accordance with §§
35.10 and
35.11 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.130) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.14 REBATES.
   If, upon the completion of the improvement project, it is found that the
assessment previously levied upon any property is more than sufficient to pay
the costs of such improvements, then the Council must ascertain and declare the
same by ordinance; and, when so declared, the excess amounts must be entered on
the lien docket as a credit upon the appropriate assessment. In the event that
any assessment has been paid, the person who paid the same, or his or her legal
representative, shall be entitled to the repayment of such rebate credit, or
the portion thereof which exceeds the amount unpaid on the original assessment.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.140) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.15 ABANDONMENT OF PROCEEDINGS.
   The Council shall have full power and authority to abandon and rescind
proceedings for improvements made under this subchapter at any time prior to
the final completion of such improvements; and, if liens have been assessed
upon any property under such procedure, they shall be canceled, and any
payments made on such assessments shall be refunded to the person paying the
same, his or her assigns or legal representatives.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.150) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.16 CURATIVE PROVISIONS.
   No improvement assessment shall be rendered invalid by reason of a failure
of the Engineer’s report to contain all of the information required by §
35.01 of this chapter, or by reason of a failure to have all of the information
required to be in the improvement resolution, the assessment ordinance, the
lien docket or notices required to be published and mailed; nor by the failure
to list the name of, or mail notice to, the owner of any property as required
by this subchapter; or by reason of any other error, mistake, delay, omission,
irregularity or other act, jurisdictional or otherwise, in any of the
proceedings or steps herein specified, unless it appears that the assessment is
unfair or unjust in its effect upon the person complaining; and the Council
shall have the power and authority to remedy and correct all such matters by
suitable action and proceedings.
(Prior Code, § 2.01.160) (Ord. 117, passed 10-19-1981)
§ 35.17 REASSESSMENTS.
   Whenever any assessment, supplemental assessment or reassessment for any
improvement which has been made by the city has been, or shall be, set aside,
annulled, declared or rendered void, or its enforcement restrained by any court
of the state, or any federal court having jurisdiction thereof, or when the
Council shall be in doubt as to the validity of such assessment, supplemental
assessment or reassessment, or any part thereof, then the Council may make a
reassessment in the manner provided by the laws of the state.

the applicant. Examples include, but shall not be limited to, full street
improvements instead of half street improvements, off-site sidewalks,
connection of street sections for continuity, extension of water lines and
extension of sewer lines. The city may also initiate formation of a
reimbursement district.
      (2)   The application shall be accompanied by a fee, as established by

created by the applicant and that the delay was unavoidable due to
unanticipated or unforeseen circumstances.
(Prior Code, § 2.10.020) (Ord. 244, passed 4-15-1996)
§ 35.32 CITY ENGINEER’S REPORT.
   (A)   The City Engineer shall review the application for the establishment
of a reimbursement district and evaluate whether a district should be
established. The Engineer may require the submittal of other relevant
information from the applicant in order to assist in the evaluation.
   (B)   The Engineer shall prepare a written report for the City Council,
considering and making recommendations concerning the following factors:
      (1)   Whether the applicant will finance or has financed some or all of
the cost of a street, water or sewer improvement, thereby making service
available to property, other than property owned by the applicant;
      (2)   The area to be included in the reimbursement district;
      (3)   The actual or estimated cost of the street, water or sewer
improvements within the area of the proposed reimbursement district and the
portion of the cost for which the applicant should be reimbursed for each
improvement;
      (4)   A methodology for spreading the cost among the parcels within the
reimbursement district and where appropriate defining a “unit” for applying the
reimbursement fee to property which may, with city approval, be partitioned,
altered, modified or subdivided at some future date. The methodology should
include consideration of the cost of the improvements, prior contributions by
property owners, the value of the unused capacity, rate-making principles
employed to finance public improvements and other factors deemed relevant by
the City Engineer. Prior contributions by property owners will only be
considered if the contribution was for the same type of improvement and at the
same location;
      (5)   The annual fee adjustment which shall be applied to the
reimbursement fee beginning on the first anniversary of the date of the
reimbursement agreement as a return on the investment for the person or the
city. The annual fee adjustment shall be fixed and determined by the City
Council and computed against the reimbursement fee as simple interest and will
not compound. The City Engineer may take into account the cost of any
financing, including prepayment penalties, loan fees, the actual percentage
rate of interest being paid by the applicant and opportunity costs lost when
recommending the annual fee adjustment to the City Council;
      (6)   The amount to be charged by the city for administration of the
agreement. The administration fee shall be fixed by the City Council and will
be included in the resolution approving and forming the reimbursement district.
The administration fee is due and payable to the city at the time the agreement
is signed;
      (7)   The period of time that the right to reimbursement exists if the
period is less than five years; and
      (8)   Whether the street, water and sewer improvements will or have met
city standards.

§ 35.33 AMOUNT TO BE REIMBURSED.
   (A)   The cost to be reimbursed to the applicant shall be limited to the
cost of construction, including the acquisition and condemnation costs of
acquiring additional right-of-way, the cost of permits, engineering and legal
expenses and the annual fee adjustment fixed and determined by the City
Council.
   (B)   A reimbursement fee shall be computed by the city for all properties
which have the opportunity to utilize the improvements, including the property
of the applicant for formation of a reimbursement district. The fee shall be
calculated separately for each type of improvement. The applicant for formation
of the reimbursement district shall not be reimbursed for the portion of the
reimbursement fee computed for the property of the applicant.
(Prior Code, § 2.10.040) (Ord. 244, passed 4-15-1996)
§ 35.34 PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   (A)   Within a reasonable time after the City Engineer has completed the
report required in §
35.32 of this chapter, the City Council shall hold an informational public
hearing in which any person shall be given the opportunity to comment on the
proposed reimbursement district. Because formation of the reimbursement
district does not result in an assessment against property or lien against
property, the public hearing is for informational purposes only and is not
subject to mandatory termination because of remonstrances. The City Council has
the sole discretion after the public hearing to decide whether a resolution
approving and forming the reimbursement district shall be adopted.
   (B)   If a reimbursement district is formed prior to construction of the
improvement(s), a second public hearing shall be held after the improvement has
been accepted by the city. At that time, the City Council may modify the
resolution to reflect the actual cost of the improvement(s).
(Prior Code, § 2.10.050) (Ord. 244, passed 4-15-1996)
§ 35.35 NOTICE OF PUBLIC HEARINGS.
   (A)   Not less than ten, nor more than 30, days prior to any public hearing
held pursuant to this subchapter, the applicant and all owners of property
within the proposed district shall be notified of such hearing and the purpose
thereof. Such notification shall be accomplished by either regular mail or
personal service.
   (B)   If notification is accomplished by mail, notice shall be mailed not
less than 13 days prior to the hearing. Notice shall be deemed effective on the
date that the letter of notification is mailed.
   (C)   Failure of the applicant or any affected property owner to be so
notified shall not invalidate or otherwise affect any reimbursement district
resolution or the City Council’s action to approve the same.
(Prior Code, § 2.10.060) (Ord. 244, passed 4-15-1996)
§ 35.36 CITY COUNCIL ACTION.
   (A)   (1)   After the public hearing held pursuant to §
35.34(A) of this chapter, the City Council shall approve, reject or modify the
recommendations contained in the City Engineer’s report.
      (2)   The City Council’s decision shall be embodied in a resolution.
      (3)   If a reimbursement district is established, the resolution shall
include the City Engineer’s report as approved or modified, and specify that
payment of the reimbursement fee, as designated for each parcel, as a
precondition of receiving city permits applicable to development of that parcel
as provided for in §
35.40 of this chapter.
   (B)   When the applicant is other than the city, the resolution shall
instruct the Finance Director to enter into an agreement with the applicant
pertaining to the reimbursement district improvements. If the agreement is
entered into prior to construction, the agreement shall be contingent upon the
improvements being accepted by the city. The agreement, at a minimum, shall
contain the following provisions:
      (1)   The public improvement(s) shall meet all applicable city standards;
      (2)   The total amount of potential reimbursement to the applicant;
      (3)   The total amount of potential reimbursement shall not exceed the
actual cost of the public improvement(s);
      (4)   The annual fee adjustment set by the City Council;
      (5)   The applicant shall guarantee the public improvement(s) for a
period of 12 months after the date of installation;
      (6)   The applicant shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city

fee and the amount of the fee.
(Prior Code, § 2.10.080) (Ord. 244, passed 4-15-1996)
§ 35.38 RECORDING OF RESOLUTION.
   The City Recorder shall cause notice of the formation and nature of the
reimbursement district to be filed in the office of the County Recorder so as
to provide notice to potential purchasers of property within the district. Said
recording shall not create a lien. Failure to make such recording shall not
affect the legality of the resolution or the obligation to pay the

(Prior Code, § 2.10.090) (Ord. 244, passed 4-15-1996)
§ 35.39 CONTESTING THE REIMBURSEMENT DISTRICT.
   No legal action intended to contest the formation of the district or the

(Prior Code, § 2.10.100) (Ord. 244, passed 4-15-1996)
§ 35.40 OBLIGATION TO PAY REIMBURSEMENT FEE.
   (A)   The applicant for a permit related to property within any
reimbursement district shall pay to the city, in addition to any other
applicable fees and charges, the reimbursement fee established by the City
Council, together with the annual fee adjustment, if within the time specified
in the resolution establishing the district, the person applies for and
receives approval from the city for any of the following activities:
      (1)   To apply for a building permit which will use or increase the use
of a public improvement; and
      (2)   To connect to a public improvement or otherwise increase the use of
a public improvement.
   (B)   INCREASE THE USE means:
      (1)   For sanitary sewer or storm sewer lines: to make a physical change
requiring a building or development permit on the intervening property which
increases the volume discharged into the line;
      (2)   For water lines: to make a physical change requiring a building or
development permit on the intervening property which increases the amount of
water used; and
      (3)   For public streets: to make a physical change requiring a building
or development permit on the intervening property which increases the trips on
the street or creates a new entrance onto the street.
   (C)   The city’s determination of who shall pay the reimbursement fee is
final. Neither the city, nor any officer or employee of the city, shall be
liable for payment of any reimbursement fee, annual fee adjustment or portion
thereof as a result of this determination.
   (D)   A permit applicant whose property is subject to payment of a
reimbursement fee receives a benefit from the construction of street
improvements, regardless of whether access is taken or provided directly onto
such street at any time. Nothing in this subchapter is intended to modify or
limit the authority of the city to provide or require access management.
   (E)   No person shall be required to pay the reimbursement fee on an
application or upon property for which the reimbursement fee has been
previously paid, unless such payment was for a different type of improvement.
No permit shall be issued for any of the activities listed in division (A)
above unless the reimbursement fee, together with the annual fee adjustment,
has been paid in full. Where approval is given as specified in division (A)
above, but no permit is requested or issued, then the requirement to pay the
reimbursement fee lapses if the underlying approval lapses.
   (F)   The date when the right of reimbursement ends shall not extend beyond
five years from the district formation date. Upon application for an extension
by the applicant, the City Council may, by resolution, authorize up to two
five-year extensions of the right of reimbursement under the agreement.
   (G)   The reimbursement fee is immediately due and payable to the city by
intervening property owners upon utilization of a public improvement. If
connection is made or construction commenced without required city permits,
then the reimbursement fee is immediately due and payable upon the earliest
date that any such permit was required. No city permit of any kind for the
intervening property shall be issued until the reimbursement fee is paid in
full.
   (H)   Whenever the full reimbursement fee has not been paid and collected
for any reason after it is due, the Finance Director shall report to the City
Council the amount of the uncollected reimbursement, the legal description of
the intervening property on which the reimbursement is due, the date upon which
the reimbursement was due and the intervening property owner’s name or names.
The City Council shall then, by motion, set a public hearing date and direct
the Finance Director to give notice of that hearing to each of the identified
intervening property owners, together with a copy of the Finance Director’s
report concerning the unpaid reimbursement fee. Such notice may be either by
certified mail or personal service. At the public hearing, the City Council may
accept, reject or modify the Finance Director’s report. If the City Council
accepts or rejects the Finance Director’s report and determines that the
reimbursement fee is due but has not been paid for whatever reason, the city
may take any action including all legal or equitable means necessary to collect
the unpaid amount. An unpaid reimbursement fee shall prohibit any issuance of
permits by the city for the intervening property.
(Prior Code, § 2.10.110) (Ord. 244, passed 4-15-1996)
§ 35.41 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS.

shall become and remain the sole property of the city.

their public improvements. Such reimbursement shall be delivered to the
developer for as long as the reimbursement district agreement is in effect.
Such payments shall be made by the city within 90 days of receipt of the
reimbursements.

addition to, any other existing fees or charges collected by the city.

directed by the city pursuant to this division, the city shall cause such
restoration to be made at the expense of the permittee.
      (4)   A permittee or other person acting in its behalf shall use suitable

   (D)   Removal of unauthorized facilities. Within 30 days following written
notice from the city, any grantee or utility operator that owns, operates,
controls or maintains any unauthorized utility facilities or related
appurtenances within the public rights-of-way of the city shall, at its own
expense, remove such utility facilities or appurtenances from the public
rights-of-way of the city. If a utility operator fails to remove any abandoned
facilities or appurtenances, the utility operator shall pay all costs and
expenses incurred by the city due to such failure, including but not limited to
costs related to project delays, and the city may cause the utility facility or
appurtenances to be removed at the utility operator’s expense using qualified
workers in accordance with applicable state and federal laws and regulations.
The utility operator shall reimburse the city within 30 days of receipt of an
invoice from the city. A utility facility is unauthorized and subject to
removal in the following circumstances:
      (1)   One year after the expiration, revocation or termination of the
grantee’s license;
      (2)   Upon abandonment of a utility facility within the public rights-of-
way of the city. A utility facility, or any portion of a utility facility, will
be considered “abandoned” when it is deactivated, out of service or not used
for its intended and authorized purpose for a period of 90 days or longer. A
utility facility will not be considered abandoned if it is temporarily out of
service during performance of repairs or if the utility facility is being
replaced;
      (3)   If the utility facility was constructed or installed without the
appropriate prior authority at the time of installation; or
      (4)   If the utility facility was constructed or installed at a location
not permitted by the license or franchise or permit issued by the city.
   (E)   Coordination of construction activities. All grantees are required to
make a good faith effort to cooperate with the city in coordinating work in the
public rights-of-way.
      (1)   By January 1 of each year, grantees shall provide the city with a
schedule of their proposed construction activities in, around or that may
affect the public rights-of-way.
      (2)   If requested by the city, each grantee shall meet with the city
annually or as determined by the city, to schedule and coordinate construction
in the public rights-of-way. At that time, city will provide available
information on plans for local, state and/or federal construction projects.
      (3)   All construction locations, activities and schedules shall be
coordinated, as ordered by the City Engineer or his or her designee, to
minimize public inconvenience, disruption or damages.

§ 51.07 UTILITY LICENSE.
   (A)   Utility license. A utility license shall be required of any utility
operator who desires to occupy public rights-of-way of the city, and shall be
obtained prior to undertaking any work in the public rights-of-way. Every
person that owns, operates or controls utility facilities as of the effective
date of this chapter shall apply for a license from the city within 30 days of
the later of the effective date of this chapter, or the expiration of a valid
franchise agreement granted by the city, unless a new franchise agreement is
granted by the city pursuant to division (L) of this section.
   (B)   Application. Any person that desires a utility license shall file an
application with the city. The license application shall be on a form provided
by the city, and shall be accompanied by any additional documents required by
the application or the city to identify the applicant, its legal status,
including its authorization to do business in Oregon, a description of the
utility facilities in the public rights-of-way or to be installed in the public
rights-of-way, a description of type of utility service provided or to be
provided by the applicant, if any, and other information reasonably necessary
to determine the applicant’s ability to comply with the terms of this chapter.
   (C)   Application fee. The application shall be accompanied by a non-
refundable applicable fee or deposit set by resolution of the City Council.
   (D)   Determination by the city. The city shall issue a written
determination granting or denying the application in whole or in part. If the
application is denied, the written determination shall include the reasons for
denial. The application shall be evaluated based upon the provisions of this
chapter, the continuing capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate the
applicant’s proposed utility facilities and the applicant’s ability to comply
with applicable federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies.
   (E)   Rights granted. 
      (1)   No license granted pursuant to this chapter shall convey any right,
title or interest in the public rights-of-way, but shall be deemed a grant to
use and occupy the public rights-of-way for the limited purposes and term
stated in the license and as provided in this chapter. The license is subject
to all recorded deeds, easements, dedications, conditions, covenants,
restrictions, encumbrances and claims of title of record that may affect the
public rights-of-way.
      (2)   A license shall authorize the licensee, subject to the provisions
of the city codes, including this chapter, and other applicable provisions of
state or federal law, as amended from time to time, to construct, place,
maintain, upgrade, repair and operate utility facilities in the public rights-
of- way for the term of the license for the provision of the utility service(s)
authorized in the license. In the event the licensee, or another utility
provider using the licensee’s facilities, offers different utility service(s)
than those authorized in the license, the licensee shall inform the city of
such changes no later than 30 days after the provision of such services.
      (3)   Nothing in the license shall be construed to prevent the city from
grading, paving, repairing and/or altering any rights-of-way, constructing,
laying down, repairing, relocating or removing city facilities or establishing
any other public work, utility or improvement of any kind, including repairs,
replacement or removal of any city facilities. If any of the licensee’s utility
facilities interfere with the construction, repair, relocation, replacement,
alteration or removal of any rights-of-way, public work, city utility, city
improvement or city facility, licensee’s facilities shall be removed or
relocated as provided in this chapter.
      (4)   Neither the issuance of the license nor any provisions contained
therein shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental
right or power, including, without limitation, the police power or regulatory
power of the city.
   (F)   Term of grant. Subject to the revocation and termination provisions of
this chapter, a utility license granted hereunder shall be in effect for a term
of five years.
   (G)   Franchise territory. Unless otherwise specified in a franchise
agreement, a telecommunications franchise granted hereunder shall be limited to
a specific geographic area of the city to be served by the franchise grantee,
and the public rights-of-way necessary to serve such areas, and may include the
entire city.
   (H)   Multiple services.
      (1)   A utility operator that provides or transmits or allows the
provision or transmission of utility services and non-utility services over its
facilities is subject to the license and fee requirements of this chapter for
the portion of the facilities and extent of utility services delivered by the
utility operator over those facilities.
      (2)   A utility operator that provides or transmits more than one utility
service to customers in the city is not required to obtain a separate license
or franchise for each utility service, but is required to pay the rights-of-way
access fees due for each utility service the utility operator provides.
   (I)   Renewal applications. A grantee that desires to renew its license
under this chapter shall, not less than 30 days but no more than 180 days
before expiration of the current license, file an application with the city,
including all information required in division (B) of this section and pay the
application fee required in division (C). The city shall review the application
as required by division (D) and grant or deny the license within 90 days of
submission of the application. If the city determines that the licensee is in
violation of the terms of this chapter at the time it submits its application,
the city may require that the licensee cure the violation or submit a detailed
plan to cure the violation within a reasonable period of time, as determined by
the city, before the city will consider the application and/or grant the
license. If the city requires the licensee to cure or submit a plan to cure a
violation, the city will grant or deny the license application within 90 days
of confirming that the violation has been cured or of accepting the licensee’s
plan to cure the violation.
   (J)   Assignments or transfers of system, license or franchise. Except as
otherwise provided by applicable state and federal law or as otherwise provided
in a franchise, ownership or control of a majority interest in a utility
facility, license, or franchise may not, directly or indirectly, be
transferred, assigned or disposed of by sale, lease, merger, consolidation or
other act of the grantee, by operation of law or otherwise, without the prior
consent of the city, which consent may include conditions prescribed by the
city.
      (1)   The grantee and the proposed assignee or transferee of the license,
franchise or utility facilities shall agree, in writing, to assume and abide by
all of the provisions of the license or franchise.
      (2)   No transfer shall be approved unless the assignee or transferee has
the legal, technical, financial and other requisite qualifications to own, hold
and operate the utility facilities pursuant to this chapter.
      (3)   Unless expressly prohibited by applicable law, the grantee shall
reimburse the city for all direct and indirect fees, costs and expenses
reasonably incurred by the city in considering a request to transfer or assign
a telecommunications franchise.
      (4)   Any transfer or assignment of a license, franchise, utility
facility or integral part of utility facility without prior approval of the
city under this chapter shall be void and is cause for revocation of the
license or franchise.
   (K)   Revocation or termination of license or franchise. 
      (1)   A license or franchise to use or occupy public rights-of-way of the
city may be revoked for the following reasons:
         (a)   Construction or operation in the city or in the public rights-
of-way of the city without constructional applicable permits;
         (b)   Construction or operation at an unauthorized location;
         (c)   Failure to comply with division (J) above with respect to sale,

due the city under this chapter;
         (h)   Insolvency or bankruptcy of the grantee;
         (i)   Violation of material provisions of this chapter; and
         (j)   Violation of the material terms of a license or franchise
agreement.
      (2)   Notice and duty to cure. In the event that the city believes that
grounds exist for revocation of a license or franchise, the city shall give the
grantee written notice of the apparent violation or non-compliance, providing a
short and concise statement of the nature and general facts of the violation or
non-compliance and providing the grantee a reasonable period of time, not
exceeding 30 days, to furnish evidence that:
         (a)   Corrective action has been, or is being actively and
expeditiously pursued, to remedy the violation or non-compliance;
         (b)   Rebuts the alleged violation or non-compliance; and/or
         (c)   It would be in the public interest to impose some penalty or
sanction less than revocation.
      (3)   Public hearing. In the event that a grantee fails to provide
evidence reasonably satisfactory to the city as to its performance consistent
with this chapter and the license or franchise, the city staff shall refer the
apparent violation or non-compliance to the City Council. The City Council
shall provide the grantee with notice and a reasonable opportunity to be heard
concerning the matter.
      (4)   Standards for revocation or lesser sanctions. If persuaded that the
grantee has violated or failed to comply with material provisions of this
chapter, or of a license or franchise agreement, the City Council shall
determine whether to revoke the license or franchise, or to establish some
lesser sanction and cure, considering the nature, circumstances, extent and
gravity of the violation as reflected by one or more of the following factors.
Whether:
         (a)   The misconduct was egregious;
         (b)   Substantial harm resulted;
         (c)   The violation was intentional;
         (d)   There is a history of prior violations of the same or other
requirements;
         (e)   There is a history of overall compliance; and/or
         (f)   The violation was voluntarily disclosed, admitted or cured.
      (5)   The provisions of this division (K) are in addition to, and in no
way limit, the other penalties provided in this chapter and any other remedies
the city may have in law or in equity.
   (L)   Franchise agreements. If the public interest warrants, as determined
by the city in its sole discretion, the city and utility operator may enter
into a written franchise agreement that includes terms that clarify, enhance,
expand, waive or vary the provisions of this chapter, consistent with
applicable state and federal law. The franchise may conflict with the terms of
this chapter with the review and approval of City Council. The franchisee shall
be subject to the provisions of this chapter to the extent such provisions are
not in conflict with the express provisions of any such franchise. In the event
of a conflict between the express provisions of a franchise and this chapter,
the franchise shall control.

WATER LINE EXTENSIONS
§ 52.040 WATER MAIN EXTENSION COSTS.
   If any person, firm or corporation is required by the city to pay the cost
of extending a water main line adjacent to property other than his or her own
property so that water service is provided for such other property without
further extension of the main line, the city shall require, prior to providing
water service, that the persons requesting connection to the line refund to the
person, firm or corporation required to pay the cost of construction to extend
said water main line a pro rata portion of the cost of said construction. The
right to require such refund shall not continue for more than ten years after
the date of installation of the extension of the water line. For purposes of
this section, the term COST OF CONSTRUCTION shall mean the actual cost of
construction in addition to annual interest at the statutory rate established
by state statutes which interest shall accrue from the date said water line is
accepted by the city until the reimbursement is fully paid or the right to
reimbursement terminated under the provisions of this section. The amount to be
refunded shall be determined by the city and such determination shall be final.
The city shall compute the pro rata portion to be refunded upon a front-foot
basis of properties connected to the line including the property of the person,
firm or corporation required to extend said line with the total reimbursable
cost spread equally over the total front footage of the properties served. In
such cases where the determination of reimbursable costs upon a front foot
basis is inequitable or inappropriate by reason of size, location or condition
of properties involved, the city may fix and determine the basis of
reimbursement other than on a front-foot basis.
(Prior Code, § 3.10.010) (Ord. 179, passed 10-2-1989; Ord. 202, passed 1-6-
1992)
§ 52.041 REIMBURSEMENT METHODS.
   The person, firm or corporation required to make such extension of water
line shall submit a map locating the extended line and the city shall determine
the properties benefitted by the extension by designating the same on the map
submitted. The cost to be reimbursed to the person, firm or corporation
extending said line shall be limited to the actual cost of construction, in
addition to the cost of permits, engineering and legal expenses. In no event
shall the items of expense for permits, engineering and legal exceed 25% of the
actual cost of construction. The city shall add to the items of cost an amount
equal to 5% of the total cost of construction including permits, engineering
and legal expenses, which percentage shall be computed annually on the
anniversary date of the agreement on the then unreimbursed balance of the cost
of construction, which percentage shall be an appropriate return on investment
to the person, firm or corporation making said extension. The city shall retain
an amount equal to 10% of the total reimbursable cost for the cost of
administration of the agreement by the city, which 10% shall be deducted from
pro rata payments by applicants for service as such pro rata payments are made.

   (A)   First level of concern; voluntary reduction in water use.
      (1)   The City Recorder shall issue a general request for a voluntary
reduction in water use by all water users. The request shall be made at a time
when there is a strong indication that the city’s water supply will be reduced
beyond the capacity to provide adequate service to all water customers. The
request shall include a summary of the current water situation, the reason for
the requested cutback in use and a warning that mandatory cutbacks will be
required if the voluntary measures do not sufficiently reduce usage.
      (2)   The request for voluntary reduction of water shall be widely
distributed to water users to assure public knowledge of the request. Local
radio and television stations, as well as newspapers, shall be asked to run
periodic announcements of the request. Leaflets could also be distributed
either house to house, or to banks, stores, supermarkets and public buildings.
   (B)   Second level of concern.
      (1)   Regulation of sprinkling and watering. No person or customer shall
sprinkle, water or irrigate any shrubbery, trees, lawns, grass, ground covers,
plants, vines, gardens, vegetables, flowers or any other vegetation, except as
follows:

even numbered addressed residences, commercial or industrial establishments on
even-numbered days of the calendar; and
         (b)   Such irrigation, sprinkling and watering shall be permitted by
odd numbered addressed residences, commercial or industrial establishments on

or structure;
         (c)   The use of water to fill, refill or add to any indoor or outdoor
swimming pools or Jacuzzi pools, except for neighborhood fire control, where
the pools have recycling water systems and evaporative covers, or where the use
of the pool is required by a medical doctor’s prescription. Publicly-owned/
operated pools may be excepted at discretion of the city; and
         (d)   The use of water in a fountain or pond for aesthetic or scenic
purposes, except where necessary to support fish life.
      (3)   Non-essential commercial or industrial use. The following
commercial or industrial water uses are hereby determined to be non-essential
and are prohibited:
         (a)   The use of water to serve a customer in a restaurant unless
requested by the customer;

         (e)   The use of water for dust control.
      (4)   Gutter flooding. No person or customer shall cause or permit water
from the municipal source to run to waste in any gutter or drain.
      (5)   Regulation of application for new water service. No applications
for new, additional, further expanded or increase-in-size water service
connections, meter, service lines, pipeline extensions, mains of other water
service facilities of any kind shall be allowed, approved or installed during
the state of emergency.
      (6)   Discontinuance of service.
         (a)   The city may, after one warning by certified mail or in person
by staff, disconnect the water service of any person or customer whenever it is
determined that such person or customer has failed to comply with any
provisions of this policy, program and regulations for emergency water use
curtailment. Service so disconnected shall be restored only upon payment of a
turn-on fee as established by a resolution of the City Council, or as otherwise
specified by law, and any other costs incurred by the city in the
discontinuance of service and the giving of suitable assurances to the city
that the action causing the discontinuance will not be repeated.
         (b)   In addition to the foregoing, the city may, prior to restoration
of service, install a flow-restrictive device on the customer’s service.
   (C)   Third level of concern.
      (1)   Prohibition on sprinkling and watering. No person or customer shall
sprinkle, water or irrigate any shrubbery, trees, lawns, grass, ground covers,
plants, vines, gardens, vegetables, flowers or any other vegetation.
      (2)   Non-compliance. In the event of non-compliance with the
aforementioned policies, the city may enact a resolution requiring mandatory
reduction of water usage. Such resolution shall generally provide:
         (a)   For residential customers, the resolution shall set a maximum
daily allotment for the amount of water used per resident. If a residence uses
more than its allotted number of gallons per day, the resident shall have water
service disconnected or be fined;
         (b)   An allotment for non-residential water users shall be set at 75%
of the water used during the same time period of the previous year. If customer
history is not available, a maximum use rate will be set for the new customer;
and
         (c)   Along with the implementation of such a resolution, the city
shall make available to the water users recommendations for water conservation
and information on water conservation kits to help reduce the amount of water
used.
      (3)   Variances.
         (a)   The city may, by resolution, grant temporary variances for
prospective uses of water otherwise prohibited after determining that unusual
circumstances or failure to grant such variances would cause an emergency
condition affecting health, sanitation or fire protection of the applicant or
the public.
         (b)   The city may ratify or revoke any such variance or adjustment at
any duly called meeting. Any such variance or adjustment so ratified, may be
rescinded by later action of the city.
         (c)   No such variance shall be retroactive or otherwise justify any
violation of the curtailment policy or program occurring prior to issuance of
said variance.

The interest shall begin to run from the date of entry of the lien in the lien
docket.

that a nuisance exists, will relieve the person responsible from the imposition
of a fine under division (B)(1) above.

      (3)   In addition to all other provisions of §§
92.01 through

shall be required to appear in the Municipal Court on the date and at the time
and place indicated thereon. At the time of appearance in the Municipal Court,
a complaint shall be served upon the individual to whom the citation has been
issued. The penalties set forth in division (B)(1) above shall apply to
nuisances determined to exist by the Chief of Police for which the person
charged is found guilty.

§ 155.028 TRAFFIC IMPACT STUDY.
   (A)   The purpose of this section is to assist in determining compliance
with § 660-012-0045(2) of the state’s Transportation Planning Rule that
requires the city to identify potential traffic impacts and apply conditions to
development proposals to minimize certain impacts and protect transportation
facilities.
   (B)   This chapter establishes the standards for when a proposal must be
reviewed for potential traffic impacts, when a traffic impact study must be
submitted with a development application in order to determine whether
conditions are needed to minimize impacts to and protect transportation
facilities, what must be in a traffic impact study and who is qualified to
prepare the study.
      (1)   When a traffic impact study is required. The city or other
authority with jurisdiction over an affected roadway may require a traffic
impact study (TIS) as part of an application for development, a change in use
or a change in access. A TIS may shall be required when a land use application
involves one or more of the following actions:
         (a)   A change in zoning or a plan amendment designation;
         (b)   Any proposed development that the road authority determines will
have adverse operational or public safety impacts to the facility;
         (c)   An increase in site traffic volume generation by 300 average
daily trips (ADT) or more;
         (d)   An increase in site traffic volume of a particular movement to
and from the state highway by 20% or more;
         (e)   An increase in use of adjacent streets by vehicles exceeding the
20,000 pound gross vehicle weights by ten vehicles or more per day;
         (f)   The location of an access driveway does not meet minimum sight
distance requirements, or is located where vehicles entering or leaving the
property are restricted, or vehicles leaving or entering the property will
queue or hesitate on the state highway, creating a safety hazard; or
         (g)   A change in internal traffic patterns that may cause safety
problems, such as back up onto a street or greater potential for traffic
accidents.
      (2)   Traffic impact study preparation. A traffic impact study shall be
prepared by a professional engineer in accordance with the requirements of the
road authority. If the road authority is the state’s Department of
Transportation (ODOT), consult ODOT’s regional development review planner and
OAR Chapter 731, Division 15.
      (3)   City street improvement requirements. In addition to street
improvement requirements in this code for new development, see §§
155.625 through

DESIGN REVIEW
§ 155.045 PURPOSE.
   (A)    The purpose of design review approval is to ensure compliance with
the objectives and provisions of this chapter and the Comprehensive Plan; to
mitigate the impacts where development may cause a conflict between uses in the
same or adjoining zones, to reduce and eliminate unsightly, unhealthful or
unsafe conditions, which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
   (B)   This subchapter is designed to address the location and design of a
use that is allowed within the zone. In considering the design review
requirements, the city shall take into account the impact of the proposed
development on nearby properties, the capacity and circulation of the street
system, the capacity of the utility and service systems, and the appearance of
the street and the community.
(Prior Code, §16.175.000) (Ord. 445, passed 5-15-2017; Ord. 450, passed 12-18-
2017; Ord. 451, passed 6-4-2018; Ord. 477, passed 2-22-2022)
§ 155.046 DESIGN REVIEW APPROVAL REQUIREMENTS.
    A building, grading, parking, or development permit, as specified in this
chapter shall not be issued for a use subject to this section, nor shall such
uses be commenced, enlarged, altered, changed or moved until a design review
application is approved by the city.
(Prior Code, §16.175.005) (Ord. 445, passed 5-15-2017; Ord. 450, passed 12-18-

§ 155.047 DESIGN REVIEW APPROVAL PROCEDURES.
    Design review is required for all new developments and modifications of
existing developments described below. Regular maintenance, repair and
replacement of existing materials (such as roof, siding, awnings, and the
like), parking resurfacing and similar maintenance and repair shall be exempt
from review.
   (A)   Limited land use design review - Type II.
      (1)   A Type II land use design review application is conducted by the
city without a public hearing and in accordance with this chapter. This
procedure shall be used when the city finds that the applicable standards are
primarily clear and objective but may require a limited exercise of discretion.
This procedure is for changes in land use and developments that do not require
a conditional use permit or comprehensive design review approval. A limited
land use review ensures compliance with the basic land use and development
standards of the land use district, such as lot area, building setbacks, and
orientation, lot coverage, building height, landscaping, parking and other
development standards.
      (2)   A limited land use review is required for the types of changes in
land use and development proposals listed below. Land uses and development
exceeding the thresholds below require a Type III design review application.
         (a)   A change in occupancy from one type of land use to a different
land use;
         (b)   A development proposal that increases lot coverage by no more
than 10%;
         (c)   Non-residential building additions up to 500 square feet or 20%
of an existing structure, whichever is greater;
         (d)   Minor modifications to development approvals that require one or
more discretionary approval standards;
         (e)   Minor alterations to a development that has a valid conditional
use permit that require one or more discretionary approval standards, and as
determined by §§
155.070 through
155.077 of this chapter;
         (f)   Non-residential accessory structures and accessory parking; and
         (g)   Having a condition for major public improvements where a
specific plan was not considered (such as transportation facilities and
improvements, parks, trails and similar improvements as determined by the
city).
      (3)   A Type II limited land use design review shall be conducted prior
to issuance of building permits, occupancy permit, business license or public
improvement permits as determined by the city and an application shall be
approved only upon meeting all of the following criteria:
         (a)   The proposed land use or development is permitted by and meets
the intent of the underlying land use district and all other applicable
sections of this chapter;
         (b)   The proposed land use or development meets all applicable
criteria of Clean Water Services, Tualatin Valley Fire & Rescue, Washington
County and any other entity with jurisdiction over the property or the roadway
adjacent to the property; and
         (c)   The off-street vehicle parking, bicycle parking and loading
areas for the use meet the requirements of §§
155.670 through
155.676.
   (B)   Type III design review. Type III design review applications are
reviewed by the Planning Commission including a public hearing in accordance
with this chapter. It applies to all development in the city, except those
specifically listed or similar to those under division (A) above and the
standards of this chapter.

authorized as a limited land use (Type I) permit pursuant to §
155.092 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 16.210.005) (Ord. 451, passed 6-4-2018; Ord. 468, passed 5-4-
2020)
§ 155.092 TYPES, REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES FOR TEMPORARY USES.
   (A)   Temporary uses are characterized by their short-term or seasonal
nature and by the fact that permanent improvements are not made to the site.
Temporary uses include, but are not limited to: construction trailers; leasing
offices; temporary carnivals and fairs; parking lot sales; retail warehouse
sales; and seasonal sales, such as Christmas tree sales and vegetable stands.
   (B)   Four types of temporary uses require permit approval. (See divisions

necessary for it to comply with all applicable development standards upon final
plat approval;
         (i)   Each model home must be located and constructed on a separate
preliminary lot intended for a dwelling unit as shown on the preliminary plat
and in conformance with all applicable development standards, including but not
limited to: setbacks, lot coverage, height, facade design, and access. The lot
on which the model home is located is not a final approved lot for any purpose.
A model home approval is not the basis for an adjustment, variance, vested
right or nonconforming use;
         (j)   Security in a form and amount acceptable to the city is provided
for construction of all public utilities as identified on the approved public
improvement plans;
         (k)   The total number of model homes:

remove any structure that has been declared a nuisance pursuant to
Ch. 92 of this code;
         (n)   If final plat approval is not obtained prior to the expiration
of the preliminary plat approval, each model home must be removed and the
property restored and made safe by the applicant or owner. This must occur no
later than 60 days after the expiration of the preliminary plat approval;
         (o)   A model home not removed in compliance with subdivision (B)(4)
(n) of this section shall be declared a nuisance. The city will enter the
property and abate the nuisance by taking such actions as are necessary to
demolish and remove the structure in compliance with the owner authorization
and performance bond required in subdivision (B)(4)(m) of this section; and
         (p)   The standards put forth in subdivisions (B)(4)(n) and (B)(4)(o)
of this section do not apply to an otherwise lawful dwelling unit or units on a
legal lot of record.

VARIANCES
§ 155.105 PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   The purpose of a variance is to provide relief when a strict application of
the zoning requirements of lot width, lot depth, building height, setback,
access or other dimensional or site requirements would impose practical
difficulties. These difficulties may result from geographic, topographic or
other physical conditions on the site or in the immediate vicinity. No variance
shall be granted which allows the establishment or expansion of use otherwise
prohibited or subject to conditional use procedures.

§ 155.127 REVIEW CRITERIA.
   (A)   Text amendment. An amendment to the text of the Comprehensive Plan or
this chapter shall be based upon a need for such an amendment identified by the
City Council or the Planning Commission. Such an amendment shall be consistent
with the following review criteria:
      (1)   Impact of the proposed amendment on land use and development
patterns within the city, as measured by:
         (a)   Traffic generation and circulation patterns in compliance with
the Transportation System Plan (TSP);
         (b)   Demand for public facilities and services, in compliance with
the city utility Master Plans;
         (c)   Level of park and recreation facilities;
         (d)   Economic activities;
         (e)   Protection and use of natural resources; and
         (f)   Compliance of the proposal with existing adopted special purpose
plans or programs, such as public facilities improvements.
      (2)   The proposed amendment complies with all applicable statewide
planning goals and administrative rule requirements;
      (3)   The amendment is appropriate as measured by at least one of the
following criteria:
         (a)   It corrects identified error(s) in the provisions of the plan;
         (b)   It represents a logical implementation of the plan;
         (c)   It is mandated by changes in federal, state or local law; and
         (d)   It is otherwise deemed by the City Council to be desirable,
appropriate and proper.
      (4)   When a development application includes a Comprehensive Plan, Zone
Map or text amendment, the proposal shall be reviewed to determine whether it
significantly affects a transportation facility, in accordance with Oregon
Administrative Rule OAR 660-012-0060, the Transportation Planning Rule.
SIGNIFICANT means the proposal would:
         (a)   Change the functional classification of an existing or planned
transportation facility (exclusive of correction of map errors). This would
occur, for example, when a street classification, requiring traffic to exceed
the levels associated with a “collector” street classification, requiring a
change in the classification to an “arterial” street as identified by the
city’s Transportation System Plan (TSP);
         (b)   Change the standards implementing a functional classification
system;
         (c)   As measured at the end of the planning period identified in the
city’s TSP or Comprehensive Plan;
         (d)   Reduce the performance of an existing or planned transportation
facility below the minimum acceptable performance identified in the city’s TSP
or Comprehensive Plan; or
         (e)   Worsen the performance of an existing or planned transportation
facility that is otherwise projected to perform below the minimum acceptable
performance standard identified in the city’s TSP or Comprehensive Plan.
      (5)   Except as provided in division (A)(6) below, amendments to the
Comprehensive Plan or land use regulations which significantly affect a
transportation facility shall assure that allowed land uses are consistent with
the function, capacity and level or service of the facility identified in the
city’s TSP. This shall be accomplished by one of the following:
         (a)   Adopting measures that demonstrate that allowed land uses are
consistent with the planned function of the transportation facility;
         (b)   Amending the city’s TSP or Comprehensive Plan to provide
transportation facilities, improvements or services adequate to support the
proposed land uses; such amendments shall include a funding plan to ensure the
facility, improvement or service will be provided by the end of the planning
period;
         (c)   Altering land use designations, densities, or design
requirements to reduce demand for automobile travel and meet travel needs
through other modes of transportation;
         (d)   Amending the planned function, capacity or performance standards
of the transportation facility; or
         (e)   Providing other measures as a condition of development or
through a development agreement or similar funding method, specifying when such
measures will be provided.
      (6)   Amendments to the Comprehensive Plan or land use regulation with a
significant effect on a transportation facility, where the facility is already
performing below the minimum acceptable performance standard identified in the
city’s TSP or Comprehensive Plan, may be approved when all of the following
criteria are met:
         (a)   The amendment does not include property located in an
interchange area, as defined under applicable law;
         (b)   The currently planned facilities, improvements or services are
not adequate to achieve the standard;
         (c)   The currently planned facilities, improvements or services at a
minimum mitigate the impacts of the amendment in a manner that avoids further
degradation to the performance of the facility by the time of the development;
and
         (d)   The road authority provides a written statement that the
proposed funding and timing for the proposed development mitigation are
sufficient to avoid degradation to the facility.
   (B)   Map amendment. An amendment to the Comprehensive Plan Map or Official
Zoning Map may be authorized; provided that, the proposal satisfies all
applicable requirements of this chapter; and, provided that, the applicant
demonstrates the following:
      (1)   The proposed amendment is consistent with the goals and policies of
the Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   The purpose statement of the proposed zone can be met and the uses
permitted in the proposed zone can be accommodated on the proposed site without
exceeding its physical capacity. Allowed uses in the proposed zone can be
established in compliance with the development requirements of the code;
      (3)   The proposed amendment is timely, considering the pattern of
development in the area, surrounding land uses, any changes which may have
occurred in the neighborhood or community to warrant the proposed amendment,
and the availability of utilities and services to serve the proposed uses or
other potential uses in the proposed zoning district; and
      (4)   The amendment conforms to the Transportation Planning Rule

back from the front property line (see
Figure 1). On lots with more than one building, this standard applies to the
largest building. On lots with more than one street frontage, this requirement
shall apply to all of the lot’s street frontages. The setback standard may be
increased when a usable public space with pedestrian amenities (such as, extra-
wide sidewalk, plaza, pocket park, outdoor dining area or town square with
seating) is provided between the building and front property line. An exception
to this standard may also be approved through site design review for sites with
multiple, detached buildings, when those buildings are oriented to an internal
“shopping street”.
 
Adjacent to a residentially zoned lot Minimum and maximum setback: 10 feet
Adjacent to any other zone            No minimum required
                                      Maximum setback: 10 feet

may include entrances to individual units, lobby entrances, entrances oriented
to pedestrian plazas, or breeze-way/courtyard entrances (for example, to a
cluster of units or commercial spaces). Alternatively, a building may have its
entrance facing a side yard, plaza, or courtyard when a direct pedestrian
walkway not exceeding 20 feet in length is provided between the building
entrance and the street right-of-way.
      (3)   All primary entrances to a building are connected to the sidewalk
by a direct and continuous walkway.
      (4)   Off-street parking, driveways or other vehicular circulation shall

NC NEIGHBORHOOD COMMUNITY ZONE
§ 155.255 PURPOSE.
    The Neighborhood Community Zone (NC) incorporates a number of design,
development and infrastructure features indicative of a self-reliant
neighborhood, including, but not limited to: quality and craftsmanship in the
built environment; an appropriate mix of architectural styles, residential
types and densities and neighborhood commercial opportunities to serve the
surrounding neighborhood; advantageous and sensitive use of natural resource
features and open space; and innovative and imaginative site planning in order
to develop a sense of place where amenities, facilities, features and overall
urban design could not be achieved through application of individual or a
combination of zones. The NC Zone shall be used to implement the Neighborhood
Community Comprehensive Plan designation. Master planning of the non-exception
expansion areas is necessary to achieve a cohesive vision for the build out of
these areas.
(Prior Code, §16.045.000) (Ord. 430, passed 10-3-2016; Ord. 451, passed 6-4-

§ 155.259 DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)    No development may occur within the NC Zone prior to Master Plan
approval. Master plans in these areas shall include a mix of uses that may
include residential, commercial, institutional and light industrial. The land
use mix shall generally reflect the concept plan adopted when an area is
brought into the urban growth boundary, or as modified through Master Plan
approval. The following standards apply to all development in the NC Zoning
District.
      (1)   Municipal parks shall be provided at a minimum rate of 400 square
feet for every one dwelling unit. In addition, municipal parks shall be
provided at a minimum rate of 5,000 square feet for every one acre of land that
is not designated exclusively residential (such as commercial, industrial,
institutional or mixed-use). Municipal parks are intended for active
recreational use. Wetlands, water quality facilities (swale) and other types of
passive open space may not count toward the minimum municipal park requirement.
The Planning Commission will utilize the Master Plan review process to
determine the location, size and functionality of proposed parks.
      (2)   In order to promote a variety of housing types and efficient land
use, a minimum of 30% of the proposed residential development in a Master Plan
shall be either attached single-family or multi-family housing. If a Master
Plan includes a minimum of 20% of the total proposed housing as multi-family
residential, a 20% increase in density will be permitted to the multi-family
housing proposed.
   (B)   Development within the NC District shall comply with the standards for
lot size and dimensional requirements, lot coverage, building height and
setbacks as contained within Table NC-1: Development Standards, or as modified
and approved during the Master Plan process. Builders and developers are
encouraged to create dwellings that meet contemporary lifestyles.
   (C)   Development within the NC District shall provide off-street vehicular
and bicycle parking per §
155.676 of this chapter, or as modified and approved during the Master Plan
process.
   (D)   In the NC Zoning District, a minimum of two acres shall be reserved
from exclusive residential development so that commercial, institutional and/or
mixed-use development options are available. This reserved area shall be
included in one of the development phases proposed with the Master Plan. If
development has not occurred in this reserved area for a minimum of five years
from the issuance of the final occupancy permit of the final residential unit
in the same development phase as the reserved area, then the applicant may
submit an application for subdivision or design review to the city for
exclusive residential development, with the Planning Commission as the review
and decision authority. The reserved area can be used as temporary open space
in the interim.

§ 155.260 MASTER PLANS; STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
    The following standards and requirements shall govern the application for
Master Plan approval within the NC Zone.
   (A)   The land uses in a Master Plan shall generally reflect the concept
plan adopted when an area is brought into the urban growth boundary, or as
modified through Master Plan approval. Flexibility in arrangement of uses and
densities is permitted provided that the overall Master Plan is in substantial
compliance with the area totals and density ranges as identified in the adopted
Concept Plan.
   (B)   A Master Plan application may address the entirety of any expansion
area individually or may combine expansion areas within the urban growth
boundary (UGB).
   (C)   A phasing plan shall be included with the submitted Master Plan for
any expansion area. The phasing plan shall indicate the acreage of each
proposed phase to be developed, the number of housing units and square footage
of other development projected within the phase and the approximate timing of
the construction of each phase. The phasing plan shall provide a reasonable
sequence of development for the expansion area with regards to the
transportation system, utilities and topography of the area as well as market
conditions and development within the city as a whole. The Planning Commission
shall approve the phasing plan as part of the Master Plan. Revisions to the
phasing plan after Master Plan approval are permitted as reviewed and approved
by the Planning Commission.
   (D)   Master plans shall have public spaces, such as a plaza, park, school
or community square.
   (E)   Garages, carports and accessory structures shall be accessed from the
rear of the building via an alley where appropriate and feasible. If front
access garages are proposed, the applicant must provide justification as to why
rear access garages are not appropriate or feasible. A garage, carport,
accessory dwelling or accessory structure shall not extend beyond the front
building elevation of the principle structure by more than six feet.
   (F)   A minimum of 10% of the single-family detached housing units proposed
with a Master Plan shall be single-level construction, or as modified through
the Master Plan review process.
   (G)   Commercial buildings shall be designed to front on pedestrian-friendly
streets rather than parking lots or arterial roadways.
(Prior Code, §16.045.030) (Ord. 430, passed 10-3-2016; Ord. 451, passed 6-4-
2018; Ord. 467, passed 1-21-2020; Ord. 477, passed 2-22-2022)
§ 155.261 PROCEDURE.
    The following procedure shall be observed when a Master Plan proposal is
submitted for consideration.
   (A)   The applicant shall submit one copy of a Master Plan application with
all exhibits and one electronic copy of all submittal materials to the city for
review. The Master Plan submittal shall include the following information in
graphic and written form:
      (1)   Proposed land uses and housing unit densities;
      (2)   Tables detailing the dimensional, area and setback requirements for
each of the proposed use categories;
      (3)   Proposed access and circulation;
      (4)   Proposed open space uses;
      (5)   Preliminary grading and drainage pattern;
      (6)   Preliminary utility plan for sanitary sewer and water;
      (7)   Relation of the proposed Master Plan to the surrounding area and
the Comprehensive Plan; and
      (8)   Phasing schedule identifying anticipated sequence and timing of
each phase or phases.
   (B)   Public notice of the proposed Master Plan shall be provided in
accordance with the public notice provision of this chapter.
   (C)   In considering the Master Plan, the Commission shall determine
whether:
      (1)   The minimum residential density of the north and east non-exception
expansion areas, as included within the city limits prior to 12-31-2017, shall
be 8.4 units per net acre. The density of the north expansion area is
calculated independently of the east expansion area, and vice versa. If an
applicant is seeking Master Plan approval for either the east or north
expansion area, the applicant must demonstrate that the single Master Plan
achieves a minimum 8.4 residential units per net acre in that entire expansion
area. The residential portion of any mixed-use development shall be included in
the overall density calculation of the expansion area;
      (2)   (a)   In all expansion areas brought into the city limits, the
residential development shall be split as follows, or as modified through
Master Plan approval:
            1.   Single-family detached: 70%; and
            2.   Mix of single-family attached and multi-family: 30%.
         (b) The following deviation to this residential split standard is
permitted to accommodate flexibility in land development:
            1.   A Master Plan proposing 50 or more dwelling units: 2%
deviation; and
            2.   A Master Plan proposing 49 or fewer dwelling units: 10%
deviation.
      (3)   Proposed utility and drainage facilities are adequate for the
population densities and type of development proposed; or
      (4)   The proposed circulation system (including proposed street
sections) is adequate to support the anticipated traffic and the development
will not exceed the adopted functional/performance standard of the streets
outside the boundaries of the Master Plan. No roadway straight line tangent
shall exceed 600 feet in length, except where deemed necessary by the Planning
Commission due to issues such as: topographic constraints; existing developed
conditions; existing property boundaries; or Master Plan design features. Where
such an exception is allowed, roundabouts or curb extensions at intersections
and other traffic-calming measures shall be evaluated.
   (D)   If the Planning Commission finds that the provisions of §§
155.610 through
155.614 of this chapter are satisfied, the proposal shall be approved. If the
Commission finds the provisions are not satisfied, it may deny the application
or return the plan to the applicant for revision. In addition to the
requirements of this section, the Commission may attach conditions it finds are
necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.
   (E)   Applications for individual phases within the Master Plan, such as
subdivision or design review applications, may be applied for concurrently with
or subsequent to Master Plan approval. If applications for individual phases
are applied for concurrently with the Master Plan, the applicant shall extend,
in writing, the state-mandated 120-day review period by 30 days for the
individual phase application. The Planning Commission will review the Master
Plan first and will review the individual phase application at a subsequent
Planning Commission meeting. If the Planning Commission requires a second
meeting to complete review of the Master Plan, the applicant agrees to an
additional 30-day extension to the review period. Applications for individual
phases within the Master Plan shall be reviewed under the provisions and
requirements of this chapter.
   (F)   In the process of reviewing applications for individual phases within
an approved Master Plan, the Commission may approve the refinements to the
Master Plan. Refinements to the Master Plan are defined as:
      (1)   Changes to the street network or functional classification of
streets that do not significantly reduce circulation system function or
connectivity for vehicles, bicycles or pedestrians;
      (2)   Changes to the nature or location of park type, trails or open
space that do not significantly reduce land area, function, livability,
usability, connectivity or overall distribution or availability of these uses
in the Master Plan area; and
      (3)   Changes to the location or mix of land uses or configuration of
individual lots or site plan elements, that do not significantly alter the
overall distribution or availability of uses or density in the Master Plan
area.
   (G)   (1)   Refinements meeting the above definition may be approved by the
Commission upon finding that:
         (a)   The refinement(s) will equally or better meet the conditions of
the approved Master Plan; and
         (b)   The refinement will not preclude an adjoining phase from
development consistent with the approved Master Plan.
      (2)   Significant changes to an approved Master Plan shall be submitted
to the Planning Commission for processing as an amendment to an approved Master
Plan. Significant changes would be defined as any change not covered by
divisions (F)(1) through (F)(3) above.

§ 155.331 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACTIVE FLOODPLAIN. The identified area of special flood hazard, but
excluding the watercourse or channel of any river, creek or tributary to the
bank full stage.
   APPEAL. A request for a review of the Planning Commission’s interpretation
of any provision of this subchapter or a request for a variance.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. Area designated AO or AH on the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly
defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and
indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. AO is characterized as sheet
flow and AH indicates ponding.
   AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The land in the floodplain within a community
subject to a 1% or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may
be designated as Zone A on the FHBM. After detailed ratemaking has been
completed in preparation for publication of the flood insurance rate map, Zone
A usually is refined into Zones A, AO, AH, A1-30, AE, A99, AR, A, VO or V1-30,
VE or V. For purposes of these regulations, the term SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA
is synonymous in meaning with the phrase AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   BANK FULL STAGE. The point at which the flow in the creek channel reaches
the maximum height of the watercourse channel, just before flooding into the
active floodplain.
   BASE FLOOD. The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
   BASEMENT. Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground
level) on all sides.
   CRITICAL FACILITY. A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. CRITICAL FACILITIES include, but are not limited to
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or
hazardous waste.
   DEVELOPMENT. Any human-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, fencing, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials located on a property with area within the
area of special flood hazard.
   ELEVATED BUILDING. For insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has
its lowest elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear
walls, post, piers, pilings or columns.
   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
the site which existed before the effective date of the adopted floodplain
management regulations.
   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing
the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
   FLOOD or FLOODING.
      (1)   A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation
of normally dry land areas from:
         (a)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
         (b)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source; and
         (c)   Mudslides (such as, mudflows) which are proximately caused by
flooding as defined in division (1)(b) above and are akin to a river of liquid
and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is
carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current.
      (2)   The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or
other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or
currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by
an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a
severe storm or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash flood or an
abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding as defined in division (1)(a) above.
   FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM). Initial flood hazard identification
generally used for emergency program communities.
   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM). The official map of a community on which
the Flood Insurance Administrator has delineated both the special hazard areas
and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. A FIRM that has been
made available digitally is called a Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM).
   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY. The official report provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Boundary-Floodway Map
and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
   FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR. The Public Works Director or his or her designee

basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement area is not considered a building’s LOWEST FLOOR; provided that, such
enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the
applicable non-elevation design requirements of §
155.346 of this chapter.
   MANUFACTURED HOME. A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which
is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term

on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by
the city and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of adopted floodplain management regulations.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light

      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. Includes substantial improvement, and means the date
the building permit was issued; provided, the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition placement or other improvement
was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual START means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or
other improvements of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of
the market value of the structure before the “start of construction” of the
improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred “substantial
damage”, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not,
however, include either:
      (1)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or
      (2)   Any alteration of a “historic structure”; provided that, the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure”.
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief from the requirements of this subchapter which
permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by the
section.
   WATERCOURSE. The channel and banks of an identifiable river, stream or
tributary, and not the adjoining floodplain areas. The flood-carrying capacity
of a watercourse refers to the flood-carrying capacity of the channel (except
in the case of alluvial fans, where a channel is not typically defined).

§ 155.333 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (A)   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance
Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood
Insurance Study (FIS) for Washington County and Incorporated Areas”, dated 10-
19-2018, with accompanying Flood Insurance Maps are hereby adopted by reference
and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study is on file
at the City Hall and can also be obtained through the county. The city shall
utilize all authoritative information available in determining the location of
special flood hazard areas.
   (B)   In areas where a regulatory floodway has not been designated, no new
construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill)
shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the community’s FIRM, unless it
is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase
the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point
within the community.
(Prior Code, § 16.065.010) (Ord. 432, passed 10-17-2016; Ord. 445, passed 5-15-

reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by human-made or natural causes. This subchapter does
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This
subchapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, any officer or
employee thereof or the Federal Insurance Administration for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this subchapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.

      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure.
      (2)   All manufactured homes must likewise be anchored to prevent
flotation, collapse or lateral movement, and shall be installed using methods
and practices that minimize flood damage. Anchoring methods may include, but
are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors.
(Reference FEMA’s Manufactured Home Installation in Flood Hazard Areas
guidebook for additional techniques.)
   (B)   Construction materials and methods.
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
      (2)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage.
      (3)   Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or otherwise
elevated or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
components during conditions of flooding.
   (C)   Utilities.
      (1)   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the system.
      (2)   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters.
      (3)   On-site disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding consistent with the state’s
Department of Environmental Quality.
   (D)   Subdivision proposals.
      (1)   A floodplain development permit must be approved PRIOR to approval
of a subdivision preliminary plat on the same property. In most cases, this
will require two separate hearings before the Planning Commission.
      (2)   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage.
      (3)   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage.
      (4)   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage.
      (5)   Base flood elevation (BFE) data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development which contain at least 50 lots or five
acres, whichever is less.
   (E)   Review of building permits. Where elevation data is not available,
either through the Flood Insurance Study or from another authoritative source,
applications for building permits shall be reviewed to assure that proposed
construction will be reasonably safe from flooding. The test of reasonableness
is a local judgment and includes use of historical data, high water marks,
photographs of past flooding and the like, where available. The city has been
notified that failure to elevate at least two feet above grade in these zones
may result in higher insurance rates.

§ 155.346 SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevations data has
been provided as set forth in this subchapter, the following provisions are
required.
   (A)   All development. All development within the boundaries of the 100-year
floodplain shall conform to the following cut and fill standards.
      (1)   No net fill in the floodplain is allowed. All fill placed in a
floodplain shall be balanced within at least an equal amount of soil material
removal.
      (2)   Excavation areas shall not exceed fill areas by more than 50% of
the area.
      (3)   Any excavation below the bank full stage of Ghost Creek or McKay
Creek shall not compensate for fill.
      (4)   Excavation to balance a fill shall be located on the same parcel as
the fill unless it is not reasonable or practicable to do so. In such cases,
the excavation shall be located in the same drainage basin and as close as
possible to the fill site, so long as the proposed excavation and fill in the
Floodplain Overlay District and to minimize erosive velocities. Stream
crossings shall be as close to perpendicular to stream flow as practicable.
Bridges shall be used instead of culverts wherever practicable.
   (B)   Residential construction.
      (1)   New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot
above base flood elevations.
      (2)   Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to
flooding are prohibited, or shall be designed to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit
of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified
by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria.
         (a)   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less

         (d)   The ground surface inside enclosed areas shall be graded in such
a way that water will drain and pooling of water will not occur.
   (C)   Non-residential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to one foot
above the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and
sanitary facilities, shall:
      (1)   Be flood-proofed so that below the base flood level the structure
is water-tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
      (2)   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
      (3)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction in accordance with accepted
standards of this division (C) based on their development and/or review of the
structural design, specifications and plans. Such certifications shall be
provided to the official as set forth in §
155.339(B) of this chapter.
      (4)   Non-residential structures that are elevated, not flood-proofed,
must meet the same standards for space below the lowest floor as described in
division (A) above.
      (5)   Applicants flood-proofing non-residential buildings shall be
notified that flood insurance premiums will be based on rates that are one foot

above BFE.
   (E)   Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§
155.332 of this chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway
is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry
debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions
apply, these provisions apply to all floodways:
      (1)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements and other development in the floodway (as defined by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency) unless certification by registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge;
      (2)   If division (D)(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of division (E)(1) above;
      (3)   Prohibit the placement of any mobile homes, except in an existing
mobile home park or existing mobile home subdivision; and
      (4)   The placement of mobile homes in existing mobile home parks and
subdivisions will comply with divisions (D)(1) through (D)(4) above.
   (F)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall be prohibited from
locating in flood hazard areas.
   (G)   Critical facilities. Construction of new critical facilities shall be,
to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the special flood hazard
area (SFHA) (100-year floodplain). Construction of new critical facilities
shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is
available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the
lowest floor elevated three feet above BFE or to the height of the 500-year
flood, whichever is higher. Access to and from the critical facility should
also be protected to the height utilized above. Flood-proofing and sealing
measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by
or released into flood waters. Access routes elevated to or above the level of
the base flood elevation shall be provided to all critical facilities to the
extent possible.

2017; Ord. 454, passed 10-1-2018)
§ 155.347 VARIANCE AND APPEAL PROCEDURE.
   All variance requests are processed by the city according to the
specifications set forth below.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall hear and decide requests for variances
from the requirements of this subchapter.
   (B)   The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged
there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by the
Planning Commission in the enforcement or administration of this subchapter.
   (C)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Planning Commission who have
standing in the land use procedure may appeal such decision to the City
Council.
   (D)   (1)   Generally, the only condition under which a variance from the
elevation standard may be issued is for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous
to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing divisions (E)(1) through (E)(11) below have been fully
considered.
      (2)   As the lot size increases, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
   (E)   In reviewing and application for variance to the floodplain standards,
the Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant
factors, standards specified in other sections of this subchapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (6)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and
floodplain management program for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the Statewide Inventory of Historic Properties, without regard to the
procedures set forth in this section.
   (G)   Variances shall not be issued within a designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (H)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (I)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (J)   (1)   Variances as interpreted in the National Flood Insurance Program
are based on the general zoning law principle that they pertain to a physical
piece or property; they are not personal in nature and do not pertain to the
structure, its inhabitants, economic or financial circumstances.
      (2)   They primarily address small lots in densely populated residential
neighborhoods.
      (3)   As such, variances from the flood elevations should be quite rare.
   (K)   Variances may be issued for non-residential buildings in very limited
circumstances to allow a lesser degree of flood-proofing than water-tight or
dry-flood-proofing, where it can be determined that such action will have low
damage potential, complies with all other variance criteria, except division
(D) above and otherwise complies with §
155.345 of this chapter.
   (L)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (M)   Upon consideration of the factors of division (E) above and the
purposes of this subchapter, the Planning Commission may attach such conditions
to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this subchapter.
   (N)   The local Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration
upon request.

reference for identifying areas subject to the provisions of this subchapter.
   (B)   An applicant with any parcel designated as having a significant
natural resource on any portion of the tax lot(s) is required to:
      (1)   Delineate wetland boundaries using the methods described in the
current edition of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Wetland Delineation
Manual;
      (2)   Provide the city with a delineation of the significant natural
resources on the subject property as part of their application. An application
shall not be complete until this delineation is submitted to the city; and
      (3)   Obtain concurrence of the wetland delineation from the state’s
Division of State Lands.
(Prior Code, § 16.75.010)
§ 155.387 DEVELOPMENT PERMIT REQUIRED.
   A development permit, pursuant to §§
155.025 through
155.033 of this chapter, shall be obtained before construction or development.
The permit shall be required for all structures including manufactured homes,
as set forth in §
155.012 of this chapter, and for all other development including fill and other
activities, also as set forth in §
155.012 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 16.75.010)
§ 155.388 GENERAL DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   (A)   The permanent alteration of the significant natural resource by
grading, by excavation or fill, by the placement of structures or impervious
surfaces, or by the removal of native vegetation is prohibited, except for the
following uses provided they are designed to minimize intrusion into the
significant natural resource, and no other options or locations are feasible:
      (1)   Public or private streets, driveways or paths may be placed within
a significant natural resource to access development activities if it is shown
to the satisfaction of the reviewing authority that no other practicable method
of access exists. If allowed, the applicant shall comply with the following
requirements:
         (a)   Demonstrate to the reviewing authority that no other practicable
access to the buildable area exists or access from an off-site location through
the use of easements is not possible;
         (b)   Design roads, driveways and paths to be the minimum width
necessary and for the minimum intrusion into the significant natural resource
while also allowing for safe passage of vehicles and/or pedestrians;
         (c)   Use bridges, arched culverts or box culverts with a natural
bottom for crossing of a significant natural resource if the crossing is found
unavoidable. The lower lip of any culvert must meet the channel bed at or below
grade. The number of channel crossings shall be minimized through use of shared
access for abutting lots and access through easements for adjacent lots;
         (d)   Consider the need for future extensions of shared access, access
easements or private streets to access potential new building sites at the time
of this application in order to avoid subsequent encroachments into the
significant natural resource;
         (e)   Prior to construction, the significant natural resource area
shall be flagged, fenced or otherwise marked and shall remain undisturbed,
except as allowed by the provisions of this subchapter. Such markings shall be
maintained until construction is complete;
         (f)   During construction, no stockpiling of fill materials, parking
or storage of equipment shall be allowed within the significant natural
resource;
         (g)   Erosion control measures, such as silt fences and bio-filter
bags, shall be used to reduce the likelihood of sediment and untreated storm
water entering the significant natural resource; and
         (h)   Permanent alteration of the significant natural resource by the
placement of public or private streets, driveways or paths is subject to the
mitigation requirements hereof.
      (2)   Public and private utilities or drainage facilities may be placed
within a significant natural resource when it is shown to the satisfaction of
the review body that no other practicable alternative location exists. If a
utility or drainage facility is allowed within a significant natural resource,
the following standards shall apply:
         (a)   Demonstrate to the reviewing authority that no other practicable
access exists or access from an off-site location through the use of easements
is not possible;
         (b)   The corridor necessary to construct utilities shall be the
minimum width practical so as to minimize intrusion into the significant
natural resource. Removal of trees and native vegetation shall be avoided
unless absolutely necessary. The existing grade of the land shall be restored
after construction. Native vegetation shall be used to restore the vegetative
character of the construction corridor;
         (c)   Prior to construction, the significant natural resource area
shall be flagged, fenced or otherwise marked and shall remain undisturbed,
except as allowed by the provisions of this subchapter. Such markings shall be
maintained until construction is complete;
         (d)   During construction, no stockpiling of fill materials, parking
or storage of equipment shall be allowed within the significant natural
resource; and
         (e)   Erosion control measures, such as silt fences and bio-filter
bags, shall be used to reduce the likelihood of sediment and untreated storm
water entering the significant natural resource.
      (3)   Replacement of existing structures with structures in the same
location that do not disturb additional surface area;
      (4)   Structures or other non-conforming alterations existing fully or
partially within the significant natural resource may be expanded; provided,
the expansion occurs outside of the significant natural resource. Substantial
improvement of a non-conforming structure in the significant natural resource
shall require compliance with the standards of this subchapter;
      (5)   Existing lawn within the significant natural resource may be
maintained, but not expanded within the limits of the significant natural
resource. Development activities shall not justify replacement of native
vegetation, especially native riparian vegetation, with lawn;
      (6)   Existing bank stabilization and flood control structures may be
maintained. Any expansion of existing structures or development of new
structures shall be evaluated by the Planning Department and appropriate state
or federal natural resource agency. Such alteration of significant natural
resources shall be approved only if less-invasive or non-structural methods,
such as bioengineering, will not adequately meet stabilization or flood control
needs; and
      (7)   The types, sizes and intensities of lights must be placed so that
they do not shine directly into the significant natural resource.
   (B)   Removal of vegetation from the significant natural resource is
prohibited, except for:
      (1)   Removal of non-native vegetation and replacement with native plant
species. The replacement vegetation shall cover, at a minimum, the area from
which vegetation was removed, shall maintain or exceed the density of the
removed vegetation, and shall maintain or improve the shade provided by the
vegetation;
      (2)   Removal of vegetation necessary for the continued maintenance of
dikes, drainage ditches, or other storm water or flood control facilities.
Vegetation removal shall be kept to the minimum necessary;
      (3)   Trees in danger of falling and thereby posing a hazard to life or
property may be removed, following consultation from a certified arborist and
approval from the Planning Department. If no hazard will be created, the
Department may require these trees, if felled, to be left in place in the
significant natural resource; and
      (4)   The control or removal of nuisance plants should primarily be by
mechanical means (such as, hand-pulling). If mechanical means fail to
adequately control nuisance plant populations, a glyphosate-based herbicide is
the only type of herbicide that can be used in a significant natural resource
area. No pre-emergent herbicides or auxin herbicides that pose a risk of
contaminating water should be used. A herbicide application is preferred to be
made early in the morning or during windless periods at least four hours before
probable rainfall.
(Prior Code, § 16.75.015)
§ 155.389 NATURAL RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT AND RESTORATION.
   The city strongly encourages the enhancement or restoration of natural
resources, such as riparian corridors along the unnamed tributary of McKay
Creek and McKay Creek, in-channel habitat improvements, non-native plant
control and similar projects which propose to improve the quality of a
significant natural resource. However, no enhancement activity requiring the
excavation or filling of material in a wetland shall be allowed unless all
applicable state and federal wetland permits have been granted.
(Prior Code, § 16.75.020)
§ 155.390 VARIANCES TO SUBCHAPTER.
   (A)   A variance to the provisions of this subchapter is permitted only as a
last resort and is only considered necessary to allow reasonable economic use
of the subject property, pursuant to §§
155.105 through
155.110 of this chapter. The property must be owned by the applicant and not
created after the effective date of this subchapter.
   (B)   Approval of a variance is based on meeting the requirements of both
divisions (B)(1) and (B)(2) below.
      (1)   A variance shall only apply to:
         (a)   Lots on which the location of a significant natural resource
results in a building area depth for a single-family dwelling of 25 feet or
less or a building envelope of 800 square feet or less; and
         (b)   Lots where strict adherence to the standards and conditions of
this subchapter would effectively preclude a use of the parcel that could be
reasonably expected to occur in the zone, and that the property owner would be
precluded a substantial property right enjoyed by the majority of landowners in
the vicinity.
      (2)   Permanent alteration of the significant natural resources by an
action requiring a variance is subject to the procedures and criteria of §
155.391 of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 16.75.025)
§ 155.391 MITIGATION STANDARDS.
   (A)   When approved impacts to any identified significant natural resource
occurs, mitigation will be required. For impacts to significant wetlands, the
standards and criteria of this section shall apply.
   (B)   For impacts to riparian corridors, the standards and criteria of this
section shall apply.
      (1)   When mitigation for impacts to a significant wetland is proposed,
the mitigation plan shall comply with all State Division of State Lands and
U.S. Army Corps of Engineers wetland regulations. The city may approve a
development, but shall not issue a building permit until all applicable state
and federal wetland permit approvals have been granted and copies of those
approvals have been submitted to the city.
      (2)   When mitigation for impacts to a non-wetland riparian area is
proposed, a mitigation plan prepared by a qualified professional shall be
submitted to the review authority. The mitigation plan shall meet the following
criteria:
         (a)   Mitigation for negative impacts to a riparian corridor shall
follow all of the requirements of Clean Water Services - Design and
Construction Standards - Resolution and Order 00-7;
         (b)   Mitigation shall occur on-site and as close to the impact area
as possible. If this is not feasible, mitigation shall occur within the same
drainage basin as the impact; and
         (c)   All vegetation planted within the mitigation area shall be
native to the region. Species to be planted in the mitigation area shall
replace those impacted by the development activity.
(Prior Code, § 16.75.030)

announce, direct attention to or advertise; and is visible from any public
right-of-way.
   SIGN AREA. The entire area made available by the sign struct ure for the
purpo se of displa ying the messa ge. For painte d signs, only that portio n of
the door, wall or struct ure actuall y devoted to the message and associated
symbols and background, if any, is included in the area. The sign area as
defined shall be used in determining the allowable square footage of signs. For
double-faced signs, only one side of the sign shall be counted in the total
maximum area. Where a sign is of a three dimensional or round or irregular
solid shape, the largest cross section shall be used as though it were a flat
surface to determine sign area. The address of the site on which the sign sits
does not count toward the sign area.

155.431 of this chapter are allowed by right; provided, the owner has a current
business license and all other uses and structures on the subject property are
in conformance with the applicable zoning; and
      (2)   Home occupations exceeding any of the threshold standards in §
155.431 of this chapter may receive approval through the conditional use home
occupation procedure under §§
155.070 through
155.077 of this chapter and must obtain an applicable city business license.
(Prior Code, § 16.085.000) (Ord. 445, passed 5-15-2017)
§ 155.431 ADMINISTRATIVE HOME OCCUPATION STANDARDS.
   (A)   Appearance of residence.
      (1)   The home occupation shall be restricted to lawfully-built enclosed
structures and be conducted in such a manner as not to give an outward
appearance of a business and may not exceed 25% of the floor area of the
dwelling; or occupy no more than 500 square feet of a garage, either attached
or detached; or occupy no more than 500 square feet of any other outbuilding.
      (2)   The home occupation shall not eliminate any required off-street
parking spaces for the dwelling.
      (3)   The home occupation shall not result in any structural alterations
or additions to a structure that will change its primary use or building code
occupancy classification.
      (4)   The home occupation shall not violate any conditions of development
approval (such as, prior development permit approval).
      (5)   No products and or equipment produced or used by the home
occupation may be displayed to be visible from outside any structure.
   (B)   Storage.
      (1)   Outside storage, visible from the public right-of-way or adjacent
properties that exceed what is customary for a single-family residence in the

noxious, combustible or flammable) beyond those normally incidental to
residential use is prohibited.
      (3)   Storage of inventory or products and all other equipment, fixtures
and activities associated with the home occupation shall be allowed in any
structure.
   (C)   Employees.
      (1)   Other than family members residing within the dwelling located on
the home occupation site, there shall be not more than one full-time equivalent
employee at the home occupation site at any given time. As used in this
subchapter, the term HOME OCCUPATION SITE means the legal lot on which the home
occupation is conducted.
      (2)   Additional individuals may be employed by or associated with the
home occupation, so long as they do not report to work or pick up/deliver at
the home occupation site.
      (3)   The home occupation site shall not be used as a headquarters for
the assembly of employees for instruction or other purposes, including dispatch
of employees to other locations.
   (D)   Advertising and signs. Signs shall comply with all applicable sign
regulations.
   (E)   Vehicles, parking and traffic.
      (1)   One commercially-licensed vehicle associated with the home

or from the home occupation site daily. There shall be no commercial vehicle
deliveries during the hours of 5:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m.
      (3)   There shall be no more than one client’s or customer’s vehicle at
any one time and no more than eight per day at the home occupation site.
   (F)   Business hours. There shall be no restriction on business hours;
except that, clients or customers are permitted at the home occupation from 8:
00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m. only, Monday through Saturday, subject to divisions (A)
and (E) above.
   (G)   Prohibited home occupation uses.
      (1)   Any activity that produces radio, television or other electronic
interference; noise, glare, vibration, smoke or odor beyond allowable levels as
determined by local, state or federal standards, or that can be detected beyond
the property line; is prohibited.
      (2)   Any activity involving on-site retail sales, including garage sales
exceeding the thresholds of a temporary use, is prohibited; except that, the
sale of items that are incidental to a permitted home occupation is allowed.
For example, the sale of lesson books or sheet music from music teachers, art
or craft supplies from arts or crafts instructors, computer software from
computer consultants and similar incidental items for sale by home business is
allowed subject to divisions (A) through (F) above.

ensure compliance with all applicable regulations, during normal business hours
and with reasonable notice.
(Prior Code, § 16.085.005) (Ord. 445, passed 5-15-2017)
§ 155.432 HOME OCCUPATIONS THAT REQUIRE A CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT; STANDARDS.
   (A)   Generally.
      (1)   The purpose of this section is to encourage those who are engaged
in small commercial ventures that do not conform to the provision for an
administrative home occupation that allow home occupations as outright
permitted uses that do not require a conditional use permit. This section
provides a process for more intense home occupations to be allowed with
conditional use permit approval by the Planning Commission and notice to
surrounding property owners.
      (2)   These home occupations may be permitted, with conditions of
approval when appropriate, in order to increase the benefits of people working
and living in the same place, while protecting neighboring residents from
adverse impacts of home occupation activities. These benefits to the business
owner and to the general public include: reduced number of commute-to-work
trips; day-time “eyes on the street” at the residence; and a neighborhood-scale
version of mixed residential and commercial uses.
   (B)   Approval process and criteria.
      (1)   Home occupation permit. Applications for proposals that cannot meet
all of the standards required for an administrative home occupation shall be
processed as a conditional use procedure, as governed by §§
155.070 through
155.077 of this chapter using the approval criteria in division (B)(2) below.
In addition to the application requirements for a quasi-judicial procedure, the
applicant shall provide:
         (a)   A written narrative or letter:
            1.   Describing the proposed home occupation;
            2.   Demonstrating compliance with those standards in §
155.431 of this chapter that can be met, and explaining why the other standards
in §
155.431 of this chapter cannot be met; and
            3.   Demonstrating compliance with the criteria in division (B)(2)
below.
         (b)   A site plan, not necessarily to scale but with accurate
measurements, of the lot proposed for the home occupation, including:
            1.   The property lines and their dimensions;
            2.   Outlines of the foundations of all buildings proposed for home
occupation use with dimensions for each wall, and the distances from each wall
to the nearest property line;
            3.   Boundaries and dimensions of driveways and parking areas,
indicating areas for use by home occupation employees and customers;
            4.   Outlines of the foundations of abutting residences, and the
distances from the shared property line to the nearest wall of each neighboring
residence; and
            5.   Identifying the buildings and areas of those buildings in
which home occupation activities will take place, and identifying which
activities will take place in which buildings and areas.
      (2)   Criteria. The Planning Commission shall approve, approve with
conditions or deny an application for a conditional use home occupation based
on all of the following criteria:
         (a)   The proposed use will not be materially detrimental to the
stated purposes of applicable code requirements and to other properties within
a radius of 100 feet of the subject property;
         (b)   Impacts to surrounding properties may exist but can be
mitigated; and
         (c)   Existing physical and natural systems, such as, but not limited
to, drainage, natural resources and parks, will not be adversely affected any
more than would occur if the development occurred in compliance with an
administrative home occupation.

(Prior Code, § 16.90.035)
HERITAGE TREES
§ 155.465 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to recognize, foster appreciation and
provide for voluntary protection for heritage trees. For the purpose of this
subchapter, a HERITAGE TREE is a tree or stand of trees that is of landmark
importance due to age, size, species, horticultural quality or historic
importance.
(Prior Code, § 16.95.000)
§ 155.466 DEFINITION.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definition shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   HERITAGE TREE. Those individual trees and/or groups of trees that have been
designated as significant on the basis of their importance in national, state,
regional or local history. They are often acknowledged due to their involvement
or inclusion in the development of landscape architecture, forestry, city
planning and culture. They possess integrity of location, setting or design,
and represent historical events. For a tree to be considered for designation as
a HERITAGE TREE, it must satisfy at least one of the following criteria:
      (1)   The tree (or group of trees) is associated with events that have
made a significant contribution to the broad pattern of our history;
      (2)   The tree (or group of trees) is associated with the life of a
person or group of historic significance;
      (3)   The tree (or group of trees) represents a significant and
distinguishable entity within a community or location; and/or
      (4)   The tree (or group of trees) has age, size or species significance
that contributes to its heritage status.
(Prior Code, § 16.95.005)
§ 155.467 NOMINATION.
   (A)   Any person may nominate, with the owners consent, a particular tree or
group of trees as a heritage tree. If the proposed heritage tree is located on
city property or public right-of-way under city or county jurisdiction, the
nomination shall be submitted to the City Manager, or County Administrator, as
appropriate. If the nomination is consented to by the city or county, the City
Manager or County Administrator shall submit the nomination to the Planning
Commission.
   (B)   Nomination shall be made on such form as required by the City Manager.
The nomination form shall include a narrative explaining why the tree qualifies
for heritage tree status pursuant to the description in §
155.466 of this chapter and the written consent of the property owner as
described in division (A) above.
(Prior Code, § 16.95.010)
§ 155.468 REVIEW PROCESS.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall review all heritage trees nominations at
a public meeting. Notice of the meeting shall be provided to the nominating
applicant, the property owner (unless the nominated tree is located on public
right-of-way under city or county jurisdiction), in which event notice shall be
given to the City Manager or County Administrator.
   (B)   Staff shall prepare a report for the Planning Commission analyzing
whether the tree complies with the requirements for designation.
   (C)   After considering the staff report and any testimony by interested
persons, the Planning Commission shall vote on the nomination. The Planning
Commission may designate a tree as a heritage tree if the Commission determines
that the following criteria are met:
      (1)   The tree or stand of trees is of landmark importance due to age,
size, species, horticultural quality or historic importance; and
      (2)   The tree is not irreparably damaged, diseased, hazardous or unsafe,
or the applicant is willing to have the tree treated by an arborist and the
treatment will alleviate the damage, disease or hazard.
   (D)   Following approval of the nomination by the Planning Commission:
      (1)   If the tree is located on private property, the designation shall
be complete upon the property owner’s execution of a covenant running with the
land suitable for recordation by the city. The covenant shall describe the
subject property, generally describe the location of the heritage tree, and
covenant that the tree is protected as a “heritage tree” by the city and is,
therefore, subject to special protection as provided by this section; and
      (2)   If the tree is located on public right-of-way, the designation
shall be complete upon the staff’s listing of the tree on the city heritage
tree records.
   (E)   If the tree is located on the public right-of-way, the city or county,
as appropriate, shall condition any future property owner-requested vacation of
the public right-of-way upon the execution of a covenant in accordance with
division (D) above, which shall be recorded by the city upon the vacation of
the right-of-way.
(Prior Code, § 16.95.015)
§ 155.469 PROTECTION.
   (A)   A permit to remove a designated heritage tree shall be required.
   (B)   If an application to remove a heritage tree is sought, the applicant
shall demonstrate that the burden imposed on the property owner, or, if the
tree is located within the public right-of-way under city or county
jurisdiction, then the burden imposed on the respective city or county by the
continued presence of the tree outweighs the public benefit provided by the
tree. For the purposes of making this determination, the following impacts
shall not be considered unreasonable burdens on the property owner, or if
appropriate the city or county:
      (1)   View obstruction;
      (2)   Routine pruning, leaf raking and other maintenance activities; and
      (3)   Infrastructure impacts or tree hazards that can be controlled or
avoided by appropriate pruning or maintenance.
   (C)   Unless the permit is to remove a dead or hazardous tree, the applicant
requesting to remove the heritage tree shall be required to mitigate for the
loss of the tree by planting one tree of the same species, with a minimum size
of a two-inch diameter trunk at a point three feet above the root ball, for
each tree removed. If the applicant asserts that the tree is dead or in
hazardous condition, the applicant shall have such determination made by a
licensed arborist.
   (D)   Any person who removes a heritage tree without the proper permit shall
be subject to penalties as established by §
10.99 of this code of ordinances.
(Prior Code, § 16.95.020)
§ 155.470 RECOGNITION.
   (A)   A heritage tree plaque shall be designed by, and furnished by the city
to the property owner, or if the tree is in the public right-of-way, to the
appropriate city or county official, of a designated heritage tree. The city
may charge a fee to cover the costs of providing the plaque. The plaque shall
be posted at a location at or near the tree and, if feasible, visible from a
public right-of-way.
   (B)   The Planning Department shall maintain a list and map of designated
heritage trees.
(Prior Code, § 16.95.025)
§ 155.471 REMOVAL OF DESIGNATION.
   A heritage tree shall be removed from designation only if it dies or is
removed pursuant to §
155.469 of this chapter. If removed from private property, the city shall
record a document extinguishing the covenant.
(Prior Code, § 16.95.030)
TOWNHOUSES
§ 155.485 STANDARDS.
   (A)    Townhouses are unique in that the attached nature of the dwelling
units can result in a bulkier housing product than single-family detached,
duplex or triplex dwellings. These standards may differ from the development
standards established for other uses in the same Zoning District.
   (B)   When a dimensional standard in this subchapter differs from that of
the underlying district, the standard in this subchapter shall apply.
(Prior Code, §16.100.000) (Ord. 451, passed 6-4-2018; Ord. 477, passed 2-22-
2022)
§ 155.486 PURPOSE.
   The purpose for allowing townhouses in certain residential zones is to
permit greater flexibility of design (including lot sizes and setbacks) and to
permit greater opportunity for variety and compatibility of housing types.
(Prior Code, §16.100.005) (Ord. 451, passed 6-4-2018; Ord. 477, passed 2-22-
2022)
§ 155.487 STANDARDS AND REQUIREMENTS.
    The following standards and requirements shall govern the development of
townhouses:
   (A)   Design standards. These standards are intended to control development
scale; avoid or minimize impacts associated with traffic, parking, and design
compatibility; and ensure management and maintenance of common areas.
      (1)   Building mass supplemental standard. The maximum number and width
of attached townhouses (i.e., with attached walls at property line) shall not
exceed six units.
      (2)   Alley access. Where a dwelling abuts a rear or side alley, or a
shared driveway, the garage or carport opening(s) for that dwelling shall
orient to the alley or shared drive, as applicable, and not a street.
      (3)   As necessary, the city shall require dedication of right-of-way or
easements and construction of pathways between townhouse lots (e.g., between
building breaks) to provide for pedestrian connectivity.
      (4)   Street access developments. Townhouses receiving access directly
from a street shall comply with all of the following standards, in order to
minimize interruption of adjacent sidewalks by driveway entrances, slow
traffic, improve appearance of the streets, provide more on-street parking
area, and minimize paved surfaces for better storm water management.
         (a)   When garages face the street, they shall be flush with, or
recessed behind the front elevation (i.e., living area or covered frontporch).
         (b)   The maximum allowable curb cut and driveway apron width is 18
feet per dwelling unit. The remainder of the driveway facing the street may not
exceed the width of the garage door plus an additional four feet. The maximum
combined garage width per unit is 50% of the total building width. For example,
a 24-foot wide unit may have one 12-foot wide recessed garage facing the
street.
         (c)   Two adjacent garages shall share one driveway when individual
driveways would otherwise be separated by less than 20 feet (i.e., the width of
one on-street parking space). When a driveway serves more than one lot, the
developer shall record an access and maintenance easement/agreement to benefit
each lot, prior to building permit issuance.
      (5)   Common areas. Common areas (e.g., landscaping in private tracts,
shared driveways, private alleys, and similar uses) shall be maintained by a
homeowners association or other legal entity. A homeowners association may also
be responsible for exterior building maintenance. A copy of any applicable
covenants, restrictions and conditions shall be recorded and provided to the
city prior to building permit approval.
   (B)   Approval standards.
      (1)   The project shall comply with all other applicable provisions of
the ZDO. The project will accommodate the traffic generated by providing
adequate off- street parking, access points and additional street right-of-way
and improvements and other traffic facilities as required.
      (2)   All public and private improvements shall be developed to
applicable city public works standards.
      (3)   Pedestrian walkways shall be provided for adequate pedestrian and
bicycle traffic.
      (4)   The overall housing density of the project shall comply with that
permitted in the underlying zone.
      (5)   If proposed, private streets shall be owned and maintained by the
owners of the lots which access the private street. A maintenance agreement
shall be recorded which provides for the maintenance of the private street.
(Prior Code, §16.100.010) (Ord. 451, passed 6-4-2018; Ord. 477, passed 2-22-
2022)
ACCESSORY USES, STRUCTURES AND DWELLINGS
§ 155.500 REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESSORY USES AND STRUCTURES,
   (A)   Accessory structures on residential lots. On all residential lots,
accessory structures with a floor area greater than 200 square feet associated
with a single-family dwelling, other than fences or walls, shall be either
recessed behind, or flush with, the front elevation of the dwelling. All
accessory structures utilized for dwelling purposes must meet the requirements
of §
155.501 below.
   (B)   Commercial activity associated with accessory structures. Commercial
activities on residential lots must comply with the Home Occupation standards
of identified in §§
155.430 through
155.432 of this chapter.
   (C)   Setbacks. In all residential zoning districts, and the residential
portions of the NC zoning district, the following setbacks shall apply to
accessory structures greater than 200 square feet in size:
      (1)   Rear.
         (a)   All portions of an accessory structure up to ten feet in height
shall be set back a minimum of five feet from the rear property line.
         (b)   All portions of an accessory structure over ten feet in height
shall be set back a minimum of ten feet from the rear property line.
         (c)   These standards may result in a “stair-stepped” setback
requirement, with portions of the same building meeting different setback
requirements.
      (2)   Side.
         (a)   All portions of an accessory structure up to ten feet in height
shall be set back a minimum of three feet from the interior side property line.
         (b)   All portions of an accessory structure over ten feet in height
shall be set back a minimum of five feet from the interior side property line.
         (c)   These standards may result in a “stair-stepped” setback
requirement, with portions of the same building meeting different setback
requirements.
      (3)   Street side. Accessory structures shall meet the same street side
setback standards as primary structures in the underlying zone.
(Prior Code, § 16.105.000) (Ord. 451, passed 6-4-2018; Ord. 470, passed 8-17-
2020)
§ 155.501 REQUIREMENTS FOR ACCESSORY DWELLINGS.
   (A)   An ACCESSORY DWELLING is a secondary housing unit that is smaller than
the existing primary structure on a residential lot, usually the size of a
studio apartment. The additional unit can be a detached cottage, a unit
attached to a garage or in a portion of an existing house. The housing density
standard of the base zone does not apply to accessory dwellings, due to the
small size and low occupancy level of the use. The following standards are
intended to control the size and number of accessory dwellings on individual
lots, so as to promote compatibility with adjacent land uses.
   (B)   Accessory dwellings shall comply with all of the following standards:
      (1)   Oregon Structural Specialty Code. The structure complies with the
state’s Structural Specialty Code;
      (2)   Utility connection. The structure is permanently built and
connected to utilities in a manner similar to the primary structure;
      (3)   One unit. A maximum of one accessory dwelling unit is allowed per
lot;
      (4)   Building height. The building height of detached accessory
dwellings (such as, separate cottages) shall not exceed 25 feet;
      (5)   Buffering. A six-foot hedge or fence between an accessory dwelling
and a lot line shall be required when the accessory dwelling will have windows
or doors which face a side or rear lot line and are within ten feet of the lot
line; and
      (6)   Location. Detached accessory dwellings shall either be recessed
behind, or flush with, the front elevation of the principal dwelling.
(Prior Code, § 16.105.005) (Ord. 451, passed 6-4-2018; Ord. 470, passed 8-17-
2020)
§ 155.502 REQUIREMENTS FOR FENCES AND WALLS.
   (A)   Fences and walls may be located in any required yard or along the edge
of any yard, subject to the maintenance of clear-vision areas. Fences and walls
shall not exceed a height of three feet along the front property line or within
a front yard setback. A fence or wall may not exceed six feet in height on a
residential lot without approval of a variance.
   (B)   On residential lots, the fence height may be measured from the
elevation of the ground where the fence sits (Figure 1, below) or from the
finished floor elevation of the first floor of the home located on the same lot
(Figure 2, below). For residential lots where the home sits at an elevation
above the location of the fence, a retaining wall or other approved method
shall be used to raise the base height of the fence equal with the finished
floor elevation of the first floor of the home.

2020)
MANUFACTURED HOMES
§ 155.515 PURPOSE.
   (A)   Because a manufactured home park can have significant impacts on the
surrounding community, special standards governing development of these uses
have been established.
   (B)   The provisions regulating manufactured homes located inside and
outside of manufactured home parks and subdivisions are adopted for the
following purposes:
      (1)   To accommodate manufactured homes as permitted uses in the Single-
Family Residential Zone and in manufactured home parks and manufactured home
subdivisions;
      (2)   To assist in providing opportunities for low and moderately priced
single-family housing;
      (3)   To provide standards to ensure a high-quality living environment;
and
      (4)   To provide standards to protect the character of existing
neighborhoods.
(Prior Code, § 16.110.000)
§ 155.516 DESIGN STANDARDS FOR MANUFACTURED HOMES.
   A manufactured home may be located inside or outside a manufactured home
park or subdivision subject to the following conditions.
   (A)   The following standards will be applied to all single-family dwellings
(site-built, modular and manufactured homes) to be constructed or located in
the city: all single-family units shall utilize at least two of the following
design features to provide visual relief along the front of the home:

   (B)   The manufactured home shall be multi-sectional (double wide or wider)
and enclose a space of not less than 1,000 square feet. A manufactured home
shall not be considered multi-sectional by virtue of having a tip-out section.
   (C)   (1)   The manufactured home shall be placed on an excavated and back-
filled foundation which is enclosed at the perimeter so that the manufactured
home is not more than 12 inches above grade on the uphill side of the home. The
perimeter enclosure shall be a non-structural concrete, concrete block or
masonry wall on all manufactured homes placed on individual residential lots
outside of a manufactured home park. Inside a manufactured home park, the
perimeter enclosure may be painted, pressure-treated exterior plywood.
      (2)   The perimeter enclosure shall be constructed to County Building
Department standards.
   (D)   The manufactured home shall have a pitched roof, with a slope of at
least three feet in height for each 12 feet in width (such as, at least a 3:12
pitch).
   (E)   The manufactured home shall have exterior siding and roofing which in
color, material and appearance is similar to the exterior siding and roofing
material commonly used in residential dwellings within the community or which
is comparable to the predominant materials used on surrounding dwellings as
determined by the City Planner.
   (F)   The manufactured home shall be certified by the manufacturer to have
an exterior thermal envelope which meets performance standards which reduce
levels to the performance standards required of single-family dwellings
constructed under the State Building Code, as defined in ORS 455.010.
   (G)   The manufactured home may have a garage or carport. If so, the
exterior materials of the garage or carport shall match the residential home.
   (H)   The manufactured home shall not be sited adjacent to any designated
historical structure.
   (I)   The manufactured home and the lot on which it is located shall be
subject to the same development standards as other single-family residence in
that zone.
   (J)   An original or replacement manufactured dwelling and carport may be
placed on a park space that has been converted to a subdivision lot under ORS
92.835 if:
      (1)   The manufactured dwelling is constructed and installed in
accordance with state and federal standards; and
      (2)   The owner of the lot has signed and recorded a waiver of the right
of remonstrance for the formation of a local improvement district by the city,
in a form approved by the city.
   (K)   The approved dimensional standards or special uses from the original
manufactured home park approval apply to all subsequent development in the
park.

Commission finds the provisions are not satisfied, it may deny the application.
   (D)   If the Planner finds denial was based on internal (on-site) factors
and new plans have been submitted which are sufficiently modified to warrant
reconsideration by the Planning Commission, applications may be resubmitted
within 120 days of the denial.
(Prior Code, § 16.110.015)
LOT, BUILDING AND YARD EXCEPTIONS
§ 155.530 PROJECTIONS FROM BUILDINGS.
   Cornices, eaves, canopies, sunshades, gutters, chimneys, flues and other
similar architectural features may project not more than two feet into a
required yard or into required open space as established by coverage standards.
(Prior Code, § 16.115.000)
§ 155.531 GENERAL EXCEPTION TO BUILDING HEIGHT LIMITATIONS.
   The following types of structures or structural parts are not subject to the

§ 155.532 GENERAL EXCEPTION TO LOT SIZE REQUIREMENTS.
   If, at that time of passage of this subchapter, a lot, or the aggregate of
contiguous lots held in a single ownership, has an area or dimension which does
not meet the lot size requirements of the zone in which the property is
located, the lot or aggregate holdings may be occupied by a use permitted
outright in the zone subject to the other requirements of the zone and
providing, if there is an area deficiency, residential use shall be limited to
a single-family residence.
(Prior Code, § 16.115.010)
§ 155.533 GENERAL EXCEPTIONS TO YARD REQUIREMENTS.
   The following exceptions to the front yard requirements for a dwelling are
authorized for a lot in any zone.
   (A)   If there are dwellings on both abutting lots with front yards of less
than the required depth for the zone, the front yard for the subject lot need
not exceed the average front yard of the abutting dwellings. If there is a
dwelling on one abutting lot with a front yard of less than the required depth
for the zone, the front yard for the subject lot need not exceed a depth one-
half way between the depth of the abutting lot and the required front yard
depth.
   (B)   To permit or afford better light, air and vision on more heavily
traveled streets and on streets of substandard width; to protect arterial
streets; and to have the location of structures compatible with the need for
the eventual widening of streets, the Planning Commission may require a setback
greater than the required yard specified in the zone.
(Prior Code, § 16.115.015)
LOT REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS
§ 155.545 LOT LINE ADJUSTMENTS.
   (A)   Definition. A LOT LINE ADJUSTMENT is the relocation or elimination of
a common boundary between two legal lots, provided no new lots are created as a
result of the relocation of the common boundary. The elimination of lot
boundaries is permitted only for a maximum of three common boundaries.
(Prior Code, §16.120.000)
   (B)   Application and fee. An application for a lot line adjustment shall be
filed with the city and accompanied by the appropriate fee. It is the
applicant’s responsibility to submit a complete application that addresses the
review criteria of this section. An application for a lot line adjustment shall
be reviewed administratively by the city per §§155.025 through 155.033 of this
chapter. The city may specify conditions or modifications in the application as
necessary to assure compliance with the review criteria of this section.
(Prior Code, §16.120.005)
   (C)   Review criteria. A lot line adjustment may be authorized; provided,
the applicant demonstrates that the adjustment satisfies the following
criteria:
      (1)   No new lots or parcels are created as a result of the lot line
adjustment;
      (2)   The adjusted lot lines result in lots that comply with all
standards of the underlying zone, access provisions and other applicable
provisions of this chapter;
      (3)   Existing structures on both properties will comply with the setback
standards of the underlying zone(s) after approval of the adjustment;
      (4)   The lot line adjustment does not conflict with any existing city
land use approval, public easement, or previous conditions of approval applied
to the subject property;
      (5)   All critical facilities and services have, or can be improved to
have, adequate capacity to serve the reconfigured lots;
      (6)   The proposal will not eliminate pedestrian or vehicle access to the
affected properties;
      (7)   The proposal does not create a parcel that will have more than one
zoning designation; and
      (8)   If any resulting lot is eligible for additional development under
existing zoning, the proposed adjustment will not:
         (a)   Preclude the opportunity for such additional development; or
         (b)   Reconfigure the properties in a pattern which might avoid or
reduce the need to install public improvements typically required as a
condition of such additional development.
(Prior Code, §16.120.010)
   (D)   Marking a property line adjustment. Pursuant to ORS 92.060, the
initial point, also known as the “point of beginning”, of a property line
adjustment must be on the external boundary of the parcel and must be marked
with a monument. The location of the monument shall be referenced by survey
pursuant to state statute, unless the County Surveyor determines otherwise.
(Prior Code, §16.120.015)
   (E)   Recording. The applicant shall be responsible for recording the
approved lot line adjustment’s plat survey and record deed with the County
Clerk’s office and/or Surveyor’s office within one year of approval, unless an
extension is granted by the city in accordance herewith.
(Prior Code, §16.120.020) (Ord. 477, passed 2-22-2022)
§ 155.546 PURPOSE.
   Standards provide for the orderly, safe, efficient and livable development
of land within the city.
(Prior Code, § 16.125.000) (Ord. 427, passed 5-16-2016)
§ 155.547 SCOPE.
   The provisions of this subchapter shall apply to all partitions and
subdivisions within the city.
(Prior Code, § 16.125.005) (Ord. 427, passed 5-16-2016)
§ 155.548 STANDARDS FOR LOTS.
   (A)   Minimum lot area. Minimum lot area shall conform to the requirements
of the zoning district in which the lot is located.
   (B)   Access. All lots shall provide a minimum of 20 feet of frontage on an
existing or proposed public street, with the following exception: flag lots,
accessed by a private driveway, may be permitted by the Planning Commission
when any of the following conditions are met:
      (1)   The subject property is surrounded by developed properties and the
terrain, shape of the parcel, or the location of existing structures precludes
accessing the property with a public street;
      (2)   The proposed flag lot(s) front on the arc of a cul-de-sac and the
use of flag lots would result in a better lot pattern around the cul-de-sac
than that which might otherwise result;
      (3)   The subject property is located in the commercial or industrial
zoning district and full frontage on a public street is unnecessary to the
logical development of the property;
      (4)   The use of flag lots is necessary due to conditions of terrain or
other physical features of the property; and
      (5)   The use of flag lots accessing from a collector or local street is
acceptable.
   (C)   Flag lots. When authorized by the Planning Commission pursuant to the
access requirements of division (B) above, flag lots shall be subject to the
following development standards.
      (1)   The access strip shall be a minimum of 15 feet in width, with an
improved surface of at least 12 feet, except as required by the Uniform Fire
Code.
      (2)   The access strip shall not be included in the calculation of lot
area for purposes of determining compliance with any minimum lot size provision
of this chapter.
      (3)   The length of the access strip is subject to the requirements of
the Uniform Fire Code, and shall not exceed 200 feet.
      (4)   Subsequent development on flag lots in the R-7.5, R-5 and R-2.5
Zoning Districts shall provide a minimum:
         (a)   Fifteen feet in the yard facing the garage door or carport
entrance;
         (b)   Ten feet in the yard facing the front of the residence;
         (c)   Ten feet in the yard facing the rear of the residence; and
         (d)   Side yard setbacks shall be the same as the underlying zone.
   (D)   Through lots. In residential zones, street access must be interior to
the developments. Screening or buffering may be required by the Planning
Commission during the review of the land division request.
   (E)   Lot side lines. The side lines of lots, as far as practicable, shall
run at right angles to the street upon which the lots face.
   (F)   Lot grading. Lot grading shall conform to the requirements of Ch. 70
of the Uniform Building Code and city public works standards.
   (G)   Large lots. In dividing tracts into large lots which at some future
time are likely to be re-divided, the applicant’s tentative plan shall also
demonstrate that any redevelopment or re-subdivision may readily take place at
the planned residential density without violating the requirements of this
subchapter. The Planning Commission may require that the blocks be of such size
and shape, be so divided into building sites and contain such site restrictions
as will provide for extension and opening of streets at intervals which will
permit a subsequent division of any tract into lots of smaller size.
   (H)   Land for public purposes. When a proposed park, open space or other
public use shown on the Comprehensive Plan or zoning map is located in whole or
in part within a subdivision, the final subdivision plat shall dedicate the
identified area for the designated public use.
(Prior Code, § 16.125.10) (Ord. 427, passed 5-16-2016)
§ 155.549 STANDARDS FOR BLOCKS.
   (A)   General. The length, width and shape of blocks shall take into account
the need for adequate building site size and street width and shall recognize
the limitations of the topography.
   (B)   Sizes. Residential districts shall have a maximum 600-foot block
length, a minimum 160-foot street adjacent lot depth and a 1,600-foot
perimeter. Commercial districts shall have a block length of 400 feet and a
1,200-foot perimeter. Light industrial districts shall have a block length of
600 to 800 feet and a 1,600- to 2,000-foot perimeter. General industrial
districts do not have block length or perimeter requirements. A block shall
have sufficient width to provide for two tiers of building sites unless
topography or the location of adjoining streets justifies an exception.
(Prior Code, § 16.125.15) (Ord. 427, passed 5-16-2016)
§ 155.550 EASEMENTS.
   (A)   Utility lines. A minimum five-foot wide easements for sewers, water
mains, electric lines or other public utilities shall be dedicated along the
front, side and rear lot or parcel lines of each lot. Easements shall be
centered on lot lines. Properties with alley access are only required to have
easements in the front and rear lot lines.
   (B)   Watercourses. If a tract is traversed by a watercourse such as a
drainage way, channel or stream, a storm water easement or drainage right-of-
way shall be provided which substantially parallels the lines of the
watercourse.
   (C)   Pedestrian and bicycle ways. When desirable for public convenience and
access, a pedestrian or bicycle way easement may be required to connect to a
cul-de-sac or to pass through an unusually long or oddly spaced block, or to
otherwise provide appropriate circulation.

         (a)   Sanitary sewers shall be installed to serve the subdivision and
to connect the subdivision to existing mains both on and off the property being
subdivided.
         (b)   If the required sewer facilities will, without further sewer
construction, directly serve property outside the subdivision, the Planning
Commission may recommend to the City Council construction as an assessment
project with such arrangement with the subdivider as is desirable to assure
financing his or her share of the construction.
         (c)   The city, at the request of clean water services, may require
that the subdivider construct sewage lines of a size in excess of that
necessary to adequately serve the development in question, where such
facilities are or will be necessary to serve the entire area within which the
development is located when the area is ultimately developed. The city may also
require that the construction take place as an assessment project with such
arrangement with the subdivider as is desirable to assure his share of the
construction.
      (5)   Water system. Water lines with valves and fire hydrants serving the
subdivision and connecting the subdivision to the city mains shall be
installed. The design shall take into account provisions for extension beyond
the subdivision to adequately grid the city system and to serve the area within

upon the following findings:
      (1)   The proposal conforms with the Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   The project will satisfactorily accommodate the traffic it
generates by means of adequate off-street parking, access points and additional
street right-of-way and improvements and any other traffic facilities required.
All such improvements shall be developed to city public works standards;
      (3)   Streets and roads in planned unit developments which are to be
dedicated shall be public and developed to city public works standards;
      (4)   Pedestrian walkways shall be provided for adequate pedestrian and
bicycle traffic and these shall be constructed to city public works standards,
except as varied by the Planning Commission;
      (5)   All utility facilities shall be installed underground and in
accordance with city public works standards;
      (6)   The design of a planned unit development shall provide direct
access for all units and lots to open space areas and facilities;
      (7)   The project will be compatible with adjacent development and will
not adversely affect the character of the area;
      (8)   All public utilities will be developed consistent with urban growth
boundary policies, plans and standards;
      (9)   The planned unit development shall not have adverse impacts on
public facilities such as schools, roads, water and sewage systems, fire
protection and the like;
      (10)   A planned unit development shall not be approved in any zone if
the housing density of the proposed development will result in an intensity of
land use greater than permitted by the Comprehensive Plan;
      (11)   Developments which either provide for or contemplate private
streets and common areas which will be or are proposed to be maintained by the
owners of units or lots within a development must organize and maintain an
owner's association. The owners association shall consist of all the owners of
units or lots within the development and membership in the association must be
required of all owners who must adopt and record bylaws as provided by ORS
100.410. The owners association shall adopt bylaws that contain the provisions
required by ORS 100.415 and specifically the power to create a lien upon the
unit or lot for services, labor or material lawfully chargeable as common
expenses as provided in ORS 100.450. The owners associations power to create
such a lien shall exist whether or not the property is submitted to the state's
Unit Ownership Law (ORS 100.005 to 100.620);
      (12)   All other subdivision restrictions contained in §§

NOTES TO TABLE:
N = Not required
Y = Yes, required
O = Conditional, required in some case
 
Note: street lights shall be installed per city standards.
 
C1 = Fire hydrants for commercial expansions. A fire hydrant is required when:
1. The total floor area of the building, including existing area and expanded
area, is greater than or equal to 2,500 square feet; or
2. A use is proposed which is classified as a hazardous (H) use under the
Uniform Building Code.
C2 = Street improvements for commercial, institutional, public, semi-public and
industrial expansions. Lots fronting on county roads must obtain access permits
from the County Department of Land Use and Transportation. The city will
require improvement to full city standards when the use meets any of the
following criteria:
1. The use generates an average of 100+ trips per day per 1,000 gross square
feet of building as documented in the Trip Generation Manual of the Institute
of Transportation Engineers or other qualified source; or
2. The use includes daily shipping and delivery trips by vehicles over 20,000
pounds gross vehicle weight.
C3 = Communications infrastructure. Communications infrastructure, including,
but not limited to, conduit for communication utilities, shall be installed to
adequately serve the approved level of development. Communications
infrastructure shall be required when other public utility or roadway
improvements are required of a development, and as required by city standards.
Y1 = Street improvements for single-family homes. New single-family homes
located on existing improved streets must pay the city’s systems use fee prior
to issuance of a building permit. New single-family homes which are located
adjacent to a city street must meet the city’s street standards. Extension of
county roads must meet the county road standards.
Y2 = Sewer line extensions for single-family homes. Clean water services has
jurisdiction over sewer line extensions. CWS generally requires extension of
the sewer lines to serve new hook-ups.

2020)
§ 155.652 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   The following general provisions shall apply to the dedication,
construction, improvement or other development of all public streets in the
city.
   (A)   Relationship. The location, width and grade of streets shall be
considered in their relation to existing and planned streets, to topographical
conditions, to public convenience and safety and to the proposed use of the
land to be served by the streets.
   (B)   Development proposals. Development proposals shall provide for the
continuation of existing principal streets where necessary to promote
appropriate traffic circulation in the vicinity of the development. All new
developments may be required to provide joint-use access to all adjacent
undeveloped or underdeveloped parcels.
   (C)   Reserve strips. Reserve strips will not be approved unless necessary
for the protection of the public welfare or of substantial property rights, and
in these cases they may be required. The control and disposal of the land
composing such strips shall be placed within the jurisdiction of the city under
conditions approved by the Planning Commission.
   (D)   Alignment. Road alignment shall conform to the city public works
design standards.
   (E)   Future extension of streets. Where necessary to give access to or
permit a satisfactory future development of adjoining land, streets shall be
extended to the boundary of a tract being developed and the resulting dead-end
streets may be approved without turnarounds. Reserve strips may be required to
preserve the objectives of street extensions.
   (F)   Intersection angles. Streets shall be laid out to intersect at angles
as near to right angles as practical. Intersection design shall conform to the
city public works design standards.
   (G)   Existing streets. Whenever existing public streets adjacent to or
within a tract are of inadequate width, additional right-of-way shall be
provided at the time of subdivision or development.
   (H)   Cul-de-sacs.   
      (1)   Cul-de-sacs shall be used only when exceptional topographical
constraints, existing development patterns, or compliance with other standards
in this code preclude a street extension and circulation. A cul-de-sac shall
not be more than 400 feet in length and shall not provide access to more than
20 dwelling units.
      (2)   All cul-de-sacs shall terminate with a turnaround in accordance
with the specifications in the public works design standards. The radius of
circular turnarounds may be larger when they contain a landscaped island,
parking bay in their center, Tualatin Valley Fire and Rescue submits a written
request, or an industrial use requires a larger turnaround for truck access.
      (3)   Public easements, tracts, or right-of-way shall provide paved
pedestrian and bicycle access ways at least six feet wide where a cul-de-sac or
dead-end street is planned, to connect the ends of the streets together,
connect to other streets, or connect to other existing or planned developments
in accordance with the standards of this subchapter, the Transportation System
Plan, public works design standards or other provisions identified in this
code.
   (I)   Street names. No street names shall be used which will duplicate or be
confused with the names of existing streets, except for extensions of existing
streets. Street names and number shall conform to the established pattern in
the city and shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Commission.
   (J)   Grades and curves. Grades and curves shall conform to the city public
works design standards. Where existing conditions, particularly topography,
make it otherwise impractical to provide buildable sites, the City Engineer may
accept steeper grades and sharper curves.
   (K)   Alleys. Alleys shall be provided in commercial and industrial
districts unless other permanent provisions for access to off-street parking
and loading facilities are made as approved by the City Engineer. Alleys shall
be constructed consistent with the city Public Works Design Standards.
   (L)   Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall conform to the city public works design
standards. Curbs and sidewalks shall be required along both sides of all public
streets. All new development upon lots, tracts or parcels of land adjacent to a
public street will be required to construct curbs and sidewalks.
   (M)   Bike lanes. Bike lanes shall be provided where required by the city’s
Transportation System Plan and shall be designed and constructed in compliance
with the city’s Public Works Design Standards.
   (N)   Street trees. Street trees shall be provided and shall be a species
identified on the Washington County approved street trees list.
   (O)   Access spacing standards. Access spacing standards shall comply with
Washington County’s standards on county roads and the city Transportation
System Plan and Public Works Design Standards on city roads.

§ 155.653 GENERAL RIGHT-OF-WAY AND IMPROVEMENT WIDTHS; MODIFICATIONS.
   (A)   Construction specifications for all street and right-of-way
improvement widths shall comply with the criteria of the city Transportation
System Plan. These standards shall be the minimum requirements for all streets,
except where modifications are permitted under this subchapter or the street
standard adopted by the City Council, whichever is less restrictive. Refer to
Figures 5-2A to 5-2P in the Transportation System Plan for detailed diagrams
depicting street right-of-way, improved and roadway width requirements. County
roads are subject to county roadway standards.
(Prior Code, § 16.150.015; Ord. 470, passed 8-17-2020)
   (B)   The Planning Commission may allow modification to the public street
standards of this chapter when both of the following criteria are satisfied.
      (1)   The modification is necessary to provide design flexibility in
instances where:
         (a)   Unusual topographic conditions require a reduced width or grade
separation of improved surfaces;
         (b)   Parcel shape or configuration precludes accessing a proposed
development with a street which meets the full standards of the city;
         (c)   A modification is necessary to preserve trees or other natural
features determined by the Planning Commission to be significant to the
aesthetic character of the area; or
         (d)   A planned unit development is proposed and the modification of
street standards is necessary to provide greater privacy or aesthetic quality
to the development.
      (2)   Modification of this subchapter shall only be approved if the
Planning Commission finds that the specific design proposed provides adequate
vehicular access based on anticipated traffic volumes. If there is insufficient
area of on-street parking, the Planning Commission may require additional off-
street parking and require that the street be posted to prohibit parking along
one or both sides of the street.

(Prior Code, § 16.165.010)
OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING
§ 155.670 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide adequate areas for the parking,
maneuvering, loading and unloading of vehicles for all land uses in the city.
(Prior Code, §16.155.000) (Ord. 450, passed 12-18-2017; Ord. 451, passed 6-4-
2018; Ord. 477, passed 2-22-2022)
§ 155.671 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (A)   The provision and maintenance of off-street parking and loading spaces
are continuing obligations of the property owner. No building or other permit
shall be issued until plans are presented that show property that is and will
remain available for exclusive use as off-street parking and loading space. The
subsequent use of property for which the building permit is issued shall be
conditional upon the unqualified continuance and availability of the amount of
parking and loading space required by this chapter.
   (B)   Parking requirements for types of buildings and uses not specifically
listed herein shall be determined by the Planning Commission, based upon the
requirements of comparable uses listed.
   (C)   In the event several uses occupy a single structure or parcel of land,
the total requirements for off-street parking shall be the sum of the
requirements of the several uses computed separately, except as specified in
division (D) below.
   (D)   Owners of two or more uses, structures, or parcels of land may agree
to utilize jointly the same parking and loading spaces when the hours of
operation do not overlap, provided that satisfactory legal evidence is
presented to the Building Inspector in the form of deed, leases or contracts to
establish the joint use. Of the total number of required off- street parking
spaces, when the two or more joint uses include a mix of residential and
commercial, one parking space per business shall be designated as a short-term
parking space for use by patrons.
   (E)   Off-street parking spaces for dwellings shall be located on the same
tax lot with the structure, and within 250 feet of the dwelling unit for which
the parking space is required. Garages and/or carports may be used to satisfy
the off- street parking requirements for dwellings, however, one required
parking space may be uncovered. Parking spaces required for other uses may be
located on a separate tax lot and shall be located not farther than 500 feet
from the building or use they are to serve.
   (F)   Parking and loading spaces shall not be located in a required side or
rear yard, except that off street parking spaces may be located in a required
side or rear yard adjacent to a street on commercial or industrial zoned land
provided that the parking spaces are developed consistent with the development
standards of this chapter.
   (G)   Required parking spaces shall be available for parking of operable
passenger automobiles of residents, customers, patrons and employees only, and
shall not be used for storage of vehicles or materials or for the parking of
trucks used in conducting the business or use.
   (H)   Required parking spaces shall be improved and available for use before
the final inspection is completed by the Building Inspector. An extension of
time may be granted by the Building Inspector providing an irrevocable letter
of credit, assignment of bank account, performance bond, or its equivalent, is
posted equaling the cost to complete the improvements.
   (I)   On-street parking credit. The amount of off-street parking required
may be reduced by one-half off-street parking space for every one on-street
parking space adjacent to the development (where curbs and sidewalks are
present and parking is allowed). On-street parking shall follow the established
configuration of existing on-street parking, except that angled parking may be
allowed for some streets, where permitted by city standards. The following
constitutes an on-street parking space:
      (1)   Parallel parking, each 24 feet of uninterrupted curb;
      (2)   Forty-five degree diagonal, each 14 feet of curb;
      (3)   Sixty degree diagonal, each 11.5 feet of curb;
      (4)   Ninety degree (perpendicular) parking, each ten feet of curb;
      (5)   Curb space must be connected to the lot which contains the use;
      (6)   Parking spaces that would not obstruct a required clear vision
area, nor any other parking that violates any law or street standard; and
      (7)   On-street parking spaces credited for a specific use may not be
used exclusively by that use, but shall be available for general public use at
all times. No signs or actions limiting general public use of on-street parking
spaces are permitted.
   (J)   When the calculation of the minimum number of parking spaces required
results in a fraction of a space, the applicant must round up to the nearest
whole space.
   (K)   When 50 or more parking spaces are either required or proposed with a
development application, a minimum of 5% of the total number of parking spaces
shall be available for future installation of electric vehicle charging
stations, as defined by Oregon Administrative Rule (OAR) 918-020-038.
Fractional numbers derived from this calculation must be rounded up to the
nearest whole number.
   (L)   All new developments may be required to provide for joint-use access
to all adjacent undeveloped or underdeveloped parcels.
   (M)   Attached or detached garages may count toward the minimum parking
requirement, provided the interior dimension of the garage contains a minimum
width of 12 feet and depth of 22 feet for each vehicle.

ANNEXATIONS
§ 155.720 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   The city finds annexation is the first step to converting future urbanizable
lands to urban land within the city’s urban growth boundary and urban planning
area and as such, it is an important part of the process of providing timely
and orderly urban development. The city also recognizes that development of
lands at urban densities must include the consideration of the provision of
adequate levels of required urban services and infrastructure such as police,
fire, sanitary sewer, water, roads and storm water disposal. Policies and
procedures adopted in this subchapter are intended to carry out the purposes of
the city’s Comprehensive Plan and ensure that annexation of lands to the city
is done timely and orderly and consistent with the Charter which requires that,
unless otherwise mandated by state law, all annexation proposals must be
approved by a majority vote of the city’s citizens before the annexation
becomes effective.
(Prior Code, § 16.205.000) (Ord. 464, passed 9-16-2019)
§ 155.721 CONDITIONS FOR ANNEXATION.
   The following conditions must be met prior to or concurrent with city
processing of any annexation request:
   (A)   The subject property must be located within the city’s urban growth
boundary;
   (B)   The subject property must be contiguous to the existing city limits or
separated from it only by a public right-of-way or a stream, bay, lake or other
body of water, per ORS 221.111(1); and
   (C)   A right-of-way that is not within the urban growth boundary may be
annexed for road reconstruction or modification or for the placement of
utilities.
(Prior Code, § 16.205.005) (Ord. 464, passed 9-16-2019)
§ 155.722 CRITERIA.
   (A)   The following criteria shall apply to all annexation requests:
      (1)   The proposed use for the site complies with the city’s
Comprehensive Plan and with the designation(s) thereon. If a re-designation of
the plan map is requested concurrent with annexation, the uses allowed under
the proposed designation must comply with the Comprehensive Plan;
      (2)   An adequate level of urban services and infrastructure must be
available or made available in a specified time period determined by Council.
An ADEQUATE LEVEL OF URBAN SERVICES is defined as:
         (a)   Municipal sanitary sewer, storm drainage and water service
meeting the requirements enumerated in the Comprehensive Plan for provision of
those services;
         (b)   Rights-of-way with adequate design capacity for the proposed use
and projected future uses; and
         (c)   Where construction of improvements necessary for delivery of the
urban services identified in division (A)(1) above or the rights-of-way
identified in division (A)(2) above are not thought to be immediately
necessary, the applicant shall note the methods that are proposed to be used
for providing and/or financing those services/improvements including, but not
limited to, dedication of right-of-way, granting waiver(s) of remonstrance
against possible future local improvement districts created or other
approaches/devices to pay for improvement costs.
      (3)   Findings documenting the availability of police, fire, parks,
school facilities and all related services shall be made allowing for
conclusive findings either for or against the proposed annexation. The adequacy
of each of these services shall be considered in relation to each annexation
proposal;
      (4)   The proposed annexation represents a logical direction for city
expansion, promotes an orderly, reasonable and economically feasible expansion
of the city boundaries and, in the judgment of the city, serves the present and
future interests of the city; and
      (5)   The burden of providing evidence supporting the findings hereof.
   (B)   Improvements for needed infrastructure may be secured by a funding
mechanism that will place the primary economic burden on the territory proposed
for annexation and not on the city generally.

Commission and City Council so as to allow for meeting the election date filing
deadlines. Applications for annexations subject to voter approval shall be
filed with the city before the close of business on the one hundred forty-fifth
day prior to the date on which the election is scheduled.

posted with a minimum of one sign not greater than six square feet in size. The
sign shall provide notice of the annexation election, a map of the subject
property and other relevant information regarding the proposed annexation.
      (4)   For all proposed annexations subject to voter approval, the
decision to set the annexation for an election shall be at the discretion of
the City Council and shall be approved by resolution. All costs associated with
placing the matter on the ballot shall be paid by the applicant or owner of the
property proposed to be annexed.
