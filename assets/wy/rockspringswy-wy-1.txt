(Prior Code, § 4-1401) (Ord. 2005-07, passed 4-19-2005; Ord. 18-12, passed 6-
19-2018)
§ 51.02 PURPOSE; AUTHORITY.
   Water service will be supplied by the city to users in those areas of the
city and the county which are identified as a portion of the system leased by
the city pursuant to the Lease, Operation, Maintenance, Service and Management
Agreement. Service will be supplied to such additional users as are authorized
by the city and the Joint Powers Water Board pursuant to the Water Purchase
Agreement and/or Lease, Operation, Maintenance, Service and Management
Agreement. All costs associated with said water service shall be paid only from
revenues derived pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.

(Prior Code, § 4-1403)
§ 51.04 APPLICATION FOR SERVICE.
   (A)   The city shall require owner or owner’s representative or agent to
make a request for service upon purchase of property. Submitting a request for
service does not in itself bind the city to serve. It shall be the
responsibility of the owner to apply for service and establish an account.
However, water usage on a particular meter will enable the city to bill for
such consumption based on ownership reflected on the deed recorded with the
County Treasurer.
   (B)   In a situation where an individual is acting as a bank and/or holding
a mortgage for the buyer, doing a contract for deed, rent to own and/or lease
to purchase, the account will remain with the individual acting as a bank and/
or a mortgage until the property has been paid for in full by the buyer and
associated liens released from the title.

§ 51.05 GUARANTEE DEPOSITS.
   (A)   A cash deposit may be required from any owner to guarantee payment of
current bills.
   (B)   (1)   The minimum amount of guarantee deposit to be required by the
city shall be equal to three times the monthly average of annual consumption.
Governmental accounts are exempt from guarantee deposits.
      (2)   Upon notification of the deposit requirement, the owner may
immediately request a payment schedule for remittance of deposit. The city may
allow the deposit to be paid in a maximum of three equal installments in
addition to all other charges which are required to be paid monthly. Six months
good credit history does not begin until the entire deposit has been satisfied.
No payment schedule shall be allowed for deposits assessed due to termination
of service pursuant to the provisions under §
51.08(H).
   (C)   After an owner has established a payment history of maintaining
current payments with no delinquencies over a period of six consecutive months,
the deposit will be applied to the account on which it was paid, transferred to
a different location or account of same owner or returned to owner upon
request.
   (D)   When service is discontinued, any guarantee deposit, less any sum
which may be due for unpaid utility bills, will be applied to the account on
which it was paid, transferred to a different location or account of same
owner, or returned to the owner. If the owner should fail to claim such deposit
when service is discontinued, a written notice shall be sent to the last known
postal address. Unclaimed deposits shall be disposed of as required by state
law.
   (E)   If any owner has received three consecutive termination notices during
the previous 12-month period, the city may require such delinquent owner to
post a guarantee deposit according to the prescribed schedule or to increase
the amount of the guarantee deposit previously collected. Failure to post the
amount of guarantee deposit requested may result in termination of service.
   (F)   Guarantee deposits may be waived on new or additional locations for
residential or commercial owners who have established six months of good credit
history as determined by the city. Acceptable credit history requires, but is
not limited to:
      (1)   All accounts of the owner have not been assessed late fees for any
six consecutive months during the previous 12-month period;
      (2)   None of the owner’s accounts have been paid with insufficient funds
or otherwise non-negotiable checks during the previous six-month period.
   (G)   Payments will be applied first to deposits in the proportion that
water and sewer deposits are due. Any remaining payments will be applied to the
service balance in proportion to the amounts due. (Prior Code, § 4-1405) (Ord.
2005-07, passed 4-19-2005)
§ 51.06 CONNECTION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   (1)   All equipment or facilities required for initial connection
shall be furnished and paid for by the user. Thereafter, the city shall, own,
operate, maintain and replace all equipment necessary to connect user’s
facilities to the city’s facilities.
      (2)   All water consumption during construction will be metered and
billed under provisions of this chapter. The contractor shall also pay a non-
refundable service connection fee as set forth in the water connection fee
schedule, approved and adopted by resolution of the governing body.
      (3)   Notwithstanding the foregoing, a portion of the connection fees
may, within the sole discretion of the City Council, be waived for real
property owners within the slummed and/or blighted areas of the city as
identified by resolution, who wish to modify an existing structure for business
purposes and who would be required to install a sprinkler system for fire
suppression to comply with the building and/or fire codes. The actual cost of
any physical facilities required to make the connection will not be waived
under any circumstances.
   (B)   User’s facilities shall be so located as to make the meter and curb
stop easily accessible and convenient for the installation, operation,
protection, metering and maintenance of the city’s meters and equipment. The
water supply shall enter the building at the location of the water meter. A
full open valve shall be located on the supply side of the water meter and an
approved check valve shall be located on the house side of the water meter.
Unless approved by the authority having jurisdiction, the water meter shall be
installed horizontally and within 24 inches of the water supply entering the
building.
   (C)   The city shall not be required to install or maintain more than one
connection direct from its facilities to the facilities of any one user. Each
user shall install and maintain, at his or her own expense, all piping,
plumbing, equipment and faucets, including a shut-off valve located in a curb
box meeting the city’s specifications, to the point of connection to the city’s
facilities except for the meter which the city will provide and install. If a
working curb stop is not accessible, the owner will be notified and given 30
days to correct the deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected within 30
days, the city may install a new curb stop in the service line. All costs
associated with the installation shall be added to the owner’s account.
   (D)   The city will permit a secondary water service on a property:
      (1)   Provided it does not adversely impact the distribution system;
      (2)   Provided the installation is to be metered and costs of
installation are borne by the property owner; and
      (3)   After review and upon acceptance by the city engineering staff and
the City Water Superintendent.
   (E)   All plumbing and equipment of owner, including outside hydrants and
faucets, shall be connected, at the expense of owner, to the service piping in
such a manner that all water used by user shall pass through the meter.
   (F)   Temporary service shall be installed at the cost of owner and
according to the specifications of the city. All temporary lines shall be
removed by owner at the request of the city and at the expense of owner. The
owner may apply to the city to have lines become permanent which application
shall be considered the same as an application for capacity increase by the
city and the Joint Powers Board.
   (G)   Every building having plumbing fixtures installed and intended for
human habitation, occupancy or use on premises abutting on a street, alley or
easement in which there is public water system shall have a separate connection
with the public water system. Where located on the same lot, multiple buildings
may connect to a common metered water system that connects to the public water
system and be buried at least six feet deep for frost protection.
(Prior Code, § 4-1406) (Ord. 98-06, passed 6-20-1998; Ord. 2005-07, passed 4-
19-2005; Ord. 18-12, passed 6-19-2018; Ord. 2021-10, passed 10-5-2021)
§ 51.07 REFUSAL OF SERVICE.
   (A)   The city may decline to serve any user until he or she has complied
with the federal, state and municipal regulations governing water service and
with provisions of this chapter.
   (B)   The city may decline to serve or to increase the size of the service
connection to any user if, in the opinion of the city, it does not have
adequate facilities to render the service applied for, or if the desired
service is of character likely to unfavorably affect service to other users.
   (C)   The city may refuse to serve a user if the user’s plumbing or
equipment does not comply with the requirements of the Uniform Plumbing Code or
is of such a character that satisfactory service cannot be given.
   (D)   The city may refuse to reconnect a service under the name of any other
member of the family when the head of the household is unchanged and when
service at that address had previously been disconnected for nonpayment of
bills.
(Prior Code, § 4-1407)
§ 51.08 TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
   (A)   (1)   Every owner who is about to sell any premises supplied with
water service by the city shall give three working or business days’ notice in
advance of specified date of sale. Accounts will only be closed upon the sale
of a property. Minimum monthly charges outlined in the rate schedule determined
periodically by the city representing the cost of making water service
available to a consumer shall accrue regardless of monthly water usage, unless
there are unusual or extraordinary circumstances. In such case, written request
must be submitted for review to the billing department. Making such request
does not guarantee approval nor does it obligate the city to make an exception
to normal procedures. The owner shall be held responsible for all service
rendered at this location. If a property is purchased and an account is not
established by the new owner, the city may open an account for billing purposes
based on deed ownership information recorded to the County Treasurer, which
will automatically close any accounts for the previous owner without
requirement of notification.
      (2)   Pursuant to the provisions of this section, voluntary closure of an
account will not result in permanent or temporary termination of water service
to any location.
   (B)   Service may be terminated for nonpayment of bills, for violation of
the provisions of this chapter or for fraudulent use of services after five
days’ written notice that bills are delinquent or that the violation of the
provisions must cease; provided, however, that where fraudulent use of service
is detected, or where a dangerous condition determined by the city is found to
exist on the user’s premises, service may be terminated without advance notice.
In addition, user’s service may be terminated for nonpayment of sewer account
for the same property receiving water service. Service may be terminated at a
location with current service for nonpayment of an account at another location
or previous location. The entire delinquent account balance must be paid in
order to avoid termination of service.
   (C)   Whenever service has been terminated by the city because of nonpayment
of delinquent billing or fraudulent use, as provided in this chapter, such
termination shall take place only between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., Monday
through Thursday, excluding legal holidays and the day preceding legal holidays
and a charge to cover the cost of disconnection/reconnection may be collected
by the city before service is restored. The amount of said charge will be the
actual cost, as determined by the city. Any party liable for payment of a
delinquent account shall agree in advance to bear the cost of collection of
such account.
   (D)   In addition to the costs associated with disconnection/reconnection
stated in division (C) above, the city shall also require payment of all
delinquent billings associated with that account prior to restoration of
service and any delinquent sewer bills at the same property receiving such
water service.
   (E)   Whenever service has been terminated by the city because of any
default by the user or fraudulent use, as provided in this chapter, all
regulations pertaining to new users, including deposit requirements, shall be
enforced.
   (F)   Deposits applied under this section shall not be eligible for payment
under an installment schedule.
   (G)   All delinquent accounts, including cost of collection, shall, to the
extent possible, be made a lien against the property receiving service.
   (H)   Whenever service is terminated because of fraudulent use, the city
shall require a satisfactory payment for service rendered or damage caused to
city facilities (in addition to the reconnection charge and actual cost) before
service is restored.
   (I)   Any unpaid balance on any outstanding account may be applied to any
other utility account issued to the same owner. Refunds less than $5 will not
be refunded by check. Upon request, a credit balance less than $5 on an account
that has been closed will be issued by the Water Finance Department.
   (J)   Terminated accounts that have been referred for collection may be
considered inactive for accrual of late fees and billing purposes.
   (K)   If a working curb stop is not accessible, the owner will be notified
and given 30 days to correct the deficiency. If the deficiency is not corrected
within 30 days, the city may install a new curb stop in the service line. All
costs associated with the installation shall be added to the owner’s account.
All associated installation costs must be paid in full in addition to all
delinquent bills and deposits as required in this chapter prior to service
being restored.
(Prior Code, § 4-1408) (Ord. 2005-07, passed 4-19-2005)
§ 51.09 HEARING.
   (A)   In cases where termination notice is required, such notice shall
inform the user that he or she may request a hearing upon the proposed
termination of service.
   (B)   Such request must be in writing directed to the Finance Director and
made within five days after having received written notice of termination.
   (C)   Pending the outcome of such a hearing, service may not be terminated.
   (D)   Hearings will be conducted at the earliest possible time after receipt
of the user’s request for hearing and in the following manner.
      (1)   A Hearing Board shall be established, consisting of three members
of the governing body, to serve on a rotating basis.
      (2)   The Hearing Board shall have the authority to hear all appeals
concerning water service termination. The Hearing Board shall determine whether
fairness, equity and substantial public interest would be served by termination
of the users’ service and in making such determination the Hearing Board shall
consider:
         (a)   Whether such termination is justified and required under the
provisions of this chapter; and
         (b)   Whether fairness, equity and substantial public interest would
be better served by allowing the user to continue to receive water service even
though termination is justified and required under the provisions of this
chapter.
      (3)   In cases where the Hearing Board determines that fairness, equity
and substantial public interest will be best served by allowing the user to
continue to receive water service, the Hearing Board may set terms and
conditions under which said user shall receive such water service.
      (4)   At the discretion of the Hearing Board, the public may be excluded
from hearings conducted pursuant to this division (D).
      (5)   If the Hearing Board determines that the user’s services should not
be terminated, the Hearing Board shall bring that recommendation before the
entire City Council for final determination.
      (6)   The Hearing Appeals Board will hear a maximum of two appeals on any
individual petition.
      (7)   Any deferred payment agreement as approved by the Hearing Board
must be signed by the customer and by the city.
      (8)   Any customer requesting an appeal of the Hearing Board must be
present at such an appeal or waive the right to further protest any actions of
the Board regarding his or her account.
   (E)   The Hearing Board may also hear other water appeals that are not
directly related to the termination of service.
(Prior Code, § 4-1409)
§ 51.10 METERING AND BILLING.
   (A)   The city will install and maintain all meters necessary to enable the
city to render bills for each service connection furnished. All meters and
other equipment furnished by the city will be maintained by the city and will
remain in the ownership of the city.
   (B)   The owner shall give the city, or its authorized agents, permission to
enter user’s premises at all reasonable times for the purpose of installing,
inspecting, reading, repairing or removing any or all of its equipment or
facilities used in connection with the supply, metering and billing of water or
terminating service.
   (C)   Meters will be read at the time service is first established and
thereafter at the city’s regular periodic intervals approximately 30 days
apart.
   (D)   The city shall periodically submit a statement of charges and fees
accrued or estimated to have been accrued for each property or user connected
to the water service system. This statement shall be submitted to the owner of
the property, provided, however, that the owner may request in writing, upon a
form provided by the city, that such statement be submitted to a tenant, lessee
or other person so designated shall be the owner’s agent for purposes of
billing and notice under this chapter, and shall further provide for
acknowledgment by the owner of their continuing responsibility for all charges
or other obligations as shall be imposed by this chapter.
   (E)   (1)   Bills showing separately the consumption (in cubic feet) and
charge for each service connection as well as work orders, deposits and other
charges furnished will be rendered monthly and will become late if not paid
within 20 days after billing date and delinquent if not paid within 42 days
after billing date.
         (a)   The billing and notice schedule is as follows.
 
Read Meter Billing Billing Due Date Late Fee Charged
1-30 days  Day 1   Day 20           Day 21
Notes to Table:
Consumption starts on Day 1; therefore, the time period allowed before shut-
off can reflect up to 77 days of actual consumption
 
         (b)   Subsequent months billing includes late fees and:
 
Delinquent Notice Shutoff
Day 42            Day 47
 
         (c)   If the city is unable to read a water meter because of its
inaccessibility or otherwise, the city may estimate consumption. As an
alternative to estimation, the customer may provide the Water Department with
accurate readings on forms provided by the city. Every account shall be read by
city personnel at least once every six months. In no instance will the city
accept responsibility to hold keys to private property in order to obtain
readings of water meters.
      (2)   Residential owners may request that charges for metered services be
calculated using a “budget billing plan.” Budget bills will be rendered monthly
showing the consumption determined by the plan in addition to charges for each
service connection and work orders, deposits and other charges. The plan will
determine the billed consumption based on the actual metered consumption, the
budget amount and the deferred balance. The monthly bill amount is calculated
so as to bring the deferred balance to zero at end of each plan year. Thus,
while a customer’s bill may never be identical, it will tend to be very near
the same all year long.
      (3)   Residential owners requesting budget billing must have 12 months of
good credit history. Customers must agree to pay any unbilled charges upon
termination of the plan or termination of their account. The budget amount is
calculated over the previous 12 months of charges and may be adjusted by up to
5% during budget billing setup. Settle-up bills shall be prepared at the end of
the plan year or upon termination to bring the deferred balance amount to zero.
The plan may be terminated at the request of the customer, or by the city if
the customer becomes delinquent.
   (F)   Any user who fails to pay the entire utility bill within 20 days of
the billing date shall be charged a late payment fee in the amount of 2% of the
past due amount. This provision shall not apply to other governmental entities
receiving water service.
   (G)   No reduction of amounts billed will be made by reason of loss of water
due to waste caused by leakage of equipment of user. No set-off or credit for
water used to prevent freezing of pipes will be given.
   (H)   The city reserves the right to install such meters or other devices as
may be necessary for the efficient operation of the system for the detection
and prevention of fraud or waste without notice to owner. Whenever flat rate
service is furnished for a special use and a demonstrated abuse of such service
occurs, the city may, upon written notice to user, meter such service and bill
for water supplied under an applicable schedule.
   (I)   Should damage result to metering equipment from tampering or willful
neglect by user, the city will repair or replace such equipment and may bill
user for the actual city costs incurred.
   (J)   Meters will be inspected upon request or as needed. If requests for
testing of meters is made by the user, the city shall charge the user for the
city’s actual cost of making such test. When a meter is found to be more than
3% fast, the city will refund to the user the amount paid for such test, if
any, together with the overcharge based on the corrected meter readings for the
period in which the meter was in use, not exceeding six months.
(Prior Code, § 4-1410) (Ord. 18-12, passed 6-19-2018)
§ 51.11 RATE SCHEDULES AND CONTRACT.
   (A)   All rate schedules are based on service to one user at one point for
each class of service. For the purpose of billing, all meters serving a user’s
premises will be considered separately, and the readings will not be combined,
except that where, for operating convenience or necessity, the city elects to
install two or more meters instead of one meter at a central location, then the
readings of such meters may be combined and billed as one account.
   (B)   The city may require a contract for a period of one year or more when
user’s requirements are unusually large or require special or unusual
equipment.
(Prior Code, § 4-1411)
§ 51.12 RESPONSIBILITY.
   (A)   The user must obtain and furnish to the city all necessary permits to
enable the city to supply service.
   (B)   The owner shall be responsible for all damage or loss of the city’s
property located upon his or her premises unless occasioned by negligence of
the city. The owner shall pay all costs for replacement and/or repair of the
city’s meter resulting from user negligence such as failure to provide
protection from freezing or corrosion of the water meter. The use of water upon
the premises of owner is at the risk of owner. The responsibility of the city,
except for the meter, shall cease at the point of connection with the city’s
facilities.
   (C)   User shall be responsible for the installation and maintenance of all
piping, plumbing and equipment on user’s facilities beginning at the
corporation cock, including all costs associated therewith. The city shall not
be liable for any loss or damage of any nature whatsoever caused by any defect
in user’s service piping or in user’s equipment upon the premises of the city.
   (D)   The city does not undertake or agree to furnish or supply continuous
or uninterrupted service to its users over and above the maximum amount of
water available to the city as determined by the Joint Powers Water Board and
shall not be held responsible or liable to any user for any loss or damage
caused or occasioned by or arising from any interruption or delay in service,

      (1)   Customer. The customer has the primary responsibility for
preventing pollutants and contaminants from entering his or her potable water
system or the public water system. The customer’s responsibility starts at the
point of delivery (service connection corporation valve) and includes all of
his or her internal water system. The customer, at his or her own expense,
shall install, operate, test and maintain approved backflow prevention devices
as required by this chapter.
      (2)   City Building Inspection Office.
         (a)   The city, through the Building Inspector, has the responsibility
to review building plans and inspect plumbing as it is installed, as to prevent
cross-connections from being designed and built into structures within the
Plumbing Inspector’s jurisdiction. The Building Inspector’s inspection
responsibility begins at the service connection corporation valve or water
meter pit (on the customer side at this location) and continues throughout the
entire extent of the customer’s potable water system.
         (b)   Where any possibility that a cross-connection might be made or
where one is actually indicated by the plans, it shall be mandatory that
approved backflow prevention devices be indicated by the plans as determined by
the degree of hazard that the inspector reasonably determines will be present,
and such devices shall be properly installed.
      (3)   City Municipal Utilities Office. The city, through its Utilities
Office, the City Municipal Utilities Office, has the responsibility of owning,
operating and maintaining the public water system beginning at the source of
supply and including adequate treatment facilities, a public water distribution
system and service piping, and ending at the point of delivery to the
customer’s water system (service connection corporation valve). In addition,
the City Municipal Utility shall exercise reasonable vigilance to ensure that
the customer has taken the proper steps to protect the public potable water
system. If, in the judgment of the Administrator, an approved backflow device
is required at the city’s water service connection any customer’s premises, the
Administrator, or his or her delegated agent, may require by notice in writing
to said customer, that approved backflow prevention devices be installed.

hook-up permit will, therefore, only be issued in conjunction with or following
the issuance of a building permit.
   (D)   When the extent or nature of the use of a building or facility is
changed or expanded, credit shall be given for the amount paid for the original
permit, if the new use calls for a lower fee than originally paid or if the
extent of the use decreases.
   (E)   Unused and outstanding sewer hook-up permits shall remain valid until
used. If such permits were issued for use at a particular location or for a
particular type of facility, then they may only be so used.

§ 53.07 MONTHLY USER FEES FOR WASTEWATER TREATMENT FACILITY.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this chapter shall be to generate sufficient
revenue to pay all costs of operating and maintaining the complete wastewater
system. The costs shall be distributed to all users of the system in proportion
to each user’s contribution to the total loading of the treatment works.
Factors such as volume, strength and any other characteristic of the effluent
introduced to the system may be considered and included as a basis for the
determination of monthly user fees. Fees established hereunder shall be
sufficient to defray all costs of operation as determined pursuant to division
(B) below, without the need for any subsidy of wastewater treatment operations
from the General Fund of the city, or the fund of any other enterprise.
   (B)   Determining the total annual cost of operation and maintenance. The
city, or its authorized representative, shall determine the total annual costs
of operation and maintenance of the wastewater system which are necessary to
maintain the capacity and performance, during the life of the treatment works,
for which such works were designed and constructed. The total annual cost of
operation and maintenance determined hereby shall account for all factors
specified in Wyo. Stat. §§ 15-7-407 and 15-7-508, and shall include, but need
not be limited to, labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance,
necessary modification, power, sampling, laboratory tests, depreciation of
existing capital plant and rolling stock, service of bonded indebtedness and a
reasonable contingency fund. The governing body is further authorized to treat
the accumulation of funds for future capital improvements, planned and
unplanned, as an operating cost for the purposes of this division (B).
   (C)   Establishing user fees.
      (1)   User fees to be set by resolution. User fees for users of the
wastewater treatment system shall be determined from time to time by resolution
by the governing body of the city. Such fees shall recover the costs of
operation and maintenance of the wastewater system, as determined under
division (B) above.
      (2)   User categories authorized. In establishing fees for users of the
wastewater treatment system, the governing body shall base such fees upon the
gallons of water consumed by each user, except that the governing body may also
establish minimum monthly fees representing the cost of making wastewater
capacity and service available to a consumer, which minimum monthly fee shall
apply regardless of whether the consumer has utilized wastewater services
during that month. The governing body may further establish such user
categories as the governing body shall deem necessary and proper for rate-
setting purposes. Such categories may be based upon factors such as the
relative strength of effluent generated by each user or user category, as
measured by biochemical oxygen demand, total suspended solids and pH, of other
appropriate indicator of strength. Other appropriate bases of categorization
might include the usage of water which does not contribute to the volume or
load of the wastewater treatment facility, the necessity for constructing,
operating or maintaining lifting or pumping capacity and other factors bearing
a reasonable relationship to the operation of the wastewater treatment
facility.
      (3)   Public hearing to be held. A public hearing before the governing
body shall be held on any proposed changes in user fees and/or user categories
prior to their adoption. Notice of said hearing shall be published at least
once a week for two consecutive weeks in a local newspaper of general
circulation.
      (4)   Surcharge. The city may adopt monthly surcharge fees for each pound
of BOD, COD, TSS and FO&G as it finds is essential to recover costs for
treatment of concentrations above domestic sources. Rates shall be set
according to treatment and handling costs.
   (D)   Application for service. As set forth in §§

wastewater system without receiving permission therefore pursuant to this
chapter, fail to pay billed charges and fees within three months of the date
such payment was due or violate the provisions of this chapter regarding
pretreatment requirements, reporting requirements or prohibited wastes, the
city shall be empowered to terminate all sewer and water service to the
affected premises. Any termination of service, whether initiated by the city or
by the user, shall be in substantial accord with the procedures set forth in §
51.08, which section is by this reference adopted hereby as though set forth in
full. Wherever appropriate, the word “water” appearing therein shall include
the word “wastewater” for purposes of this section. Where necessary to effect
the termination of service, the city shall be authorized to install a curb stop
and shut-off valve upon the service line and bill the actual cost of same to

§ 53.10 PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE CITY FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY SEWER
BLOCKAGES AND/OR BACKUPS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to provide a procedure for
determining whether claims made against the city for damages caused by sewer
blockages and/or backups should be paid by the city and, in the event that
payment of such claims is appropriate, the appropriate payment amount.
   (B)   Claims procedure. Any person, firm, association or corporation that
owns property which receives sewer service from the city may file a claim for
payment of damages to such property which are alleged to have been caused by a
blockage and/or backup of the city sewer system. The City Clerk shall provide
forms to be completed by the claimant. Such form shall contain all information
necessary for the City Clerk to submit the claim to the city’s liability
insurance carrier.
   (C)   Payment of claims. All claims made pursuant to the provisions of the
claims procedure shall be submitted to the city’s liability insurance carrier.
If the city’s liability insurance carrier pays the claim, the city shall be
released from any further obligations arising from the claim. If the city’s
liability insurance carrier denies coverage on the claim, the claimant may
request that the claim be considered for payment by the governing body. The
maximum payment on such a claim shall be $500. If such a request is made, the
claim shall be referred to the City Sewer Committee which shall:
      (1)   Review the claim as well as any accompanying information, including
documentation or information provided by the city’s liability insurance
carrier;
      (2)   Determine whether the blockage occurred in the claimant’s service
line and/or was caused or occasioned by the claimant’s own actions;
      (3)   Determine whether the blockage and/or backup occurred in the city’s
main line, over which the city has responsibility for maintenance, as a result
of something unknown to and/or outside of the control of the city, in which
case the claim may be considered for payment by the City Council;
      (4)   Investigate and verify the extent of alleged property damage
suffered by the claimant and the cost of repair or replacement of the
claimant’s property; and
      (5)   If it is verified that the claimant’s property has been damaged due
to a blockage and/or backup of the city’s main sewer line which occurred as a
result of something unknown to and/or outside of the control of the city, the
governing body of the city may authorize payment for such damages.
   (D)   Time limitation for filing a claim. The city will not consider a claim
if the claim is received more than 30 days after the claimant’s notification of
denial from the city’s insurance carrier.

§ 54.083 PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.
   (A)   Except as specified, all significant industrial users and any other
required users must, at a frequency determined by the Control Authority, submit
no less than twice per year (June and December, or on dates specified by the
Control Authority) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants
in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured
or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the Control Authority or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.
   (B)   The Control Authority may authorize an industrial user subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated
by a categorical pretreatment standard if the industrial user has demonstrated
through sampling and other technical factors that the pollutant is neither
present nor expected to be present in the discharge, or is present only at
background levels from intake water and without any increase in the pollutant
due to activities of the industrial user. (See 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(e)(2).) This
authorization is subject to the following conditions.
      (1)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater.
      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual or general wastewater discharge permit, but
in no case longer than five years. The user must submit a new request for the
waiver before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual or
general wastewater discharge permit.
      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
industrial user must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes.
      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with this chapter and include the certification statement in §
54.093(A) (see 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(a)(2)(ii)).
      (5)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 C.F.R. part
136 with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis.
      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Control Authority must be
included as a condition in the user’s permit. The reasons supporting the waiver
and any information submitted by the user in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Control Authority for three years after expiration of the
waiver.
      (7)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the user’s
permit by the Control Authority, the industrial user must certify on each
report with the statement in §
54.093(C) that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream
due to activities of the industrial user.
      (8)   In the event that a waived pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the user’s operations,
the user must immediately comply with the monitoring requirements of division
(A) above or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Control
Authority and notify the Control Authority.
   (C)   All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with §
54.093(B).
   (D)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.
   (E)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location more
frequently than required by the Control Authority, using the procedures
prescribed in §
54.089, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
   (F)   All reports which have sampling or analysis reports attached shall
include the chain of custody form, self-monitoring report (SMR) certification,
the required flow sheets and lab certification statement.

accidental discharges, discharges of a non-routine, episodic nature, a non-
customary batch discharge, a slug discharge or slug load, that might cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and
notify the Control Authority of the incident. This notification shall include
the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if
known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless
waived by the Control Authority, submit a detailed written report describing
the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to
prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the
user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which might be incurred as
a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person
or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines,
penalties or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter.
   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user’s bulletin board or
other prominent place advising employees who to call in the event of a
discharge described in division (A) above. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who could cause such a discharge to occur are advised of the
emergency notification procedure. Significant industrial users are required to
notify the Control Authority immediately of any changes at its facility
affecting the potential for a slug discharge.

§ 54.088 NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.
   (A)   Any industrial user shall notify the city, in writing, of any
discharge into the POTW or a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would
be hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. Such notification to the city
shall be made within the appropriate time frames specified in §
54.085 or within 24 hours of becoming aware of the discharge, whichever is
shorter. Such notification must include:
      (1)   The name of the hazardous waste as set forth at 40 C.F.R. part 261;
      (2)   The EPA hazardous waste number;
      (3)   The type of discharge (continuous, batch or other);
      (4)   An identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the
wastes;
      (5)   An estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in
the waste stream discharged during that calendar month;
      (6)   An estimation of the mass of the constituents in the waste stream
expected to be discharged during the following 12 months;
      (7)   Certification that the industrial user has a program in place to
reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it
has determined to be economically practical; and
      (8)   Signatory certification as required by §
54.093.
   (B)   Any industrial user shall notify the EPA Regional Waste Management
Division Manager and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of the
discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed, or would
be hazardous waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261 and meets the reporting criteria
specified at 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p). Notification to the state and EPA is the
responsibility of the industrial user and shall be made as required under 40
C.F.R. § 403.12(p). The industrial user shall copy the city on all
notifications made to the state and the EPA.
   (C)   In the case of any new regulation under § 3001 of the Resource
Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. § 6921 identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substances as
hazardous waste, the industrial user must notify the city, the EPA Regional
Waste Management Waste Division Director and state hazardous waste authorities
of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.
   (D)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not
otherwise allowed to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued hereunder
or any applicable federal or state laws.

§ 54.089 ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 C.F.R. part 136
and amendments thereto, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 C.F.R. part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA
determines that the part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods or any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
Control Authority or other parties approved by EPA.
   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge.
Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly
operated, kept clean and maintained in good working order at all times. The
failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall
not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative
of its discharge.

§ 54.090 SAMPLE COLLECTION.
   Samples collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be based on data
obtained through appropriate sampling and analysis performed during the period
covered by the report, based on data that is representative of conditions
occurring during the reporting period.
   (A)   Except as indicated in divisions (B) and (C) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24-hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Control Authority. Where time-proportional composite sampling
or grab sampling is authorized by the city, the samples must be representative
of the discharge. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation)
specified in 40 C.F.R. part 136 and appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab
samples collected during a 24-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for cyanide, total phenols and sulfides, the samples may
be composited in the laboratory or in the field; and for volatile organics and
oil and grease, the samples may be composited in the laboratory. Composite
samples for other parameters unaffected by the compositing procedures as
documented in approved EPA methodologies may be authorized by the city, as
appropriate. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous limits.
   (B)   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total phenols,
sulfides, total petroleum hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds must be
obtained using grab collection techniques.
   (C)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and 90-day
compliance reports required in §§
54.080 and
54.082 (40 C.F.R. § 403.12(b) and (d)), a minimum of four grab samples must be
used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, total petroleum
hydrocarbons and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which historical
sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical sampling data
are available, the Control Authority may authorize a lower minimum. For the
reports required by §
54.083 (40 C.F.R. §§ 403.12(e) and (h)), the industrial user is required to
collect the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain and
make available for inspection and copying all records of information obtained
pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter, any additional
records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by
the user independent of such requirements and documentation associated with
best management practices established under §
54.022. Records shall include: the date, exact place, method and time of
sampling and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses
were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or
methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer
retention period by the Control Authority.

COMPLIANCE MONITORING
§ 54.105 RIGHT OF ENTRY INSPECTION AND SAMPLING.
   The Control Authority shall have the right to enter the premises of any user
to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this
chapter and any individual or general wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Control Authority ready access to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying and the performance of any additional duties.
   (A)   Where a user has security measures in force which require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation
of suitable identification, the Control Authority shall be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
   (B)   The Control Authority shall have the right to set up on the user’s
property or require installation of such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling and/or metering of the user’s operations.
      (1)   The monitoring facilities should normally be situated on the user’s
premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause
undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area and located so that, it will not be obstructed by
landscaping or parked vehicles.
      (2)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city’s
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within 60 days following
written notification by the city.
   (C)   The Control Authority may require the user to install monitoring
equipment as necessary. The facility’s sampling and monitoring equipment shall
be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user
at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality
shall be calibrated every quarter to ensure their accuracy.
   (D)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user
at the written or verbal request of the Control Authority and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be paid by the user.
   (E)   The Control Authority may use digital photography during an inspection
to documents conditions found on a site and/or as evidence.
   (F)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Control Authority access to the
user’s premises shall be a violation of this chapter.

§ 54.106 SEARCH WARRANTS.
   If the Control Authority has been refused access to a building, structure or
property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to
believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
of the city designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any permit or
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and
welfare of the community, the Control Authority may seek issuance of a search
warrant from the City Court and/or the County District Court.

§ 54.107 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater
discharge permit applications, individual or general wastewater discharge
permits and monitoring programs, and from the Control Authority’s inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction
unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Control Authority that the release of such information
would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to
protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must
be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When
requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such
information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might
disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for
inspection by the public but shall be made available immediately upon request
to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment
program and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the
report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other effluent data, as
defined in 40 C.F.R. § 2.302, shall not be recognized as confidential
information and shall be available to the public without restriction.

54.024;
      (2)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which 33% or more of wastewater measurements taken for each pollutant
parameter during a six-month period equals or exceeds the product of the
numeric pretreatment standard or requirement, including instantaneous limits,
as defined by §§
54.020 through
54.024, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils and
grease and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement as
defined by §§
54.080 through
54.093 (daily maximum, long-term average, instantaneous limit or narrative
standard) that the Control Authority determines has caused, alone or in
combination with other discharges, interference or passthrough, including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public;
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 54.120 NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.
   When the Control Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Control Authority may serve upon that user a written notice
of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of such notice, an explanation of
the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention
thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user
to the Control Authority. Submission of such a plan in no way relieves the user
of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice
of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Control
Authority to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.
(Prior Code, § 7-420) (Ord. 2013-15, passed 10-1-2013; Ord. 2015-02, passed 4-

§ 54.121 CONSENT ORDERS.
   The Control Authority may enter into consent orders, assurances of
compliance or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such documents shall include specific action to
be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period
specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect
as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §§
54.123 and
54.124 and shall be judicially enforceable.

§ 54.122 SHOW CAUSE HEARING.
   The Control Authority may order a user which has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, to appear before the Control Authority and show cause why the
proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement
action, the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why
the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting
shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt
requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user, as defined in §
54.005, and required by §
54.060(A). A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite
for, taking any other action against the user.

§ 54.123 COMPLIANCE ORDERS.
   When the Control Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, the Water Reclamation Facility Superintendent may issue an
order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come
into compliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring
and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants
discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for
compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement, nor does a
compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any
continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

§ 54.124 CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.
   When the Control Authority finds that a user has violated, or continues to
violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard
or requirement, or that the user’s past violations are likely to recur, the
Control Authority may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and
desist all such violations and directing the user to:
   (A)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and
   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed
to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting
operations and/or terminating the discharge. Issuance of a cease and desist
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.

   (A)   When the Control Authority finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Control Authority may fine such user
in an amount not to exceed $1,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-
violation, per-day basis. In the case of monthly or other long-term average
discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of
violation.
   (B)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for
the Control Authority to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the
fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has
merit, the Control Authority may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event
the user’s appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest
accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The Control Authority may add
the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and
orders, to the fine.
   (C)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

§ 54.126 EMERGENCY SUSPENSIONS.
   The Control Authority may immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge, which reasonably appears to present, or cause
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons.
The Control Authority may also immediately suspend a user’s discharge, after
notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to
the environment.
   (A)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately
stop or eliminate its contribution. In the event of a user’s failure to
immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Control Authority
may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving
stream or endangerment to any individuals. The Control Authority may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the
satisfaction of the Control Authority that the period of endangerment has
passed, unless the termination proceedings in §
54.127 are initiated against the user.
   (B)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge
presenting imminent endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement,
describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to
prevent any future occurrence, to the Control Authority prior to the date of
any show cause or termination hearing under §§
54.122 or
54.127. Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing
prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

§ 54.127 TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.
   In addition to the provisions in §
54.067, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge
termination:
   (A)   Violation of individual or general wastewater discharge permit
conditions;
   (B)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and
characteristics of its discharge;
   (C)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater
volume, constituents and characteristics prior to discharge; and/or
   (D)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises for the purpose of
inspection, monitoring or sampling.

   (A)   When the Control Authority finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual or general
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Control Authority may petition the
City Court and/or the District Court of the county through the City Attorney
for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual or general
wastewater discharge permit, order or other requirement imposed by this chapter
on activities of the user.
   (B)   The Water Reclamation Facility Superintendent may also seek such other
action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against a user.

§ 54.129 REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.
   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive. The Control
Authority may take any, all or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in
accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan (ERP). However, the
Control Authority may take other action against any user when the circumstances
warrant. Further, the Control Authority is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.

§ 54.133 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS.
   (A)   Upset.
      (1)   For the purpose of this division (A), UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user. An UPSET does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance or careless or
improper operation.
      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (A)(3) below are met.
      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset
shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs or
other relevant evidence that:
         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the
upset;
         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent and
workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         (c)   The user has submitted the following information to Control
Authority within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information
is provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five days):
            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of
noncompliance;
            2.   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times
or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to
continue; and
            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and
prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the
occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (5)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial determination on
any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards.
      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power
of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (B)   Prohibited discharge standards. The user shall have an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncompliance with the
general prohibitions or the specific prohibitions in §
54.020 if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause passthrough or interference and that either:
      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was
in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the passthrough or
interference; or
      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user’s prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of
interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or disposal
requirements.
   (C)   Bypass.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (C), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         BYPASS. The intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of
a user’s treatment facility.
         SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE. Substantial physical damage to property,
damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inoperable, or
substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be
expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE does not
mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (2)   Exceptions. A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses
are not subject to the provision of divisions (C)(3) and (C)(4) below.
      (3)   Bypass notifications.
         (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Control Authority, at least ten days before the date
of the bypass, if possible.
         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Water Reclamation
Facility Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain: a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass,
including exact dates and times and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The Control Authority
may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has
been received within 24 hours.
      (4)   Bypass prohibited.
         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Control Authority may take an
enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:
            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;
            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
            3.   The user submitted notices as required under division (C)(3)
above.
         (b)   The Control Authority may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Control Authority determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in division (C)(4)(a) above.

§ 54.134 ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE PLAN.
   (A)   Enforcement response plan contents. Pursuant to 40 C.F.R. § 403.8(f)5
(vii), the city has developed and implemented an enforcement response plan
containing detailed procedures on how the city’s POTW will investigate and
respond to instances of commercial or industrial user noncompliance/violations.
The plan provides for:
      (1)   A description of how the POTW will investigate instances of
noncompliance;
      (2)   A description of the types of escalating enforcement responses the
POTW will take in response to all anticipated types of industrial use
violations and the time periods within which the responses will take place;
      (3)   Identify by title of the official(s) responsible for each type of
response; and
      (4)   Adequately reflect the POTW’s primary responsibility to enforce all
applicable pretreatment requirements and standards.
   (B)   Enforcement response plan actions. As part of the city’s enforcement
response plan, the city may suspend the water service and/or wastewater
treatment service and/or wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an imminent or
substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of the person(s), to the
environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate any
condition of its NPDES permit.

   (A)   Civil penalties.
      (1)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of
this chapter, an individual or general wastewater discharge permit or order
issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall be
liable to the city for a civil penalty.
         (a)   The amount of such civil penalty may be levied regardless of the
amount of damage.
         (b)   The amount of such penalty shall not exceed $1,000 nor exceed

         (c)   In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge
limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
         (d)   Each day upon which a violation occurs or continues shall
constitute a separate violation. Such penalties may be recovered by judicial

         (e)   This remedy is cumulative, and recourse thereto shall not limit
recourse to the criminal provisions of this chapter or any other remedy
provided by law.
      (2)   The Control Authority may recover reasonable attorneys’ fees, court
costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including
sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual damages incurred
by the city.
      (3)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take
into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to, the
extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user’s violation, corrective
actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other factor as
justice requires.
      (4)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
   (B)   Criminal prosecution.
      (1)   A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this
chapter, an individual or general wastewater discharge permit or order issued

§ 90.08 CERTAIN DOMESTIC ANIMALS PROHIBITED.
   (A)   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep or maintain within the

   It shall be unlawful for any person to keep a vicious animal, cross animal
or any animal that manifests a disposition to injure persons or present a risk
to people or other pets, without having the animal physically confined in a
secure enclosure or leashed and muzzled at all times. Upon conviction of a
violation of this section, the City Attorney may petition the Municipal Court
for an order to have the animal destroyed. Should the Municipal Court determine
that the animal is to be destroyed, the Municipal Court may issue a warrant or
order to cause the seizure and destruction of the animal.
(Prior Code, § 3-528) Penalty, see §

§ 90.10 DISPOSAL ORDER.
   (A)   In the interest of the health, safety and general welfare of the
residents of the city, the Municipal Judge may order that an animal which has
been found diseased, adjudged vicious or is a habitual violator of any of the
provisions of this chapter, be disposed of.
   (B)   The order of the Municipal Judge shall be written and shall be served
upon the owner of the animal. If the owner does not obtain a stay of the order
from a court of competent jurisdiction within ten days of the date of service,
the order shall be carried out by the animal control officer, and, in so doing,
the animal control officer may go upon any property, public or private, within
the city.
   (C)   In the event that the owner of the animal which is the subject of the
disposal order is ready and willing to surrender said animal to the animal
control officer for disposal, the owner shall be allowed a period of 24 hours
(said period commencing from the point at which the disposal order is signed by
the Judge) to do so. If, however, upon affidavits filed, or other satisfactory
proof to him or her made, the Judge of the Municipal Court determines that said
owner is not willing to voluntarily surrender said animal, or if a willing
owner fails to surrender an animal within 24 hours, the Municipal Judge may,
without further notice to the owner, direct the animal control officer to
forthwith apprehend said animal and carry out the disposal order. In all cases,
the determination of the willingness or unwillingness of the owner to surrender
the animal shall be left solely to the discretion of the Municipal Judge, whose
primary concern shall be the prevention of any attempt by the owner to subvert
the purpose of this section.
   (D)   Any animal disposed of in accordance with this section, or any other
section of this chapter, shall be humanely terminated.
(Prior Code, § 3-529)
§ 90.11 ANIMAL FECES.
   (A)   It is the responsibility of owners and property occupants to keep
their property free of animal feces so as not to present a potential danger to
the public health nor to create a situation where offensive odors are emanating
from the property. The failure to meet this responsibility shall be unlawful.
   (B)   It shall be unlawful for any person to spread, scatter, distribute or
deposit in any manner any animal feces on property not owned or occupied by
them without the express permission of the owner or occupant of the property.
(Prior Code, § 3-530) Penalty, see §
90.99
§ 90.12 DISEASE CONTROL.
   (A)   Any person owning or harboring a dog or cat over the age of six months
shall have such dog or cat vaccinated against rabies and distemper by a
licensed veterinarian.
   (B)   A person who has been bitten by any animal, or the parent or guardian
of such person, shall promptly report the incident to the animal control
officer or the Police Department. It is the duty of the animal control officer,
when such report is made, to use all reasonable efforts to promptly apprehend
and impound the animal for quarantine. If the animal is in the custody of its
owner, the owner shall, forthwith, surrender said animal. If the animal is at
large when apprehended, the animal control officer shall use reasonable
diligence to identify the owner and notify him or her of the animal’s
impoundment. The animal control officer shall notify the appropriate health
officials.
   (C)   (1)   The animal shall be impounded and quarantined at the owner’s
expense for a period of ten days at the Municipal Animal Shelter. At the
owner’s request and expense, the animal may be quarantined under the
supervision of and on the secure premises of a licensed veterinarian. The
animal control officer rather than impounding the animal may allow for home
quarantine on the premises of the owner; provided, that the owner:
         (a)   Proves the animal recently had rabies and distemper shots;
         (b)   Has properly licensed the animal (or does so within 48 hours);
         (c)   Has, in the opinion of the animal control officer, suitable
quarantine facilities; and
         (d)   Submits to daily inspections by the animal control officer of
the animal and the quarantine premises during the quarantine period.
      (2)   Failure to abide by any of the quarantine rules will result in the
impoundment of the animal. A violation of this division (C) is a misdemeanor.
   (D)   If, after the end of the ten-day period, the animal is declared free
of disease by a licensed veterinarian, the animal may be returned to the owner.
If impounded in the Animal Control Center, it will be returned to the owner by
the animal control officer only upon payment of all accrued impound and
boarding charges. If the owner has not been found or refuses or fails to pay
the appropriate fees, the animal shall be disposed of or placed up for adoption
after the ten days. In any case, the appropriate health officials shall be
notified of the animal’s condition at the end of the ten-day quarantine.
   (E)   Any animal suspected of having been exposed to rabies or some other
contagious disease may, by order of the Municipal Judge upon petition of the
animal control officer, be impounded and quarantined as herein provided.
   (F)   No person shall kill any animal suspected of being rabid until after
the animal has been quarantined as herein provided and a diagnosis of rabies
has been made by a licensed veterinarian. If a veterinarian diagnoses rabies in
an animal quarantined, then the animal shall be humanely destroyed and the head
of such animal sent to a laboratory for pathological examination and
confirmation of the diagnosis. If the suspected animal is so vicious and/or
wild that it cannot be captured, and the police officer or animal control
officer reasonably believes that capture is unlikely, the animal may be killed
by a police officer with gunshot. When dead, the animal’s head is to be severed
from its body and the head sent to the state laboratory for examination.
   (G)   If the owner of any animal impounded for quarantine is unknown, the
city shall bear the expense of the quarantine. Any animal for which the city
assumes financial responsibility for quarantine expenses shall become the
property of the city and be adopted out or disposed of as set forth in §
90.20.
   (H)   When an animal under quarantine has been diagnosed by a licensed
veterinarian as being diseased, the animal control officer shall report the
findings and recommendations to the Mayor, who may issue a proclamation, which
shall be published at least once in an official newspaper in the city,
requiring the owner of every animal to confine or securely muzzle it for such
time of quarantine as specified in the proclamation; during which time it shall
be unlawful for any animal to be allowed outside the premises of its owner. It
shall be the duty of the animal control officer to capture and impound, as such
proclamation may direct, every animal found at large contrary to such
proclamation after expiration of 12 hours from the first publication thereof.
   (I)   The above divisions shall apply to dogs, cats or other animal species
in which the known incubation period for rabies is ten days, as determined by
the State Department of Health. If the animal species has a known incubation
period for rabies as determined by the Department of Health, which differs from
the ten days, then the different incubation period shall be used as the
quarantine period instead of ten days.
   (J)   If any animal, including wild animals, as defined in §
90.02, bites a person and there is no known incubation period for rabies for
the species of animal as determined by the Department of Health, the following
provisions shall apply.
      (1)   The person who was bitten by the animal, or the parent or guardian
of such person, shall comply with division (B) above.
      (2)   The animal control officer shall use all reasonable efforts to
apprehend the animal.
      (3)   If the animal can be apprehended, it shall be destroyed by the
animal control officer or an officer of the City Police Department.
      (4)   The head of the animal shall be sent to a laboratory for
pathological examination for rabies.
      (5)   The animal control officer shall advise the person who was bitten,
or his or her parent or guardian, of the laboratory results and take any
additional action to preserve the public health, including advising the Mayor
of any public health risks, who may proclaim a quarantine under division (H)
above.
   (K)   No person shall fail to disclose the known location of any animal
which is required to be apprehended under this chapter, or interfere or impede
with the activities of a police officer or the animal control officer in the
performance of his or her duties under this chapter. A violation of this
division (K) is a misdemeanor.

injury to an animal shall immediately stop and render such assistance as may be

Control Department. Failure to do so shall be unlawful.
   (E)   It shall be unlawful for any person to dye or in any other manner
change the color of, or sell, exchange, offer to sell or exchange, display or
give away, any chicks, ducklings or any other fowl or rabbits under eight weeks

90.99

disfigure any animal except as affirmatively provided in this chapter, or
administer poison, or cause to be ingested any hazardous foreign object by any
animal, or expose any poisonous substance with the intent that it shall be
taken by any animal other than pests of public health concern, such as rats or
mice.
   (B)   This section does not limit the actions of a police officer or animal
control officer when the officer determines the existence of a public safety
danger.
(Prior Code, § 3-533) Penalty, see §
90.99
§ 90.15 FURNISHING FOOD TO IMPOUNDED ANIMALS.
   (A)   Every person who impounds, or causes to be impounded, any animal in
any pound, corral or other enclosure, or who confines an animal to any specific
area by any means whatsoever, shall supply to the animal during confinement a
sufficient quantity of wholesome food and pure water.
   (B)   (1)   When any animal impounded, or otherwise confined or restrained,
is without food and/or water for more than 24 successive hours, it shall be
lawful for any persons to enter into the area in which the animal is confined
and supply the animal with food and water as often as necessary so long as the
animal remains confined.
      (2)   Any person entering property to supply food and/or water to an
animal restrained or confined is not liable in any action for the entry, and
the reasonable cost of the food and water may be collected by him or her from
the owner of the animal.
   (C)   If the animal control officer comes upon an animal impounded as
described in division (B) above, he or she shall post a notice to comply with
this section upon the premises where the animal is located. If the notice has

protection against weather extremes. All kennel buildings must be adequately
heated and ventilated. Cage or run floors, unless radiantly heated, shall have

age within the city which has not been licensed. The owner of a dog or cat
shall, immediately after such animal has attained the age of six months,
license the animal with the city. Said license shall be effective for one year.
Each owner must re-license said dog or cat on or before the expiration of one
year from the issuance date and shall pay a fee according to a fee schedule as
determined by the Police Department and approved by the governing body.
   (B)   No license is required of:
      (1)   Dogs whose owners are nonresidents if such animals are not kept in
the city more than 30 days, provided such animals are kept under proper
restraint and other applicable provisions of this chapter are met;
      (2)   Seeing eye dogs properly trained to assist blind persons when such
dogs are actually being used as guide dogs. Such dogs may be licensed at no
charge if the owner desires to do so; or
      (3)   Governmentally owned police or guard dogs. Such dogs may be
licensed at no charge if the owner desires to do so.
   (C)   The City Clerk shall keep a permanent record of all licenses issued.
Said record shall show the name and address of the person issued a license, the
number of the license and tag, the type, sex, breed and color of the animal,
the date issued and the fee paid.
   (D)   Vaccination for rabies and distemper is a condition precedent to
issuance of a license. A current certificate of vaccination shall accompany an
application for licensing of any dog or cat. Without such proof, no license
shall be issued. Each owner of a dog or cat shall at all times maintain a
current vaccination for rabies and distemper for each dog or cat over six
months of age.
   (E)   (1)   Upon payment of the required license fee, the city shall deliver
to the owner of the animal a substantial tag, stamped with a number
corresponding to the number of the entry made by the city in a book kept for
the recording of information relative to the licensing of animals. The tag may
be either collar-type or ear-type. Tags shall be worn by all dogs when not
confined upon the owner’s property, provided that owners of show dogs or AKC
registered dogs may have them tattooed with an identifying number, which number
must be endorsed upon the license certificate and records of the City Clerk.
Animals tattooed need not wear tags.
      (2)   Licensed veterinarians doing business within the city may apply for
permission to license dogs and/or cats on behalf of the city pursuant to the
provisions set forth above. Such veterinarians shall keep records related to
license sales and shall deliver records and fees collected to the city as
required by the Department of Finance and Administration. The city shall
thereafter remit to such veterinarians $1 from each license sold for
administrative expense.
   (F)   In the event a license tag is lost, the owner may obtain a duplicate
tag upon payment to the city of $3. If there is a change in ownership of the
dog during the license year, the new owner may have the current license
transferred to his or her name upon payment of $1. A licensing tag shall be
used only for the animal licensed. No person other than the owner shall remove
a collar or license tag from a licensed animal.

held for a period of five days. If not reclaimed by the owner during that
period, it shall become the property of the city and shall be at the discretion
of the animal control officer either placed up for adoption or humanely
destroyed. To reclaim an animal, all accrued impound and boarding fees on all
animals shall be paid by the owner.
      (2)   In the event that a set of extraordinary circumstances arises
which, in the discretion of the animal control officer, would make strict
enforcement of this division (B) unjust, the animal control officer may
disregard the mandates of this section, and, within reason, deal with the
situation as he or she sees fit.
   (C)   (1)   If, in the discretion of a licensed veterinarian, any animal is,
by reason of disease or physical condition, too dangerous to the health of any
other animal or to itself to keep impounded, such animal may be euthanized. If
a licensed veterinarian cannot be contacted by reasonable means, the animal
control officer may euthanize an animal which is, by reason of disease or
physical condition, obviously too dangerous to the health of any other animal
or to itself to keep impounded. The animal control officer shall take steps to
acquire an immediate pathological examination of such animal euthanized for
health reasons.
      (2)   This division (C) shall apply also to any animal which is maimed
and/or suffering from any injury causing the animal needless pain or suffering.
   (D)   The animal control officer will assign each impounded animal a number
which is to be recorded, along with available information about the animal,
date and place of impoundment, date of release or other disposition, name of
the owner if known, whether reclaimed, destroyed or adopted, if reclaimed or
adopted, by whom, and if destroyed, then when and how.
   (E)   Any animal impounded for any reason under the authority of this
chapter shall be released to the owner thereof only upon payment to the city of
fees and charges related to the impoundment and boarding of the animal. Said
fees shall be determined by a schedule of fees established by the Police
Department and approved by the governing body. A boarding fee equal to that
charged by the actual place of boarding shall be charged when an animal
impounded is not boarded at the city’s animal control facilities.
      (1)   An impoundment fee of $40 per dog if licensed and $60 if
unlicensed, and $30 per cat or other animal if licensed and $40 if unlicensed;
      (2)   A boarding fee of $5 animal for each night the animal is impounded;
and
      (3)   A boarding fee equal to that charged by the actual place of
boarding shall be charged when an animal impounded is not boarded at the city’s
animal control facilities.
   (F)   No steel-jaw type traps or any other type of trap other than live
traps approved by the animal control officer shall be used for the capture of
animals by any person or organization whatsoever. However, such traps may be
used as a last resort by the city to catch wild animals within the city;
provided, that all other reasonable means to subdue or to take possession of
the animal is first attempted. Reasonable means include, but are not limited
to, nets, tranquilizer guns and sonic equilibrium disrupters.

   (A)   Animals placed up for adoption may be adopted out to any person deemed
by the animal control officers to be a responsible and suitable owner, one who
will agree to comply with the provisions of this chapter and all amendments. No
animal shall be adopted out until the appropriate fee is paid, except that a
nonprofit animal rescue organization may adopt animals without paying a fee.
   (B)   Any animal made available for adoption under the authority of this
chapter shall be adopted out to the first responsible person tendering payment
of the appropriate fee in accordance with a schedule of fees established by the

SMOKING IN PUBLIC PLACES
§ 91.40 PURPOSE; FINDINGS.
   (A)   The governing body of the city does find that:
      (1)   Numerous peer reviewed studies have found that tobacco smoke is a
major contributor to indoor air pollution and that breathing secondhand smoke
is a cause of disease in healthy nonsmokers, including heart disease, stroke,
respiratory disease and lung cancer. At special risk are children, elderly
people, individuals with cardiovascular disease and individuals with impaired
respiratory function, including asthmatics and those with obstructive airway
disease;
      (2)   Health hazards induced by breathing secondhand smoke include lung
cancer, heart disease, respiratory infection and decreased respiratory
function, including broncho-constriction and broncho-spasm; and
      (3)   A significant amount of secondhand smoke exposure occurs in the
workplace. Employees who work in smoke-filled businesses suffer a 25% to 50%
higher risk of heart attack and higher rates of death from cardiovascular
disease and cancer, as well as increased acute respiratory disease and
measurable decrease in lung function.
   (B)   Accordingly, the governing body finds and declares that the purposes
of the ordinance codified in this subchapter are:
      (1)   To protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in
public places and places of employment; and
      (2)   To guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breathe smoke-free air and
to recognize that the need to breathe smoke-free air shall have priority over
the desire to smoke.
(Prior Code, § 4-1601)
§ 91.41 DEFINITIONS.

   (B)   The state and the city have a wide range of cultural resources that
include prehistoric and historic sites which are invaluable relics that remain
to illustrate the state’s past. The City Council hereby find that the state and
the city are noteworthy for their historic sites and natural beauty. The city
has many residential and commercial structures with architectural significance
and some settlement period historic sites. In recent years, many significant
structures and historic and archaeological sites have been destroyed without
adequate consideration of either the values represented therein or the
possibility of preserving the properties for use in economically productive
ways. Citizens of the city share the belief that the state’s cultural resources
enhance the quality of life for all and promote the city’s general welfare. It
is hereby declared a matter of public policy that the protection, enhancement
and perpetuation of significant historical, archaeological and architectural
relics of value is a public necessity and is required in the interest of
health, prosperity, safety and welfare of the people. The purpose of this
section is to:
      (1)   Effect and accomplish the protection, enhancement and perpetuation
of such improvements and of districts which represent or reflect elements of
the city’s cultural, social, economic, political, engineering and architectural
history;
      (2)   Safeguard the city’s historic, archaeological and cultural
heritage, as embodied and reflected in such historic structures, sites and
districts;
      (3)   Stabilize and improve property values;
      (4)   Foster civic pride in the beauty and noble accomplishments of the
past;
      (5)   Protect and enhance the city’s attractions to residents, tourists
and visitors and serve as a support and stimulus to business and industry to
strengthen the economy of the city; and
      (6)   Promote the use of historic structures, sites and districts for the
education, pleasure and welfare of the people of the city.
   (C)   The City Council enacts this chapter as stated above to help preserve
the state’s heritage. The City Council also endorses the state’s certified
local government program and agrees to participate in this historic
preservation program. The city has the ability to participate in the CLG
program by provisions specified in Wyo. Stat. § 16-1-101.

prehistory or history.

   (H)   Owners must be notified of the designation decision within 14 days of
the Commission meeting. The State Historic Preservation Office and other
agencies, as appropriate, shall be notified of designation by the Commission.
Within 30 days of the date on which the City Council ratifies designation of
any site, building, structure, district or object as worthy of preservation,
the Commission shall cause to be filed with the appropriate legal entity a

against the pawnbroker, and, in the case of a successful action to enforce such
liability, the costs of the action together with the attorneys’ fees as

§ 116.01 PURPOSE OF FINDINGS.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to regulate sexually-oriented
businesses in the interests of the health, safety and general welfare of the
citizens of the city and to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to
address the deleterious secondary effects that occur when sexually-oriented
businesses are concentrated in a given area. It is not the purpose of this
chapter to impose restrictions or limitations upon the content of any
communication protected by the First Amendment to the United States
Constitution, or Article 1, § 20 of the State Constitution, including sexually-
oriented materials.
   (B)   Based on evidence and testimony concerning the adverse secondary
effects of adult uses on the community presented in public hearings, and in
reports made available to the governing body of the city, and on findings
incorporated in the cases of City of Renton v. Playtime Theaters, Inc., 475
U.S. 41 (U.S. 1986); Young v. American Mini Theaters, 427 U.S. 50 (U.S. 1976);
Barnes v. Glen Theater, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (U.S. 1991); Abilene v. Dickinson
County Commissioners, 492 F.3d 1164 (10th Cir. 2007); American Bush v. South
Salt Lake, 140 P.3d 1235 (Ut. 2006); Arcara v. Cloud Books, 478 U.S. 697 (U.S.
1986); California v. LaRue, 409 U.S. 109 (1972); City of Erie v. Pap’s, 529
U.S. 277 (U.S. 2000); Heideman v. South Salt Lake, 165 Fed. Appx. 627 (10th
Cir. 2006); Ino Ino v. Bellevue, 937 P.2d 154 (Wa. 1997); and Schad v. Ephraim
452 U.S. 61 (U.S. 1981); on studies in other communities, including, but not
limited to: Phoenix, Arizona; Denver, Colorado; Adams County, Colorado; Dallas,
Texas; Garden Grove, California; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Manatee County,
Florida; and New York, New York; and also on findings from the Attorney
General’s Commission on Pornography, Final Report, 1986; testimony presented to
the Ohio House Civil and Commercial Law Committee: Sexually-Oriented
Businesses: An Insider’s View by Former Dancer in Strip Clubs from Indiana,
April 28, 2004; and, upon police records produced by the City Police
Department, the governing body finds as follows.
      (1)   Sexually-oriented businesses lend themselves to certain ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities that are often uncontrolled by the operators
of the establishments. Further, there is presently no mechanism in the city to
make the owners of these establishments responsible for the activities that may
occur on their premises.
      (2)   The documented evidence shows that sexually-oriented businesses,
because of their very nature, have a deleterious effect on both existing
businesses around them and the surrounding residential areas adjacent to them,
causing among other adverse secondary effects, increased crime and downgrading
of property values.
      (3)   The evidence shows that sexually-oriented businesses, due to their
nature, have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly
when they are operating in close proximity to each other, thereby contributing
to crime, lower property values, urban blight and downgrading of the quality of
life in the adjacent area.
      (4)   The evidence shows that sexually-oriented businesses are frequently
used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution.
      (5)   The evidence shows increased crime and unhealthful conduct tend to
accompany, concentrate around and be aggravated by sexually-oriented
businesses, including, but not limited to, prostitution, drug use and
distribution, pandering, public indecency, public disturbances and exposing
minors to harmful materials.
      (6)   Sexually-oriented businesses have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial
governmental concerns.
      (7)   The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of
the city will be promoted by the enactment of this chapter.

§ 151.01 FINDINGS.
   The governing body of the city finds that the presence of vacant and
abandoned commercial structures creates an element of neighborhood blight. It
is recognized that blight lowers property values, leads to deteriorating
housing conditions, undermines the quality of life, affects the public health,
safety and general welfare, and can also result in human injury and criminal
activities.
(Prior Code, § 4-1701)
§ 151.02 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   ACCESSORY BUILDING. A subordinate structure on the same premises as the main
commercial structure, the use of which would be naturally and normally
incidental to that of the main structure, whether the main structure is a
vacant and/or abandoned commercial structure or not, such as, but not limited
to, a garage, barn or storage shed or structure.
   OWNER. Any person with a legal or equitable ownership interest in the
property.
   SECURED. A building which has all points of entry into the structure either:
      (1)   Closed by use of windows and doors which are in proper working
order, intact, without holes or broken elements and are locked; or
      (2)   Are secured by exterior grade plywood in accordance with this
chapter.
   VACANT AND/OR ABANDONED COMMERCIAL STRUCTURE. Any building which has been
used or was intended for use as a commercial structure, in whole or in part,
including an accessory building, and which has become or has been vacant and/or
abandoned for a period of at least 180 consecutive days and which also meets at
least one of the following conditions:
      (1)   Is open to casual entry or trespass;
      (2)   Is fire damaged to an extent which prohibits safe human occupancy;
      (3)   Is the site of loitering or vagrancy;
      (4)   Demonstrates a lack of property maintenance and upkeep as evidenced
by one or more apparent violations of the applicable ordinances of the city or
state law;
      (5)   Has been cited for being in violation of city ordinances;
      (6)   Has been secured or boarded up for at least 90 days;
      (7)   Has no metered utilities connected or in use;
      (8)   Is under a condemnation notice or legal order to vacate;
      (9)   Is structurally unsound; or
      (10)   Is a potential hazard or danger to persons.
(Prior Code, § 4-1702) (Ord. 2021-19, passed 1-4-2022)
§ 151.03 REGISTRATION.
   The owner of any property containing one or more vacant and/or abandoned
commercial structures shall register said property with the Urban Renewal
Agency of the city and pay an annual administration fee. The owner of any such
property has a duty to register the property regardless of whether the owner
has received any prior notice from the city. Registration of property
containing a vacant and/or abandoned commercial structure does not preclude the
city from taking appropriate action to secure a structure, to repair or abate
dangerous, hazardous or unlawful conditions, or to eliminate imminent hazards
to public health and safety. Registration of property containing a vacant and/
or abandoned commercial structure does not relieve the owner of the duty to
comply with applicable building codes adopted pursuant to the ordinances of the
city.
(Prior Code, § 4-1703) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.04 REGISTRATION INFORMATION.
   (A)   The owner of each property containing one or more vacant and/or
abandoned commercial structures shall register the property with the Urban
Renewal Agency of the city and provide the following information on a vacant
and/or abandoned commercial structure registration form:
      (1)   The address of the property containing one or more vacant and/or
abandoned commercial structures;
      (2)   The legal name(s) and mailing address of each owner of the

as the name and address of the person to whom any notice shall be sent;
      (5)   The reason the owner is maintaining a vacant and/or abandoned
commercial structure on the property;
      (6)   The estimated length of time any vacant and/or abandoned commercial
structure is expected to remain vacant or abandoned; and
      (7)   A description of plans for restoration, reuse or removal of any

commercial structures, as defined in §
151.02, shall pay an annual vacant and/or abandoned commercial structure
registration fee in the amount of $500 and an annual administrative fee in the
amount of $250. Fees paid pursuant to this section shall be used to defray the
expenses incurred by the Urban Renewal Agency and the city to monitor and
enforce any applicable ordinances.
   (B)   The first annual administrative fee for a property shall be paid on or
before the first day of the month following the date upon which the property is
determined to contain a vacant and/or abandoned commercial structure, as
defined in §
151.02. Subsequent annual administrative fees shall be due on the first
business day after the expiration of one year from the date the previous annual
administrative fee was paid; provided, however, that no subsequent annual
administrative fee shall be due if the property no longer contains any vacant
and/or abandoned commercial structure.
   (C)   The failure to register a vacant and/or abandoned commercial
structure, as defined in §
151.02, or to pay an annual administrative fee, when the same shall become due,
shall subject the property owner to the penalties set forth in accordance with
§
151.99. Any owner of a property containing a vacant and/or abandoned commercial
structure who fails to make timely payment of the required annual
administration fee set forth herein, within 30 days after it becomes due and
owing, shall be subject to a late fee in the amount of $10 per month.

151.99
§ 151.06 RECOVERY OF FEES.
   If all or part of the fees required by this chapter are not paid or are
overdue, the Urban Renewal Agency of the city may recover such sums by any
lawful means available.
(Prior Code, § 4-1706)
§ 151.07 SECURING STRUCTURES.
   (A)   A request by the URA to secure a vacant and/or abandoned commercial

ordinances and related building codes, the city shall secure the structure, and
the owner shall be responsible for costs incurred.

entry on a vacant and/or abandoned commercial structure such that all exterior
openings suitable for animal or human entry are secured as follows.

secured by use of exterior grade plywood or its equivalent, cut to the size of
the opening and secured by the use of appropriate fasteners.
      (2)   Entry points above the first story or not accessible from ground
level shall be secured by use of exterior grade plywood or its equivalent cut
to the size of the opening and secured by the use of appropriate fasteners.
(Prior Code, § 4-1707) Penalty, see §
151.99
§ 151.08 RIGHT OF ENTRY; RE-INSPECTIONS.
   If the owner has failed to secure a property and it has been secured by the
city, the city may enter or re-enter the structure to conduct necessary
inspections to ensure compliance with the requirements of this chapter and to
determine if there are any emergency or hazardous conditions.
(Prior Code, § 4-1708)
§ 151.09 REUSE AND OCCUPANCY.
   No owner shall perform, or cause to be performed any work, to reconstruct,
repair, remodel or otherwise improve any vacant and/or abandoned commercial
structure, without having obtained building permits as required by the
ordinances of the city. No vacant and/or abandoned commercial structure shall
be re-occupied until the required building permits have been obtained, said
structure has been inspected and a certificate of occupancy is issued by the
Chief Building Official.
(Prior Code, § 4-1709) Penalty, see §
151.99

be removed therefrom by anyone. The person, company or corporation obtaining
such permit and causing such excavation to be made shall post a sign at the

time of the expiration of the permit granted, as herein contemplated, according
to the city’s standard specifications for back filling excavations, and a
surface of equal quality to the surfacing of the street shall be applied within

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 155.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   (A)   The legislature of the state has in Wyo. Stat. §§ 19-5-101 et seq.
delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations
designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its
citizenry.
   (B)   Therefore, the City Council does ordain as follows.
(Prior Code, § 13-813)
§ 155.02 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Prior Code, § 13-813)
§ 155.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions to specific areas by provisions designed:
   (A)   To protect human life and health;
   (B)   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
   (F)   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (G)   To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
   (H)   To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazards
assume responsibility for their actions.
(Prior Code, § 13-813)
§ 155.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purpose, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (A)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety
and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
   (B)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;
   (D)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may
increase flood damage; and
   (E)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.
(Prior Code, § 13-813)
§ 155.05 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   APPEAL. See §
157.008.
   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING. A designated AO or AH Zone on the flood insurance

(Prior Code, § 13-813.1) (Ord. 90-01, passed 4-3-1990)
§ 155.06 LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the
city limits.
(Prior Code, § 13-813.2)
§ 155.07 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood
Insurance Study for the City of Rock Springs, Wyoming,” dated July 20, 1998,
with an accompanying flood insurance rate map (FIRM), and any deletions,
additions, amendments or changes thereto, are hereby adopted by reference and
declared to be part of this chapter. The flood insurance study and FIRM are on
file at the City Planner’s office at the City Hall.
(Prior Code, § 13-813.2) (Ord. 89-18, passed 9-19-1989)
§ 155.08 COMPLIANCE.
   No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and
other applicable regulations.
(Prior Code, § 13-813.2) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 155.09 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate or impair any existing
easements, covenants or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and
another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap,
whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(Prior Code, § 13-813.2)
§ 155.10 INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall
be:

not been provided in accordance with §
155.07, the Zoning Administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize
any base flood elevation and floodway data available from any federal, state or
other source as criteria for requiring that new construction, substantial
improvements or other development in Zone A are administered in accordance with
§
155.41.
      (3)   Information to be obtained and maintained. The Zoning Administrator
shall:
         (a)   Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea
level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially
improved structures and whether or not the structure contains a basement;
         (b)   For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:
            1.   Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean
sea level) to which the structure has been floodproofed; and
            2.   Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in §
155.25(B)(3).
         (c)   Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the
provisions of this chapter.
      (4)   Alteration of watercourses. The Zoning Administrator shall:
         (a)   Notify adjacent communities and the State Disaster and Civil
Defense Office prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and
submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency; and
         (b)   Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or
relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is
not diminished.
      (5)   Interpretation of FIRM boundaries. The Zoning Administrator shall
make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries
of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person
contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity
to appeal the interpretation as provided in §
155.27.
(Prior Code, § 13-813.3)
§ 155.27 VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Appeal Board.
      (1)   The Board of Adjustment, as established by the Zoning Ordinance,
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements
of this chapter.
      (2)   The Board of Adjustment shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or determination made by
the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
      (3)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Adjustment, or any
taxpayer, may appeal such decisions to the District Court as provided in Wyo.
Stat. § 15-1-609.
      (4)   In passing upon such applications, the Board of Adjustment shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified
in other sections of this chapter and:
         (a)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
         (b)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
         (c)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owners;
         (d)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community;
         (e)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
         (f)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
         (g)   The compatibility of the proposed use with the existing and
anticipated development;
         (h)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area;
         (i)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
         (j)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
         (k)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and
bridges.
      (5)   Upon consideration of the factors of division (A)(4) above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Board of Adjustment may attach such conditions to
the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
chapter.
   (B)   Conditions for variances.
      (1)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base level; provided, that the items in division (A)(4) above have
been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the
technical justifications required for issuing the variance increases.
      (2)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
      (3)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (4)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (5)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of the variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization
of the public as identified in division (A)(4) above or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
      (6)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
below the base flood elevation and that cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
(Prior Code, § 13-813.3) (Ord. 90-01, passed 4-3-1990)

must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or
meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having
a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of
enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings
shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with
screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices; provided, that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
   (C)   Manufactured and mobile homes.
      (1)   Manufactured and mobile homes shall be anchored in accordance with
§
155.40(A)(2).
      (2)   It is required that manufactured and mobile homes that are placed
or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community’s FIRM
on sites: outside of a manufactured or mobile home park or subdivision; in a
new manufactured or mobile home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an
existing manufactured or mobile home park or subdivision; or in an existing
manufactured or mobile home park or subdivision on which a manufactured or

15-2014)
§ 155.42 FLOODWAYS.
   Located within areas of special flood hazard established in §
155.07 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely
hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential
projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:
   (A)   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development unless certification by a registered
professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments
shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge; and
   (B)   If division (A) above is satisfied, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of this subchapter.

§ 156.022 FINAL PLAT.
   (A)   Following approval of the preliminary plat, a final plat application
may be prepared and submitted. The final plat shall be prepared and certified
to its accuracy by a registered land surveyor licensed in the state. The final
plat and required supporting material shall conform to the design and
engineering standards set forth in these regulations and to any conditions of
approval specified by the Commission and the Council. The final plat shall
conform to the preliminary plat and any requirements of the Council. Five 24-
inch by 36-inch printed copies of the final plat and all required supporting
documentation listed in division (G) below shall be submitted with the
application. In addition, all documents shall be provided in “pdf” format with
the submission of the application. The Planning Department shall review the
application for conformance with the final plat submittal requirements. If the
application does not conform to the submittal requirements, the application
will be deemed incomplete, the subdivider will be notified and the application
will be returned.
   (B)   Final platting may be accomplished in phases as shown on the approved
preliminary plat. When this is done, each sheet of the final plat shall contain
a vicinity map showing the location of the portion being submitted in
relationship to the area for which the preliminary plat was submitted. All
final plats so submitted shall be of the same scale, shall have identical
titles, legends and other information and shall have match lines so that
mosaics of the entire subdivision can be developed. Each phase of the
subdivision shall be as nearly self-sustaining and complete as possible and
shall by itself, or in conjunction with previous phases, meet the design
standards set forth in these regulations so that if development of the entire
subdivision is interrupted or discontinued after one or more phases is
completed, a viable development will result whether the approved phase remains
or is replatted as a separate subdivision. The subdivision shall be constructed
in the order in which the phases are numbered. Altering the phasing of the
subdivision shall require resubmittal and approval of a new preliminary plat.
   (C)   The final plat shall be clearly and legibly drawn in black ink upon
Mylar of 0.004 inch in thickness (minimum) or some similar stable base
material. Required affidavits, certificates and acknowledgments shall be
legibly printed on the plat in opaque ink. The sheet size of all final plats
shall be 24 inches high by 36 inches wide. Margins shall be one and one-half
inches on the left side and one and one-half inches on the three remaining
sides. The scale may be reduced to one inch equals 200 feet for subdivisions in
which the minimum lot size is five acres or more. Each sheet of the final plat
shall be numbered, and the total number of sheets comprising the plat shall be
stated on each sheet (for example: “Sheet 2 of 4”). The relationship of one
sheet to the other shall be shown by key maps and by match lines.
   (D)   Once approved, a Mylar copy of the final plat must be submitted to the
Planning Department as required.
   (E)   The submitted final plat shall contain the notarized signatures of the
owner or owners, mortgagees or others with an equitable or legal interest in
the land of whatever nature and the signature of the registered land surveyor.

   (H)   After receipt of the final plat and determination that a complete
submittal has been made, the Planning Department shall refer material to the
Utility Review Committee for its review and shall request that comments be
returned within seven days. Members of the Utility Review Committee who do not
return comments within seven days will be considered to be in support of the
application. At least seven days prior to the date of the Commission meeting at
which the plat is to be considered, the Planning Department shall notify the
property owners of record within 200 feet of the proposed subdivision of the
time and date of the meeting. In reviewing the final plat, the Commission shall
consider oral or written statements from the applicant, the public, city staff

final plat and notify the subdivider of the conditions to be met to gain
approval. If a disapproved final plat is modified and resubmitted to the
Council at a later date for its consideration, the Council may require the
concurrent submittal of an updated ownership and encumbrance report or title
opinion.

below is authorized by the City Council, within 60 days of approval by the
Council, the final plat shall be recorded in the office of the County Clerk. It
is the subdivider’s responsibility to secure all signatures on the final plat
and record the plat with the County Clerk. A copy of the recorded plat shall be
provided to the city within 15 days after recording.
   (K)   As an alternate procedure and at the request of the subdivider, the
Council may approve a final plat and instruct the Planning Department to
withhold the approved final plat from recording for a period of time to allow
the subdivider to install all of the required public improvements according to
the plans and specifications approved by the City Engineer. This procedure,
when approved by the Council, shall be in lieu of the guarantees for
installation or improvements as set forth in these regulations. An executed
standard contract as approved by the City Attorney regarding installation of
improvements shall be submitted with the final plat. The contract shall require
that all improvements be completed no later than 12 months from the date the
final plat was approved by the Council. The subdivider may apply in writing
for, and the Council may, for cause shown, by resolution, grant a six-month
extension to the 12-month period. After all improvements are inspected and
approved by the Council, the plat shall be recorded within 60 days after the
City Council’s acceptance of the improvements, and the sale of lots may proceed
according to the approved and recorded plat. It is the subdivider’s
responsibility to secure all signatures on the final plat and record the plat
with the County Clerk. A copy of the recorded plat shall be provided to the
city within 15 days after recording. Building permits for structures will not
be issued within the subdivision until the plat is recorded and the
requirements for improvements are met. If, after receiving approval of the
alternate approval procedure, the subdivider chooses to submit a financial
guarantee, the subdivider shall provide the City Engineer an engineer’s cost
estimate of the remaining improvements. After approval of the cost estimate by
the City Engineer, the financial guarantee shall be submitted and approved by
the Council, by resolution, and the filing of the plat shall proceed.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
§ 156.060 ADMINISTRATION.
   (A)   These regulations shall be administered and enforced by the Planning
Department or other agency as designated by the Council.
   (B)   All subdivision plats submitted to the city shall first have been
examined by the Planning Department and the Commission in accordance with the
procedures established by these regulations, whether located inside of or,
pursuant to, Wyo. Stat. § 34-12-103, located outside of, but within one mile
of, the city. As part of their examination, the Department and the Commission
may consult with other public or private agencies to determine whether or not
the plat, as proposed, will contribute to the orderly growth and development of
the city. The actions of the Department, the Commission and the Council shall
be governed by the procedures and schedules set forth.
   (C)   The city shall not extend utilities and services and shall not approve
any proposed subdivision of land which, by itself or as a part of a larger
tract, is contiguous to the boundaries of the city unless the preliminary plat
submitted to the Planning Department is accompanied by a properly acknowledged
petition for annexation to the city and a separate application for proper
zoning.
   (D)   The Planning Department shall review both the annexation petition and
the preliminary plat for accuracy and completeness and shall process the plats
as if the land were already part of the city. The required plats and the
annexation petition may be considered by the city simultaneously; however,
final action by the Council on the annexation petition and zoning shall precede
or be taken concurrently with final action on the final plat.
(Prior Code, § 16-701) (Ord. 2019-14, passed 7-16-2019)
§ 156.061 VARIANCES.
   (A)   When it can be shown that in the case of a particular subdivision,
strict compliance with the provisions of these regulations would cause undue
hardship, the Council may authorize a variance to these regulations, provided
that the general intent of these regulations are preserved, that public
interest is protected and that such variances do not have the effect of
nullifying the intent and purpose of the comprehensive plan, the official map
or the Zoning Ordinance. The granting of a variance shall be based upon finding
by the Council that:
      (1)   The subdivider is proceeding in good faith;
      (2)   There are unusual topographical or other special circumstances
associated with the property which are not the result of any action of the
subdivider and which prohibit the use of the property in a manner similar to
the use of adjacent or nearby properties;
      (3)   The variance is necessary for reasonable development of the
property in question and will alleviate a clearly demonstrable hardship;
      (4)   The variance will not nullify the intent or purpose of these
regulations; and
      (5)   Granting the variance will not be detrimental to the general public
health, safety and welfare.
   (B)   Any variance granted shall constitute the minimum adjustment necessary
to alleviate the hardship.
   (C)   A request for variance may be submitted only after the Commission has
formally reviewed the preliminary plat and has either: recommended disapproval
because the plat does not conform to these regulations; or conditionally
approved the plat specifying those amendments which must appear on the final
plat in order for it to be approved. The subdivider may then seek relief from
the specific provisions of these regulations with which he or she cannot
comply.
   (D)   All requests for variances shall be submitted in writing to the
Council and shall be referred to the Commission for comments and
recommendations prior to any action taken by the Council. In granting a
variance, the Council may impose such conditions as will ensure substantial
compliance with the objectives and standards of these regulations. The findings
and action on each variance and any conditions imposed shall be recorded in the
minutes of the Council and a copy thereof provided to the Planning Department.
   (E)   If the subdivision variance is granted by the Council, the subdivider
may incorporate the provisions of the variance into the final plat to be
submitted to the Commission and to the Council for approval. In its review of
the final plat, the Commission shall be bound by the decision of the Council
regarding the variance and shall review and approve the final plat with the
variance if the plat in all other respects conforms to the preliminary plat and
any other conditions imposed by the Commission.
(Prior Code, § 16-702) (Ord. 2019-14, passed 7-16-2019)

other proprietors in said plat and provided, further, that nothing contained in
this section shall authorize the closing or obstruction of any public highways
laid out according to law.

public grounds shall be assigned to all lots or parcels adjacent to the public
area being vacated in equal proportions unless waived by an adjacent property
owner. When any part of a plat shall be vacated, the part vacated shall remain
inside of the plat so vacated.
   (D)   The County Clerk shall write in plain, legible letters across that
part of said plat so vacated, the word “vacated” and also make a reference on
the same to the volume and page in which said instrument of vacation is

the Planning Department shall notify the property owners within 200 feet of the
proposed vacation of the time and date of the meeting.
      (4)   In its deliberations, the Commission shall consider oral or written
statements from the applicant, the public, city staff and its own members. The
Commission may recommend approval, conditional approval, disapproval or may
table the application. The Commission shall notify the Council in writing of
its recommendation.
      (5)   The Council shall hold a public hearing on the application for
vacation. A notice of the time, date, place and purpose of the hearing shall be
published in the official newspaper of the city at least 15 days prior to the
date of the hearing. In its deliberations, the Council shall consider oral or
written statements from the subdivider, the public, city staff and its own
members. The Council may approve, deny or table the request to vacate property.
Upon approval, the applicant shall prepare and record the documents required to
complete the vacation.

§ 156.063 ADMINISTRATIVE LIABILITY.
   The city shall hold harmless all city agencies and officials, and their
official agents and representatives, when acting in good faith and without

   (A)   Prior to the approval of any final plat by the City Council, the
subdivider shall either:
      (1)   Guarantee the installation of the necessary public facilities by
complying with the provisions of §
156.023 regarding financial guarantees of improvements; or
      (2)   Execute a standard contract on forms provided by the city and
request that the City Council proceed according to the provisions of these
regulations regarding delaying the recording of the final plat until
improvements are installed and approved.
   (B)   The standard contract shall, among other things, specify that the
required improvements be installed within the time stated, in accordance with
the requirements of the State Department of Environmental Quality.
   (C)   The time specified for the completion of the required improvements
shall not exceed 12 months from the date the final plat was approved by the
City Council. Requests for extensions may be approved by the City Council.
(Prior Code, § 16-801)
§ 156.076 RELEASE OF FINANCIAL GUARANTEE.
   As improvements are completed, inspected and approved by the City Engineer,
the subdivider may apply to the city for a release of a proportionate part of
any collateral deposited with the city.
(Prior Code, § 16-802)
§ 156.077 DESIGN BY PROFESSIONAL ENGINEER.
   All public improvements must be designed by a professional engineer licensed
to do such work in the state.
(Prior Code, § 16-803)
§ 156.078 ON-SITE REPRESENTATIVE.
   The developer shall designate, in writing, the name of the agent who shall
be available at all times during its progress and who shall not be replaced
without a written notice to the City Engineer. The agent will be the
developer’s representative at the site and shall have the authority to act on
the developer’s behalf.
(Prior Code, § 16-804)
§ 156.079 INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   The subdivider shall install the following improvements in a timely manner
and in accordance with plans, specifications and data as approved by the City
Engineer. At the subdivider’s expense, the subdivider shall provide inspection
of all subdivision improvements. (Reference § 156.098(B).) Inspection shall be
full time during the installation of water, sanitary sewer and storm sewer
systems. Prior to acceptance of subdivision improvements, final inspections of
the subdivision improvements shall be requested by the subdivider. The final
inspections shall be coordinated by the Department of Engineering and
Operations and performed by the appropriate city department. The subdivider
shall make every effort to ensure that the subdivision improvements are
complete prior to scheduling final inspections with the Department of
Engineering and Operations. Should excessive re-inspections by the city be
necessary, the subdivider may be required to pay a reasonable charge for the
re-inspection services.
   (A)   Sanitary sewer system.
      (1)   There shall be constructed, at the owner and subdivider’s expense,
a sanitary sewer system, including all necessary pumping stations, pumping
equipment (pumping stations and pumping equipment will not be permitted by the
city unless all means of gravity flow are unavailable or undue hardship would
result; increased costs, unless they constitute an undue and prohibitively
excessive financial burden as determined by the city, will not constitute a
hardship), manholes and all other necessary or desirable appurtenances to
provide for the discharge of sanitary sewage from all lots or parcels of land
within the platted area to a connection with the city’s sanitary sewers. The
sanitary sewer system shall be constructed in accordance with the plans and
specifications of the city and at the sewer grades approved by the city. The
above-mentioned facilities for the collection and disposal of sanitary sewage
from the platted area shall, upon final approval and acceptance by the city,
become the property of the city.
      (2)   Under some circumstances the city may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, installation of a sanitary sewer that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area or the area being subdivided as
shown by the preliminary plat or site plan but necessary to complete the city
sanitary system as it relates to both the area being platted and other areas.
   (B)   Storm drainage system.
      (1)   There shall be constructed, at the owner and subdivider’s expense,
a storm drainage system adequate to serve the area, including anticipated
extension of use to serve additional areas. The storm drainage system shall be
constructed in accordance with plans and specifications of the city and at
sewer grades approved by the city. The sewers, shall, upon inspection, approval
and acceptance by the city, become the property of the city. Temporary sediment
control measures implemented by the developer, which in the opinion of the City
Engineer significantly impact the capacity of the storm drainage system, will
not be allowed. In the storm sewer design phase, consideration shall be given
to alternatives and principles of stormwater management.
      (2)   Under some circumstances, the city may require, as a condition for
approval of the plat, installation of a storm sewer that is larger than
necessary to meet the needs of the platted area or the area being subdivided as
shown by the preliminary plat or site plan, but necessary to complete the city
storm sewer system as it relates to both the area being platted and other
areas.
   (C)   Water main system. There shall be constructed, at the owner and
subdivider’s expense, a water main system to adequately serve all lots or
parcels of land within the platted area, with due regard to the present and
reasonably foreseeable needs of the entire area shown in the preliminary plat
or site plan, and shall connect the same to existing water mains. The water
main system shall be constructed in accordance with plans and specifications of
the City and Joint Power Water Board.
   (D)   Streets, street grading and surfacing. The owner of land being platted
shall, at his or her expense, provide the grading of the entire street right-
of-way, alley or public place and provide appropriate paving, including curb
and gutter on all streets. The street improvements shall be constructed in
accordance with the plans and specifications of the city and shall adequately
reflect the classification of the street, its location and anticipated volume
of traffic. All streets or roads shall be of such width and shall be so
constructed as to meet the standards of the public body responsible for the
maintenance thereof as outlined in §
156.095.
   (E)   Street lights, street name signs and traffic control signs. The owner
shall, at his or her expense, install all street lights, street name signs and
traffic control signs. All lights and signs shall be installed so as to meet
the standards outlined in §
156.099. Street lights, street signs and traffic control signs shall be
installed prior to acceptance of subdivision improvement or any occupancy
permit being issued for any building, in any subdivision.
   (F)   Fire hydrants. The owner and subdivider shall, at his or her expense,
install all fire hydrants. All fire hydrants shall be designed and installed so
as to meet the specifications outlined in §
156.099.
   (G)   Utilities; gas, electricity and telephone and the like. It shall be

utilities. All utilities shall be installed underground, except that major
overhead power lines may be located along arterial streets or other
specifically designed streets.
   (H)   Other facilities or improvements. The owner or subdivider shall, at
his or her expense, install any other facility or improvement as may be
specified on the preliminary plat, site plan or in a contract and agreed to by
the subdivider. All such facilities and improvements shall be designed, located
and/or installed to city specifications as designated by these regulations on
the preliminary plat, site plan or in a contract.
   (I)   Monuments.
      (1)   The owner and subdivider shall, at his or her expense, install
monuments at all subdivision boundary corners which shall be marked with two
inch diameter brass caps. These caps may be set in concrete or be affixed to
30-inch lengths of galvanized pipe and shall be properly marked for
identification as to location, shall carry the true elevation, shall be
reference if subject to destruction and again shall show the proper
identification and license of the certifying surveyor.
      (2)   Perimeter ties shall be shown to all section, quarter section and
sixteenth section lines.
      (3)   Block and lot corners, points of tangency and points of curve of
all curves shall be marked by a distinctive survey corner marker. Where section
lines and quarter section lines intersect the centerline of any street,
reference shall be given to the nearest section corner or quarter corner.

non-access reservation along the rear property line, deep lots with rear
service alleys or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
   (L)   Service streets. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad
right-of-way or limited access highway right-of-way, existing or planned, the
Commission may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of
such right-of-way, at a distance suitable for the appropriate use of the
intervening land. Service streets shall intersect other streets in such a way
that sufficient intersection stacking distance is provided without interfering
with through traffic.
   (M)   Street grades. Grades of all streets shall conform in general to the
terrain and shall not be less than 0.5% nor more than 5% for arterial or major
streets, or 7% for collector streets, or 8% for minor streets in Residential
Zones, or 8% for access streets, but in no case more than 3% within 50 feet of
any intersection.
   (N)   Street visibility. A combination of steep grades and curves shall be
avoided. In order to provide visibility for traffic safety, that portion of any
corner lot (whether at an intersection entirely within the subdivision or of a
new street with an existing street) shall be cleared of all growth (except

centerline of the street for a distance of at least 30 feet from the right-of-
way line. If directed, ground shall be excavated to achieve visibility. Trees
and hedges over four feet high shall not be permitted within six feet of the
street right-of-way.
   (O)   Street radii.
      (1)   Curves. Street lines within a block, deflecting from each other at
any one point by more than ten degrees, shall be connected with a curve, the
radius of which for the centerline of street shall not be less than 400 feet on
arterial and major streets and 200 feet on minor streets, and in no case shall
the connecting tangent of two curves be less than 100 feet.

where a change of zoning to a zone which permits commercial use is
contemplated, the street width shall be increased by such amount on each side
as may be deemed necessary by the Commission to assure the free flow of through
traffic without interference by parked or parking vehicles and to provide
adequate and safe parking space for such commercial or business districts.
   (Q)   Street names.
      (1)   All street names shall be approved by the Commission and shall
conform to an established numbering and naming system if such a system exists.
      (2)   Proposed street names shall be substantially different so as not to
be confused in sound or spelling with present names except that streets that

change in street name.
      (4)   The subdivider shall install street signs as required and approved

criteria of the city;
      (3)   Reserve strips controlling access to streets; and
      (4)   Intersections with more than four corners.
   (S)   Public land dedication, parks, open-space.
      (1)   Where a proposed park, playground or open-space shown on the
comprehensive plan is located in whole or in part in a subdivision, the
Commission shall require that such area or areas be shown on plats in
accordance with the requirements specified in this section. Such area or areas
shall be dedicated to the city by the subdivider if the City Council approves
such dedication.
      (2)   The Commission shall require that plats show sites of a character,
extent and location suitable for the development of a park, playground or other
recreation purposes.
      (3)   In all new residential subdivisions, 7% of the gross area shall be
dedicated for public recreation space, school sites or other public use with
such percentage being in addition to property dedicated for streets, alleys,
easements or other public ways. When a subdivision is too small for the
practical dedication of public land, when no land in the subdivision is
suitable for such use or when the proposed park for the area is not to be
located within the proposed subdivision, the subdivider shall be required to
pay a fee of 10% of the land value prior to its subdivision (the market value
shall be determined by utilization of assessment records and formulas that
apply thereto).
   (T)   Easements.
      (1)   Easements centered on rear and other lot lines as required shall be
provided for utilities where and of the size necessary.
      (2)   Easements shall be provided along each side of the centerline of

channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage
right-of-way as required by the engineer.
      (4)   Easements shall be dedicated for the required use.
   (U)   Lots, design and location.
      (1)   The lot arrangement shall be such that in constructing a building
in compliance with the Zoning Ordinance, there will be no foreseeable
difficulties for reasons of topography or other natural conditions. Lots should
not be of such depth as to encourage the later creation of a second building
lot at the front or rear.
      (2)   All side lines of a lot shall be at right angles to straight street
lines and radial to curved street lines unless a variance from this rule will
give a better street or lot plan.
      (3)   The lot dimensions shall not be less than the minimum required to
secure the minimum lot area specified in the Zoning Ordinance. Through lots,
when permitted, shall have additional depth of ten feet for screen planting
along the rear line. Remnants of lots below the minimum required size shall not
be allowed but must be added to adjacent lots.
      (4)   Lots abutting upon a watercourse, drainageway, channel, stream or
water body shall have additional depth or width, as required to assure that
house sites are not located in the 100-year floodplain.
      (5)   In the subdividing of any land, regard shall be shown for all
natural features, such as trees, watercourses and bodies, which, if preserved,
will add attractiveness to the proposed development.
      (6)   Where a proposed residential lot is adjacent to a limited access
highway, major highway, arterial street or collector street, there shall be no
direct vehicular access from individual lots to such roads. A temporary
entrance may be granted for single tracts until neighboring land is subdivided
and the required access can be feasibly provided.
   (V)   Street improvements to be designated. No subdivision plat shall be
approved unless the subdivider has designated street improvements for the
entire front of all interior lots, and the entire front and side of all corner
lots.

(Prior Code, § 13-102)
§ 157.003 INTENT AND PURPOSE.
   The intent of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
general welfare of the community and its people through the establishment of
minimum regulations governing development and use of land. This chapter shall
divide the city into districts and establish regulations in regard to location,
erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration and use of structures and
land. Such regulations are established: to protect such use areas; to promote
orderly development and redevelopment; to provide adequate light, air and
access to property; to prevent congestion in the public right-of-way; to
prevent overcrowding of land and undue concentration of structures by
regulating land, buildings, yards and density of population; to provide for
compatibility of different land uses; to provide for administration of this
chapter; to provide for amendments; to prescribe penalties for violation of
such regulations; and to define powers and duties of the city staff, the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the Board of Adjustment and the City Council in
relation to this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 13-103)
§ 157.004 RELATION TO COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
   The enforcement of, amendments to and administration of this chapter shall
be accomplished in accordance with the recommendations contained in the
comprehensive plan, as developed and amended from time to time by the Planning
and Zoning Commission and City Council.
(Prior Code, § 13-104)
§ 157.005 SEVERABILITY.
   It is hereby declared to be the intention of the city that the provisions of

provisions of this chapter not specifically included in said judgment; or
   (B)   If any court of competent jurisdiction shall adjudge invalid the
application of any provision of this chapter to a particular property, building
or other structure, such judgment shall not affect the application of said
provision to any other property, building or structure not specifically
included in said judgment.
(Prior Code, § 13-105)
§ 157.006 CONFLICT WITH OTHER REGULATIONS.
   In the case of a conflict between this chapter and/or any part thereof and
any other ordinance of the city, the more restrictive provision in all cases
shall apply.
(Prior Code, § 13-106)
§ 157.007 EXCLUSIVENESS OR PERMITTED AND CONDITIONALLY PERMITTED USES.
   In each zoning district established herein, any use not expressly permitted
or conditionally permitted shall be deemed excluded unless said use can be
shown to the satisfaction of the Planning and Zoning Commission to be
consistent with the intent of the district, in which case the Commission shall
grant an exemption for said use pursuant to this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 13-107)
§ 157.008 DEFINITIONS.

adjustment is sought and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the
neighborhood and have not resulted from any act of the applicant subsequent to
the adoption of the ordinance;
      (2)   For reasons fully set forth in the Board’s findings, the
circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application of the
provisions of the ordinance would deprive the applicant of the reasonable use
of the land or building, the granting of the adjustment is necessary for the
reasonable use thereof and the adjustment as granted is the minimum adjustment
that will accomplish this purpose; and
      (3)   The granting of the adjustment is in harmony with the general
purposes and intent of the ordinance and will not be injurious to the
neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.
   (C)   To grant exceptions and variances upon request where, after a showing
that an illegal construction or a nonconforming building or use existed for a
period of at least five years in violation of zoning ordinances and the city,

Notes to Table:
(1) Front setbacks may be adjusted to a lesser amount than required by this chapter
as follows: when more than 25% of the lots fronting one side of the street between
intersections are occupied by structures having setbacks from the street right-of-way
of lesser amounts than hereinafter required by this chapter, the average setback of
all existing buildings between the intersection shall be considered an established
setback and shall be maintained by all new or relocated structures. When a building
is to be built where there is an established setback less than that required by this
chapter, and there is an existing building on only one contiguous side, the front
setback for the new building shall be no greater than that of the existing building
on the one side which is contiguous to and contains a building. If a building is to
be built where there is an established setback less than that required by this
chapter, and there are existing buildings on both contiguous sides, the established
setback shall be determined by connecting a straight line between the forward most
portion of the buildings on the contiguous sides. An adjustable front setback under
this section must be approved by the Planning and Zoning Commission.
(2) 16' total both sides; one side shall have a minimum setback of 10' and one side
shall have a minimum setback of 6'.
(3) Corner yard setbacks may be reduced to 3' for accessory structures not exceeding
200 square feet on corner lots in which a 6-foot fence is installed and permitted in
accordance with §
157.130(D)(5), or in which a legally nonconforming fence is established within the
corner yard.
(4) 4,000 square foot per lot if each dwelling unit of a duplex is on a separate lot.
(5) Outdoor living area in the minimum amount specified above must be provided on any
lot occupied by the multiple residence, townhouse cluster or apartment building. This
space must be easily accessible for daily recreational use by the occupants of the
building. Driveways, parking areas, ornamental landscaped areas (having a width of
less than 20 feet), and required side or front yards shall not be considered as
outdoor living area, except in the case of interior townhouse units where said unit
is less than 20 feet in width, in which case the minimum width of the outdoor living
area shall be the width of the lot.
(6) When two or more principal buildings are located on one lot, the minimum
separation between any two adjacent principal buildings shall be a distance not less
than an amount equal to the height of the taller of the two buildings or 20 feet,
whichever is greater when developed as a planned unit development. For major and
minor site plans, building separation shall be the sum of two interior side yard
setbacks.
(7) The minimum lot area may be adjusted according to the following: For each parking
stall in or under the residence or otherwise completely underground, subtract 400 sq.
ft. from the total minimum lot area. For each unit with a balcony or patio of not
less than 40 sq. ft., subtract 100 sq. ft. from the outdoor living area.
(8) The city may require common walls for accessory structures on the same lot where
common walls will eliminate unsightly and hazardous areas. Exteriors of accessory
structures shall have an exterior finish compatible to the main structure.
Compatibility shall be determined by the city based on type and use of building
materials.
(9) All principally permitted, conditionally permitted and accessory uses shall be
screened from adjacent Residential Zones (except R-5 Zones) as described in §
157.126(A).
(10) For apartment buildings, parking of motor vehicles shall not be allowed within
the front or corner side setbacks.
(11) Access for residential uses shall comply with the requirements of §
157.133(B)(5) through (B)(10).
(12) Manufactured home subdivision streets: All manufactured home subdivision streets
shall be public and shall meet all design requirements of §§
156.095 through
156.099 unless approved as private as part of a planned unit development. The
Director of Engineering and Operations shall review and approve the design of all
streets within a manufactured home subdivision.
(13) Each manufactured or mobile home shall be set back a minimum of 15 feet from the
private street. Each manufactured or mobile home shall be separated by a distance of
20 feet from all adjacent manufactured or mobile homes. For purposes of measuring
separation, all attached porches and decks that have a roof covering shall be
considered part of the manufactured or mobile home and shall observe a 20-foot
separation from adjacent manufactured or mobile homes. Each manufactured or mobile
home shall be setback a minimum of 10 feet from exterior property lines of the
manufactured home park and 3 feet from all interior space lines.
(14) Structures accessory to manufactured or mobile homes shall meet all requirements
listed in §
157.129 and in addition be a minimum of 3 feet from all interior space lines.
(15) The following provisions shall apply to all manufactured home parks.
   (a) Manufactured home park streets. Private streets shall be permitted within a
manufactured home park and may be permitted to have a residential street right-of-way
minimum width of 50 feet. All other design criteria shall meet the requirements of §§
156.095 through
156.099. The Director of Engineering and Operations shall review and approve the
design of all streets within a manufactured home park.
   (b) Recreational area. Recreation areas shall be provided to meet the anticipated
needs of the residents of the manufactured home park. Not less than 7% of the gross
site area shall be devoted to recreational uses. Recreation areas shall include space
for community use facilities, picnic and play areas. The design of recreation areas
shall be appropriate for the intended use and location of the activity.
   (c) Review and approval of a manufactured home park. In evaluating a major site
plan application for an R-6 Manufactured Home Park, the Commission shall consider the
following:
      1. The proposed site and development plan provide for adequate access to the
public street system without causing undue congestion or placing excessive traffic
loads on local streets; and
      2. The size and shape of the site is adaptable to good mobile home park design
and that development of the site for mobile home uses will not unduly obstruct
development of adjoining property.
   (d) Parking. There shall be a minimum of two paved, off-street parking spaces per
dwelling unit. Each space shall be at least 9' wide and 20' deep in size. Each off-
street parking space shall have direct access to a public or private street. No
direct access shall be allowed to arterial roadways. Direct access to collector
roadways shall be discouraged.
   (e) Utilities. All utilities, including water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer (and/or
surface water drainage), electrical lines, gas lines, telephone lines and street
lights shall be designed and constructed according to such regulations as prescribed
in Chapter 156.
   (f) Landscaping. The front setback area of each manufactured or mobile home shall
be landscaped using sod and/or decorative stone. All private, commonly owned
recreation areas not devoted to buildings, structures, surfaced courts, sandboxes and
the like shall be sodded and irrigated. Landscaping of public parks shall be the
responsibility of the city.
   (g) Screening. All principal and accessory uses shall be screened from adjacent
residential uses (except R-6) as described in §
157.126(A).
   (h) Maintenance.

      5. Each manufactured or mobile home must be stabilized from beneath using a
concrete masonry and/or metal support system acceptable to the City Building
Inspector.
      6. There shall be no outdoor storage of furniture (except lawn furniture),
household goods, tools, equipment or building materials or supplies.
      7. Each manufactured or mobile home must bear a label certifying that it is
built in compliance with federal manufactured home and safety standards. Manufactured
or mobile homes built prior to June 15, 1976, must bear a label certifying compliance
to the standard for mobile homes, NFPA 501, ANSI 119.1, in effect at the time of
manufacture.
   (i) Inspections. The City Zoning Administrator or agent is hereby authorized to
make such inspections as are necessary to determine satisfactory compliance with this
chapter and shall have the authority to enter at reasonable times upon any private or
public real property for the purpose of inspecting and investigating conditions
relating to the enforcement of this chapter. It shall be the duty of the owners of
manufactured home parks or persons in charge thereof, or owners or occupants of a lot
in a manufactured home subdivision, to allow the City Zoning Administrator or his or
her agent free access to such premises at reasonable times for the purpose of such
inspections. It shall be the duty of every occupant of a manufactured home park to
allow the owner thereof, or his or her agents or employees, access to any part of
such manufactured home park at reasonable times for the purpose of making such
repairs or alterations as may be necessary to effect compliance with this chapter or
with any lawful order issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter.
   (j) Replacement of existing manufactured or mobile homes. Manufactured or mobile
homes as principal residential buildings on individual lots, or in manufactured home
parks or manufactured home subdivisions in operation at the time of the adoption of
this chapter may be improved by the replacement of the manufactured or mobile home
with another manufactured or mobile home, even though it may not be designated as a
permitted use in the district in which it is located and provided that the replacing
manufactured or mobile home will not create nonconforming yards or separation
distances or will not increase existing nonconforming yards or separation distances.

§ 157.093 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONE.
   (A)   Purpose.
      (1)   As an alternative to conventional zoning and development approaches
and processes, the planned unit development (PUD) procedures and regulations
are set forth in order that the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare be furthered in an era of increasing urbanization; to encourage
innovations in residential, commercial and industrial development renewal so
that greater opportunities for better housing and recreation, shops and
industrial plants conveniently located to each other may extend to all citizens
and residents of the city; to reflect changes in the technology of land
development; to encourage a more creative approach in the utilization of land
in order to accomplish a more efficient, aesthetic and desirable development
which may be characterized by special features of the geography, topography,
size or shape of a particular property; and to provide a compatible and stable
environment in harmony with that of the surrounding area.
      (2)   The planned unit development may include any development having one
or more principal uses or structures on a single parcel of ground or contiguous
parcels. The PUD shall consist of a harmonious selection of uses and groupings
of buildings, parking areas, circulation and open spaces, and shall be designed
as an integrated unit, in such manner as to constitute a safe, efficient and
convenient urban area.
   (B)   General requirements and standards.
      (1)   Ownership. The tract shall be a development of land under unified
control at the time of application, planned and scheduled to be developed as a
whole. However, no authorizations or permits shall be granted for such
development unless the applicant has acquired actual ownership of or executed a
binding sales contract for all of the property comprising such tract. For the
purpose of this division (B), the term SINGLE OWNERSHIP shall include ownership
of portions of such development by two or more wholly owned subsidiaries of a
single owner, or by such single owner and one or more of its wholly owned
subsidiaries.
      (2)   Conformance with comprehensive plan. The proposed planned unit
development shall be consistent with the city’s comprehensive plan.
      (3)   PUD area regulations. The minimum total PUD area shall be no less
than five acres if it includes a subdivision, or shall meet the minimum lot
size of the Zoning District where the parcel is situated, unless the applicant
can show that the minimum PUD area requirements should be waived because the
waiver would be in the public interest and that one or both of the following
conditions exist:
         (a)   Unusual physical features of the property itself or of the
surrounding neighborhood are such that development under the standard
provisions of the Residential Districts would not be appropriate in order to
conserve a physical or terrain feature of importance to the neighborhood or
community; and/or
         (b)   The property is adjacent to or across the street from property
which has been developed under the provisions of this section and will
contribute to the amenities of the neighborhood.
      (4)   Density in residential PUDs. Ten percent increase.
         (a)   A residential PUD may provide for a variety of housing types in
any one of the basic Residential Zoning Districts. In addition, the number of
dwelling units allowed may be flexible relative to the number of dwelling units
per acre that would otherwise be permitted by the zoning regulations applicable
to the site. However, the total number of dwelling units allowed in a PUD shall
be consistent with the land use element of the city’s comprehensive plan, and
in no case shall the unit density be exceeded by more than 10% of that
permitted by the comprehensive plan.
         (b)   If the unit density exceeds that permitted by the comprehensive
plan, the applicant has the burden to show that such increase in density will
not have an undue and adverse impact on existing public facilities or on
neighboring properties.
         (c)   In determining the reasonableness of the increase in unit
density, the Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council shall consider
increased efficiency in public facilities and services based, in part, upon:
            1.   The location, amount and proposed use of common open space;
            2.   The location, design and type of dwelling units;
            3.   The physical characteristics of the site;
            4.   Particular distinctiveness and excellence in siting, design
and landscaping; and
            5.   Dedication of more than the minimum required for public lands
or open space.
      (5)   Front, rear and side yard building setback regulations. Residential
building setbacks from all property lines which form the perimeter of the PUD
or from all interior and exterior dedicated street right-of-way lines or from
the paving of any private interior circulation streets shall be no less than 20
feet; commercial building setbacks shall be no less than 35 feet or the height
of the building, whichever is greater.
      (6)   More than one building per lot. More than one building may be
placed on one platted or recorded lot in any PUD areas for single-family
detached dwellings or other housing types providing privately owned lots must
comply with Chapter 156 in all respects not specifically noted in this section
as appropriate variances or waivers.
      (7)   One housing type not inconsistent with intent. A PUD which only
involves one housing type, such as all detached or all attached units, shall
not be considered as inconsistent with the stated purposes and objectives of
this section and shall not be the sole basis for denial or approval.
      (8)   Architectural style, appearance. Architectural style of buildings
shall not solely be a basis for denial or approval of a plan. However, the
overall appearance and compatibility of individual buildings to other site
elements or to surrounding development will be primary considerations in the
review stages of the Planning and Zoning Commission and Council.
      (9)   Building permits; when issued. No building permits shall be granted
for any building on land for which an application for a PUD is in the process
of city review or which does not conform to the approved PUD.
      (10)   Staging of development.
         (a)   Any PUD plan proposed to be constructed in stages shall include
full details relating thereto, and the City Council may approve or modify where
necessary any such proposals.
         (b)   The staging shall include the time for beginning and completion
of each stage. Such timing may be modified by the city on the showing of good
cause by the developer.
         (c)   The land owner or developer shall make such easements, covenants
and other arrangements and shall furnish such performance bond or bonds as may
be determined by the city to be reasonably required to assure performance in
accordance with the plan and to protect the public.
      (11)   Streets, utilities, services and public facilities. The uniqueness
of each proposal for a PUD may allow specifications and standards for streets,
utilities and services to be subject to minor modifications of the
specifications and standards established in this and other city ordinances
governing their construction. The city may, therefore, waive or modify the
specifications or standards where it is found that they are not required in the
interests of the residents of the PUD or of the city. The plans and profiles of
all streets, utilities and services shall be reviewed, modified, if necessary,
and approved by the city prior to the final approval of the PUD. All PUDs shall
be served by public or community water and sewer systems.
      (12)   Open space provision.
         (a)   At least 10% of the total PUD area shall be set aside for public
and/or private open space and recreational use in the manner required by
Chapter 156. The city shall determine what portion of the 10%, if any, shall be
private.
         (b)   In no case shall less than 5% of the total PUD area be dedicated
for public use or no less than 5% of the assessed value of the land prior to
its development be paid as fee-in-lieu of the public land dedication.
      (13)   Operating and maintenance requirements for planned unit
development common facilities. In the event that certain land areas or
structures are provided within the planned unit development for private
recreational use or as service facilities, the owner of such land and buildings
shall enter into an agreement with the city to assure the continued standard.
These common areas may be placed under the ownership of one of the following,
depending which is more appropriate:
         (a)   Dedicated to public where a community-wide use would be

(Prior Code, § 13-814) (Ord. 2019-15, passed 11-5-2019)
§ 157.109 DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The requirements set forth in this subchapter shall apply to the location
and design of all WCFs governed by this subchapter; provided, however, that the
Director may waive these requirements if it determines that the goals of this
subchapter are better served thereby. To that end, WCFs shall be designed and
located to minimize the impact on the surrounding neighborhood and to maintain
the character and appearance of the city, consistent with other applicable
provisions of the city’s ordinances.
   (A)   General requirements. The following requirements shall be met by all
WCFs.
      (1)   Collocation.
         (a)   Applicants requesting permission to install a new tower or
alternative tower structure not in the public ROW shall provide an exhibit
showing all existing towers located within 1,500 feet of the proposed new tower
facility. The applicant shall inquire about potential collocation at all
technically feasible locations within the 1,500-foot radius and shall provide
written proof of said inquiries, as well as responses received. This provision
shall not apply to small cell facilities or towers or alternative support
structures for small cell facilities.
         (b)   Excluding alternative tower structures, monopoles, replacement
poles or utility poles for small cell facilities, WCFs shall be designed and
constructed to permit the facility to accommodate WCFs from at least two
wireless service providers on the same WCF unless the city approves an
alternative design to the extent such design is reasonably feasible based upon
construction, engineering and design standards. No WCF owner or operator shall
unreasonably exclude a telecommunications competitor from using the same
facility or location. Upon request by the city, the owner or operator shall
provide evidence demonstrating why collocation is not possible at a particular
facility or site.
      (2)   Site design.
         (a)   Each WCF and its appurtenances shall be completely contained
within a single recorded property boundary, lot or tract.
         (b)   WCFs shall not negatively impact other ROW uses, such as
underground utilities, site lines, pedestrian and bicycle access, or create a
roadside hazard, as determined by the city.
      (3)   Setbacks. The following minimum setbacks shall apply to all WCFs
and related accessory equipment. A WCF shall meet the greater of the following
minimum setbacks from all property lines:
         (a)   For WCFs located outside of the ROW:
            1.   The setback for a principal building within the applicable
zoning district;
            2.   Twenty-five percent of the WCF height; and
            3.   The tower height, including antennas, if the tower is in or
adjacent to a Residential District.
         (b)   For WCFs located inside of the ROW, WCFs shall meet all setback
requirements set forth in the WYDOT Roadway Design Manual, or the AASHTO
Roadside Design Guide. For facilities using existing structures or poles in
ROW, such setback requirements shall apply only to the extent technically
feasible.
      (4)   Advertising. No advertising shall be permitted anywhere on the WCF
other than identification signage.
      (5)   Lighting.
         (a)   WCFs shall not be artificially lit, unless required by the FAA
or other applicable governmental authority, or the WCF is mounted on an
alternative tower structure, such as a light pole or other similar structure
primarily used for lighting purposes.
         (b)   If lighting is required, the city may review the available
lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least
disturbance to the surrounding views. Lighting shall be shielded or directed to
the greatest extent possible so as to minimize the amount of glare and light
trespass on surrounding properties, particularly residences. Security lighting
around the equipment shelter shall be permitted.
      (6)   Security. “No trespassing” signs shall be posted around the
facility with a contact telephone number for emergencies.
      (7)   Access roadway. The access roadway to the WCF shall be paved with
asphalt or concrete unless the WCF is an accessory use. WCFs that are accessory
uses may have unpaved, gravel access roadways, provided the access to the
facility is via a private, paved surface (not directly onto a public street).
      (8)   Adjacent to single-family residential uses. WCFs shall be sited in
a manner that considers the proximity of the facility to residential structures
and Residential District boundaries. When placed by residential property, the
WCF shall be placed adjacent to the common side yard property line between
adjoining residential properties, such that the WCF minimizes visual impacts
equitably among adjacent properties. In the case of a corner lot, the WCF may
be placed adjacent to the common side yard property line between adjoining
residential properties, or on the corner formed by two intersecting streets. If
these requirements are not reasonably feasible from a construction, engineering
or design perspective, the applicant may submit a written statement to the
Director requesting the WCF be exempt from these requirements.
      (9)   WCFs as accessory uses. WCFs shall be permitted as an accessory use
on a site, provided:
         (a)   The WCF complies with this subchapter;
         (b)   The existing use on the property is a permitted, conditionally
permitted or lawful nonconforming use;
         (c)   Placement of the WCF shall not require the addition of an access
drive onto a public street; and
         (d)   Vehicular access to the WCF shall not interfere with existing
parking or vehicular circulation on the site.
      (10)   Hazardous materials. No hazardous materials shall be permitted in
association with WCFs, except those necessary for the operation of the WCF and
only in accordance with all applicable laws governing such materials.

   (C)   Review procedures for eligible facilities requests.
      (1)   Application. In all zoning districts, eligible facilities requests
shall be considered a use by right subject to administrative review. The city
shall prepare and make publicly available an application form which shall be
limited to the information necessary for the city to consider whether an
application is an eligible facilities request. Such information may include,
without limitation, whether the request:
         (a)   Would result in a substantial change; or
         (b)   Would violate a generally applicable law, regulations or other
rule codifying objective standards reasonably related to public health and
safety. The application may not require the applicant to demonstrate a need or
business case for the proposed modification or collocation.
      (2)   Type of review. Upon receipt of an application for an eligible
facilities request pursuant to this subchapter, the Director shall review such
application to determine whether the application so qualifies.
      (3)   Timeframe for review. Subject to the tolling provisions of division
(C)(4) below, within 60 days of the date on which an applicant submits an
application seeking approval under this subchapter, the city shall approve the
application unless it determines that the application is not covered by this
subchapter.
      (4)   Tolling of the timeframe for review. The 60-day review period
begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled only by mutual
agreement of the city and the applicant, or in cases where the Director
determines that the application is incomplete:
         (a)   To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the city must provide
written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application,
specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the
application;
         (b)   The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant
makes a supplemental written submission in response to the city’s notice of
incompleteness; and
         (c)   Following a supplemental submission, the city will notify the
applicant within ten days that the supplemental submission did not provide the
information identified in the original notice delineating missing information.
The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to
the procedures identified in division (C)(4)(a) above. In the case of a second
or subsequent notice of incompleteness, the city may not specify missing
documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of
incompleteness.
      (5)   Failure to act. In the event the city fails to act on a request
seeking approval for an eligible facilities request under this subchapter
within the timeframe for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall
be deemed granted. The deemed grant becomes effective when the applicant
notifies the city in writing after the review period has expired (accounting
for any tolling) that the application has been deemed granted.
   (D)   Review of small cell facility applications.
      (1)   Application. In all zoning districts, small cell facilities shall
be considered a use by right subject to administrative review. The city shall
prepare and make publicly available an application form.

nondiscriminatory basis, and the city shall approve or deny an application for:
collocation of small cell facility on an existing structure within 60 days of
receipt of the application; or within 90 days for applications to deploy a
small cell facility using a new structure.
      (3)   Tolling of the timeframe for review. The review periods begin to
run when the application is filed and may be tolled only by mutual agreement of
the city and the applicant, or in cases where the Director determines that the
application is incomplete.
         (a)   Within ten days of receiving an initial application, the city
will determine and notify the applicant whether the application is materially
complete.
         (b)   If an application is materially incomplete, the city will
specifically identify the missing documents or information, and the specific
rule or regulation creating the obligation to submit such documents or
information.
         (c)   The shot clock set forth in division (D)(2) above shall restart
at zero on the date which the applicant submits all the documents and
information identified by the city to make the application complete. If the
applicant’s supplemental submission fails to make the application complete, and
the city notifies the applicant within ten days of the supplemental submission,
and clearly and specifically identifies the missing documents or information,
the applicable shot clock set forth in division (D)(2) above shall be tolled
until the applicant provides the missing documents and information. The shot
clock resumes (the date calculation does not restart) to run on the date when
the applicant submits all the documents and information identified by the city
to render the application complete.
      (4)   Failure to act. If the city fails to issue a decision on an
application for a small wireless facility within the required time periods set
forth in this subchapter, it shall constitute a “failure to act” within the
meaning of 47 U.S.C. § 332(c)(7)(B).

standards regarding pedestrian access or movement;
         (d)   Fails to comply with reasonable and nondiscriminatory spacing
requirements that apply to other communications service providers and electric
utilities in the ROW and that concern the location of ground-mounted equipment
and new alternative tower structures. Such spacing requirements shall not
prevent a small wireless facility from serving any location;
         (e)   Fails to comply with applicable codes; or
         (f)   Fails to comply with the requirements in this chapter.
      (6)   Documentation; revised application. The city must document the
basis for a denial, including the specific code provisions on which the denial
was based, and send the documentation to the applicant on or before the day the
city denies an application. The applicant may cure the deficiencies identified
by the city and resubmit the application within 30 days of the denial without
paying an additional application fee. The city shall approve or deny the
revised application within 30 days. Any subsequent review shall be limited to
the deficiencies cited in the denial.
   (E)   Review procedure for WCFs excluding small wireless facilities and
eligible facilities requests.
      (1)   Application. The city shall prepare and make publicly available an
application form for WCFs.

within 150 of recent of the application. Upon receipt of an application for a
request pursuant to this subchapter, the city shall review such application,
make its final decision to approve or disapprove the application and advise the
applicant in writing of its final decision.

written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt of the application,
specifically delineating all missing documents or information required in the
application.
         (b)   The timeframe for review begins running again when the applicant
makes a supplemental submission in response to the city’s notice of
incompleteness.
         (c)   Following a supplemental submission, the city will notify the
applicant within ten days if the supplemental submission did not provide the
information identified in the original notice delineating missing information.
The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or subsequent notices pursuant to
the procedures identified in this subchapter. Second or subsequent notices of
incompleteness may not specify missing documents or information that was not
delineated in the original notice of incompleteness.
      (4)   Failure to act. In the event the city fails to approve or deny a
complete application under this subchapter within the timeframe for review
(accounting for any tolling), the applicant shall be entitled to pursue all
remedies under applicable law.
   (F)   Decision. Any decision to approve, approve with conditions or deny an
application for a WCF shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence
in a written record. The applicant shall receive a copy of the decision.

      (1)   Generally. All R-5 Districts’ principal and accessory uses (except
signs) which are situated on a parcel which abuts a Residential District, other
than R-5 or R-6 uses, shall be screened from such district by an approved wall
or fence not less than six feet in height above the level of the adjacent
property at the district boundary. Walls or fences of lesser heights or
planting screens may be permitted by the city if there is a finding that the
nature or extent of the use being screened is such that a lesser degree of
screening will as adequately promote the use and enjoyment of the properties
within the adjacent Residential District, or there is a finding that a
screening of the type required by this subchapter would interfere with the
provisions of adequate amounts of light and air to said properties. All
required screening devices shall be designed so that they are architecturally
harmonious with the principal structures on the site, and they shall be
properly maintained so as not to become unsightly, hazardous or less opaque
than when originally constructed.
      (2)   Exception. This provision shall not apply when the apartment
development is adjacent to an already existing nonresidential use (i.e.,
school, church) in a Residential District. Such exception to the screening
requirement shall only be allowed along that property line between the
apartment development and the nonresidential land use.
      (3)   Timing of installation. It shall be the responsibility of the
developer of the R-5 or R-6 property requiring screening to install said
screening prior to issuance of the occupancy permit and/or commencement of the
R-5 or R-6 use. Screening shall be installed whether or not the adjacent
residential property is developed.
   (B)   Business and industrial development.
      (1)   Generally. All principal and accessory uses (except signs) which
are situated on a parcel which abuts a Residential District shall be screened
from such district by an approved wall or fence not less than six feet in
height above the level of the residential property at the district boundary.
Walls or fences of lesser heights or planting screens may be permitted by the
city if there is a finding that the nature or extent of the use being screened
is such that a lesser degree of screening will as adequately promote the use
and enjoyment of the properties within the adjacent Residential District, or
there is a finding that a screening of the type required by this subchapter
would interfere with the provisions of adequate amounts of light and air to
same said properties. All required screening devices shall be designed so that
they are architecturally harmonious with the principal structures on the site,
and they shall be properly maintained so as not to become unsightly, hazardous
or less opaque than when originally constructed.
      (2)   Timing of installation. It shall be the responsibility of the
developer of the business or industrial property requiring screening to install
said screening prior to issuance of the occupancy permit and/or commencement of
the use. Screening shall be installed whether or not the adjacent residential
property is developed.

manner and of substantial material reasonably suited for the purpose for which
the fence is proposed to be used. Every fence shall be maintained in a
condition of reasonable repair and shall not be allowed to become and remain in
a condition of disrepair, damage or unsightliness, or constitute a nuisance,
public or private. Any such fence which is, or has become, dangerous to the
public safety, health or welfare, or has become unsightly through improper
maintenance or neglect, is a public nuisance, and the Zoning Enforcement
Officer shall commence proper proceedings for the abatement thereof.
         (b)   Link or wire fences, wherever permitted, shall be constructed in
such a manner that no barbed ends shall be at the top except in Industrial
Districts and shall be constructed of at least 11-gauge or equal.
      (2)   Measuring fence height. The height of any fence shall be calculated
to the uppermost point as follows.
         (a)   In required yards abutting a street, the height of the fence
shall be the total effective height measured from the finished grade on the
side nearest the street.
         (b)   In other required yards, the height of the fence shall be the
total effective height above the finished grade measured on the side nearest

restricts access from the front to the rear yard, a gate, identifiable
collapsible section or other such means of recognizable ingress shall be
unobstructed and a minimum of three feet in width. The location of such ingress
points shall be positioned at any point paralleling the front lot line between
the side lot property line and the principal structure.
      (5)   In corner side yards, fences up to six feet in height may be
permitted, provided that no fence may be built in a corner side yard that is
adjacent to a neighboring front yard unless it meets the front yard fencing
requirements of divisions (D)(1) and (D)(2) above.
   (E)   Business and Industrial District fences. Fences in all Commercial and
Industrial Districts shall not exceed ten feet in height, except that boundary
line fences abutting Residential Districts shall not be greater than six feet

feet of the special purpose fence property and making findings that the fence
is necessary to protect, buffer or improve the premises for which the fence is
intended. The Zoning Administrator shall notify adjacent property owners within
five working days of receipt of a complete application. The determination of
the Zoning Administrator shall be made no sooner than ten calendar days
following notification of adjacent property owners, and said decision may be
appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission by letter filed within ten
working days of the permit determination.
   (G)   Finished sides. In all districts, any fence so constructed as to have
only one finished side shall be erected such that the finished side of the
fence is exposed to the adjacent property, with the exception of the following
situations. For the purpose of this division (G), FINISHED SIDE shall be
defined as not having its supporting members significantly visible.
      (1)   Where adjoining lots share a common side lot line, the finished
side requirement shall be waived along the common side lot line between the
front building line and the rear lot line.
      (2)   Where adjoining lots share a common rear lot line, the finished
side requirement shall be waived along the entire length of the common rear lot
line.
      (3)   Where corner lots share a common side or rear lot line with
adjoining lots, the finished side requirement shall be waived along the common
side and rear lot lines but not to extend past the building lines of the
adjacent interior lots.

street is prohibited.
      (4)   Preserving off-site parking. When required accessory off-street

§ 157.139 NONCONFORMING USES AND DEVELOPMENT.
   (A)   General. It is recognized that within the zoning districts established
by this subchapter there are uses and developments, which were lawful prior to
the adoption of this subchapter, which would be prohibited, regulated or
restricted under its present terms. These uses and developments are declared to
be incompatible with permitted uses and developments in the zoning district
involved and are, therefore, considered nonconforming.
   (B)   Intent. It is the intent of this subchapter to permit nonconforming
uses and development to continue in the size and manner which they presently
exist until such time as they are removed or abandoned, but not to encourage
their continuance. This chapter strives, therefore, to move property toward
conformance, rather than away from it.
   (C)   Nonconforming uses.
      (1)   Continuance. Any use lawfully existing upon the effective date of
this subchapter may be continued at the size and in the manner of operation
existing upon such date except as hereinafter specified.
      (2)   Establishment of use. For the purposes of this section, a use shall
be deemed as established on the date said use commences. Issuance of a permit
or other approval for a use that is never commenced shall not be deemed
establishment of use.
      (3)   Change of use. Any change of use associated with a nonconforming
use shall not be approved unless said use conforms with the requirements of
this subchapter and the underlying zoning district regulations. Once a lawful
nonconforming use of any structure or land in any district has been changed to
a conforming use, the Zoning Administrator shall issue a certificate of zoning
conformance, and the use shall not thereafter be changed to any nonconforming
use unless said change occurs due to a change in this chapter. These
regulations shall apply even if there is no change of ownership or tenancy.
      (4)   Abandonment/discontinuance of use. Whenever a nonconforming use of
a structure or land is discontinued or abandoned for a period of one year, any
future use of said structure or land shall be in conformity with the provisions
of any other applicable ordinance or regulation.
      (5)   Reconstruction. Whenever a nonconforming use of a structure has
been damaged by fire, flood, explosions, earthquake, war, riot or act of God,
it may be reconstructed and use as before if reconstructed within 12 months
after such calamity, provided the reconstruction shall be for the same use in
existence prior to said fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot or act of
God and shall be in conformance with all other provisions of this subchapter
except use shall not enlarge the size or manner of operation existing upon the
date of calamity. Any reconstruction shall be subject to §
157.133, as well as any other applicable ordinance or regulation.
      (6)   Maintenance. Normal maintenance of a structure containing or
related to a lawful nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary
structural repairs, provided such structural repairs do not enlarge or
intensify the nonconforming use.
      (7)   Expansion. Nonconforming uses shall not be expanded, enlarged
extended or intensified, even if structures associated with said nonconforming
uses are conforming structures. Once a nonconforming use has been reduced in
size, it shall not thereinafter be expanded.
      (8)   Multiple uses. In the case where a structure or structures on the
same property contain multiple uses, some or all of which are nonconforming,
cessation of one or more of the nonconforming uses shall be considered a change
in use, and not a discontinuance or abandonment of use, and the provisions of
division (C)(2) above shall apply.
      (9)   Relocation. A nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in
part to any other portion of the lot, tract or parcel occupied by said use
after the effective date of this subchapter.
      (10)   Change of tenancy, ownership or management. A change in ownership,
tenancy or management of property containing a nonconforming use shall not have
an impact upon the nonconforming status of said property, provided, however,
all other provisions of this subchapter shall apply.
      (11)   Burden of proof. If nonconforming rights are challenged, or if
there is a request to expand a nonconforming development, it shall be the
property owner’s responsibility to provide written proof, through business
records or other records and data, that the nonconforming use has not ceased
operation for a period of one year or been converted to a conforming use. It
shall also be the property owner’s responsibility to provide proof that the
nonconforming use legally existed or was previously grandfathered, at the time
this subchapter was adopted.
   (D)   Nonconforming development; structures.
      (1)   Safety considerations. Nothing in this subchapter shall affect the
requirement that a structure be maintained in a safe condition where said
structure is declared unsafe by the Building Inspector.
      (2)   Reconstruction. Whenever a lawful nonconforming structure has been
damaged by fire, flood, explosions, earthquake, war, riot or act of God, it may
be reconstructed and used as before if reconstructed within 12 months after
such calamity, provided the reconstruction shall be for the same use in
existence prior to said fire, flood, explosion, earthquake, war, riot or act of
God and shall be in conformance with all other provisions of this subchapter,
except use shall not enlarge the size or manner of operation existing upon the
date of calamity. Any reconstruction shall be subject to §
157.133 as well as any other applicable ordinance or regulation.
      (3)   Expansion.
         (a)   Nonconforming structures with conforming uses. Nonconforming
structures with conforming uses may be expanded, provided said expansion does
not create greater nonconforming yards or heights and said expansion does not
create an associated expansion of a nonconforming use. Said expansions shall
meet the requirements of §
157.141.
         (b)    Residential dwelling units. Alterations may be made to a
structure containing lawful nonconforming residential units when they will
improve the livability thereof, provided they will not increase the number of
dwelling units and provided the proposed alterations meet the requirements of
division (D)(3)(a) above.
      (4)   Relocation. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved to any
other portion of the lot, tract or parcel occupied by said structure after the
effective date of this subchapter unless said relocation would make the
structure conforming.
      (5)   Change of tenancy, ownership or management. A change in ownership,
tenancy or management of property containing a nonconforming structure shall
not have an impact upon the nonconforming status of said property, provided,
however, all other provisions of this subchapter shall apply.
      (6)   Manufactured homes. Replacement of existing, nonconforming
manufactured homes shall be permitted in accordance with the provisions of §
157.086(C).
   (E)   Nonconforming development; lots.
      (1)   At the time of the enactment of this subchapter, if an owner of a
plot of land consisting of one or more adjacent lots in a subdivision of record
does not own sufficient contiguous land to enable him or her to conform to the
minimum lot size requirements, or does not have sufficient lot width to conform
to the minimum lot width requirements, such plot of land may nevertheless be
used as a building site. The dimensional requirements of the district in which
the piece of land is located may be reduced by the smallest amount that will
permit a structure of acceptable size to be built upon the lot, such reduction
to be determined by the Board of Adjustment.
         (a)   In the R-1, R-2 and R-3 Zones, the reductions shall permit only
a single-family residence.
         (b)   In the R-4 Zone, the reductions shall permit only a duplex.
         (c)   In the R-5 Zone, the reductions shall permit only a townhouse
cluster or apartment containing no more than five units.
         (d)   In the R-6 Zone, the reductions shall permit only a single-
family dwelling or a mobile home of less than 18 feet in width.
      (2)   No lot, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots in
the same ownership at the time of passage of this subchapter, shall be reduced
in size so that lot width or size of yards or lot area or any other requirement
of this subchapter is not maintained. This section shall not apply when a
portion of a lot is acquired for a public purpose.

§ 157.140 SOLAR ACCESS.
   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect the health, safety
and general welfare of the community by encouraging the use of solar energy
systems. The overall objective of these regulations is to provide adequate
protection from interference by structures, trees or topography. It is the
intent of this section to provide a means of protection for the use of solar
collectors without causing undue hardships on the rights of adjacent property
owners and to establish solar collectors as a permitted use in all zoning
districts.
   (B)   Application. Any person who desires to obtain a solar right shall
first make application to the Zoning Administrator for a solar access permit. A
permit application for a solar right shall consist of the following materials:

rights permit for any solar collector which complies with these regulations.
      (2)   Following tentative approval, a copy of the solar rights legal
description and site plan will be mailed to all potentially affected property
owners.
      (3)   If no protest is received and substantiated within five working
days of the mailing, the solar right shall be deemed approved.
   (D)   Recording of solar rights and permits. The permit application and site
plan shall be filed in the County Clerk’s office after the Zoning Administrator
approves the solar rights application and site plan. A recording fee for filing
the permit application and site plan, made payable to the County Clerk, shall
be submitted to the Planning Department. The Zoning Administrator shall be
responsible for recording the permit application and site plan. The application
and site plan shall become official after being recorded in the County Clerk’s
office.
   (E)   Use regulations; shading of collectors unlawful.
      (1)   Solar collectors shall be located on the solar user’s property so
as not to unreasonably or unnecessarily restrict the uses of neighboring
property. The solar right shall not limit any adjacent property owner from
building within the building envelope of his or her lot.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided by these regulations, it is unlawful
for any person to erect a building or other structure, or to allow a tree,
shrub or other vegetation to cast a shadow upon a solar collector which is
greater than the shadow cast by a hypothetical ten-foot high wall located along
the property lines between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m., MST, on the
winter solstice day.

WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEMS
§ 157.175 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide standards for placement of wind
energy conversion systems (WECSs) within the city, while achieving the
following goals:
   (A)   Promoting the safe, effective and efficient use of WECSs in order to
reduce consumption of fossil fuels associated with production of electricity;
   (B)   Preserving and protecting public health, safety, welfare and quality
of life by minimizing the potential adverse impacts of WECSs;
   (C)   Establishing standards and procedures for siting, design, engineering,
installation, operation and maintenance of WECSs; and
   (D)   Promoting wind energy development to meet some or all of the
electrical energy needs of a property through WECSs placed on that property.
Development of large-scale WECSs for export of wind energy is not consistent
with the purpose or intent of this chapter.
(Prior Code, § 13-817)
§ 157.176 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL (DBA). A measurement of sound pressure level, which
has been filtered or weighted to progressively deemphasize the importance of
frequency components below 1,000 hertz and above 5,000 hertz. This reflects the
fact that human hearing is less sensitive at low frequencies and at extremely
high frequencies, relative to the mid-range of the frequency spectrum. This
area of sensitivity also corresponds to the human speech band.
   DECIBEL (DB). The measurement of a sound pressure relative to the
logarithmic conversion of the sound pressure reference level often set as zero
db (A-weighted). In general, the quietest sound humans can hear is near zero db
(A-weighted) and the loudest range of human hearing without pain is near 120 db
(A-weighted).
   FAA. The Federal Aviation Administration of the United States Department of
Transportation.
   GUY CABLE. Any cable or wire that extends from a wind energy conversion
system to the ground or supporting structure for the purpose of supporting the
system structure.
   METEOROLOGICAL TOWER (MET TOWER). A facility consisting of a tower and
related wind-measuring devices, which is used solely to measure winds
preliminary to construction of a small wind energy conversion system.
   MICRO WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM. A building-mounted wind energy
conversion system (either a vertical or horizontal axis turbine) that has a
rated nameplate capacity of one kilowatt or less and projects no more than 15
feet above the highest point of the roof. All MICRO WIND ENERGY CONVERSION
SYSTEMS shall be attached to a principal structure.
   RATED NAMEPLATE CAPACITY. The maximum rated output of electric power
production equipment. This output is typically specified by the manufacturer
with a “nameplate” on the equipment.
   SHADOW FLICKER. The visible flicker effect when rotating blades of the wind
energy conversion system cast shadows on the ground and nearby structures
causing a repeating pattern of light and shadow.
   SMALL WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM. A wind energy conversion system
consisting of a tower, a turbine and associated control or conversion
electronics that generates power for an individual property for the purpose of
reducing on-site energy consumption with a rated nameplate capacity of 25
kilowatts or less per system. This includes, but is not limited to, storage,
electrical collection and supply equipment and transformers. Excess electrical
power generated, and not presently needed for on-site use, may be utilized by
the utility company.
   SYSTEM HEIGHT. The vertical distance from ground level to the tip of the
wind generator blade when it is at its highest point. If the wind energy
conversion system is installed on a roof, the SYSTEM HEIGHT is equal to the
roof height (as measured from the ground level to the base of the WECS) plus
the vertical distance from the roof to the tip of the wind generator blade when
it is at its highest point.
   TOWER. The monopole, guyed monopole or lattice structure that supports a
wind generator.
   TURBINE. The parts of a wind energy conversion system, including the blades,
generator and tail. The definition of a TURBINE includes both horizontal axis
wind turbines (HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT).
   TURBINE CLEARANCE. The distance between ground level and the lowest point of
a turbine blade in its rotation.
   WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM (WECS). Any wind energy conversion system that
converts wind energy into electricity through the use of a wind generator and
includes the rotor, tower, pad transformer (if any) and associated equipment.
For the purpose of this chapter, WECSs may be classified as either micro or
small, dependent upon rated nameplate capacity.
(Prior Code, § 13-817) (Ord. 2012-11, passed 1-2-2013)

   (A)   Permitted accessory use. Micro wind energy conversion systems shall be
permitted as an accessory use in all zoning districts other than the Open Space
(O-1) Zoning District, subject to the requirements herein.
   (B)   Maximum system height. Micro wind energy conversion systems shall not
exceed the maximum building height for the district in which they are located,
nor shall they exceed 15 feet in height above the supporting building height.
For those zoning districts without a maximum building height, maximum system
height shall be equal to the supporting building height plus 15 feet. If the
supporting building height plus 15 feet exceeds the maximum building height for
the zoning district, the applicant may seek a conditional use permit for
placement of the micro WECS for a height not to exceed 15 feet above the
maximum district height, provided the following findings can be made:
      (1)   The proposed micro WECS shall not adversely impact any neighboring
property owner’s view;

the district was intended and to be of substantial benefit to significant
segments of the populace of the city. For that reason, no amendment to this
chapter shall be adopted whereby a zoning classification is established for any
land area unless the area to be zoned meets the following minimum size

2009; Ord. 2012-02, passed 3-20-2012)
§ 157.215 PROCEDURE FOR VARIANCES.
   (A)   Generally. The Board of Adjustment may allow a departure from the
terms of the zoning regulations pertaining to height or width of structures or
the size of yard and open spaces where such departure will not be contrary to
the public interest, and where, owing to conditions peculiar to the property
because of its size, shape or topography, and not as a result of the action of
the applicant, the literal enforcement of this chapter would deprive the owner
of the reasonable use of the land and/or building involved.
   (B)   Application for variance. A request for variance shall be made by
filing at least ten days prior to the Board meeting an application with the
Zoning Administrator; such application shall be accompanied by a development
plan showing such information as the Zoning Administrator may reasonably
require for purposes of this chapter. The plans shall contain sufficient
information for the Board to make a proper decision on the matter. The request
shall state the exceptional conditions and the peculiar and practical
difficulties claimed as a basis for a variance. In all cases, the application
shall include:
      (1)   Name and address of the applicant;
      (2)   The legal description of the property involved in the request for
variance, including the street address, if any, of the property;
      (3)   The names and addresses of the owners of the property and any other
persons having a legal interest therein;

form.
   (C)   Notice of hearing. Notice of a variance hearing shall be mailed at
least seven days prior to the Board meeting to each owner of property situated
wholly or partly within 200 feet of the property to which the variance relates.
The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for mailing such notices. For the
purpose of giving mailed notice, the Zoning Administrator shall require the
owner of the property affected to furnish the names and addresses of all
property owners within 200 feet of the property.
   (D)   Review and decision by the Board of Adjustment. In considering
applications for variance, the Board shall consider the effect of the proposed
variance upon the health, safety and welfare of the community, traffic
conditions, light and air, danger of fire, risk to the public safety and the
effect on values of property in the surrounding area. The Board shall hear oral
or written statements from the applicant, the public, city staff or its own
members. If the Board determines by motion that: the special conditions
applying to the structure or land in question are peculiar to such property or
immediately surrounding area and do not apply generally to other land or
structures in the district in which said land is located; granting the proposed
variance will not in any way impair health, safety, welfare or in any other
respect be contrary to the intent of this chapter and the city’s comprehensive
plan; and the granting of such variance will not merely serve as a convenience
to the applicant but is necessary to alleviate demonstrable hardship or
difficulty, the Board may grant such variance and impose conditions and
safeguards therein.

§ 157.217 PROCEDURE FOR CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT APPROVAL.
   (A)   Generally. Certain uses, while generally not suitable in a particular
zoning district, may, under certain circumstances, be acceptable. When such
circumstances exist, a conditional use permit may be granted. The permit may be
issued for a specified period of time, with automatic cancellation at the end
of that time unless it is renewed, or conditions may be applied to the issuance
of the permit and periodic review may be required. The permit shall be granted
for a particular use and not for a particular person or firm.
   (B)   Application for conditional use permit. Applications for conditional
use permit approval shall be made on a form provided by the Zoning
Administrator together with the required fee. All applications shall be signed
by the property owner(s) of record. The request for a conditional use permit
shall follow the procedures and applicable requirements of §
157.216.
      (1)   Conditional uses which are listed in this chapter as having certain
pre-established conditions as set forth in this chapter may be processed under
the minor site plan procedures and requirements unless otherwise specified.
      (2)   Conditional uses having no pre-established conditions as set forth
in this chapter shall be processed under the major site plan procedures and
requirements, except that electrical substations, gas regulating stations,
water pump stations, water towers and lift stations, when approved as part of a
PUD or subdivision, shall be exempt from the fees and provisions for
conditional uses. In addition, retaining walls shall be processed as a minor
site plan.
   (C)   Notification of conditional use permit review. A notice of conditional
use permit review shall be mailed at least seven days prior to the Planning and
Zoning Commission meeting to each owner of property situated wholly or
partially within 200 feet of the property to which the conditional use permit
relates. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for mailing such
notices.
   (D)   Review and decision by Planning and Zoning Commission.
      (1)   No conditional use permit shall be given for a use which is not
listed in this chapter as a conditional use in the particular district in which
it is proposed to be located. The Commission shall consider the effect of the
proposed use upon the health, safety and general welfare of occupants of
surrounding lands, existing and anticipated traffic conditions, including
parking facilities on adjacent streets and land, and the effect of the proposed
use on the comprehensive plan. The Commission may grant the application by
motion, imposing such conditions and safeguards as it deems necessary, or it
may deny the application.
      (2)   Applications for conditional use permits may be denied by motion of
the Commission. If an application is denied, the denial shall constitute a
finding that the applicant has not shown that the conditions required for
approval do exist. No application for a conditional use permit which has been
denied wholly or in part shall be resubmitted for a period of six months from
the date of said order of denial, except on grounds of new evidence or proof of
change of conditions found to be valid by the Commission.
   (E)   Notification of Commission action. The applicant shall be notified in
writing of the action taken by the Commission. If the application has been
granted, the permit shall be issued upon the signature of the Chairperson of
the Planning and Zoning Commission and the Zoning Administrator, and any
conditions, automatic termination date or period of review shall be stated on
the permit.
   (F)   City Council action required. Conditionally permitted uses in the Open
Space/Unclassified Zone (O-1) shall not become effective without Council
approval by resolution.

be included in the preliminary development plan and what exceptions or
variances to this chapter it may be willing to allow in exchange for certain
publicly beneficial design or planning features.
      (3)   City Council review. It is not required that the City Council
review PUD concept plans, however, the applicant may request a concept plan
review by the Council following Commission review and comment. The scope of

200 feet of the property to which the PUD relates. The Zoning Administrator
shall be responsible for placing and mailing such notices. For purposes of
giving mailed notice, the Zoning Administrator shall require the applicant to
furnish the names and addresses of all property owners within 200 feet of the
property. The Zoning Administrator shall make a copy of the notice and a list
of the owners and addresses to which the notice was sent as a part of the
record of the proceedings. Failure of individual property owners to receive
notice shall not invalidate the proceedings.
            3.   In addition, within ten days of the first hearing a sign
indicating proposed planned unit development shall be posted by the developer
on the affected property, however, failure of a sign to be posted or remain
posted may not invalidate the proceedings.
         (b)   Review.
            1.   In considering applications for PUD approval, the Commission
shall consider the following: interrelationship with the plan elements to
conditions both on and off the property; conformance to the city’s

            3.   If the Commission shall determine by motion that the proposed
preliminary development plan will not be detrimental to the health, safety or
welfare of the community nor will cause traffic congestion or seriously
depreciate surrounding property values and at the same time is in harmony with
the purposes and intent of this chapter, the plan for the area and the
comprehensive plan, the Commission may recommend granting preliminary
development plan approval along with necessary conditions and safeguards.
            4.   The Commission shall notify the City Council in writing of its
recommendation.
      (3)   City Council review and hearing.
         (a)   Notice of hearing.
            1.   The City Council shall hold a hearing on the preliminary

         (c)   Public protest against PUD. If there is a written protest
against the preliminary development plan signed by the owners of 20% or more of
the property within 140 feet of the proposed PUD, the preliminary development
plan shall not be approved except upon the affirmative vote of three-fourths of
all members of the City Council. If the above protest requirement is not met,
approval may be by majority vote of the membership of the City Council.
   (E)   Final development plan.
      (1)   Approval. Final PUD development plan approval by the Council and
the issuance of a planned unit development permit shall occur only when:

planned unit development complying with all of the requirements of Chapter 156,
except to the extent that the Council may give specific permission to the
effect that specific portions of Chapter 156 need not be complied with. Such
required plats shall contain on their face a cross-reference to the final
development plan.
   (F)   Method of withdrawing an application for PUD approval. Any application
for a planned unit development permit may be withdrawn by the applicant at any
time prior to filing the final plat, or at any time prior to physical
implementation of the approved permit, such as the commencement of construction
on the permit site, upon written notification to the Zoning Administrator and
City Clerk. The PUD shall be null and void upon receipt of such notice by the
city.
   (G)   Amendments to PUD approval.
      (1)   Minor changes. Minor changes in the location and placement of
buildings may be authorized by the Zoning Administrator and Director of
Engineering and Operations where unforeseen circumstances, such as engineering
requirements, dictate such change. When in question the Zoning Administrator
and the Director of Engineering and Operations may determine whether the
changes shall be classified as a minor or major change or may refer the
question to the Planning and Zoning Commission if they deem it necessary.
      (2)   Major changes. Major changes, such as alterations in structural
types, in the shapes and arrangements of lots and blocks and in the allocation
of open space or other land uses which increase density and/or intensity of the
project, and all other changes which significantly affect the overall design of
the project, shall be referred to the Planning and Zoning Commission for report
and recommendation to the Council after which the City Council shall hold a
public hearing and shall either approve or deny the changes in the final
detailed development plan. If such changes are authorized, the developer shall
submit a revised plan showing the authorized changes. The requirements of
division (D)(3) above shall apply to requests for major changes. Applications

such notice. For the purpose of giving mailed notice, the Board may require the
owner of the property affected to furnish an abstractor’s certified property
certificate showing the property owners within 200 feet of the property. The
Zoning Administrator shall make a copy of the notice and a list of the owners
and addresses to which the notice was sent as a part of the record of
proceedings. The failure to receive notice by individual property owners shall
not invalidate the proceedings.
   (D)   Review and decision by the Board. Within 30 days of the date of

satisfactorily correct the situation in question, but it may not attempt to
infringe upon matters not specifically contained in the appeal.
   (E)   Notice of Board decision. The Board shall issue a written notice of
its decision to all concerned parties and to the City Clerk. The notice shall
state the facts of the matter as determined by the Board, the reasons for its

§ 157.220 ZONING PERMITS.
   (A)   Generally. Buildings and structures exempted under the International
Codes shall be required to secure a zoning permit prior to commencing
construction. Specifically, those uses which require a zoning permit are as
follows:
      (1)   Fences not over six feet high;
      (2)   Retaining walls less than four feet in height measured from the
bottom of the footing to the top of the wall;
      (3)   Driveways;
      (4)   One-story detached nonresidential accessory buildings used as tool
and storage sheds, playhouses and similar uses, provided the roof area does not
exceed 120 square feet, in accordance with the International Building Code;
      (5)   Detached membrane structures with floor area not exceeding 250
square feet;
      (6)   One-story detached residential accessory buildings used as tool and
storage sheds, playhouses and similar uses, provided the roof area does not

§ 157.221 PARALLEL CONDITIONAL USE DISTRICTS.
   (A)   Generally. The purpose of this section is to provide a voluntary
alternative procedure for the rezoning of a property for a specified use. A
broad range of uses are permitted in each general district. However, there are
instances where a general zoning district designation is clearly inappropriate
for a certain property, but a specific use permitted under that district and
subject to restrictive conditions would be consistent with the spirit and
objectives of this chapter. Parallel conditional use districts, herein
established, are intended to accommodate such situations. This voluntary
procedure is intended for use with firm development proposals and is neither
intended nor suited for securing early zoning for tentative uses which may not
be undertaken for a long period of time.

   (B)   Application. Applications for establishment of a parallel conditional
use districts shall be submitted and reviewed in accordance with §
157.214. In addition, emphasis will be given to an evaluation of the
characteristics of the specific use proposed in relationship to surrounding
property. Plans containing the information specified in §
157.216, plus any additional limitations or restrictions the petitioner may
wish to propose, may be required as determined by the Zoning Officer to
accompany an application for a parallel conditional use district zoning
designation.
   (C)   Permitted uses and development requirements. Potential uses which may
be requested for a parallel conditional use district shall be restricted to
only those uses permitted in the corresponding general zoning district as
designated in this chapter. Uses permitted in parallel conditional use
districts shall be subject to all applicable development standards and
requirements for that use listed in the corresponding general zoning districts
as set forth elsewhere in this chapter and any particular requirements or
restrictions approved and made a part of the conditional use permit by the
governing body.
   (D)   Issuance of a parallel conditional use permit. If the governing body
approves a petition for a parallel conditional use district it shall issue a
parallel conditional use permit authorizing the requested use with such
reasonable conditions as the governing body determines to be necessary in
promoting public health, safety and general welfare.
   (E)   Zoning map designation. Following approval by the governing body of a
parallel conditional use district, the property for which approval was granted
shall be identified on the official zoning map by the appropriate conditional
use district designation (CD).
   (F)   Effect of approval. If an application is approved, the parallel
conditional use district thus established and all conditions attached thereto
shall be binding upon the property and all subsequent development and use of
the property shall be in accordance with the approved plan and conditions. The
intent of this type of zoning is to provide a procedure for specific
development proposals, and as such it is intended that all property rezoned be
in accordance with firm plans to develop. Therefore, two years from the date of
approval, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall examine progress made to
develop in accordance with approved plans. If it is determined that active
efforts to so develop are neither proceeding nor have been completed, it shall
be the responsibility of the property owner to justify to the Planning and
Zoning Commission any delay in development. If the Planning and Zoning
Commission finds that such delay is unjustified, or that the intent of the
rezoning procedure as stated in this section has been violated, it shall
forward a report of its findings to the governing body which may recommend that
proceedings to rezone the subject property to its former designation be
initiated.

   A petition for an amendment to the zoning map or to this chapter that has
been denied shall not again be instituted earlier than one year from the date
of denial unless the City Council, after considering the advice of the Planning
and Zoning Commission, shall find that there have been substantial changes in
conditions or circumstances bearing on the application.

of the city in the development is in the best interest of the citizens of the
city and shall make a recommendation to the City Council.
   (B)   The City Council shall hold a public hearing at which it shall
consider the recommendation of the Planning and Zoning Commission as well as
the comments of the public and shall take action to approve or disapprove the
city’s involvement.

deny the exemption or table the exemption request. The exemption request may
not be tabled for more than two regular meetings of the Commission. The
Commission shall determine by motion that the proposed exemption is consistent
with the intent of the zoning district where the use is proposed and that the
proposed use will not be detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the
community, nor will cause traffic congestion or seriously depreciate
surrounding property values and at the same time is in harmony with the
purposes and intent of this chapter, the plan for the area and the
comprehensive plan.
   (F)   Notification of Commission action. The applicant shall be notified in
writing of the action taken by the Commission. If approved, the exemption shall
be granted upon the signature of the Planning and Zoning Commission Secretary.
