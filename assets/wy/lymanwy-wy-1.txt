modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests, and a reasonable contingency
fund. (See section
10-3-11 of this chapter.) (Ord. 9-92, 6-17-1993)
10-3-5: WASTEWATER CONTRIBUTION:
   A.   Residential User Calculation: The town of Lyman shall determine for
each residential user or user class the average monthly volume of wastewater
discharged to the wastewater system, by using winter water consumption volumes
determined by reading meters for October through April and then dividing total
winter volume by seven (7) months.
   B.   New Services: New services without a prior year's volume to base rates
will be charged according to average residential or nonresidential rates. (Ord.
2006-9, 7-20-2006)
10-3-6: WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE:
   A.   Basis For Monthly User Charge: For residential users, monthly user
charges will be based on actual winter water usage. If a user has a consumptive
use of water or in some other manner uses water which is not discharged into
the wastewater collection system, the user charge for that contributor may be
based on readings of wastewater meter(s) or separate water meter(s) installed
and maintained at the user's expense. For nonresidential users, monthly user
charges will be based on actual monthly water usage throughout the year.
   B.   Classification As Residential: The governing body may classify
institutional, religious, industrial, commercial, and other nonresidential
establishments as a residential user; provided, that the wastes from these
establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user
with respect to volume, strength, and delivery flow rate characteristics (see
section
10-3-13 of this chapter).
   C.   Rates Established: Rates for wastewater service from the town municipal
system shall be established and/or amended by resolution of the town council.
Said rates set by said resolution(s) may include a flat base rate with monthly
base rates and/or graduated usage rates for wastewater usage beyond a specified
base rate. The town may also set, by resolution, additional rates and/or fees
for residential and nonresidential users whose wastewater has a greater
strength than normal domestic sewage, which surcharge is in addition to the
normal user charge that will be collected.
   D.   Septage Waste Haulers: Each septage waste hauler shall be assessed a
user charge rate to be set by resolution of the town council, including an
additional rate for septage of greater strength than is typically charged.
Nothing in this section shall require the town to accept septage into the
town's wastewater system.
   E.   Toxic Pollutants: Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants (see
chapter 2 of this title) which cause an increase in the cost of managing the
treatment works, or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by
interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of
operation, maintenance or replacement of the treatment works, shall pay for
such increased costs. The charge to each such user shall be as determined by
the appropriate financial personnel and approved by the town governing body.
   F.   Rates: All rates in effect at the enactment of this section shall
continue until amended by resolution of the town council. (Ord. 2017-05, 2-2-
2017)
10-3-7: WASTEWATER FACILITIES REPLACEMENT FUND:
A reserve fund called the wastewater facilities replacement fund is hereby
established within the wastewater utility fund for the purpose of providing
sufficient funds to be expended for obtaining and installing equipment,
accessories and appurtenances during the useful life (20 years) of the
wastewater treatment facilities necessary to maintain the capacity and
performance for which such facilities were designed and constructed. This fund
shall also be sufficient at the end of the useful life of the treatment
facility to replace facilities as necessary. Such an annual cost shall be
determined as outlined under "equipment replacement" in section
10-3-11 of this chapter. (Ord. 9-92, 6-17-1993)
10-3-8: BILLING AND DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS:
   A.   Billing: Wastewater service charges for use of the town of Lyman
wastewater system shall be due and payable monthly, on or before the end of
each month. The town clerk shall prepare and mail a statement of the wastewater
service charge to each user. This statement may be combined with the water rent
charges pursuant to section
10-1-5 of this title. All charges shall be paid to the town clerk at his office
in the town hall. There shall be no discount allowed. (Ord. 2007-01, 2-15-2007)
   B.   Deemed Delinquent: If the sewer user fails, refuses or neglects to pay
the wastewater charges within thirty (30) days of the mailing of notice of the
due charges, the bill shall become delinquent and may be collected by action or
fine for violation of this chapter in the municipal court, and the sewer access
may be immediately shut off.
   C.   Collection Policy: A collection policy for delinquent accounts shall be
adopted by resolution, which prescribes periods and practices for sending late
notices, hanging turnoff notice tags, turning off wastewater access, late
penalty fees, etc. (Ord. 2011-12, 9-1-2011)
   D.   Restoration Of Service: Before the wastewater service shall be
restored, all delinquent charges for the premises must be paid with an
additional fee, as established by policy, for restoring the service. (Ord.
2007-01, 2-15-2007)
   E.   Misdemeanor: Failure to pay delinquent water charges, as set out in
subsection A of this section, shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable by up
to seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) in addition to any and all arrearages,
if, after no less than thirty (30) days, and after a minimum of fifteen (15)
days after written notice. Notice shall be considered sufficient if said notice
is attached to the residence. (Ord. 2011-12, 9-1-2011)
10-3-9: REVIEW OF SERVICE CHARGE:
   A.   Annual Review: The town shall review the total annual cost of operation
and maintenance as well as each user's wastewater contribution not less often
than every year and will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of the
service charge system established herein and to assure that sufficient funds
are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment works.
   B.   Excess Revenues: After two (2) consecutive years of collecting excess
revenues, the town shall apply those revenues to the costs of operation and
maintenance for the next year and adjust the rates accordingly. If a
significant user, such as a business, has completed in house modifications
which would change that user's wastewater contribution, the user can present to
the town staff such factual information and the town shall then determine if
the user's wastewater contribution is to be changed.
   C.   Request For Review: Any user who feels his user charge is unjust and
inequitable may make written application to the town requesting a review of his
user charge.
   D.   Review Of Request: Review of the request shall be made by the town as
soon as is reasonable, and, if substantiated, the user charges for that user
shall be recomputed based upon the revised flow and/or strength data and the
new charges shall be applicable to the next billing cycle/period.
   E.   Fiscal Year End Balances: Fiscal year end balances in the operation,
maintenance, and replacement fund shall be used for no other purposes than
those designated. Monies which have been transferred from other sources to meet
temporary shortages in the operation, maintenance and replacement fund shall be
returned to their respective accounts upon appropriate adjustment of the user
charge rates for operation, maintenance, and replacement. The user charge rate
(s) shall be adjusted such that the transferred monies will be returned to
their respective accounts within six (6) months of the fiscal year in which the
monies were borrowed. (Ord. 9-92, 6-17-1993)
10-3-10: NOTIFICATION:
Each user will be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular
bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable
to wastewater treatment services. (Ord. 9-92, 6-17-1993)

   B.   Purposes: This title, by its nature, will also serve the following
specific purposes:
      1.   Each subdivider will know in advance what general subdivision design
is expected, will be able to use established principles of development for his
subdivision and will know what improvements will be necessary.
      2.   Adjoining landowners should have assurance that at a later date
their property can be subdivided without conflict with present plats and should
be protected against poor practices which would destroy values along their
property boundaries.
      3.   Future property owners should be able to purchase sites in newly
subdivided areas with the knowledge that legal descriptions are accurate and
that desirable features have been used in the subdivisions.
      4.   All taxpayers should save money by coordinated, logical street right
of way and utility extensions, and by assurance that improvements are made to
specified standards, and should be able to secure necessary land for public
purposes in advance of high values. (1987 Code § 16.04.010)
11-1-2: CONFORMANCE WITH PROVISIONS:
Under the authority vested in the town council and the planning and zoning
commission to protect the public health, safety and welfare, no final plat of
land subdivision shall be approved and accepted unless it conforms to the
provisions of this title. No annexation shall occur for more than one
previously or contemporaneously divided parcels unless the standards set forth
in this title have been or are contemporaneously applied in a manner which
allows the annexed parcel to be incorporated into town as a subdivision. (Ord.
2012-03, 3-1-2012)
11-1-3: APPLICABILITY:
   A.   Division Into Three Lots, Plats, Etc.: The division of a lot, tract or
parcel of land into three (3) or more lots, plats, sites or other divisions of
land for the purpose, whether immediate or future, of sale or building
development, shall make the transaction subject to the provisions of this title
whether a plat is recorded or not.
   B.   Filed And Recorded After Review And Approval: All plats of a
subdivision of land within the town shall be filed and recorded only after
having been reviewed and approved by the planning and zoning commission and
accepted and signed by the town council.

incorporated land within the town. (1987 Code § 16.04.030)
11-1-4: STREET ACCESS REQUIRED:
No building shall be erected on any lot nor shall a building permit be issued
for a building unless the street giving access to the lot upon which such
building is proposed to be placed has been approved by the planning and zoning
commission and accepted by the town council as a part of an official
subdivision where the land is subject to section
11-1-1 of this chapter. Dead end streets which are terminated due to natural or
preexisting manmade barriers or which form a continuous loop without any
intersecting street, private or public, may be retained in private ownership,
however a building permit shall only be issued if approved by the Planning and
Zoning Commission and a recordable document is created or produced absolving
the town from maintaining, improving, or upgrading the street. (1987 Code §
16.04.040; amd. Ord. 2020-01, 6-4-2020)

11-3-8: Hearing
11-3-9: Conditions On Approval
11-3-10: Expiration; Approval
11-3-1: BASIC CONSIDERATIONS:
   A.   Good Counsel Essential: A successful subdivision involves coordination
and understanding of many factors related to law, engineering, marketing,
financing and planning. Because of the need for thorough analysis, an
individual considering the platting of a parcel of land is advised to contact
his attorney, an engineer or surveyor, a real estate or marketing firm, a
financial lending institution and a land planning specialist. While certain
shortcuts may be possible, good counsel on all phases of a proposed subdivision
is essential at an early stage. Through this review, the subdivider may be able
to save time, avoid unnecessary mistakes and make the most of his
opportunities.
   B.   Questions To Be Considered: Some of the questions which should be
considered by both the subdivider and the planning and zoning commission at the
onset are as follows:
      1.   Is there a need for additional residential sites in the area?
      2.   What type and price homes are likely to be built?
      3.   What lot sizes would be most appropriate? (Lot sizes should conform
to zoning ordinance.)
      4.   Should areas be reserved for business or industrial use?
      5.   Does the tract include special scenic locations or areas of
historical importance which need to be reserved?
      6.   Will school and/or playground sites be required?
      7.   If the plat abuts a major street or expressway, will additional
right of way or limited access features be necessary?
      8.   Are portions of the area subject to flooding?
      9.   Are soil conditions favorable for construction purposes?
      10.   How can water, sanitary sewer, storm sewer, electrical and gas
utility services be provided?
      11.   Can the subdivision be designed as part of an existing
neighborhood?
      12.   Should the planned unit development concept be considered?
      13.   Can any of the land adjacent to the site be included?
      14.   Will the site be adversely affected by its surrounding environment
or will the proposed usage adversely affect the environment?
      15.   What legal or tax problems are likely to be encountered?
      16.   Does the proposed usage meet the requirements of the comprehensive
plan and zoning regulations? (1987 Code § 16.12.010)
11-3-2: PROCEDURAL OUTLINE:
The following outline is included as a guide for the subdivider to use in
obtaining systematic review and approval or disapproval of a proposed
subdivision. The planning and zoning commission may delegate the initial
contact and review responsibilities to an authorized representative:
   A.   Obtain Lyman subdivision and zoning information.
   B.   Analyze proposed development concepts for conformity.
   C.   Prepare preliminary sketch (optional).
   D.   Prepare preliminary plat with a vicinity map (unless the subdivision is
a minor subdivision.
   E.   Submit preliminary plat to planning and zoning commission no less than
fourteen (14) days before the next scheduled planning and zoning meeting.
   F.   Meet with Town Public Works Supervisor or designee to determine
placement of utilities, including the possible installation the entire length
of the subdivision or lots.
   G.   Prepare final plat.
   H.   Obtain required specifications, dedications, etc.
   I.   Submit final plat to planning and zoning commission.
   J.   Submit final plat to town council.
   K.   Record approved and signed final plat with accompanying Resolution of
the Town Council.
(1987 Code § 16.12.020; amd. Ord. 2020-01, 6-4-2020)
11-3-3: PRELIMINARY SKETCH:
If the subdivider chooses, he may submit a sketch map to the planning and
zoning commission (or their designated representative) for their review and
comments prior to making application for planning and zoning commission review
of the preliminary plat. The sketch map should be prepared in a manner which
generally defines the layout of the streets, lots and location of any public
uses, such as schools and parks. It is the purpose of the sketch map to resolve
any major points of disagreement with the planning and zoning commission before
the subdivider goes to the expense of designing and drawing the preliminary
plat. No action is required of the planning and zoning commission other than to
review the sketch plan and offer comments appropriate to the subdivider. (1987
Code § 16.12.030)
11-3-4: CONTENTS AND FILING OF PLAT:

commission without first reviewing the matter at a regularly established
meeting of the commission.
   B.   Notice: Notice shall be sent to the address of the subdivider by first
class mail stating the time and place of such meeting. Similar notice shall be
mailed to the owners of the land immediately adjoining the platted land as
their names and addresses appear on the tax records of the county. The names
and addresses shall be provided by the applicant with the certification that
they are correct to the best of the applicant's knowledge.
   C.   Conditional Approval: If the plat is approved conditionally or subject
to modifications, the nature of the required modifications shall be stated in
the records of the planning and zoning commission and a letter defining them

11-6-1: Permitted Deviations; Redesign Or Denial
11-6-2: Determination Of Mountainous Character
11-6-3: Special Problems
11-6-1: PERMITTED DEVIATIONS; REDESIGN OR DENIAL:
   A.   Permitted Deviations: If, in the opinion of the planning and zoning
commission, the topography of a proposed subdivision has sufficient slope to be
considered mountainous, minor deviations may be made from the standards of this
title, if, in the opinion of the planning and zoning commission, such
deviations will not materially affect the general health, safety or welfare of
future or adjacent residents.
   B.   Redesign Or Denial: If significant deviations are necessary to make the
project feasible, it may be determined that the topography simply is not
conducive to residential purposes. In this instance, the project may require
redesign or denial. (1987 Code § 16.24.010)
11-6-2: DETERMINATION OF MOUNTAINOUS CHARACTER:
For the purpose of determining if the area is considered mountainous, the
applicant should submit plans for a preliminary review by the planning and
zoning commission. General agreement as to basic design principles could occur
at that time. The planning and zoning commission, however, is under no
obligation to commit themselves until all of the submittal requirements of the
preliminary plat are filed. (1987 Code § 16.24.020)
11-6-3: SPECIAL PROBLEMS:
In addition to normal subdivision problems, the planning and zoning commission
will be concerned with geologic hazards, grades of proposed streets, method of
handling slash materials and other problems created by mountainous development.

CHAPTER 7
PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT
SECTION:
11-7-1: Purpose
11-7-2: Application And Procedure
11-7-1: PURPOSE:
The planned unit development concept is being used to encourage more creative
and flexible use of land and to provide greater flexibility in land
development. This type of development can occur by relaxing the minimum and
maximum requirements of zoning/subdivision regulations and by permitting the
combination of a variety of housing types with open space, recreation
facilities and community facilities with the ultimate result being better
living environments. (1987 Code § 16.28.010)
11-7-2: APPLICATION AND PROCEDURE:
If a planned unit development is proposed, variances to the requirements of
this title may be authorized. The procedures for application shall meet all of
the requirements of submittal, review and approval as defined in title 12 of
this code. Preliminary and final plats would be submitted at their appropriate
times with the PUD application items for concurrent review as required for
subdivision. (1987 Code § 16.28.020)

11-8-1: GENERALLY:
The general location and alignment of streets and lot size shall conform to the
comprehensive plan and zoning requirements for the Town. Efforts should be made
to encourage good design practices, incorporating new ideas, improving planning
techniques which vary from the typical grid street pattern now commonly found
in many older subdivisions. The topography and other natural features of the
site should be taken into consideration and plans developed in such a manner
that these natural features benefit the total development. This may be done by
a curvilinear pattern, open spaces for recreation or pedestrian movements, or
it may be accomplished by increasing cluster or townhouse developments which
permit greater use of open space and greater preservation of natural
topographic and environmental features. The design standards set out in this
chapter shall apply to all subdivisions. (1987 Code § 16.32.010)
11-8-2: PRESERVATION OF NATURAL FEATURES:
The design and development of subdivisions shall preserve, insofar as possible,

from opposite sides shall intersect at the extension of their centerline, or
their centerlines shall be offset at least one hundred fifty feet (150').
   M.   Sight Distance: To ensure adequate sight distances, when street roadway
lines deflect more than one degree (1°), connection shall be made by horizontal
curves.
   N.   Vertical Curves: Vertical curves shall be used at changes of grade
exceeding one percent (1%) and shall be designed to provide, at a minimum, a
sight distance of two hundred feet (200') for local streets and three hundred
feet (300') for all other streets (arterial and collector streets shall be
determined by the current specifications of the American Association of State
Highway Officials and as may be required by the Town Engineer).

(1,200') or be less than three hundred feet (300'). (1987 Code § 16.32.050)
11-8-6: LOTS:
   A.   Minimum Width: The minimum width of lots shall conform to the
applicable zoning standards.
      1.   On cul-de-sac streets or curved streets, the lot width required
shall, at a minimum, apply at the building setback line as defined by the zone
in which the property is located.
      2.   Through lots with frontage at opposite ends should be generally
avoided, except where it is essential to provide a separation of residential
development from major arterial highways.
   B.   Side Lot Lines: Side lot lines shall be at substantially right angles
or radial to street lines.
   C.   Street Frontage: All residential lots in a subdivision shall front on a
public street. (1987 Code § 16.32.060)

   A.   Generally: Uses permitted subject to conditional use permits are those
uses necessary for the development of the community, but which uses must be
located, planned and used in such manner as not to be detrimental to the
property abutting such uses and to the community as a whole. In considering a
conditional use permit, the planning and zoning commission shall determine
whether the use is suitable in the area and, if the grant is made, shall
require safeguards necessary to protect the health, safety, morals, order,
convenience and general welfare. In approving such uses, the planning and
zoning commission shall set forth the manner in which the use is to be
conducted, approve the design or plan of the structures, including their
locations and the yards around them, and consider the adequacy of facilities to
serve them. In granting a conditional use permit, the planning and zoning
commission may grant deviations or relief from the yard, fence, sign, height,
parking, loading and open space regulations of this title. (1987 Code §

conditions be attached to any recommended approval. The commission and council
shall consider the same criteria and make the findings required in the same
manner as those set forth in this chapter.
   C.   Term: In any case in which a conditional use permit has not been
exercised within one year from the date of issuance, such permit shall be void
and have no further force or effect. "Exercise" as used in this section, shall
mean that the holder of the permit has: 1) obtained all necessary building
permits; and 2) executed a binding contract for the construction of the
principal building or other improvement or, in the absence of contracts, that
the principal building or other improvement is under construction to a
substantial degree. When construction is not a part of the conditional use

conditions as designated in the permit. (Ord. 6-94, 10-24-1994)
