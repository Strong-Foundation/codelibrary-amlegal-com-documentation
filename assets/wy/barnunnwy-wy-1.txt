(Ord. 2022-10, 10-18-2022)
2-19-3: LEGAL ADVERTISEMENTS:
   The term "newspaper", in so far as it is used by the Statues of the State of
Wyoming, requiring publication by municipalities of certain notices and
information is undefined. This chapter, therefore, sets forth the meaning of
the terms "newspaper" and publish for the purpose of complying with Wyoming
State Statutes by the Town of Bar Nunn and the matters to be considered by the
town in regard to the same.
   A.   Whenever possible the, Town shall take into consideration the
circulation of the newspaper when placing notices, with such consideration to
consider ultimate circulation, timeliness, and the cost of placing the notice.
While cost or circulation need not alone dictate which newspaper is chosen, it
shall be a matter that shall be taken into consideration.
   B.   Whenever the term "newspaper" is used by a Wyoming State Statute which
requires a municipality to place a notice or publication in the same, the town
may:
      1.    Rely on the common understanding of the meaning of the term
"newspaper" as it existed at the time of the first Wyoming Statute to use the
same. If this is done, it will require not any further act by the Town Council
in order for that understanding to apply.
      2.   Adopt, by resolution, the 21st Century understanding of "newspaper"
for any particular purpose, which shall mean an electronic publication
satisfying the following criteria:
         a.    An electronic publication, to include a website which;
         b.   Is published or maintained on a daily basis, and which;
         c.   Is published for the purpose of distributing information and news
in a fashion similar to that of a print newspaper and which;
         d.   Includes Natrona County, Wyoming as part of its routine coverage.
   C.   Whenever the term "publish" is used by a Wyoming State Statute which
requires a municipality to publish a notice in a "newspaper", the following
shall be presumed to apply:
      1.   "Publish", in the case of a print newspaper, shall be presumed to
mean "printed and distributed", wherever the statute makes reference to a
locality, such as within a municipality or county, unless the town establishes
a good and sufficient basis for reading the same in another manner, and records
the same my way of a resolution.
      2.   "Publish", in the case of electronic media, shall be presumed to
mean electronically issued on a website which meets the definition of a
"newspaper" as set forth above, which can reasonably be determined to be
directed towards or read within a municipality or county.
   D.   In any instance in which the town determines to publish a notice in an
electronic newspaper, such as is described in Section 1-5-9 B.2. above, it
shall publish the same on its website and store a copy of the electronic notice
for a period of five (5) years, unless a statute, ordinance or resolution
requires a longer time period. Publication of an notice in an electronic
newspaper may include a active link to the town's publication on its website,
which shall suffice for publication as long as it was specifically done for the
purpose of giving notice.
   E.   Should the State of Wyoming amend, repeal or replace the current
publication statutes, on whole or in part, to allow for the placement of
notices through a centralized electronic system maintained or authorized by the
State of Wyoming, the City of Mills shall accordingly elect to use that system
in the fashion authorized by the State.

   B.   Suspicion Of Rabies, Quarantine:
      1.   Quarantine Order: A law enforcement officer, an animal control
officer, or a county health officer or his designee, may order a domesticated
animal quarantined if the officer has reason to believe the animal bit a
person, is infected with rabies or has been in contact with a rabid animal. If
a quarantine cannot be imposed because a domesticated animal cannot be
captured, the officer may kill the animal. The officer shall attempt to kill
the animal in a humane manner and in a manner which avoids damage to the
animal's head. After the animal is dead, the head is to be severed from the
body and sent to the state laboratory for examination.
      2.   Time Limit: An officer who orders a domesticated animal to be
quarantined shall deliver the animal, or shall order the animal delivered, to
an isolation facility as soon as possible, but no longer than twenty four (24)
hours after the original order is issued.

shall keep the quarantined domesticated animal in strict isolation under the

of a ten (10) day observation period.
      4.   Symptoms Evident; Notification: If the veterinarian determines that
a domesticated animal exhibits symptoms of rabies during the original or
extended observation period, the veterinarian shall notify the county health
department and the officer who ordered the animal quarantined, and the officer
or veterinarian shall humanely kill the animal. If the domesticated animal has
bitten a person, the county health department shall notify the person's
physician.
      5.   Costs Incurred; Responsibility: The owner of an animal is
responsible for any expenses incurred in connection with keeping the animal in
an isolation facility, supervision and examination of the animal by a

these expenses.

domesticated animal is "at large", as defined under the terms of this section,
the owner shall be strictly liable for and punished as provided in subsection
4-1-17C of this chapter.
   C.   Animal Wastes:

authorized animal to keep his property free and clear of animal waste so as not
to present a potential danger to the public health, as determined by the county

officer to kill any wild or domestic animal if such officer determines that
there is a reasonable danger to the public safety.
   B.   Remedies Authorized:
      1.   An animal control officer may lawfully intervene in any situation
where it appears an act of cruelty is being perpetrated upon any animal.
      2.   A law enforcement officer or an animal control officer may remove,
shelter and care for any animal found to be cruelly exposed to the weather,
starved or denied adequate water, neglected, abandoned or otherwise treated in
a cruel manner, and may deliver such animal to another person to be cared for
and given medical attention if necessary. In all cases, the owner, if known,
shall immediately be notified and the officer or person to whom the animal is
delivered for care and keeping shall have a lien upon the animal for its care,
keeping, medical attention and expense of notice. If the owner or custodian is

suffering from injury, it shall be lawful for such officer to destroy such
animal after consulting with a licensed veterinarian. If the animal is licensed
or tattooed or has a microchip implant, an attempt to notify its owner shall be
made before the animal is destroyed. The above mentioned officers or designees
may destroy an animal without consulting with a licensed veterinarian or an
owner if it is considered an emergency situation, to relieve the animal from
undue suffering. The owner thereof shall not recover damages for the
destruction of the animal unless he shall prove that destroying the animal was

4-3-2: PUBLIC NUISANCE DECLARED:
   A.   Nuisance Declared: The accumulation or storage of abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled, unlicensed or inoperative vehicles or junk on private or public
property is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private

fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the

within ten (10) days after the receipt of such notice without just cause, such
failure is declared to be unlawful and shall constitute a misdemeanor,
punishable by an assessment or fine of twenty five dollars ($25.00) for each
separate violation. Each day such nuisance persists shall constitute a separate
violation.
      2.   It is unlawful and shall constitute a misdemeanor for any person,
after having received notice as provided in this Chapter, to remove any vehicle
or junk from private property to any other private property upon which storage
is not permitted, or onto any public property for the purpose of storage.

period, the Town may either: 1) issue a citation for the nuisance for each day
the nuisance is not abated; or 2) may abate the nuisance and the cost of
abatement may be charged to the owner of the nuisance or assessed against the

if a public nuisance exists and as to the assessment of administrative costs
and the costs of abatement; that if a hearing is not so requested the right to
a hearing shall be waived;
         f.   A statement that failure to abate the nuisance may result in a
Town abatement and/or criminal charges. (Ord. 93-08, 10-19-1993; amd. 1999

delivered to the Town Clerk within ten (10) days from the date of the notice to
abate. Such request shall specify the property concerning which the request is
made, the requesting party's name and address, and nature of the interest held

   B.   Citation Or Abatement Authorized: In the event of a public nuisance as

unabated for more than ten (10) days, the Mayor or his representative is
granted the authority to: 1) issue a citation for the nuisance for each day the
nuisance is not abated; or 2) may abate the nuisance and the cost of abatement
may be charged to the owner of the nuisance or assessed against the land upon
which the nuisance exists, or both; provided however, that if a proper request
for hearing is filed, abatement shall only proceed upon resolution or order of
the Town Council or hearing examiner. Prosecution of a citation for the
nuisance however, may be enforced by the Town Attorney through the Municipal
Court at anytime.
   C.   Time Of Hearing: In the event a request for hearing is filed as
provided, a hearing shall be held before the Town Council or such other
individual or group as designated by the Town Council to act as hearing
examiner. The purpose of the hearing shall be to confirm or deny the existence
of a public nuisance and for taking such further action as is authorized under
this Chapter. Notice of the time, place and hour of the hearing shall be sent
at least ten (10) days in advance of the hearing of all known parties.
   D.   Parties To Be Heard: At such hearing, all parties shall be afforded an

examiner, as the case may be, may resolve or order that the Mayor and/or his
employees or agents, remove or otherwise abate the nuisance; provided however,
that if the circumstances justify, in the opinion of the entity or person
presiding at the hearing, the time for abatement may be delayed. In the event a
nuisance is confirmed, administrative and removal costs may also be assessed at
the hearing. If it is found that a public nuisance does not exist, abatement
authority shall be denied and costs shall not be assessed.
   F.   Appeals: Appeals from adverse decisions rendered by the Town Council
pursuant to subsection D of this Section, may be made to the District Court in
the same manner as an appeal from an adverse decision rendered by an agency in
a contested case under the provision of Wyoming Statutes section 16-3-114. A
hearing examiner, as provided in subsection C of this Section, is an agency
within the meaning of the Wyoming Administrative Procedures Act 1  and adverse
decisions may be appealed in the manner provided therein.
   G.   Waive Hearing: In the event a request for hearing, as provided, is not
filed, the right to a hearing shall be considered to have been waived. (Ord.

   F.   Notification of Liquor Violation.
      1.   Municipal Court. Not later than thirty (30) days following
disposition of a charge which results in a conviction to a liquor licensee,
agent, or employee for a liquor violation in municipal court, the court shall
report the following information to the Town clerk:
         a.   The fact that a licensee, permittee, or employees and/or agents
of a licensee or permittee have been convicted of a violation of the Town code;
and
         b.   The date of the alleged violation; and
         c.   Whether the municipal court disposition has been appealed. For
purposes of this section, a conviction includes a finding of guilt after trial,
a plea of guilty, or a plea of nolo contendere.
      2.   Notice of Violation to Liquor Licensee. Upon notice to the Town
clerk of a proof of violation of any one or more violation(s) as outlined in
subsection E, the Town clerk shall notify the liquor licensee of the violation
(s) via regular mail to the address of the licensee listed on the licensee's
most recent liquor license application to the Town. The notice shall include
the description of the violation and provide for a reasonable timeframe to
mitigate the violation. If the licensee fails to correct the violation within a
reasonable timeframe, the clerk shall submit the violation to the governing
body and the governing body may hold a hearing as outlined in subsection (F)
(3).
      3.   Notice of Hearing before Governing Body. If the governing body
chooses to hold a hearing regarding violation(s), all evidence will be admitted
and considered prima facie evidence of the liquor licensee's violation(s). The
purpose of the hearing is to allow the liquor licensee the opportunity to offer
corrections to the information and action taken by liquor licensee to mitigate
the violation(s), and for the governing body to determine whether the liquor
licensee should face restrictions or suspension of the liquor license. Notice
of such violation shall be served by regular mail to the address of the
licensee listed on the licensee's most recent liquor license application to the
Town, and shall include a statement:
         a.   That the Town received proof of violation(s), and that a fine,
suspension and/or revocation of the licensee's license is possible; and
         b.   Summarizing the nature and date(s) of the incidents resulting in
the violation(s).
      4.   Hearing Before Governing Body. The hearing before the governing body
shall be conducted under the Wyoming Administrative Procedures Act (Wyoming
Statutes Section 16-3-101 et seq.) and rules as adopted from time to time by
the governing body.
      5.   Penalties. Following the hearing described in this section, and
based upon the information considered and received at such hearing, the
governing body may:
         a.   Issue a written warning and/or require a mitigation plan of the
violation by licensee; or
         b.   Order a fine and/or suspension of license: The suspension of the
liquor license shall remain in effect until the governing body lifts the
suspension, a court competent jurisdiction lifts the suspension, or the Town
clerk receives notice from the State of Wyoming that the sales tax liability
has been satisfied. Penalties provided in this section are based on the
violations of ordinances outlined in subsection E herein against a liquor
licensee within a three-year period beginning each year on the first day of
April through the last day of March of the following year. Any convictions of
liquor law violations during this period of time involving the same licensed
liquor building and/or premises may be used by the governing body to determine
a gross violation and suspension or recommend revocation of a licensee's
license. The maximum fine is seven hundred fifty dollars ($750.00) per
occurrence.
      6.   Revocation. If it appears to the governing body that a liquor
license should be revoked, the governing body may authorize the Town attorney
to prepare and file with the district court a petition to revoke the licensee's
license. If a license is revoked, except as provided in Wyoming Statutes
Section 12-7-201(d) concerning the expiration of a license while a revocation
order is under appeal, the liquor licensee of such revoked license shall not be
eligible to apply for a new liquor license for a period of twelve (12) months
from the date of revocation. In the event a suspension occurs, the clerk shall
send by certified mail one copy of the suspension notice to the last known
address of the liquor licensee and to the director of the state department of
revenue. Additionally, the clerk shall post one copy of the suspension notice
on the liquor license or permitted building or premises. Immediately upon the
posting of the suspension notice, the sale, offering to sell, distribution, or
trafficking of liquor or malt beverages in unlawful. Further, the licensee
shall either remove all of the alcoholic liquor and malt beverages from the
licensed building and/or premises.
      7.   Appeal. Action by the governing body suspending a liquor license of
a licensee shall be subject to review in the district court upon exhaustion of
administrative appeals in accordance with the procedural rules heretofore or
hereinafter adopted by the Wyoming Supreme Court concerning the review of
administrative actions. Filing an appeal as provided in such rules, stays
enforcement of the suspension decision pending final order of the appeal.

6-1-5: New Sewers And Connections Design And Construction
6-1-6: Sewer Service Charges
6-1-7: Delinquent Accounts
6-1-1: APPORTION COSTS:
   A.   Determine Annual Cost Of Operation And Maintenance: The city/Town shall
determine the total annual costs of operation and maintenance of the wastewater
systems which are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance, during
the service life of the treatment works, for which such works were designed and
constructed. The total annual cost of operation and maintenance shall include,
but need not be limited to, labor, repairs, equipment replacement, maintenance,
necessary modifications, power, sampling, laboratory tests and a reasonable
contingency fund.
   B.   Wastewater User's Contribution Percentage: The city/Town shall
determine for each user or user class, the average daily volume of wastewater
discharged to the wastewater system, which shall then be divided by the average
daily volume of all wastewater discharged to the wastewater system to determine
such user's volume contribution percentage. The amount used as the total
average daily volume of wastewater shall exclude infiltration and inflow.
The city/Town shall determine for each user or user class, the average daily
total suspended solids (TSS) poundage discharged to the wastewater system,
which shall then be divided by the average daily poundage of all TSS discharged
to the wastewater system to determine such user's TSS contribution percentage.
The volume contribution percentage, BOD contribution percentage, and TSS
contribution percentage for each user class shall be multiplied by the annual
operation and maintenance costs for wastewater treatment of the total volume
flow, total five (5) day twenty degree centigrade (20°C) BOD and total TSS,
respectively.
   C.   Surcharge System For Users With Excess BOD And TSS: The city/Town will
assess a surcharge rate for all nonresidential users discharging wastes with
BOD and TSS strengths greater than the average residential user. Such users
will be assessed a surcharge sufficient to cover the cost of treating their
above- normal strength wastes. Normal strength wastes are considered to be two
hundred (200) ppm BOD and two hundred fifty (250) ppm TSS. The surcharge rate
structure for such above-normal strength waste discharge as follows:
   EXCESSIVE SEWAGE STRENGTH
   SURCHARGE FORMULA*
   Where:
S    = Vs x 8.34 (($0.0824) (BOD-200) + ($0.0616) (SS-250))
S    = Surcharge in dollars
Vs   = Sewage volume in million gallons
8.34 = Pounds per gallon of water
BOD  = BOD strength index in parts per million by weight
200  = Allowed BOD strength in parts per million by weight
SS   = Suspended solids strength index in parts per million by weight
250  = Allowed SS strength in parts per million by weight
 
   * Subject to annual review and revision.
(Ord. 99-03, 11-16-1999)
   D.   User's Wastewater Service Charge: Each nonresidential user's wastewater
treatment cost contributions as determined in Sections
6-1-2 and
6-1-3 of this Chapter shall be added together to determine each user's annual
wastewater service charge. Residential users may be considered to be one class
of user and equitable service charge may be determined for each user based on
an estimate of the total wastewater contribution of this class of user. The
governing body may classify industrial, commercial and other nonresidential
establishments as a residential user; provided, that the wastes from these
establishments are equivalent to the wastes from the average residential user
with respect to volume, total suspended solids, and BOD. Each user's wastewater
treatment cost contribution will be assessed in accordance with the following
rate schedule:

6-1-2: WASTEWATER FACILITIES REPLACEMENT FUND:
A reserve fund called the Wastewater Facilities Replacement Fund is hereby
established within the funds of the Town for the purpose of providing
sufficient monies to be expended for obtaining and installing equipment,
accessories and appurtenances during the useful life of the wastewater
facilities necessary to maintain the capacity and performance for which such
facilities are designed and constructed.
The reserve fund shall be an interest-bearing fund and shall be funded by an
annual deposit obtained from the Town's sewer account. (Ord. 89-05, 6-6-1989)
6-1-3: REVIEW OF USER'S WASTEWATER SERVICE CHARGE:
The Town shall review the total annual cost of operation and maintenance as
well as each user's wastewater contribution percentage not less often than
every two (2) years and will revise the system as necessary to assure equity of
the service charge system established herein and to assure that sufficient
funds are obtained to adequately operate and maintain the wastewater treatment
works. The Town shall apply excess revenues collected from a class of users to
the costs of operation and maintenance attributable to that class for the next
year and adjust the rate accordingly. If a significant user, such as an
industry, has completed in-plant modifications which would change that user's
wastewater contribution percentage, the user can present, at a regularly
scheduled meeting of the governing body, such factual information and the Town
shall then determine if the user's wastewater contribution percentage is to be
changed. The Town shall notify the user of its finding as soon as possible.
Each user will be notified, at least annually, in conjunction with a regular
bill, of the rate and that portion of the user charges which are attributable
to wastewater treatment services. (Ord. 89-05, 6-6-1989)
6-1-4: PAYMENT OF SERVICE CHARGE, PENALTIES:
The Town shall submit an annual statement to the user for the user's annual
wastewater service charge or one-twelfth (1/12) of the user's annual wastewater
service charge may be included with the monthly wastewater utility billing. The
Town shall add a penalty of one and three-quarters percent (13/4%) per month if
the payment is not received by the City within fifteen (15) days. Should any
user fail to pay the user wastewater service charge and penalty within three
(3) months of the due date, the Town may stop the wastewater service to the
property. (Ord. 89-05, 6-6-1989)
6-1-5: NEW SEWERS AND CONNECTIONS DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION:
The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of all sanitary sewers
and sewer conjunctions, and the methods to be used in excavating, placing of
the pipe, jointing, testing and backfilling the trench, shall all conform to
the requirements of the Building and Plumbing Codes or other applicable rules
and regulations of the Town 1  and the State. In the absence of code provisions
or in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures set forth in
appropriate specifications of the ASTM and WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9 shall
apply. (Ord. 89-05, 6-6-1989)

owner may then extend the line to provide service in accordance with the
provisions hereof. The costs associated with the immediately preceding
exceptions, items a), b) and c) of this subsection, shall be originally borne
by the lot owner as part of the sewer main extension; but will be reimbursed to
the lot owner, after review by the Town Council, on the basis of the linear
cost per foot paid by the owner(s) for the stated section, or upon such basis
agreed to by the parties, should the Town Council find the linear cost per foot
above or below the then prevailing market price for similar services and
materials.
The costs associated with the sewer main extension to be borne by the lot owner
shall include, but shall not be limited to, the charges for labor and material
consumed during construction; the charges for inspecting and approving the
extension; charges for permitting, licensing, or acquisition of other
governmental approval; and the charges for acquisition of a sewer tap from the

($2,500.00), plus three percent (3%) per year from the base year, 2000. All
costs associated with the installation of the manholes, as designed, shall be
borne, proportionately, by the landowners acquiring new sewer service from the
extension. Such costs shall be paid to the contractor installing the manholes
by the affected lot owner(s).
Upon extension of any sewer main, the owner of the furthest upstream lot, upon
conclusion of the extension, shall be assessed an amount equal to two thousand
seven hundred fifty dollars ($2,750.00), together with his/her portion of the
manhole costs and engineering design fees occurring as the result of the
extension. The stated two thousand seven hundred fifty dollar ($2,750.00)
assessment fee shall be retained by the Town to reimburse and defray
inspection, construction and engineering fees occurring during the course of
the extension. In the event a lot owner shall fail to pay the assessment fees,
the Town shall be entitled to collect the assessments as provided by Wyoming
State law.
In the event any extension of a sewer main does not require the concurrent
installation of a manhole under the terms of the applicable design scheme, each
lot owner to be served from the contemplated extension, shall install and pay
the costs associated with installation of a sewer clean out trap. The clean out
shall be installed under the direction and oversight of the Town's Engineer.

plastics, tar, asphalt residues, residues from refining, or processing of fuel
or lubricating oil, mud, or glass grinding or polishing wastes.
      3.   Petroleum based oil in sufficient enough amounts that cause pass-
through or interference to the system, and in no cases, exceeding one hundred
milligrams per liter (100 mg/l).
      4.   Any wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or greater than 9.00,
unless the POTW is specifically designed to accommodate such wastewater, or
wastewater having any other corrosive property capable of causing damage or
hazard to structures, equipment, and/or personnel of the POTW.
      5.   Any wastewater containing toxic pollutants in sufficient quantity,
either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, to injure or interfere
with any wastewater treatment process, constitute a hazard to humans or
animals, result in toxic gases, vapors or fumes within the POTW in a quantity
that may cause acute worker health and safety problems, create a toxic effect
in the receiving waters of the POTW or to exceed the limitation set forth in a
categorical standard. A toxic pollutant shall include, but not be limited to,
any pollutant identified pursuant to section 307(a) of the Act.
      6.   Any noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, or solids which either
singly or by interaction with other wastes are sufficient to create a public
nuisance or hazard to life or are sufficient to prevent entry into the public
sewers for maintenance and repair.
      7.   Any substance which may cause the POTW's effluent or any other
product of the POTW such as residues, sludges, or scums, to be unsuitable for
reclamation and reuse or to interfere with the reclamation process. In no case,
shall a substance discharged to the POTW cause the POTW to be in noncompliance
with sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations developed under
section 405 of the Act; any criteria, guidelines, or regulations affecting
sludge use or disposal developed pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act, the
Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or State criteria applicable
to the sludge management method being used.
      8.   Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its NPDES and/or
State disposal system permit or the receiving water quality standards.
      9.   Any wastewater with objectionable color which cannot be removed in
the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable
tanning solutions.
      10.   Any wastewater having a temperature which will inhibit biological
activity in the POTW treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater with a temperature above sixty five degrees Celsius (65°C) (150°F)
or a temperature that causes the POTW influent to exceed forty degrees Celsius
(40°C) (104°F), unless the POTW treatment plant is designed to accommodate such
temperature.
      11.   Any pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.)
released at a flow rate and/or pollutant concentration which a user knows or
has reason to know will cause interference to the POTW. In no case shall a slug
load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or quantities of pollutants
that exceed limits set by the city.
      12.   Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes of
such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits established by the city in
compliance with applicable State or Federal regulations.
      13.   Any wastewater which causes a hazard to human life or creates a
public nuisance.
When the city/Town determines that a user is contributing to the POTW, any of
the above enumerated substances in such amounts as to interfere with the
operation of the POTW, the city/Town shall: a) advise the user of the impact of
the contribution on the POTW; and b) develop effluent limitations for such user
to correct the interference with the POTW provided, however, nothing contained
herein shall be interpreted to prohibit the city/Town from taking immediate
enforcement action against a user who is contributing in violation of this
Chapter.
      14.   Any discharge of trucked or hauled nonhazardous liquid wastes is
prohibited except at discharge points designated by the POTW. Designation
points shall be pursuant to rules and regulations of the city.
      15.   Any wastewater that causes the influent to the POTW to exceed the
maximum allowable industrial loadings specified in the specific pollutants
limitation-local limits subsection 6-3-4C of this Section.
   C.   Specific Pollutant Limitations Designated - Local Limits:
      1.   Maximum total allowable industrial loading that can be accepted at
the POTW for treatment in accordance with guidance established by Federal law
will be adopted by each town by resolution to reference the values established
by the city of Casper.
      2.   Any other specific pollutants identified by the city may also have
specific effluent permit limitations set to restrict their discharge into the
system.
      3.   The above maximum allowable industrial loadings in pounds per day
will be distributed using criteria established in Casper's report on the
development of local limits under the Pretreatment Program, June 1994, and EPA
Guidance Manual on the Development and Implementation of Local Discharge
Limitations Under the Pretreatment Program, December 1987 (as they now exist or
as they are hereafter revised).
      4.   Best Available Technology (BAT) shall be used for pretreatment of
any discharges to the POTW from the clean-up activities, of soil, aquifer, or
ground water table associated with leading underground storage tanks of spills
of any petroleum products. The BAT shall be capable of reducing the benzene
concentration to less than 0.05 mg/l and the "total" benzene, ethyl benzene,
toluene and xylene (BETX) to less than 0.750 mg/l. This is in accordance with
guidance established in EPA's Model NPDES Permit for Discharges resulting from
the Cleanup of Gasoline Released from Underground Storage Tanks, June 1989.
   D.   State Requirements To Apply: State requirements and limitations on
discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than Federal
requirements and limitations or those in this Chapter.
   E.   Excessive Discharges: No user shall increase the use of process water
or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete
substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the categorical standard, or in any other pollutant-specific
limitation developed for the industrial user.
   F.   Tenant Responsibility: Where an owner of property leases premises to
any other person as a tenant under any rental or lease agreement, if either the
owner or the tenant is an industrial user, either or both may be held
responsible for compliance with the provisions of this Chapter.
   G.   Accidental Discharges: Each significant industrial user shall provide
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other
substances regulated by this Chapter. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the
owner's or user's own cost and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the Town
for review, and shall be approved by the Town before construction of the
facility. No significant industrial user who commences contribution to the POTW
after the effective date hereof shall be permitted to introduce pollutants into
the system until accidental discharge procedures have been approved by the
Town. Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall not
relieve the significant industrial user's facility as necessary to meet the
requirements of this Chapter. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the
responsibility of the significant industrial user to immediately telephone and
notify the POTW of the incident. The notification shall include location of
discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions.
   H.   Notices:
      1.   Written Notice: Within five (5) days following an accidental
discharge, the significant industrial user shall submit to the Town Engineer
and city a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and
the measures to be taken by the significant industrial user to prevent similar
future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the significant
industrial user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be
incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to
persons or property; nor shall such notification relieve the significant
industrial user of any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be
imposed by this Chapter or other applicable law.
      2.   Notice To Employees: A notice shall be permanently posted on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advertising employees whom to
call in the event of an accidental discharge. Employers shall ensure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such an accidental discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.
   I.   Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards: Upon the promulgation of
the categorical standard for a particular industrial subcategory, the standard,
if more stringent than limitations imposed under this Chapter for sources in
that subcategory, shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under
this Chapter. The City shall notify all affected users of the applicable
reporting requirements under 40 CFR, section 403.12, as enacted or hereafter
amended. (Ord. 99-03, 11-16-1999)
6-3-5: FEES:

user believes that some of the permit requirements no longer apply.
      7.   On a yearly basis, the city shall review and update their list of
significant industrial users, and shall notify or remind them of their status
and requirements. This list shall identify the criteria used to determine their
status and wastewater contribution permit requirements and shall also indicate
whether the city has made a determination that any such industrial users should
not be considered a significant industrial user. This list, and any subsequent
modifications thereto, shall be submitted to the approval authority as a
nonsubstantial program modification. Discretionary designations or
dedesignations by the city shall be deemed to be approved by the approval
authority ninety (90) days after submission of the list of modifications
thereto, unless the approval authority determines that a modification is in
fact a substantial modification as described in 40 CFR 403.18.
   B.   Application; Contents; Issuance Procedure:
      1.   At least ninety (90) days prior to commencement of discharge, new
sources and sources that become IUs subsequent to the promulgation of an

sample shall be representative of daily operations and at a minimum shall
include the following:
            (1)   A minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used for pH,
cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, hexavalent chromium and
volatile organics. For all other pollutants, twenty four (24) hour composite
samples must be obtained through flow- proportional composite sampling
techniques where feasible. The POTW may waive flow-proportional composite
sampling for any industrial user that demonstrates that flow-proportional
sampling is infeasible. In such cases, samples may be obtained through time-
proportional composite sampling techniques or through a minimum of four (4)
grab samples, over the normal workday operation, where the user demonstrates
that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being
discharged;
            (2)   The user shall take a minimum of one representative sample to
compile that data necessary to comply with the requirements of this subsection;
            (3)   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other wastewaters are mixed
with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment, the user should measure
the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of the combined waste
stream formula of 40 CFR section 403.6(e); in order to evaluate compliance with
the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass limit has

         b.   State pretreatment requirements; or
         c.   Local limitations calculated by mass balance or other valid
scientific methods necessary to protect the POTW from materials described in
the sewer discharge regulations subsection C. The basis for effluent
limitations will be reviewed as part of the NPDES permit application (every 5
years).
   B.   Compliance; Initial Report:
      1.   Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical standards or, in the case of a new source, following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject
to categorical standards and requirements shall submit to the city a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge from
the regulated process which are limited by categorical standards and
requirements and the average and maximum daily flow for these process units in
the user facility which are limited by such categorical standards or
requirements. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical
standards or requirements are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or pretreatment is necessary to
bring the user into compliance with the applicable categorical standards and
requirements. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of
the industrial user and certified to by a professional engineer.
      2.   Industrial users shall immediately notify the city and as soon as
possible thereafter the EPA regional waste management division manager, and
State hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of
a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under
40 CFR, part 261, as enacted or hereafter amended, or any applicable Federal
regulations. The notification requirement in this subsection does not apply to
pollutants already reported under the self- monitoring requirements of the
industrial users contribution permit.
   C.   Compliance; Periodic Report:
      1.   Any user subject to a categorical standard, after the compliance
date of such pretreatment standard or, in the case of a new source, after
commencement of the discharge into the POTW, shall submit to the city during
the months of June and December, unless required more frequently in the
pretreatment standard or by the city, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the effluent which are limited by such
pretreatment standards or permits. In addition, this report shall include a
record of all daily flows which during the reporting period exceeded the
average daily flow allowed in the wastewater contribution permit. At the
discretion of the city and in consideration of such factors as high or low flow
rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city may agree to alter the months
during which the above reports are to be submitted.
      2.   The city may impose mass limitations on users which are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other
cases where the imposition of mass limitations are appropriate. In such cases,
the report required by subsection C1 of this Section shall indicate the mass of
pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the user.
These reports shall contain the results of sampling and analysis of the
discharge, including the flow and the nature and concentration, or production
and mass where requested by the city, of pollutants contained therein which are
limited by the applicable pretreatment standards. All analysis shall be
performed in accordance with procedures established by the approval authority
pursuant to section 304(h) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, part 136, and
amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the approval
authority. Sampling shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
approved by the approval authority. Where 40 CFR, part 136, does not include a
sampling or analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and
analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the
EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April 1977, and amendments thereto, or with
any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the approval
authority.
   D.   Notice Of Change In Discharge: All permitted industrial users shall
notify the POTW in writing within forty five (45) days of when their discharge
changes significantly. A significant change shall include changes to the
pollutant concentration levels, discharges of previously unreported pollutants,
or flow increases of ten percent (10%) or greater.
   E.   Reports From Noncategorical Industrial Users: All industrial users not
subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall provide appropriate reports
to the POTW as the city may require.
   F.   Automatic Resampling: If the results of the industrial user's
wastewater analysis indicate a violation has occurred, the user must notify the
POTW within twenty four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation and
repeat the sampling and pollutant analysis and submit, in writing, the results
of this repeat analysis within thirty (30) days after becoming aware of the
violation.
   G.   Timing: Written reports required by the industrial user's wastewater
contribution permit will be deemed to have been submitted to the POTW on the
date postmarked if mailed via U.S. mail, postage prepaid. If not mailed as set
forth, then the date of receipt of the report at the POTW shall govern.
   H.   Accidental Spill Or Slug Control Plans:
      1.   Industrial users that store hazardous substances shall not
contribute to the POTW after the effective date hereof unless a spill
prevention plan has been approved by the city. Approval of such plans shall not
relieve the industrial user from complying with all other laws and regulations
governing the use, storage, and transportation of hazardous substances.
      2.   At least once every two (2) years, the city must evaluate whether
each significant industrial user needs a slug control plan to control slug
discharges as defined in the definitions and abbreviations section of this
Chapter. The plan shall contain at least the following elements:
         a.   Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch
discharge;
         b.   Description of stored chemicals;
         c.   Procedures for promptly notifying the POTW of slug discharges,
including any discharge that would violate a specific prohibition of this
Section with procedures for follow-up written notification within five (5)
days;

accidental spills, including inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control
of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or
equipment, measures for containing toxic organic pollutants (including
solvents), and/or measures and equipment for emergency response; and
         e.   If necessary, follow-up practices to limit the damage suffered by
the treatment plant or the environment. (Ord. 99-03, 11-16-1999)
6-3-8: COMPLIANCE MONITORING:
   A.   The city requires that monitoring facilities be provided and operated
at the user's expense, to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of
the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility
shall normally be situated on the user's premises, but the Town, after
consultation with the city, may, when such a location would be impractical or
cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will be accessible by the
city/Town.
   B.   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in
a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.
   C.   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with all applicable local
construction standards and specifications. Construction shall be completed
within ninety (90) days following written notification by the Town. (Ord. 99-
03, 11-16-1999)

ascertain whether the purpose of this Chapter is being met and all requirements
are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is
created or discharged shall allow the city/Town or its representatives, upon
showing proper identification, ready access at all reasonable times to all
parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records
examination and copying, or in the performance of any of their duties. The
city, superintendent and/or EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's
property such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling inspection,
compliance monitoring, and/or metering operations. Where a user has security
measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance
before entry into their premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements
with their security guards so that upon presentation of suitable
identification, personnel from the city/Town and/or EPA will be permitted to
enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific
responsibilities.
   B.   Sample Collection:
      1.   Except as indicated in subsection B2 of this Section, the industrial
user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite
collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is unfeasible,
the city may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or through a
minimum of four (4) grab samples during the operating period of the facility
where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of
the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to
show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
      2.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, chromium VI, cyanide,
phenols, toxicity, sulfides, and volatile organic chemicals must be obtained
using grab collection techniques or as amended hereafter by EPA.
   C.   Determination Of Noncompliance: The city may use a grab sample(s) to
determine noncompliance with pretreatment standards or wastewater contribution
permit effluent limitations. (Ord. 99-03, 11-16-1999)
6-3-10: PRETREATMENT CONDITIONS:
   A.   Users shall provide and maintain in a safe and proper manner, at their
own expense, necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this
Chapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical standards and
additional standards required by this Chapter within the time limitations as
specified by the Federal pretreatment regulations. Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to an acceptable level shall be provided, operated, and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing the pretreatment
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the city for review,
and shall be acceptable to the city before construction of the facility. The
review of such plans and operating procedures will in no way relieve the user
from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary to produce an
effluent acceptable under the provisions of this Chapter. Any subsequent
changes in the pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported
to and be acceptable to the city/Town prior to the user's initiation of the
changes.
   B.   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be
made available to officials of the EPA, State, or city/Town upon request. These
records shall remain available for a period of at least five (5) years after
their collection. This period shall be extended during any litigation
concerning compliance with this Chapter or permit conditions. (Ord. 99-03, 11-
16-1999)
6-3-11: CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION:
   A.   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires,
permit applications, permits and monitoring programs, and from inspections,
shall be available to the public or other governmental agency without
restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to
the satisfaction of the city/Town that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection
as trade secrets of the user.
   B.   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available to any person unless required under applicable State law. Wastewater
constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential
information.
   C.   Information accepted by the city/Town as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the Town,
except as provided by Wyoming law. (Ord. 99-03, 11-16-1999)

Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided or modified when, in the
opinion of the city/Town, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid
wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable
wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients, except that such interceptors shall
not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. Modifications to
existing interceptors may be required when violations of this Section exist.
All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city/Town, and
shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and
inspection. In the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner shall be
responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the
captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal
which are subject to review by the city/Town. Any removal and hauling of the
collected materials not performed by owner's personnel must be performed by
currently licensed waste disposal firms. (Ord. 99-03, 11-16-1999)
6-3-13: VIOLATIONS:
   A.   Tampering With Wastewater Facilities: No person shall maliciously,

any structure, appurtenance or equipment which is a part of the wastewater
facilities. Any person violating this provision shall be subject to punishment
pursuant to Section
1-4-1 of this Code.
   B.   Harmful Contributions: The city/Town may suspend the wastewater
treatment service and/or wastewater contribution permit when such suspension is
necessary, in the opinion of the city, in order to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment
to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, cause interference to
the POTW or causes the violation of any condition of its NPDES permit. Notice
of the action taken in accordance with this subsection shall be sent to the
user, (as described in definitions), by letter sent certified mail, return
receipt requested, or, at the election of the city/Town, by facsimile
transmission, to the address at which the billing for the service is sent. The
city/Town shall receive a copy of the notice of the action taken if the user is
within their boundary.
   C.   Suspension Order: Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater
treatment service and/or the wastewater contribution permit shall immediately
stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of the person to
comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the Town or city shall take such
steps as deemed necessary including immediate severance of the water and/or
sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW system or
endangerment to any individuals. The city/Town shall reinstate the wastewater
contribution permit and/or the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the
elimination of the noncomplying discharge. A detailed written statement
submitted by the user describing the cause of the harmful contribution and the
measures taken to prevent any future harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence shall be submitted to the city/Town
within fifteen (15) days of the date of occurrence. Said written statement
shall be in form and content acceptable to the city/Town. Failure to comply

   F.   Variance Criteria: Variances may be granted by the town in order to
vary from the strict application of any of the requirements of this title in
the case of a physical condition applying to a lot or building if the strict
application would deprive the owner of the reasonable use of the land or
building involved. No adjustment in the strict application of any provision of
an ordinance may be granted unless:
      1.   There are special circumstances or conditions, fully described in
the town's findings, which are peculiar to the land or building for which the
adjustment is sought and do not apply generally to land or buildings in the
neighborhood, and have not resulted from any act of the applicant subsequent to
the adoption of this title;
      2.   The circumstances or conditions are such that the strict application
of the provisions of this title would deprive the applicant of the reasonable
use of the land or building, the granting of the adjustment is necessary for
the reasonable use thereof and the adjustment as granted is the minimum
adjustment that will accomplish this purpose; and

purposes and intent of this title and will not be injurious to the neighborhood
or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare.

and conclusions of law. No variances to the ordinance shall be recommended by
the commission unless it finds that:
      1.   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances and conditions,
which are peculiar to the land or building, and which do not generally apply to
land or buildings in the neighborhood, and literal application of this title to
the applicant's property will result in unnecessary hardship.
      2.   The hardship is due to unique circumstances and that the
difficulties facing the applicant are different from those of neighboring
properties.
      3.   The variance will not authorize a use other than those uses
specifically listed as permitted or conditional uses in the zoning district in
which the variance is sought.
      4.   The variance will not result in a gain in use, service, or income
for the applicant to a greater extent than available to other landowners in the
vicinity.
      5.   Granting the variance will not merely serve as a convenience for the
applicant but is necessary to alleviate a proven hardship related to the
property.
   G.   Action Time Line: Unless otherwise stated in the minutes of zoning and
planning, all variances shall be valid for and must be acted upon within six
(6) months.

clustered along a particular frontage or boundary. The trees shall be selected
from the list of tree types available at the town hall that are commonly known
to grow in the area.
         f.   The required landscaped setback trees may be located in
landscaped setback with a depth greater than the minimum required depth;
however, in any case the required trees shall be located within fifty feet
(50') of the street side property lines. The required boundary trees shall be
located within fifty feet (50') of the nonstreet (interior) boundary of the
zone districts.
         g.   The required landscaped setback trees shall be located in the
adjacent public right of way area if: 1) the town engineer's standards for
street trees are met in the case of a town street; 2) the district engineer
approves the trees in the case of a state highway; and 3) no conflicts exist
within utility easements.
         h.   The required landscaped setback trees may be permitted to be
located in the adjacent public right of way area if these trees cannot be
placed in the landscaped setback area due to the existing development of the
site. However, such trees are required only to the extent that: 1) the town
engineer's standards for street trees are met in the case of a town street; 2)
the district engineer approves the trees in the case of a state highway; and 3)
no conflicts exist within utility easements.
         i.   The landscaped setback requirements in this section are
superseded, where applicable, by the front yard parking regulations in
subsection F of this section. The parking requirements may cause a greater
landscaped setback than required by this section.
      3.   Required Buffers:
         a.   Buffer between nonresidential and residential districts separated
by nonarterial street:
            (1)   Where Required: Such a buffer is required along the street
side property line in any nonresidential project in any zone district where
such a project is separated from a residential district by a nonarterial
street. Nonarterial streets are those not designated as arterial streets on the
town's major thoroughfare plan. Public alleys are also considered nonarterial
streets for the purposes of this subsection.
            (2)   Design Standards: Such a buffer shall be a minimum of fifteen
feet (15') in depth. The minimum number of trees in such a buffer shall be one
tree for every fifteen feet (15') of the frontage length of the buffer. A
minimum of one-third (1/3) of the trees shall be evergreen trees. These
requirements may effectively increase the depth and number of the trees of the
minimum required landscaped setback in subsections E1 and E2 of this section.
An opaque structure with a minimum height of six feet (6') is required along
the inside edge (private property side) of the buffer. This buffer area shall
require a ground covering with a minimum of seventy five percent (75%) in
living plant materials.
         b.   Buffer between adjacent nonresidential and residential projects
and adjacent multi-family residential and single- family/two-family residential
projects:
            (1)   Where Required: Such a buffer is required in the following
situations:
   (A) Along the common property line in any nonresidential project in any zone
district where such a project is adjacent to any residential zone district.
   (B) Along the property line in any multi-family project (a project with 3 or
more dwelling units in 1 building) in any zone where such a project is adjacent
to a one-family or two-family zone district.
            (2)   Design Standards: Such a buffer shall be a minimum of fifteen
feet (15') in depth. The minimum number of trees in such a buffer shall be one
tree for every fifteen feet (15') of length of the buffer. A minimum of one-
third (1/3) of the trees shall be evergreen trees. An opaque structure with a
minimum height of six feet (6') is required along the common property line.
This type of buffer is not required to consist of a minimum percentage in
ground covering by living materials. However, that portion of the buffer area
in a ground covering by nonliving materials shall be covered with bark, wood
chips, rock, stone, or other materials.
      4.   Required Internal Landscaping:
         a.   Purpose: Internal landscaping requirements are intended to
augment the boundary landscaping requirements (such as landscaped setbacks and
buffers) and parking lot landscaping requirements. The purpose of internal
landscaping is to visually soften the mass of buildings and to visually
separate building areas from parking areas. The town recognizes that
flexibility in the design of spaces and tree selection is needed. This
flexibility is needed because of: 1) the diversity of building designs; 2) the
possible limitations on plant selections due to building foundation problems
posed by the root growth of some trees; and 3) building foundation problem
posed by the irrigation of expansive soils.
         b.   Requirements For Multi-Family Projects (A Project With 3 Or More
Dwelling Units In 1 Building) In Any Zone District:
            (1)   Minimum internal landscaping area, a minimum of fifteen
percent (15%) of the site's net area (site's area excluding adjacent public
streets).
            (2)   Minimum number of trees in the internal landscaping area, a
minimum of one tree for every five hundred (500) square feet of the required
minimum internal landscaping area.
         c.   Requirements For Nonresidential Projects In Any Zone District:
            (1)   Minimum internal landscaping area, a minimum of five percent
(5%) of the site's net area (site's area excluding adjacent public streets).
            (2)   Minimum number of trees in the internal landscaping area, a
minimum of one tree for every five hundred (500) square feet of the required
minimum internal landscaping area.
            (3)   Up to one-half (1/2) of the required trees may be substituted
by shrubs adjacent to retail storefronts where the view of wall signs may be
obstructed. Ten (10) shrubs with a minimum container size of five (5) gallons
shall be provided for each tree that is replaced.
         d.   Standards For The Minimum Internal Landscaping Area And Minimum
Number Of Trees:
            (1)   Location Of The Minimum Area: To be credited toward the
minimum internal landscaping area requirement, a landscaping area shall be
located as follows:
   (A) Adjacent to those building elevations which form the major public views
of the project from adjacent streets and properties and to the users of the
project; or
   (B) Within a plaza or courtyard between buildings or portions of buildings;
or
   (C) In a space provided to separate building areas from parking areas; or
   (D) In a similar location which substantially conforms to the stated purpose
of the required internal landscaping area (see above), if approved by zoning
and planning.
The location of spaces credited toward the minimum internal landscaping area
requirement shall be consistent with the policies articulated herein.
The minimum internal landscaping area and its minimum number of trees may not
consist of spaces or trees which are proposed to meet the minimum requirements
of other subsections of this section, such as landscaped setbacks, buffers, or
parking lot trees.
            (2)   Design Standards: The minimum required internal landscaping
area shall consist of a minimum of fifty percent (50%) in ground covering by
living grass or other plant materials. This percentage provides flexibility
where plants and their irrigation should be limited next to building
foundations.
The intent of the internal landscaping area is to provide relief from
structures and hard surfaces in a project through the use of plantings.
Therefore, sidewalks that provide basic pedestrian circulation only shall not
be credited toward the minimum internal landscaping area requirement. Paved
plazas may be credited to a maximum of fifty percent (50%) of required internal
landscaping area if such plazas have trees that provide visual relief to those
building elevations that form the major public views of the project.
To provide for flexibility of design in the minimum internal landscaping area,
the developer may select the types of and the planting spaces between the
required trees. However, the trees shall be selected from the tree types that
are commonly known to grow in the Bar Nunn area. The planting spacing should
allow for the growth characteristics of the trees without adversely affecting
the maintenance of structures, walks or drives.
The minimum planting sizes of trees shall comply with the specifications
provided in subsection D of this section.
      5.   Percentage In Living Materials: Unless otherwise specified, any
required landscape area, such as a minimum landscaped setback, shall consist of
a minimum of seventy five percent (75%) in ground covering by living grass or
other plant materials. The minimum planting sizes and spacings of shrubs and
ground covers to meet a ground covering requirement shall be consistent with a
landscape policy manual, prepared by zoning and planning. The foliage crown of
trees shall not be used in the seventy five percent (75%) or other required
percentage calculation. The remaining twenty five percent (25%) of the required
landscape area may be covered with bark, wood chips, rock, stone or similar
materials.
      6.   Other Landscape Regulations:
         a.   Landscaping shall not conflict with the traffic visibility
requirements in subsection 8-3-7B2 of this chapter.
         b.   The use of artificial trees, shrubs, vines, turf or other plants
as an outside landscape material is prohibited.
         c.   Clumps of trees (such as aspen, Populus tremuloides), where used,
are encouraged instead of single trunk trees. However, such a clump shall be
credited as only one of the required trees.
         d.   Landscaping shall not interfere with the general function, safety
or acceptability of any gas, electric, water, sewer, telephone or utility
easement. Landscaping shall be limited to an eight inch (8") mature height
within three feet (3') of a fire hydrant.
         e.   Refuse collection areas, including trash bins, shall be screened
from view from adjacent properties and streets by the use of a wall or fence of
an opaque design or other architectural elements, or dense evergreen planting
with a minimum planting height of four feet (4').
         f.   Loading docks, vehicle repair bays and vehicle fueling areas
shall be screened from view from adjacent properties and streets by the use of
plantings, berms, walls, fences or other architectural elements.
         g.   The existing indigenous vegetation on that site is encouraged to
be retained in a development project and may be credited toward required
landscaping in this section.
         h.   Where a calculation of a requirement results in a fractional
number (such as 14.2 required trees), the requirement shall be considered the
next greatest whole number (such as 15 required trees).
         i.   Where two (2) different landscape requirements apply (for
example, a buffer and a landscaped setback), the greater requirements shall be
met (for example, the buffer).
         j.   Landscaping in the right of way of a state highway shall be
approved by the district engineer, where applicable.
         k.   Parking lot landscaping requirements are as provided in
subsection F of this section.
   F.   Parking Lot Landscape Requirements:
      1.   Required Trees: One tree of a type suitable for parking lots shall
be provided for every fifteen (15) open (not in garage) spaces. The tree types
and minimum planter sizes shall be consistent with this section. The required
trees may be clustered but shall be located to divide and break up expanses of
paving and long rows of parking spaces and to create a canopy effect in the
parking lot. In order to be considered within the parking lot, the trees must
be located in planters that are bounded on at least three (3) sides by parking
lot paving. This means that only trees in landscaped islands or fingers can
count toward the parking lot tree requirements. Planters shall be of sufficient
size and design to accommodate the growth of the trees and to prevent damage to
the trees by vehicles.
      2.   Required Screening: Open parking spaces, except in one-family and
two-family residential projects in any zone district, shall be screened from
view from adjacent properties and streets to an eventual minimum height of
three feet (3') by the use of berms and/or plantings. A minimum of two-thirds
(2/3) of the affected street frontage or property boundary, not containing
intersecting driveways, must have the required screen. Structures such as
decorative walls or fences may be approved through zoning and planning if it is
found that:
         a.   The structures avoid a blank and monotonous appearance by such
measures as architectural articulation and the planting of vines, shrubs or
trees; or
         b.   The total use of berms and/or plantings is not physically
feasible; or
         c.   The structures attractively complement the use of berms and/or
plantings.
The maximum spacing of plants to achieve an acceptable screen and the maximum
acceptable grades for screening areas, such as sodded berms and planting beds
shall be as approved by the town engineer or zoning and planning.
   G.   Enforcement And Assurances For Installation And Completion: Within one
year of issue date of building permit for any structure where landscaping is
required, except when a certificate of occupancy is obtained by providing
acceptable assurance to the town guaranteeing the completion of such
landscaping, all work as indicated on the landscaping plan shall be inspected
and approved by the town engineer or designee of zoning and planning. At the
time of inspection, the landowner shall possess a copy of the approved
landscaping plan for use by the town engineer or appointee of zoning and
planning.
At the time of inspection, the town engineer or appointee of zoning and
planning shall check the quantities and locations of landscape materials. At
the time of such inspection, the landowner shall warrant that the completed
landscaping complies with the approved landscape plan. Such warranty shall
include the quantities, locations, species and sizes of plants and other
landscape materials on the approved landscape plan. In the event that an
inspection is not conducted by the town engineer or appointee of zoning and
planning prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy because acceptable
assurance has been provided to the town guaranteeing the completion of such
landscaping, such inspection shall be done by the town engineer or appointee of
zoning and planning subsequent to the installation of such landscaping but
prior to the release or expiration of the acceptable assurance.
A landowner may obtain a certificate of occupancy for a structure prior to the
completion of the required landscaping work if the completion is not possible
due to seasonal or weather conditions and if the landowner submits the
necessary assurances to zoning and planning for guaranteeing the completion of
the landscaping, such as an irrevocable letter of credit, certified check or
subdivision bond or other acceptable assurance, which shall be equal to the
cost of the landscaping work and shall be accompanied by a written assurance
that such landscaping will be completed to the satisfaction of zoning and
planning within a specified period of time not to exceed one year of issue date
of building permit.
   H.   Maintenance:
      1.   Maintenance On Private Property:
         a.   The landowner is responsible for the maintenance of the
landscaping plan as originally approved.
         b.   The landowner is responsible for all regular and normal
maintenance of landscaping, including weeding, irrigation, fertilizing, pruning
and mowing.
         c.   Plant materials which exhibit evidence of insects, pests,
diseases and/or damage, shall be appropriately treated and all dead plant
material shall be removed and replaced with living plant materials within one
growing season.
      2.   Maintenance Of Adjacent Right Of Way Areas Or Street Parkings: This
code requires the owners of property to maintain the street parking (the area
between a property line and asphalt edge or curb) adjoining the property. The
town shall provide maintenance of trees only by means of spraying, trimming and
removal.
      3.   Performance Standard For Seeded Areas: Seeded landscape areas shall
have no bare areas larger than six (6) square inches after germination. (Ord.
2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-3-12: WAIVERS:
   A.   Requests for waivers (not more than 10 percent less than the
requirement) of buffering, or parking requirements listed in the zoning
districts of this title, or reduction of landscaping requirement specified in
this chapter, may be considered subject to the following procedure:
      1.   Submission of a written request from the owner of record addressed
to the town engineer stating the rationale for the request and providing any
documentation, diagrams, renderings or photographs necessary to convey the
intent of the waiver request.
      2.   Notification of the request and the date, time and place of the
zoning and planning commission meeting where the waiver will be considered
shall be mailed to property owners within a three hundred foot (300') radius of
the subject property. No public hearing shall be required, however, the
commission shall receive comments from meeting participants who desire to
address the request.
      3.   The commission shall review the waiver request and approve, approve
with conditions, approve with modifications or deny the request. In rendering
their decision, the commission shall consider such factors as proximity to
other development and types of uses, manmade or natural barriers such as
streets, drainages, draws, existing vegetation, slopes, etc., which achieve the
intent of the buffering or landscaping requirement at a lower rate than is
required by this title. The commission may also consider alternative solutions
that achieve the intent of landscaping and/or buffering.
      4.   Requests for a reduction of off street parking requirements shall be
considered on the basis of use, number of employees, availability of on street
parking or shared parking with adjacent property owners.
      5.   The Bar Nunn town council shall have the authority to approve,
modify, or deny all waiver requests. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-3-13: PERMIT FEES:
The fees for permits shall be as established by the town council. (Ord. 2012-1,
4-17-2012)

parking of an automobile exclusive of access aisles and/or private driveways.
         d.   Minimum Space Dimensions For Handicapped Parking Spaces: All off
street business, commercial, or industrial parking lots shall provide, within
the space requirements specified in this section, one handicapped space per
each parking lot or a minimum of two percent (2%) of the total number of
required spaces per each lot, whichever is greater. Such spaces shall be placed
as close as possible to a major entrance of a building or use and shall not in
any case be located more than one hundred feet (100') in distance from the
major entrance of a building or use. Handicapped off street parking shall be
designated by a vertically mounted sign, a maximum of six feet (6') in height,
and also by pavement markings or otherwise as provided by applicable local law:
            (1)   Parallel Parking For Handicapped: Parallel off street parking
spaces shall be placed adjacent to a walk system so that access from the
vehicle to the destination is over a hard surface. Such off street parking
spaces shall be a minimum of thirteen feet (13') in width including the
adjacent aisle and a minimum of twenty four feet (24') in length and shall
either have an ADA compliant ramp up to the walk or shall be separated from the
walk by bollards or a similar device if the road level is at the same elevation

Note:
       1.    Additional width may be required where the aisle serves as the
principal means of access to on site buildings or structures.
      2.   All off street parking spaces, lots, or areas shall be constructed
and maintained in accordance with the following standards:
         a.   Construction and maintenance standards for commercial and
industrial districts: Parking surfaces, including ramps, streets, or parts
thereof, drives, and all other modalities providing ingress or egress leading
to the parking area shall be surfaced with four inches (4") of asphalt over a
six inch (6") base, or with such other surfaces as are designed by licensed
Wyoming geotechnical engineers, and approved by the town engineer. Such
facilities shall be arranged for convenient access and safety of pedestrians
and vehicles and shall be graded for drainage in such a manner as to provide
proper drainage away from all parking surfaces and structures. The drainage
shall also be designed and constructed so as to not burden existing town
drainage and storm sewer capabilities when runoff occurs. In no event shall
drainage exit the property onto adjacent property at greater than
preconstruction rates. The parking surfaces, as well as all modalities
providing access to the parking surfaces, shall be maintained in a safe,
operational, and orderly condition.
         b.   Construction and maintenance standards for all residential
districts: Parking surfaces, including private drives to garages, and garage
floor or parking pads, shall have surfacing of sufficient character to meet
current industry standards. Such facilities shall be arranged for convenient
access and safety of pedestrians and vehicles and shall be graded for drainage
in such a manner as to provide proper drainage away from all parking surfaces
and structures. The drainage shall also be designed and constructed so as to
not burden existing town drainage and storm sewer capabilities when runoff
occurs. In no event shall drainage exit the property onto adjacent property at
greater than preconstruction rates. The parking surfaces, as well as all
modalities providing access to the parking surfaces, exhibiting potholes or
extensive cracking shall be restored so as to eliminate these deficiencies.
(Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-4-2: OFF STREET PARKING AND LOADING REGULATIONS:
   A.   General Provisions:
      1.   Prospective Application Of Title: Any building improvements/
modifications that change or expand the use of the affected property, or the
development of land approved after the effective date hereof, shall obligate
the owner to bring the applicable property into compliance with all
requirements of this chapter.
      2.   Obligation: The requirements for off street parking and off street
loading shall be a continuing obligation of the owner of the real estate on
which any building or improvement is located, so long as the building or
improvement is in existence and its use requiring vehicle parking or vehicle
loading facilities continues. It shall be unlawful for an owner of any building
or improvement to discontinue, change or dispense with the required vehicle
parking or loading space, apart from the discontinuance, sale or transfer of
such structure, without establishing alternative vehicle parking or loading
space which meets with the requirements of and is in compliance with this
title; or for any person to use such building without providing space for
vehicle parking or loading space which meets with the requirements of and is in
compliance with this title.
      3.   Joint Use Of Facilities: Nothing in this title shall be construed to
prevent the joint use of off street parking or off street loading spaces for
two (2) or more buildings or two (2) or more uses in one building if the total
of such spaces when used together shall not be less than the sum of the
requirements for the various individual uses computed separately.
      4.   Mixed Uses: The total off street parking and loading requirements
shall be the sum of the various uses.
      5.   Establishment Of Required Facilities Not Deemed Dedicated To Public
Use: The establishment of off street parking or loading facilities to meet the
requirements of this title shall not be construed to be a dedication of such
facilities to a public use. They shall remain appurtenant to the building or
structure they are intended to serve only, so long as the use of such building
or structure is such that such facilities are necessary for the convenience of
its occupants or other persons using, entering, or visiting such buildings.
      6.   Regulation Of Adjacent On Street Parking And Loading: The owners or
occupants of a building or structure for which sufficient off street parking
space and loading space has been provided may request that the use of on street
parking and/or loading immediately adjacent to the lot or parcel of land upon
which such building or structure is located be prohibited, restricted or
regulated for the purpose of relieving traffic congestion or promoting traffic
safety. The manner in which on street parking under the authority of this title
is prohibited, restricted, or regulated shall be approved by the town engineer
and shall be enforced by the town in the same manner as other similar measures
for regulation of traffic. This shall not be construed to limit in any way the
power of the town to regulate traffic and parking upon the public streets.
      7.   Accessibility To Parking Required: All off street parking or loading
facilities shall be accessible at all times, from a street, paved alley, or
paved driveway intended to serve such off street parking and/or loading.
Likewise, off street parking or loading facilities shall be available at all
reasonable and appropriate times for the use of the occupants of the building
or structure they are intended to serve, customers, visitors or any other
persons who may use, visit or enter the building or structure.
      8.   Identification Signs: Off street parking or loading facilities may
have posted signs identifying the building or structure and use to be served.
The owners or occupants may use any legal means or method to prevent the use of
such facilities by persons other than those for whose use the facilities are
intended.
      9.   Fractional Measurements For Parking Spaces: When units or
measurements determining the number of required off street parking and off
street loading spaces result in a requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction less than one-half (1/2) shall be disregarded and any fraction one-
half (1/2) or over shall require one off street parking or off street loading
space.
      10.   Proposed Plans For Facilities: For the purpose of converting
parking or loading spaces into the required parking or loading area, plans must
be submitted to the town engineer to show how the required parking or loading
spaces shall be arranged in the area supplied for that purpose and to indicate
sufficient space for parking maneuvers as well as adequate ingress and egress
to the parking or loading area.
      11.   Waivers: Zoning and planning is hereby authorized and empowered,
after a proper hearing thereon, with notice to the public, to permit waiver (by
not more than 10 percent less than code requirements) or modification in the
location, configuration, or amount of off street parking or off street loading
spaces required by this title if, after investigation by zoning and planning,
which investigation shall include receipt of written findings and
recommendations of the town engineer, it is found that such waiver is necessary
to prevent unreasonable hardship for all affected parties or to secure an
appropriate development or modification of a specific parcel of land.
Requests for waivers for parking shall follow the procedures outlined in
section
8-3-12 of this title.
   B.   Off Street Parking:
      1.   Compliance Required To Receive Certificate Of Occupancy: No
certificates of occupancy shall be granted for any new building or change/
expanded use until off street parking requirements hereunder have been
confirmed through inspection and approved by the town engineer or his designee.
      2.   Tandem Spaces: Except for single-family residential purposes, no
tandem parking space shall be counted as more than one off street parking
space.
      3.   Sharing Of Off Street Parking Areas: No part of the off street
parking area required for any building, or use shall be included as a part of
an off street parking area required for another building, excluding a shopping
center whose site plan has been approved by the town council, unless an
executed sharing agreement is presented to the town engineer, approved by the
town council, and meets the requirements of subsection A2 of this section.
      4.   Credit For Nonadjacent/Off Site Parking: In calculating total off
street parking space requirements for all districts other than the residential
districts hereinafter identified in subsection B5 of this section, credit may
be granted if adequate off street parking space meeting all requirements of
this section is available within a distance of four hundred feet (400') of the
use. Application for such credit shall demonstrate that such parking space has
been irrevocably secured for a minimum period of ten (10) years from the date
of approval. In the general business district, credit may also be allowed when
the owner or person in charge of the use has obtained the requisite number of
off street parking spaces in an existing parking structure, or paid a cash
contribution toward the construction of a parking structure. The maximum space
that can be acquired by any one individual toward satisfying the town's off
street parking requirements shall be determined by the town council.
      5.   Parking For R-1 Through R-3, R-5, And R-6 Districts: Parking for R-
1 through R-3, R-5 and R-6 districts shall be located on the same lot or tract
as the main structure is located.
      6.   Use Of Right Of Way: No off street parking space to be provided
under the terms of this section shall be located within the right of way of any
public street unless approval to the use is granted by the commission and
council.
      7.   Configuration Of Commercial Lighting Facilities: Lighting facilities
shall be so designed and installed that illumination will be directed away from
abutting residential properties and will not interfere with traffic signals.
Light poles shall not exceed thirty feet (30') in height unless approved as a
waiver granted by the commission.
      8.   Uses Not Specified: Where parking requirements for any use are not
specifically defined in section
8-4-3 of this chapter, such parking requirements shall be determined by zoning
and planning after receiving written findings and recommendations of the town
engineer.
   C.   Loading Space/Areas:
      1.   Businesses Requiring Off Street Loading Spaces: Every retail
establishment, storage warehouse, industrial plant, manufacturing
establishment, freight terminal, or wholesale establishment that has a gross
floor area of ten thousand (10,000) square feet or more, intended for such use,

NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES
SECTION:
8-5-1: Intent; Application Of Provisions
8-5-2: Nonconforming Lots
8-5-3: Nonconforming Use Of Land
8-5-4: Nonconforming Structures
8-5-5: Nonconforming Uses Of Structures And Land
8-5-1: INTENT; APPLICATION OF PROVISIONS:
   A.   Nonconforming Lots, Structures Or Uses Allowed: It is the intent of
this title to permit legal nonconforming lots, structures or uses to continue
until they are removed or become more conforming, but not to encourage their
continuance.
It is recognized that there exist, within the zoning districts established by
this title, lots, structures and uses of land and structures which were lawful
before this title was adopted, which would be prohibited, regulated or
restricted under its present terms. Such uses are declared by this title to be
incompatible with permitted uses in the district involved. It is the intent of
this title that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or
extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited
elsewhere in the same zoning district. Zoning and planning shall hear all
requests for variances under this section. A nonconforming use of a structure,
a nonconforming use of land or a nonconforming use of a structure and land,
shall not be extended nor enlarged after the passage of the ordinance from
which this section is derived by alteration of a building or premises or by the
addition of other uses of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the
zoning district involved. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this section
shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated
use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to
November 16, 1982, nor any building upon which a building permit has been
issued and construction has not begun. "Actual construction" is hereby defined
to include the placing and fastening of construction materials in a permanent
position. If demolition or removal of an existing structure is involved, such
demolition or removal shall be considered as a part of the construction.
   B.   Change In Ownership: There may be a change of tenancy, ownership or
management of any existing nonconforming use of land, structure or land and
structure providing there is not a change in the nature or character of such
nonconforming use. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-5-2: NONCONFORMING LOTS:
   A.   Lots Nonconforming Prior To Adoption Of Zoning Ordinance: In a district
in which dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other
provisions of this title, a dwelling or dwellings and customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot or lots of record on November 16,
1982.
This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements
for area and/or width, which are generally applicable in the zoning district
involved; provided, that side yards, setbacks, and other requirements shall
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which such lot is
located.
   B.   Division Of Parcels: If two (2) or more lots or combinations of lots or
portions with continuous frontage are in single ownership at the time of the
adoption or amendment to this section, and if the lot or combination of lots
does not meet the requirements for area or width, the land involved shall be
considered as an undivided parcel. No division of a parcel shall be made which
leaves the remaining lot or fraction thereof with width or area below the
requirements stated in that zoning district. Variances may be obtained through
approval of zoning and planning. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-5-3: NONCONFORMING USE OF LAND:
If a lawful use of land existed on November 16, 1982, which is no longer
permissible under the zoning district in which the land is located, the use may
continue, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased nor extended to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied on the passage date hereof or
the date of amendments hereto.
   B.   No nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any other
portion of the lot, tract, or parcel occupied by such use after November 16,
1982.
   C.   If any nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of
one hundred eighty (180) days or more, any subsequent use of such land shall
conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which the land is
located.
   D.   Property owners may petition the zoning and planning commission and the
town council for a variance to these provisions as outlined in section
8-3-2 of this title. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-5-4: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES:
If a lawful structure existed on November 16, 1982, which could not be built
under the terms or regulations for the zoning district in which such
nonconforming structure is located because of restrictions on lot coverage,
height or other characteristics of the structure, the structure may be
continued, subject to the following provisions:
   A.   No structure may be enlarged or altered in any way that increases its
nonconformity.
   B.   Should a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than
fifty percent (50%) of its replacement cost (as determined by the Casper
building inspector based on a written bid submitted by a qualified building
contractor) exclusive of foundation, it shall not be reconstructed except in
conformity with the requirements for the zoning district in which the structure
is located.
   C.   Should any structure be moved for any reason, for any distance
whatsoever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in
which it is located.
   D.   Property owners may petition the zoning and planning commission and the
town council for a variance to these provisions as outlined in section
8-3-2 of this title. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-5-5: NONCONFORMING USES OF STRUCTURES AND LAND:
If a lawful use of a structure and land, in combination, existed on November
16, 1982, which is not permitted in the zoning district in which it is located,
the use may continue, subject to the following contingencies:
   A.   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted in the zoning
district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered, except by changing the use of
the structure to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located.
   B.   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any part of an
existing building or structure planned, arranged, or designed for such use,
which existed on November 16, 1982, however, such use shall not be extended to
occupy any land outside such building.
   C.   If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a
structure, or structure and premises, may be changed to another nonconforming
use of the same or a more restrictive classification, providing that the
proposed use is equally appropriate to the district as the preexisting
nonconforming use. In permitting such change, zoning and planning may require
appropriate conditions and safeguards for the protection of other owners of
property within the zoning district; however, under no circumstances shall the
nonconformity of any use be changed to a less restrictive classification.
   D.   If a nonconforming use of a structure and land is discontinued for a
period of one hundred eighty (180) days or more in any one calendar year,
except seasonal or periodical agriculture or residential use, any future use of
such land, building or structure shall be in conformity with the regulations
for the zoning district in which the use is located.
   E.   On any building or structure devoted in whole or in part to any
nonconforming use, ordinary work and repairs, or repair or replacement of
nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring and plumbing shall be permitted; however,
this is not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the replacement cost of the
building as determined by the building official. Nothing shall be deemed to
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or
part thereto, declared to be unsafe by an official. Nothing in this section
shall be construed to prevent the installation or repair of curbs, gutters,
sidewalks, streets, storm sewers or any other capital improvement that is for
the safety and general welfare of the zoning district in which said land or
structure is located.
   F.   Property owners may petition the zoning and planning commission and the
town council for a variance to these provisions as outlined in section
8-3-2 of this title. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)

8-8-1: PURPOSE:
   A.   The purpose of the planned unit development district is to provide
opportunities to create more desirable environments through the application of
flexible and diversified land development standards under a professional,
prepared comprehensive plan and program. The PUD is intended to be used to
encourage the application of new techniques and new technology to community
development that will result in superior living or development arrangements
with lasting values. It is further intended to achieve economics in land
development, maintenance, street systems, and utility networks while providing
building groupings for privacy, usable, open spaces, and vehicle and pedestrian
circulation for the inhabitants.
   B.   Except as otherwise restricted, the planned unit development may be
proposed as a substitute for any existing zone and may be initiated by the
"owner" as defined in this title, or upon the motion of the council as
prescribed in this title. The planned unit development may be used for
residential, business, or industrial purposes, or a combination of residential/
business or business/industrial purposes. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-8-2: FINDINGS FOR PROJECT APPROVAL:
The council and the commission shall approve a PUD, if the PUD is found to
satisfy standards of this title, including the following:
   A.   Be compatible with the goals and policies of the Bar Nunn community
development plan and other applicable adopted plans and policies;
   B.   Be compatible with the area surrounding the project site and place no
greater demand on existing town facilities and services than can be furnished
by the town;
   C.   Promote the efficient use of land by means of more economical
arrangement of buildings, circulation systems, land uses, densities, and
utilities;
   D.   Provide for usable and suitably located open space such as, but not
limited to, bicycle paths, playground areas, courtyards, tennis courts,
swimming pools, planned gardens, outdoor seating areas, outdoor picnic areas,
and similar open space;
   E.   Demonstrate flexibility and quality in design to permit diversification
in the location, type, and uses of structures;
   F.   Combine and coordinate architectural styles, building forms, and
building relationships within the development and in concert with adjacent and
surrounding land and development;
   G.   Minimize impact on adjacent zoning districts by limiting building
heights, providing screening and/or other buffers;
   H.   Preserve and utilize where possible, existing landscape features and
amenities and encourage the harmonious combination of such features with
structures and other improvements;
   I.   Be designed and developed as a whole under the control of one owner,
partnership, corporation, or agency;
   J.   Consist of such a mixture of uses, density, or characteristic or
creative design;
   K.   Constitute a buffer zone between existing land uses and existing zones;
   L.   Consist of a land area of a minimum of one and one-half (11/2) acres in
size; a smaller land area may be permitted with written approval by the
commission. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-8-3: PERMITTED USES:
Except as otherwise permitted or restricted, all uses permitted in the R-1, R-
2, R-3, R-4, R-5, R-6, B-1, B-2, I-1, and I-2 districts are permitted in a PUD,
provided that when residential uses are proposed for a specific PUD, any
commercial uses proposed for the PUD must be shown to be primarily for the
service and convenience of the residents of the development and the immediate
neighborhood and that such uses, if any, shall not change, injure, or destroy,
temporarily or permanently, the predominantly residential character of the PUD.
(Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-8-4: SIZE OF THE PUD SITE:
A PUD may be for a tract of residential land that will accommodate not more
than thirty six (36) dwelling units per acre, if the council and the commission
find, upon a showing by the landowner, that the PUD is in the public interest
because one or more of the following conditions exist:
   A.   An unusual physical or topographic feature of importance to the people
of the area or the community as a whole exists on the site or in the
neighborhood which can be preserved and still leave the landowner equivalent
use of the land by the use of a PUD;
   B.   The property or its neighborhood has a historical character of
importance to the community that will be protected by the use of a PUD;
   C.   When not more than twenty five percent (25%) of the PUD (planned unit
development) lot perimeter is abutting properties zoned R-1 (residential
estate) or R-2 (one-unit residential), the maximum allowed density is thirty
(30) residential units to the acre. When more than twenty five percent (25%) of
the lot perimeter is abutting properties R-1 (residential estate) or R-2 (one-
unit residential), the maximum density shall not exceed twenty four (24)
residential units to the acre. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)

   B.   Commercial, fifteen percent (15%) of the total land area;
   C.   Industrial, ten percent (10%) of the total land area. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-
17-2012)
8-8-7: DIMENSIONS AND BULK STANDARDS AND TYPE OF CONSTRUCTION:
The type of proposed construction shall be described in the PUD application,
providing that:
   A.   If the spacing between main buildings is not equivalent to the spacing
that would be required between buildings similarly developed under this title
on separate parcels, other design features shall provide light, ventilation,
and other characteristics equivalent to that which would have been obtained
from the spacing standards.
   B.   Buildings, off street parking and loading facilities, open space,
landscaping, and screening shall provide protection outside the boundary lines
of the development comparable to that otherwise required of similar development
in other existing districts.
   C.   The maximum building height shall not exceed four (4) stories or forty
feet (40') for residential uses, or eight (8) stories or seventy five feet
(75') for commercial uses, except that a greater height may be approved if
surrounding open space within the PUD, building setbacks, and other design
features are used to avoid any adverse impact due to the greater height. (Ord.
2012-1, 4-17-2012)
8-8-8: DENSITY:
If a PUD is used as an overlay, there shall be no more buildings or building
sites per acre than permitted in the district for which the PUD is an overlay.
If the PUD is used as a separate zoning district, the number of units will be
determined as provided in section
8-8-4 of this chapter. (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)

A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL (dBA): A measurement of sound pressure level, which has
been filtered or weighted to progressively deemphasize the importance of
frequency components below one thousand (1,000) Hz and above five thousand
(5,000) Hz. This reflects the fact that human hearing is less sensitive at low
frequencies and at extremely high frequencies, relative to the midrange of the
frequency spectrum. This area of sensitivity also corresponds to the human
speech band.
DECIBEL (dB): The measurement of a sound pressure relative to the logarithmic
conversion of the sound pressure reference level often set as zero dB (A-
weighted). In general, this means the quietest sound we can hear is near zero
dB (A-weighted) and the loudest we can hear without pain is near one hundred
twenty (120) dB (A-weighted).
FAA: The federal aviation administration of the United States department of
transportation.
GUY CABLE: Any cable or wire that extends from a small wind energy system for
the purpose of supporting the system structure.
METEOROLOGICAL TOWER: A facility consisting of a tower and related wind
measuring devices, which is used solely to measure winds preliminary to
construction of a small wind energy conversion system. Meteorological towers
shall not be allowed for time periods in excess of twelve (12) months, and
shall be removed prior to the installation of the wind energy conversion system
for which they are measuring. A request to install a meteorological tower shall
be included in the application to install either a micro wind system or a small
wind energy conversion system.
MICRO WIND SYSTEM: A building mounted wind system (either a vertical or
horizontal axis turbine) that has a rated nameplate capacity of ten (10) kW or
less (3 kW or less for residential properties), and projects no more than
fifteen feet (15') above the highest point of the roof. Such building mounted
wind systems shall be regulated by applicable building and electrical codes,
and shall not be considered a small wind energy conversion system. A micro wind
system shall not be considered in determining total building height for zoning
or setback purposes. Multiple turbines are permitted, provided the total
cumulative rated nameplate capacity does not exceed ten (10) kW (or 3 kW for
residential properties).
RATED NAMEPLATE CAPACITY: The maximum rated output of electric power production
equipment. This output is typically specified by the manufacturer with a
"nameplate" on the equipment.
SMALL WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM: A wind energy conversion system consisting
of a tower, a turbine, and associated control or conversion electronics that
generates power for an individual property for the purpose of reducing on site
energy consumption with a rated nameplate capacity of twenty five (25) kW or
less per tower. This includes, but is not limited to, storage, electrical
collection and supply equipment, and transformers. Excess electrical power
generated, and not presently needed for on site use, may be utilized by the
utility company.
TOWER HEIGHT: The total height above finished grade of the fixed portion of the
tower, including the wind turbine blades.
TURBINE: The parts of a wind system including the blades, generator, and tail.
The definition of a turbine includes both horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT)
and vertical axis wind turbines (VAWT). (Ord. 2012-1, 4-17-2012)

soils classified in accordance with the AASHTO M-147-73 classification of A-
1 and A-5(0) to A-5(3). The area must have good drainage and the soil must not
exhibit expansive properties.
Minimum structural section components thicknesses for collector streets located
on this type of subgrade shall consist of four inches (4") of asphalt concrete
surface course over six inches (6") of aggregate base material over twelve
inches (12") of modified subgrade/prepared subbase. Minimum component

(6") of aggregate base material over twelve inches (12") of modified subgrade/
prepared subbase.
         b.   Poor Subgrade: A "poor subgrade" is defined as a soil having an
AASHTO M-147-73 classification of A-5 (4 or greater), A-6 or A-7. Soil samples
must not exhibit a degree of expansion greater than two percent (2%) of the
sample's original height when saturated under a five hundred (500) psf load.
In poor subgrade areas, the road pavement structural section must be designed
by a registered civil engineer specializing in geotechnical or soil
engineering. The design shall be submitted to the town and include supporting
soil strength data and anticipated traffic loading for twenty (20) year design
life. All roads shall be designed for a twenty (20) year life unless prior

into the manhole six (6) to twelve inches (12") with the top half cut out. This
pipe is to allow for cleaning and pipe inspection and shall be minimally sloped
back to tee to keep liquid from draining out of the pipe. All sewage shall flow
down the vertical drop to the manhole invert. All drops shall be external, no
internal drops will be allowed.
If less than eighteen inches (18") drop, an internal "beaver slide" shall be
used and installed to allow for a smooth transition in the manhole. Abrupt
drops will not be allowed.
      2.   Lamp holes will not be acceptable as a substitute for manholes.
      3.   Floor troughs shall be furnished for all sewers entering manholes. A
larger diameter manhole may be needed in order to properly construct floor

13-2G-5: Surcharge For Excess BOD Or Suspended Solids
13-2G-6: Sewer Plant Investment Fees–Amount–Responsibility
13-2G-1: PURPOSE:
   It is determined and declared to be necessary and conducive to the
protection of the public health, safety and welfare to collect charges from all
users who contribute wastewater to the Town's treatment works. The proceeds of
such charges so derived will be used for the purpose of operation and
maintenance and other related costs as determined by the Town council for such
public wastewater treatment works.
(Ord. 2024-01, 5-7-2024)
13-2G-2: GENERATION OF REVENUE:
   The user charge system shall generate adequate annual revenues to pay costs
of annual operation and maintenance including replacement and other related
sewer system costs which the Town may determine by ordinance to be paid by the
user charge system. That portion of the total user charge which is designated
for operation and maintenance including replacement of the treatment works
shall be established by ordinance.
(Ord. 2024-01, 5-7-2024)
13-2G-3: BASIS OF USER FEE-FEE STRUCTURE:
   All users within the Town's service area shall be assessed a monthly sewer
user rate consisting of a customer service charge and a volume charge.
   A.   The customer service charge shall be assessed to recover costs that
apply equally to each user of the system regardless of volume contribution. It
shall be billed on a customer account basis.
   B.   The volume charge shall be the amount charged a customer for the
quantity of wastewater contributed to the Town's system during a billing
period.
      1.   For the single-family residential and multifamily residential users,
this fee shall be based on the average water used by that user during the
winter quarter (December, January and February) as measured at the dwelling by
the Town water meter. A single-family residential and multifamily residential
user may submit a written request to the Public works director or designated
representative to use alternate months for the averaging period. The Public
works director or designated representative is authorized to substitute
different month of a calendar year to obtain a three (3) month averaging period
to calculate the annual sewer average for the user and adjust the sewer user
fee accordingly. The following situations may be considered by the Public works
director or designated representative to select an alternate month to be used
for the recalculation of the sewer user fee: weather conditions, shut-off of
service, new ownership, irrigation, or leaks within the user's dwelling. The
Public works director or designated representative may utilize the prior year's
average when a three (3) month averaging period cannot be determined due to the
situations noted herein.
      2.   For single-family residential users not having a winter water
consumption history, their sewer bill for the first month of service and every
month thereafter shall be based on the number of reported occupants times two
thousand (2,000) gallons per occupant per month with a minimum implied water
usage of two thousand (2,000) gallons per month. After a period of three (3)
full months as measured at the dwelling by the Town water meter, a single-
family residential user may submit a written request to the Public works
director or designated representative for a review of the average sewer
consumption used by the user. The Public works director or designated
representative will calculate the annual sewer average based on this period of
three (3) full months and adjust the sewer user fee accordingly. For
multifamily residential users not having a winter water consumption history,
the sewer average shall be based on the previous owner's average. When a
previous owner's average is not available due to new construction or shut off
of services the sewer average shall be based on the number of reported
occupants for all units times two thousand (2,000) gallons per occupant with a
minimum implied water usage of two thousand (2,000) gallons per unit per month.
Otherwise, the assigned average monthly water consumption will be used until
such time as a winter quarter water consumption history is obtained for the
individual user.
      3.   For residential users who purchase and move to another property
within the Town, the established volume charge will be transferred to the new
property.
   C.   Charges shall made by the Governing Body of the Town of Bar Nunn by
resolution. The rates and charges established in this section may be modified
by a resolution adopted and ratified by the governing body. The rates so
determined shall remain in effect until or unless revised by any subsequent
resolution. The governing body may further review and adjust such charges
during the budgetary process as is necessary in order to meet the anticipated
expenditures of the department. The rates so determined shall remain in effect
until or unless revised in any subsequent year.
   D.   A resolution shall be presented for governing body action to ratify
said adjustments. The governing body may further review and adjust such charges
during the budgetary process as is necessary in order to meet the anticipated
expenditures of the department. The rates so determined shall remain in effect

system except as provided in subsection B of this section. The owner of the
property upon which an approved water meter is located shall assure that such
meter is at all times in good working order, and shall contact the public works
director to cause the meter to be repaired or replaced. The property owner
shall bear all costs of meter installation and repair or replacement. For
additional provisions concerning water meter installation and property owner
responsibilities, see Title 13, Chapter 1.
      2.   Such meter shall be read on a monthly basis to determine volume
charge for the purpose of billing for wastewater contribution to the Town's
system. The fee structure shall be in accordance with Section 13-2G-3 of this
code.
   B.   Any residential user served by the wastewater system of the Town who is
not served by the water system of the Town shall be charged a monthly volume
charge based upon the Town-wide average residential water consumption of the
winter quarter. This volume rate will be adjusted annually in conjunction with
the annual sewer rate calculation for residential users served by the Town
water system.
(Ord. 2024-01, 5-7-2024)
13-2G-5: SURCHARGE FOR EXCESS BOD OR SUSPENDED SOLIDS:
   A.   For those contributors who contribute wastewater, the strength of which
is greater than the upper limit of normal domestic sewage, a surcharge in
addition to the normal charge will be collected. This surcharge shall be
determined by the town based on estimates of treatment costs of excess BOD and
SS concentrations at the time such contributors are connected to the town's
wastewater treatment system.
   B.   Any user which discharges any toxic pollutants which cause an increase
in the cost of managing the effluent or the sludge from the town's treatment
works, or any user which discharges any substance which singly or by
interaction with other substances causes identifiable increases in the cost of
operation, maintenance or replacement of the treatment works, shall pay for
such increased costs. The strength of effluent shall be determined by the
responsible plant operating personnel and users shall be charged the additional
surcharge rates as provided by ordinance.
