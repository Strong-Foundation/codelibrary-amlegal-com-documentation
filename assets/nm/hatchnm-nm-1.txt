SPECIFIC STANDARDS
 
 
 
Section under 15.16.070: BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD:
 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in the current scientific and engineering report entitled,
“The Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Doña Ana County, New Mexico, dated July 6,
2016 with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and FIRM dated July 6, 2016.
 
 
Section 15.16.140 DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR:
 
(I) When a regulatory floodway has not been designated, the Floodplain
Administrator must require that no new construction, substantial improvements,
or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and
AE on the community's FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and
anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the
base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.
 
 
 
Section 15.16.180 FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION SPECIFIC STANDARDS:
 
E. Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO/AH Zones). Located within the
areas of special flood hazard established in 15.16.070 are areas designated as
shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base
flood depths of one foot to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not
exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow
may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Therefore, the following provisions apply:
 
(1)  All new construction, substantial improvements, and reconstruction due to
substantial damage of residential structures, including all equipment or
mechanical items servicing the structure, shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least one
foot above the BFE specified on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no
BFE is specified).
 
(2)  All new construction, substantial improvements and reconstruction due to
substantial damage, of nonresidential structures, including all equipment or
mechanical items servicing the structure shall:
(a)  Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest
adjacent grade at least one foot above the depth number specified in feet on
the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or
(b)  Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so
that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural
components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads of effect of buoyancy.
(3) A registered professional engineer or surveyor shall submit a certification
to the ESD, for review by the Floodplain Administrator, that the standards of
this section, as proposed in 15.16.170, are satisfied.
(4)  Within Zone AH or AO, adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes
shall be required to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed
structures.
 
F. Recreational Vehicles
1.   Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH,
and AE on the community's FIRM either
(i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, or
(ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
(iii) meet the permit requirements of 15.16.170, and the elevation and
anchoring requirements for "manufactured homes" in Section D of this section. A
recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking
system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and
security devices, and has no permanently attached additions.
 
 
   ALL ORDINANCES AND PARTS OF ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT HEREWITH ARE HEREBY
REPEALED.
 
   THIS ORDINANCE SHALL BE PUBLISHED ONCE AND SHALL BE IN FULL FORCE AND
EFFECTIVE FIVE (5) DAYS AFTER PUBLICATION.

occupational groups with a clear and identifiable community of interest in
employment terms, employment conditions and related personnel matters among the
employees involved. Occupational groups shall generally be identified as blue
collar, white collar, technical, para- professional, professional, corrections,
sheriff's officers, and fire. Bargaining units shall not be determined by craft
or trade designations. The parties, by mutual agreement and approval of the
board, may further consolidate occupational groups. Essential factors in
determining appropriate bargaining units shall include the principles of
efficient administration of government, the history of collective bargaining
with the employer and the assurance to employees of the fullest freedom in
exercising the rights guaranteed by the statute.
   B.   If the labor organization and employer cannot agree on the appropriate
bargaining unit within thirty (30) days, the board shall hold a hearing
concerning the composition of the bargaining unit. Any agreement as to the
appropriate bargaining unit between the employer and the labor organization
shall be subject to the approval of the board.
   C.   The board shall not include in any appropriate bargaining unit
probationary, supervisory, managerial or confidential employees. (Ord. 279 §
10, 1996)
2.20.110: ELECTIONS:
   A.   Whenever, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the board, a
petition is filed by a labor organization containing the signatures of at least
thirty percent (30%) of the employees in an appropriate bargaining unit, the
board shall conduct a secret ballot representation election.
   B.   Once a labor organization has filed a petition with the board calling
for a representation election, other labor organizations may seek to be placed
on the ballot. Any organization may file a petition containing the signatures
of not less than ten percent (10%) of the employees in the appropriate
bargaining unit no later than ten (10) days after the board has posted a
written notice that a petition containing the signatures of not less than
thirty percent (30%) of the employees has been filed by a labor organization.
   C.   All representation elections, except runoff elections, shall include
the option for "no representation".
   D.   In the event of an election with two (2) or more organizations on the
ballot where neither of the choices received a majority of the votes cast, a
runoff election shall be held within fifteen (15) days. The choices on the
runoff election shall consist of the two (2) choices which received the
greatest number of votes in the original election.
   E.   Where a majority of the votes cast are in favor of representation by a
labor organization and at least sixty percent (60%) of the members in the
bargaining unit have cast a vote, the board shall certify the labor
organization as the exclusive representative for all employees in that
appropriate bargaining unit. No labor organization shall be certified as an
exclusive representative unless at least sixty percent (60%) of the members of
the bargaining unit vote in the election.
   F.   No election shall be conducted if an election has been conducted in the
twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the proposed representation
election. No election shall be held during the term of an existing collective
bargaining agreement, except as provided in subsection
2.20.130(B) of this chapter.
   G.   Election disputes shall be resolved by the board. (Ord. 279 § 11, 1996)
2.20.120: EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATION:
   A.   A labor organization that has been certified by the board as
representing the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit shall be the
exclusive representative of all employees in the appropriate bargaining unit.
The exclusive representative shall act for all employees in the bargaining unit
and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement covering all employees in the
bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall represent the interests of
all employees in the bargaining unit without discrimination or regard to
membership or nonmembership in the labor organization.
   B.   The existence of an exclusive bargaining representative shall not
prevent employees from taking their grievances through the grievance process or
filing prohibited practices with the board based upon discrimination by the
exclusive representative or the employer. The board will adjudicate
disagreements over contract interpretations only when the disagreement is
between the employer and the exclusive representative. Any settlement of a
grievance or relief given on a prohibited practice brought by an individual
shall not be inconsistent with or in violation of the collective bargaining
agreement in effect between the employer and the exclusive representative or
inconsistent with or in violation of good faith resolution made between the
employer and the exclusive representative in the day to day administration of
the collective bargaining agreement. (Ord. 279 § 12, 1996)
2.20.130: DECERTIFICATION OF EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIVE:
   A.   Any member of a labor organization or the labor organization itself may
initiate decertification of a labor organization as the exclusive
representative if thirty percent (30%) of the employees in the appropriate
bargaining unit make a written request to the board for a decertification
election. Decertification elections shall be held in a manner prescribed by the
board.
   B.   When there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect, a request
for a decertification election shall be made to the board no earlier than
ninety (90) days and no later than sixty (60) days before the expiration of the
collective bargaining agreement; provided, however, that a request for a
decertification election may be filed at any time after the expiration of the
third year of a collective bargaining agreement with a term of more than three
(3) years.
   C.   When, within the time period prescribed in subsection B of this
section, a competing labor organization files a petition containing signatures
of at least thirty percent (30%) of the employees in the appropriate bargaining
unit, a representation election rather than a decertification election shall be
conducted.
   D.   When an exclusive representative has been certified but no collective
bargaining agreement is in effect, the board shall not accept a request for a
decertification election earlier than twelve (12) months subsequent to a labor
organization's certification as the exclusive representative. (Ord. 279 § 13,
1996)
2.20.140: SCOPE OF BARGAINING:
   A.   Except for retirement programs provided under the public employees'
retirement act, the parties shall bargain in good faith on wages, hours and
other terms and conditions of employment and other issues agreed to by the
parties.
   B.   Bargaining in good faith shall not require either party to agree to a
proposal or to make a concession.
   C.   The obligation to bargain collectively imposed by this chapter shall
not be construed as authorizing employers and exclusive representatives to
enter into any agreement that is in conflict with state statutes or federal
statutes. In the event of conflict between the provision of any federal or
state statutes and any agreement entered into by the employer and the exclusive
representative, the former shall prevail.
   D.   Payroll deduction of the exclusive representative's membership dues
shall be a mandatory subject of bargaining if either party chooses to negotiate
the issue. The amount of dues shall be certified in writing by an official of
the labor organization and shall not include special assessments, penalties or
fines of any type levied by the exclusive representative. During the time that
a board certification is in effect for a particular exclusive representative,
the employer shall not deduct dues for any other labor organization from
members of the same bargaining unit.
   E.   Any agreement by the employer and an exclusive representative that
requires the expenditures of funds shall be contingent upon the specific
appropriation of funds by the governing body and the availability of funds to
fund the agreed upon provision.
   F.   The parties have a requirement that grievance procedures culminating
with final and binding arbitration be negotiated. This applies only to
grievances and does not apply to negotiation impasses. (Ord. 279 § 14, 1996)
2.20.150: NEGOTIATIONS AND IMPASSE RESOLUTION:
   A.   The following meetings shall be closed:
      1.   Meetings for the discussion of collective bargaining strategy
between the employer and the employer's negotiating team;
      2.   Collective bargaining sessions; and
      3.   Consultations and impasse resolution procedures at which the
employer and the exclusive representative of the appropriate bargaining unit
are present.
   B.   The following impasse procedure shall be followed by the employer and
exclusive representative:
      1.   Either party may declare an impasse if no agreement has been reached
by the contract expiration date or within one hundred twenty (120) days of the
first negotiating session on the negotiation of the first agreement. Once an
impasse exists, a mediator from the federal mediation and conciliation service
will be assigned by the board.
      2.   If the impasse continues after a sixty (60) day mediation period,
either party may request from the board that a fact finder be assigned to the
negotiations. A fact finder will be selected by the parties from a list of
individuals requested from the federal mediation and conciliation service.
      3.   The fact finder shall conduct hearings with the parties. The fact
finder shall complete all work and submit a recommendation to the parties and
the board within forty five (45) calendar days of initial appointment. If the
parties have not reached agreement within ten (10) days after receipt of the
fact finder's report, the board shall publish the report.
      4.   The cost for the mediator or the fact finder shall be borne equally
by the parties to the impasse. (Ord. 279 § 15, 1996)
2.20.160: EMPLOYERS; PROHIBITED PRACTICES:

   C.   During the negotiation process, including the impasse procedure,

employees are prohibited from disclosing to village elected officials and
management employees any information, bargaining strategy, term(s) or issue(s)
which is the subject of negotiations with employees of the bargaining unit
involved in negotiations and employees of the exclusive representative, where
it would violate bargaining ground rules.

pursuant to this chapter, including those for appropriate temporary relief and
training orders. The court shall consider the request for enforcement on the
record made before the board. The court shall uphold the action of the board
and take appropriate action to enforce it unless the court concludes that the

placing them in a mailbox, on a doorknob, or otherwise on any property; coming
personally onto any property for the purposes set forth in this definition; and
calling the occupants of any property by telephone for the purposes set forth
in this definition. (Ord. 205 § 2, 1985)
5.16.030: PURPOSE:
The purpose of this chapter is to require identification of solicitors to
prevent fraud on the public and reduce the likelihood of burglars posing as
solicitors; to prohibit uninvited soliciting of residences by commercial
solicitors to prevent annoying intrusions of people's privacy; to regulate and
prohibit certain soliciting on sidewalks, streets and public grounds to avoid
traffic, safety and congestion problems; and to protect the health, safety and
welfare of the public. (Ord. 205 § 3, 1985)
5.16.040: DETERMINATION OF COMMERCIAL AND NONCOMMERCIAL ACTIVITY:
No municipal official or employee shall have the power to determine whether
soliciting is commercial or noncommercial. Each person soliciting shall comply
with this chapter according to that person's own determination of whether their
soliciting is for commercial or noncommercial purposes. To contest such a
determination by a person, the municipality shall seek an appropriate
injunction from the district court, and shall permit the person to continue
soliciting until such district court order is issued, so long as that person
has otherwise complied with this chapter. (Ord. 205 § 4, 1985)
5.16.050: NO SOLICITING SIGNS:
Any person may place upon the entrance to any property a "No Soliciting" sign
which shall prohibit any person from soliciting the occupants of such property
for commercial or noncommercial purposes by any means except for telephone

"No Soliciting" sign has been placed shall constitute a separate offense. (Ord.
205 § 5, 1985)
5.16.060: COMMERCIAL SOLICITING OF RESIDENCES:
No person engaging in commercial solicitation shall solicit any residence
without having been first invited to do so by the owner or occupant of such

the distribution of handbills, advertisements or leaflets so long as no direct
communication with the owner or occupants of the residence is attempted. (Ord.
205 § 6, 1985)
5.16.070: COMMERCIAL SOLICITOR'S LICENSE AND REGISTRATION:
   A.   Each itinerant person engaging in commercial solicitation within the
municipality shall register with the clerk. The itinerant commercial solicitor
shall provide his or her name, the business represented, the nature and purpose
of the solicitation, the methods of solicitation to be used, the make, model
and license number of any automobile to be used in soliciting, and the dates
during which soliciting will occur. Upon registration the clerk shall issue a
numbered registration certificate to each itinerant solicitor and each
itinerant solicitor shall display that registration certificate to the person
solicited prior to soliciting any person.
   B.   The provisions of subsection A shall not apply to telephone solicitors.
All telephone solicitors shall be required to register with the clerk and may
do so by telephone or in person. Such registration shall include the name of
the telephone solicitor, the business the solicitor represents, the nature and
purpose of the solicitation, and the dates during which solicitation by
telephone will occur in the municipality. Upon registering the municipal clerk
shall inform the solicitor of the solicitor's registration number. No person
shall solicit by telephone unless first reciting that they have complied with
this chapter and reciting their registration number to the person being
solicited.
   C.   All itinerant commercial solicitors, except those engaging in
interstate commerce, shall be required to pay a twenty five dollar ($25.00)
license fee to the municipality for the privilege of soliciting within the
municipality. The fee shall be collected by the municipal clerk who shall issue
the license to the commercial solicitor upon payment of the fee. Such a license
shall be valid for a period of ninety (90) days from its date of issuance.
Notwithstanding the holding of a valid license, a solicitor shall register each
time the solicitor begins a new set of solicitations in the municipality.
   D.   The burden shall be upon each commercial solicitor, who desires to be
exempt from the license fee due to engaging in interstate commerce, to provide
sufficient data to the municipal clerk to prove that they are engaged in
interstate commerce. In the event that the municipal clerk refuses to issue an
exemption to a commercial solicitor, then the commercial solicitor shall be
entitled to a hearing before the municipal judge within forty eight (48) hours,
not including weekends or legal holidays, on the question of whether or not the
commercial solicitor is engaged in interstate commerce. In the event that such
a hearing is not held within such time limit, then the solicitor shall be
exempted from the license fee.
   E.   All nonitinerant solicitors shall carry proof of identification and
present such proof at the time of soliciting, but shall not be required to
register or obtain a license under this chapter. This chapter shall not affect
the authority of the municipality to require the nonitinerant solicitor to
register or obtain a license pursuant to any other municipal ordinance. (Ord.
205 § 7, 1985)
5.16.080: DRUMMER'S BOND:
All itinerant drummers shall post a five hundred dollar ($500.00) cash or
surety bond acceptable to the municipal clerk to secure their good faith
performance. Such bond shall be returned to the itinerant drummer upon proof
that the merchandise or service has been delivered or provided as promised and
so long as no person has lodged a good faith complaint against the drummer for
nonperformance or faulty performance. (Ord. 205 § 8, 1985)
5.16.090: NONCOMMERCIAL SOLICITING:
All persons soliciting for noncommercial purposes, including by telephone,
shall be required to give to the clerk their name, the organization for which
they are soliciting, and the make, color, and license number of any automobile
that they are using, if any. There is no requirement that such noncommercial
solicitors come personally to the clerk. It shall be sufficient to provide this
information by telephone. Each noncommercial solicitor shall indicate to each
person solicited that they have complied with this chapter prior to soliciting.
In the event that a noncommercial solicitor fails to comply with this chapter,
that person shall be required to physically appear before the clerk and present
proof of identification and authorization to solicit on behalf of whatever
organization the person is claiming to solicit for, or if soliciting by
telephone, to provide such information by telephone. Such information shall be
referred to the chief who shall verify it within twenty four (24) hours, not
including weekends and legal holidays. In the event verification cannot be
obtained within such time limits, then the solicitor shall be allowed to
solicit until such time as it is shown that the solicitor is not who they claim
to be or is not authorized to solicit on behalf of the organization the
solicitor claims to be soliciting for. In the event a solicitor is not who he
or she claims to be or solicits on behalf of an organization for which they
have no authority to solicit, that person shall be guilty of violating this
chapter. Each time a person is solicited under false pretenses shall constitute
a separate offense. (Ord. 205 § 9, 1985)
5.16.100: USE OF REGISTRATION AND LICENSE INFORMATION:
The clerk shall forward copies of all registration and license information to
the chief to aid the chief in investigating criminal complaints. (Ord. 205 §
10, 1985)
5.16.110: COMPLAINTS FROM THE PUBLIC:
Any member of the public who has reason to believe that this chapter is not
being complied with may contact the clerk, the mayor or the chief and set forth
such grounds. Upon receipt of such a complaint, the clerk and the mayor shall
forward the information to the chief who shall investigate the complaint and
take appropriate action pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. 205 § 11, 1985)
5.16.120: SOLICITING ON STREETS, SIDEWALKS AND PUBLIC GROUNDS:

8.28.010: AUTHORITY AND PURPOSE:
The board of trustees of the village of Hatch is authorized by statute, in
particular New Mexico Statutes Annotated 1978, section 4-37-4, to enact
ordinances to protect and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of
the residents of the village of Hatch. The purpose of this chapter is to
protect and maintain the natural environment and to reduce the negative health
effects caused by the creation of fugitive dust, more specifically "PM10",
which refers to a size of particulate matter within dust that has been
identified by the scientific and medical communities and by the federal
environmental protection agency ("EPA") as a significant health risk in high
concentrations in the air. This chapter is enacted consistent with the goals
and policies of the comprehensive plans for the village of Hatch, and as a part
of New Mexico environment department's natural events action plan (NEAP) for
the village of Hatch and the state of New Mexico. This chapter shall accomplish
the requirements of these documents by preventing, limiting, or mitigating the
effects of activities which create fugitive dust (which includes PM10s), or
have a tendency to make land more vulnerable to natural erosion forces that
create fugitive dust. The objective of this chapter is to ensure that all
surface disturbance activities use erosion control measures to mitigate visible
fugitive dust on an ongoing basis for the protection of the health and safety
of the residents of the village of Hatch. This chapter also attempts to ensure
that when natural events do occur, such as fugitive dust creation through high
winds, the contribution of human generated dust is limited in its negative
health and safety impacts. Emissions that are regulated by federal or state law
to require filtering or similar treatment prior to release into the air are not
considered "fugitive", and are not regulated by this chapter. (Ord. 352, 2009)
8.28.020: APPLICABILITY:
Under the conditions outlined below, the provisions of this chapter shall apply
to any human activity, operation and/or practices, or any condition caused by
human activity, which generates dust, causes water erosion, or makes the land
more vulnerable to erosion by natural erosion forces. In the development of
village land for public purposes, village policies shall be consistent with the
purposes of this chapter, and shall be conducted so as to minimize the creation
or aggravation of erosive forces. (Ord. 352, 2009)
8.28.030: INTERPRETATION AND CONFLICT:
Where this chapter imposes greater restrictions than those imposed by other
rules, regulations, agreements, or village ordinances or resolutions, the
provisions of this chapter shall be prevailing and controlling. Where two (2)
or more provisions of this code are conflicting, the most restrictive shall
apply. (Ord. 352, 2009)
8.28.040: SEVERABILITY:
If any section, paragraph, sentence, phrase or part hereof is declared
unconstitutional or invalid, the remaining portions shall apply. (Ord. 352,
2009)
8.28.050: APPEAL:
A determination that a property requires an erosion control plan (ECP) or
erosion mitigation plan (EMP), or that a proposed ECP or EMP is insufficient,
or both, shall be subject to administrative appeal to the village planning and
zoning commission, and then to the village board of trustees. A property owner
wishing to appeal a determination shall request an appeal in writing, directed
to the village planning and zoning commission. (Ord. 352, 2009)
8.28.060: NEW DEVELOPMENT:
Any development that requires a permit under any village ordinance, other than
for construction of a single-family dwelling unit (multiple applications within
a subdivision shall not apply), shall require an erosion control plan to be
submitted consistent with section
8.28.100 of this chapter. Grading for all construction, including single-family
dwelling units shall be limited to the building pad site, pond and driveway
plus an additional five feet (5') in all directions of these areas. (Ord. 352,
2009)
8.28.070: EXISTING CONDITIONS:
The owner of any property that is determined to be in a condition vulnerable to
erosion by natural forces due to human development of the property may be
required to submit an erosion mitigation plan (EMP) if the condition of the
property is determined to pose a significant health threat due to the nature or
extent of the vulnerable condition of the property, or its location near
concentrations of vulnerable populations, such as school children, or ill or
elderly persons. (Ord. 352, 2009)
8.28.080: EXEMPT ACTIVITIES:
Although the village of Hatch encourages the use of reasonable erosion control
measures in all activities, the following activities are exempt from the
regulations and restrictions of this chapter:
   A.   Regular agricultural operations covered by the right to farm act, New
Mexico Statutes Annotated 1978, sections 47-9-1 through 47-9-7 (1991),
including cultivating, tilling, growing, and harvesting crops, and the raising
of farm animals or fowl.
   B.   Governmental activities during life threatening situations or other
emergencies or in connection with any officially declared disaster or state of
emergency.

village's public water supply system contain less than or cannot sustain fifty
percent (50%) of capacity, the village board of trustees shall have the
authority to impose stage 1 water rationing. The following requirements shall
be in effect:
            (1)   The village shall make public announcements through the local

is imposed.
         b.   Stage 2 Water Rationing: Whenever the storage facilities for the
village's public water supply system contains less than or cannot sustain
twenty five percent (25%) of capacity, and the village board of trustees finds
that the village is in a state of emergency, the following measures are
necessary to protect the health and welfare of the citizens: The village board
of trustees shall have the authority to impose stage 2 water rationing. The

to any swimming pool.
            (6)   It shall be the policy of the village to keep stage 2 in
effect for a period no longer than absolutely necessary. The village board of
trustees shall consider lifting stage 2 restrictions as soon as lifting the
restrictions will not endanger the water supply by reducing amounts of water in
storage.
      4.   No person shall be convicted of violating this section unless such
person in fact turned on water, directed the turning on of water, or kept water
turned on after learning it was turned on in violation of this section, or

   C.   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the applicant understands
that should there ever be a shortage of water within the village water system,

13.08.040: REQUIRED CONNECTIONS:
The Board of Trustees has caused a survey to be made of sanitary conditions
within the Village, including the geological aspects in relation to industrial,
business and residential establishments as the same affect the health and
welfare of the inhabitants of the village, and has determined that it is
necessary for the protection of the public health and for sanitary purposes
that owners of inhabited property within the village be required to connect
their industrial, business and residential establishments or other inhabited
property to the sewer system and to cease to use all other methods of sewage
disposal, and the board does so require; provided only, that each such
establishment or other inhabited property is within one hundred fifty feet
(150') of the nearest sewer service line and is capable of being served by and
through the village's sewer system at the established rates. In the event any
owner of such inhabited property fails or refuses to make such a connection
upon being requested to do so by the village officials, the village may take
such lawful action as may be necessary or desirable to effect such connection.
Any owner of such inhabited property shall be compelled so to connect the
property. Upon a failure so to connect within sixty (60) days after written
notice to do so transmitted by registered first class mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to each last known owner at his last known address according to the
records of the village and the real property assessment roll in the county in
which the property is located, the board shall cause such connection to be made
and a lien to be filed against the property for the expense in making such
connection. (Ord. 177 § 4, 1976)
13.08.050: SEPARATE CONNECTIONS:
Every separate structure must have a separate connection to the sewer system.
Exceptions from this requirement will only be made after written application to

to each and all of the following:
   A.   The two (2) structures to be connected by a single connection to the
sewer are owned by the same applicant;
   B.   The buildings or structures are so located that each does not have
substantial frontage along the sewer line, but instead one building is so
behind the other, making it unlikely that the buildings will ever pass into
separate ownership;
   C.   The applicant agrees that if the buildings ever pass into separate
ownership, the applicant will pay for the cost of a second connection and grant
all necessary easements therefor;
   D.   The applicant will cause to be paid a full connection fee for each such
separate structure prior to the issuance of a connection permit. (Ord. 177 § 5,
1976)
13.08.060: COSTS OF CONNECTION:
Connection to the sewer system shall only be made after the payment of the
connection fee and issuance of a permit to do so, to any owner of the property
to be connected, by the clerk of the village, upon approval of the board, the
cost of connection to be defrayed by such owner, including, but not limited to,
the cost of installing a stub or service line from the lateral line to the
property connected. (Ord. 177 § 6, 1976)
13.08.070: OWNER'S RESPONSIBILITY FOR INSTALLATION:
The responsibility for installing the sewer service line from the municipal
sewer lateral to the property connected shall be the responsibility of the
owner and shall be done in accordance with the following conditions:
   A.   All sewer lines installed by the owner must be inspected by the
village's representative before connection into the village lines is made. It
is the responsibility of the owner to first obtain a connection permit and
thereafter to notify the village when the service line is ready for inspection,
such notice to be given at least twenty four (24) hours prior to the
inspection. Any line backfilled without an inspection will not be accepted for
service.
   B.   All pipe and fittings must be laid on undisturbed solid ground, or on a
sand or clean gravel fill. Pipe shall be four inches (4") in diameter or
greater, as required by the village.
   C.   All service lines must be either soil pipe, cast iron pipe, asbestos
cement pipe, VCP or PVC with rubber gaskets. The asbestos cement pipe shall not
be used in lengths in excess of five feet (5').
   D.   Cleanouts shall be installed by the owner on his property at every
ninety foot (90') interval of line and at each bend or direction change of
thirty degrees (30°) or more, extending into the property. Additional cleanouts
may be required for larger than four inch (4") sewer service lines. Cleanouts
shall consist of a standard combination Y and one-eighth (1/8) bend with
standard riser and a four inch (4") brass cleanout plug. Cleanouts set out on a
slope must be braced with timber.
   E.   Cement or concrete mortar or lead joints will not be permitted for
jointing of any pipe, nor will the village permit encasing of the pipe or
fittings with concrete, but all joints must be installed with rubber gaskets.

15.16.010: STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION:
The legislature of the state of New Mexico has in statutes amended 1978,
section 3-18-7, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to
adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the village of
Hatch in Dona Ana County, New Mexico, does ordain as follows. (Ord. 380, 2016)
15.16.020: FINDINGS OF FACT:
   A.   The flood hazard areas of the village of Hatch are subject to periodic
inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely
affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
   B.   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous
to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, floodproofed or
otherwise protected from flood damage. (Ord. 380, 2016)
15.16.030: STATEMENT OF PURPOSE:
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   A.   Protect human life and health;
   B.   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
   C.   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   D.   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   E.   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
   F.   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood
blight areas; and
   G.   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area. (Ord. 380, 2016)
15.16.040: METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES:
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods:
   A.   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   B.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   C.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;
   D.   Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may
increase flood damage;
   E.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands. (Ord. 380, 2016)

NEW CONSTRUCTION: For the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures
for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes
any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management
purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or

basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
STRUCTURE: For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as
well as a manufactured home.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the
cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
(50%) of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of
the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred
"substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term
does not, however, include either: a) any project for improvement of a
structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or
safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code
enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or b) any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
VARIANCE: A grant of relief by a community from the terms of a floodplain
management regulation. (For full requirements see section 60.6 of the national
flood insurance program regulations.)
VIOLATION: The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure
or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications,
or other evidence of compliance required in section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)
(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until
such time as that documentation is provided.
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the national geodetic
vertical datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of
various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine
areas. (Ord. 380, 2016)

render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
   B.   The appeal board shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
   C.   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the appeal board may
appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction.
   D.   The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the federal emergency

   E.   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or
the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   F.   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in subsection
15.16.150B of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one- half (1/2) acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
   G.   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this
chapter (see section
 15.16.030 of this chapter).
   H.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   I.   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   J.   The prerequisites for granting variances are:
      1.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      2.   Variances shall only be issued upon: a) showing a good and
sufficient cause; b) a determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and c) a determination that
the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
      3.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   K.   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that: 1) the criteria outlined in
subsections A through I of this section are met, and 2) the structure or other
development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threats to public safety. (Ord. 380, 2016)

water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding;
   E.   All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
   F.   New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system and discharge
from the systems into floodwaters; and
   G.   On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to
them or contamination from them during flooding. (Ord. 380, 2016)

hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer
or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and
plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of
construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined
in this subsection. A record of such certification which includes the specific
elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are
floodproofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator.
   C.   Enclosures: New construction and substantial improvements, with fully
enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which
are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria:
      1.   A minimum of two (2) openings on separate walls having a total net
area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided.

      2.   Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially
improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites: a)
outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, b) in a new manufactured
home park or subdivision, c) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision, or d) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a
flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be
securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.

the minimum standard size required by the village, shall not require a plat of
said resubdivision provided that a certificate of survey setting forth the
legal description of tracts resulting from such resubdivision shall be filed
with the commission, the county clerk and the county assessor of Dona Ana
County and such filing shall be considered as a rededication of said described
lots in all respects. The plat shall refer to permanent monuments and shall

dimensions and the dimensions of all land dedicated for public use or for use
of the owners of lots fronting or adjacent to the land. Description of the lots
by number and plat designation are valid in conveyances and for the purpose of
taxation. (Ord. 319 § 9, 2003)
16.04.110: MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS; HARDSHIP:
   A.   Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision it can be shown
that strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography, or
other nonself-inflicted condition, or that these requirements would result in
inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of this chapter, the commission
may recommend to the governing body to vary, modify, or waive the requirements
so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured;
provided that such variance, modification, or waiver will not have the effect
of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter or any utility regulations
or other requirements of the village or interfere with carrying out the
comprehensive plan.
   B.   Application for any variance or modification shall be submitted in
writing by the subdivider at the time the preliminary plat is filed and shall
state fully the grounds for the application and the facts relied upon by the
subdivider. The commission shall give its written recommendation thereon at the
time of its approval or disapproval of said preliminary plat.
   C.   In no case shall any variation or modification be contrary to the
mandatory requirements of state law, nor be more than a minimum easing of the
requirements.
   D.   In granting variances and modifications, the commission may recommend
such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the objective of
the requirements so varied or modified. In all cases the decision of the
governing body shall be final. (Ord. 319 § 10, 2003)
16.04.120: ALTERNATE SUMMARY PROCEDURE:
The village clerk, upon recommendation of the commission, is hereby authorized
to approve and sign certain subdivision plats as follows:
   A.   Subdivision of not more than two (2) parcels of land; or
   B.   Resolution, where the combination or recombination of portions of
previously platted lots does not increase the total number of lots; or
   C.   Subdivisions of two (2) or more parcels of land in areas zoned for
industrial use. Any subdivision approved and authorized in this section shall
be in substantial conformity with this chapter. Approval by this summary
procedure shall be endorsed on the plat or on the instrument of conveyance in
lieu of a plat and such approval shall be conclusive evidence of approval by
the commission. (Ord. 319 § 11, 2003)
16.04.130: APPROVAL NECESSARY FOR UTILITY SERVICE:
Until a final plat has been approved by the governing body, any official of the
village or public utility company who shall serve or connect the land within
the subdivision with any public utility such as water, sewer, electric or gas
is guilty of a misdemeanor. (Ord. 319 § 12, 2003)
16.04.140: PENALTIES:
Whoever being the owner, or agent of the owner, of any land located in the
village or within the extraterritorial limits of the village, transfers, sells,
or agrees to sell or negotiate to sell such land by reference to any exhibition
of or by use of a plat or subdivision of such land before such plat has been
approved as herein provided for in this chapter and recorded in the office of
the Dona Ana County clerk, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. Upon
conviction, he shall forfeit and pay a penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00)
for each lot transferred or sold, or agreed, or negotiated to be sold. The
village, through its attorney or other designated official, may enjoin such
transfer or sale or agreement by action for injunction or may recover the
penalty by civil action. (Ord. 319 § 13, 2003)

17.44.010: PURPOSE:
This chapter is intended to limit the enlargement, the reestablishment after
abandonment, and alteration or restoration after destruction of legal
nonconforming uses or structures, including mobile homes. While permitting the
use and maintenance of existing legal nonconforming uses and structures, this
chapter limits the number and extent of such uses and structures by prohibiting
their being moved, altered, replaced or enlarged in a manner that would
increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and the standards
prescribed in this title and by prohibiting their restoration after
destruction. (Ord. 285 § 5, 1997: Ord. 256 art. III § 7A, 1993)
17.44.020: DATE WHEN USE OR STRUCTURES BECOME LEGALLY NONCONFORMING:
Any structure or use which meets existing codes and standards becomes legally
nonconforming whenever a change in zone boundaries or a change in regulation
for the zone in which it is located takes effect, which change makes the
previously legally conforming use a nonconforming use. A use or structure
located on a property which conformed to an existing zoning law when commenced
or constructed, but which becomes nonconforming due to a subsequent change in
zoning classification or zoning laws shall be deemed to be legally
nonconforming, and may be continued except as otherwise provided in this title.
(Ord. 256 art. III § 7B, 1993)
17.44.030: DISCONTINUATION OF NONCONFORMING USES:
Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued or changed to a conforming
use for a continuous period of one hundred twenty (120) calendar days or more,
the nonconforming use shall not be reestablished. The use of the structure or
site shall thereafter be in conformity with the regulations for the zone in
which it is located. Discontinuation shall include cessation of a use
regardless of the intent to resume the use unless the governing body is
notified in writing of the intent to resume the use and is provided with a
schedule for resumption of the use within one week of its discontinuance and
the governing body has approved in writing a schedule for resumption of said
use. (Ord. 256 art. III § 7C, 1993)
17.44.040: CONTINUATION AND MAINTENANCE:
   A.   A use lawfully occupying a structure or a site that does not conform to
the performance standards for the zone in which the use is located shall be
deemed to be a nonconforming use and may be continued except as otherwise
provided in this chapter.
   B.   A structure, lawfully occupying a site, that does not conform with the
performance standards for front yard, side yard, rear yard, height, coverage or
distances between structures, for the zone in which the structure is located,
shall be deemed a nonconforming structure and may be maintained, except as
otherwise provided in this chapter.
   C.   Routine maintenance and repairs may be performed on a structure or
site, the use of which is nonconforming and on a nonconforming structure. (Ord.
256 art. III § 7D, 1993)
17.44.050: ALTERATIONS AND ADDITIONS TO LEGAL NONCONFORMING USES AND
STRUCTURES:
   A.   No structure, the use of which is legally nonconforming, shall be
moved, altered or enlarged unless required by law, or unless the moving,
alteration or enlargement will result in the elimination of the nonconformity,
except as permitted in this chapter.
   B.   No legal nonconforming use shall be enlarged or extended in such a way
as to occupy any part of the structure or site or another structure or site
which it did not occupy at the time it became a legal nonconforming use, or in
such a way as to displace any conforming use occupying a structure or site,
except as permitted in this chapter.
   C.   No legal nonconforming structure shall be altered, replaced or
reconstructed in any manner which increases the discrepancy between the use and
the standards of the zone in which the use is located including building
habitability rating and the property development standards for front yard, side
yards and rear yard, height of structures, or unusable open space prescribed in
the zone in which the structure is located. No legal nonconforming structure
shall be moved or enlarged unless the new location or enlargement shall conform
to the property development standards for the zone in which it is located.
(Ord. 256 art. III § 7E, 1993)
17.44.060: RESTORATION OF A DAMAGED STRUCTURE:
   A.   Whenever a structure which does not comply with the property
development standards for front yard, side yards, rear yard, height of
structures, or distances prescribed in the zone in which the structure is
located, or the use of which does not conform with the performance standards
for the zone in which it is located, is destroyed by fire or other calamity, by
act of God, or by public enemy to the extent of fifty percent (50%) or less,
the structure may be restored and the nonconforming use resumed, provided that
restoration is started within one year and diligently pursued to completion.
When the destruction exceeds fifty percent or the structure is voluntarily
razed or is required by law to be razed, the structure shall not be restored
except in full conformity with the property development standards for the zone
in which it is located and the nonconforming use shall not be resumed.
   B.   The extent of damage or partial destruction shall be based upon the
ratio of the estimated cost of restoring the structure to its condition prior
to such damage or partial destruction to the estimated cost of duplicating the
entire structure as it existed prior to the damage. Estimates for this purpose
shall be made by or shall be reviewed and approved by the governing body and
shall be based on the minimum cost of construction in compliance with the
building code. (Ord. 256 art. III § 7F, 1993)
