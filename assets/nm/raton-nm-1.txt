supplement to the code shall include all substantive parts of permanent and
general ordinances passed by the City Commission during the period covered by
the supplement and all changes made thereby in the code. The pages of a
supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the code and

obsolete, and the new pages shall be so prepared that, when they have been
inserted, the code will be current through the date of the adoption of the
latest ordinance included in the supplement.
   (B)   In preparing a supplement to this code, all portions of the code which
have been replaced shall be excluded from the code by the omission thereof from

   (C)   When preparing a supplement to this code, the codifier (meaning the
person, agency, or organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make
formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts of ordinances included
in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to embody them into a
unified code. For example, the codifier may:
      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions;
      (2)   Provide appropriate catch lines, headings, and titles for sections
and other subdivisions of the code printed in the supplement, and make changes
in the catch lines, headings, and titles;
      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be
inserted in the code and, where necessary to accommodate new material, change
existing section or other division numbers;
      (4)   Change the words “this ordinance” or words of the same meaning to
“this chapter,” “this subchapter,” “this division,” and the like, as the case
may be, or to “§§ ___ to ___” (inserting section numbers to indicate the
sections of the code which embody the substantive sections of the ordinance
incorporated into the code); and/or
      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the
original meaning of ordinance sections or the alphabetical arrangement of new
chapters inserted into the code; but in no case shall the codifier make any
change in the meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the
supplement or already embodied in the code.
(1981 Code, § 1-8)
§ 10.20 ALTERING CODE.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to change or amend, by additions or

portions thereof, or to alter or tamper with the code in any manner whatsoever
which will cause the law of the city to be misrepresented thereby; provided
that supplementation of this code by authorized persons shall be permitted.
(1981 Code, § 1-9)
Penalty, see § 10.99

enforcing any provision of this code, including the performing of any act upon
the premises required or authorized by this code, the serving of any order,
notice, or other process upon the owner of the premises or any other person
located thereon, or the exercise of any duty, obligation, or responsibility
arising under this code which can be accomplished only on the premises.

§ 10.22 JUDICIAL INVALIDATION OF PROVISION.
   (A)   It is the intent of the City Commission to include in this
codification only the provisions includable herein according to law. Any
judicial decision, ruling, or holding of any court of competent jurisdiction
invalidating any provision of this code, which originated from an ordinance
existing at the time of the adoption of this code, because of its inclusion in
this code, shall not affect the validity of the ordinance from which it
originated, it being the intent of the City Commission that any ordinance shall
continue in full force and effect in its form as of immediately prior to the
adoption of this code as though it had not been included herein.
   (B)   The invalidation by any court of competent jurisdiction of any
provision of this code, which originated from an ordinance existing at the time
of the adoption of this code, because of the inclusion of the provision of this

      (2)   An eligible applicant is outstandingly qualified and his or her
expertise, education, achievement, experience, and ability are obviously far

which the overtime was worked.
      (2)   Employees working in divisions (F)(1)(a) and (F)(1)(b) above will
not be compensated for overtime worked on the employee’s own initiative or
overtime not officially approved in advance.

off, unless no regular employee can meet the minimum qualifications of the
position, or refuses the assignment.
      (3)   Regular employees laid off shall have priority rights, in reverse
order of layoff, to vacant positions with the same or lower salary for which
they meet the minimum requirements of the class specification. The above

is, concerning matters having taken place no later than 5 calendar days prior
to filing of the GRIEVANCE.
   (B)   Employee performance evaluations, transfers, and layoffs are not
appealable to the Board.
   (C)   In processing a grievance, the following procedure shall apply.
      (1)   Informal resolution. An aggrieved employee shall contact either

grievance and state his or her reasons for objecting to the action taken. The
parties involved shall recognize that the grievances should be settled promptly
and as close to their source as possible. Both parties should present all facts
relating to the grievance at this step in order that an equitable solution may
be achieved.
      (2)   Formal grievance.
         (a)   Step 1. If the grievance is not resolved by informal resolution,

effort.
         (b)   Step 2. If the grievance is not resolved in Step 1, the
aggrieved employee may file the grievance with the City Manager within 5
calendar days following the Step 1 decision. At this point, all grievances must
be reduced to writing and signed by the complainant before submitting to the
City Manager. At this point, all facts regarding the discussion in Step 1
should be presented. Also, the person charged should present his or her facts
in writing. Within 5 calendar days following receipt of the grievance, the City

Refusal to testify is grounds for disciplinary action. The Board will not
consider any charges against a grievant except those which were specifically
delineated in the notice of final decision per division (C)(2)(b) above.

(1981 Code, § 20-26) (Ord. 823, passed 1-22-1991)
§ 33.24 LEAVE.
   (A)   Annual leave.
      (1)   (a)   Supervisory and professional employees.
 
Years of Service  Leave Accrual Per Month
Up to 5 years     10 hours
5 to 10 years     12 hours
10 to 20 years    14 hours
20 years and over 15 hours
 
         (b)   Non-supervisors.
 
Years of Service  Leave Accrual Per Month
Up to 5 years     9 hours
5 to 10 years     11 hours
10 years and over 13 hours
 
      (2)   Annual leave shall not be earned while on injury leave or leave
without pay. Annual leave with pay shall, when requested, be granted for
sickness when all accrued sick leave has been exhausted. Except in case of
emergency, all applications for annual leave will be initiated by the employee
in advance on the leave form prescribed by the City Manager.
         (a)   A maximum of 2-years’ accrual of annual leave may be carried
forward into the beginning of the 12-month period following the employee’s
anniversary date (month of initial employment by the city). If an employee has
accrued 2 years of leave, and earns additional leave, the additional leave
earned must be used during the year that it was earned or it will be lost. Any
unused leave in excess of 2-years’ accrual will be lost on the employee’s
anniversary date. Upon termination, an employee will be compensated for accrued
annual leave as of the date of termination, up to a maximum of 2-years’
accrual.
         (b)   Employees should check with the City Manager’s office
periodically in order to be aware of the status of their accrued leave.
   (B)   Sick leave. Eight hours of sick leave shall be accrued for each
complete calendar month of service. Maximum accrual of sick leave will be 40
work shifts. Accrued sick leave is lost upon termination, and not to be
restored upon reinstatement, except where the reinstatement is the result of a
reversal of a dismissal action. Sick leave accrued in excess of 40 work days
may be cashed in at the ratio of 1 hour’s pay for 2 hours of sick leave. The
computation and payment to be made on or about the first day of December each
year. Upon retirement, supervisory and unclassified personnel may convert 100%
of unused sick leave to early retirement and nonsupervisory personnel may
convert 60% of unused sick leave.
      (1)   Sick leave is for use when an employee is incapacitated to do his
or her job, or for related reasons, such as:
         (a)   Exposure to a contagious disease that would endanger the health
of coworkers;
         (b)   Presence of contagious disease in an employee’s immediate family
which requires his or her personal care;
         (c)   Dental, optical, or medical examination or treatment;
         (d)   Sick leave may be granted when emergency circumstances require
the presence of an employee in the home, hospital, or doctor’s office because
of an illness in the employee’s immediate family. Immediate family as used is
defined as employee’s spouse or children. A doctor’s statement specifying the
circumstances will be required; and/or
         (e)   The City Manager may authorize sick leave up to 3 days, or for
extenuating circumstances an additional maximum of 2 days, to attend the
funeral of a member of the employee’s immediate family (wife, husband,
children, stepchildren, guardian, brother, sister, parent, stepparent, mother-
in-law, father-in-law, or any member of the immediate family living in the
household).
      (2)   The employee who becomes ill is responsible for notifying his or
her supervisor as soon as practicable and upon return will complete the
appropriate sick leave form. Leave for prearranged medical, dental, or optical
examination or treatment should always be applied for and approved in advance.
      (3)   Supervisors are responsible for the proper administration of sick
leave. Accordingly, they have the responsibility to ensure that sick leave is
not abused. A supervisor may require any employee to furnish a certificate from
a physician for any sick leave taken. However, supervisors should not use this
authority to harass employees, but rather only in cases of lengthy sick leave
where the employee is obviously under a physician’s care or when the supervisor
has adequate reasons to believe the employee has misused sick leave. In
instances where an employee is on sick leave in excess of 3 days during any 1
pay period, or a pattern of sick leave absences immediately before or after
weekends and holidays develops, a certificate from the attending physician may
be required.
      (4)   Sick leave shall not be accrued when an employee is on leave
without pay or injury leave.
   (C)   Leave without pay. Leave without pay may be granted under the
following conditions.
      (1)   The City Manager may approve leave without pay upon the written
request of the employee and recommendation of the appointing authority for a
period not more than 30 consecutive calendar days in the case of a probationary
employee, or 12 consecutive months in the case of a nonprobationary employee.
Either period may be extended when the extension is approved by the appointing
authority and the City Manager. Leave without pay, when requested by an
employee, may be granted only when the appointing authority can assure a
position of like status and pay at the same location.
      (2)   Leave without pay may be used to cover periods of unauthorized
absence, maternity leave, parental leave, authorized absence, or when an
employee is incapacitated, but does not have any accrued annual or sick leave.
      (3)   If an employee is granted leave without pay for a period in excess
of 30 calendar days, only 30 calendar days will be credited toward eligibility
for a salary increase or nonprobationary status. During the total period of
leave without pay, neither annual nor sick leave shall be accrued. Any holidays
accrued while an employee is on leave without pay will not be paid.
      (4)   Failure on the part of an employee to report for work upon the
expiration of approved leave without pay shall be considered a voluntary
resignation.
   (D)   Military leave with pay. Any full-time employee who is a member of the
National Guard or Air National Guard of New Mexico, or any organized reserve
unit of the armed forces of the United States, shall, if placed on active duty,
be granted paid military leave for a period not to exceed 15 working days per
calendar year, in addition to other authorized paid leave. A full-time
employee, who is a member of an unorganized reserve component, shall be granted
military leave with pay not to exceed 15 working days per calendar year for the
purpose of attending organized courses of instruction or training periods
officially authorized for members of the components. In all cases when military
leave with pay is granted, the city office is required to maintain a copy of
the official orders in the employee’s personnel folder. If an employee is
called to active military duty in an emergency by the President of the United
States or the Governor, the time spent on active duty, not to exceed 5
additional working days within a 12-month period, shall be authorized. Absence
which is not chargeable to military leave can be charged to annual leave.
Therefore, employees who are called to duty for a period beyond the 15-day
period chargeable to military leave can use annual leave or leave without pay
for the excess period. Temporary or part-time employees are not entitled to
military leave with pay under this provision.
   (E)   Re-employment upon return from military leave. An employee returning
from military obligation shall be re-employed in the position held by the
employee before military service or to a position similar in pay. The employee
will maintain his or her seniority status upon re-employment. Annual and sick
leave accrued prior to the employee’
   (F)   Court and jury leave.
      (1)   When, in obedience to a subpoena or following the discretion of his
or her appointing authority, an employee appears as a juror or is a witness for
the federal government, the State of New Mexico, or a political subdivision
thereof, in official capacity, he or she shall be entitled to a court or jury
leave with pay for the period required. Fees received as a witness or
compensation for jury, not including reimbursement for transportation, shall be
paid to the city. Attendance in court or at an official hearing in connection
with an employee’s official duties, and the time required in going and
returning, shall not be considered as absence from duty.
      (2)   If, in obedience to a subpoena, an employee appears as a witness in
a matter not related to his or her assigned duties, the appointing authority,
with the approval of the City Manager, may at his or her discretion:
         (a)   Consider the employee’s attendance as a witness and the time
spent coming and going as administrative leave, if the activity on the part of
an employee is clearly a civic duty, and if the employee receives no
remuneration for his or her appearance and travel, or if remuneration is
received and the employee agrees to pay it to the city; or
         (b)   Allow annual leave or leave without pay if the conditions in
division (F)(2)(a) above are not met.
   (G)   Administrative leave. Appointing authorities may authorize the paid
absence of an employee under unusual circumstances when it is in the interest
of the city to do so. Administrative leave shall not exceed 3 consecutive days
without the approval of the City Manager. Examples of the uses of
administrative leave are: participation by an employee in community activities;
early departure from work because of hazardous road conditions; or treatment of
an injury received on the job. However, the City Manager should establish
adequate controls to ensure that this regulation is equitably administered in
the best interest of the city.

§ 33.27 STRIKES.
   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definition shall apply

      STRIKE. When an employee of the city, in concerted action with others,
for the purpose of inducing, influencing, or coercing a change in the

§ 33.28 RESERVED.
§ 33.29 DRUGS IN THE WORKPLACE.
   (A)   Findings. In addition to the requirements of the Drug Free Work Place
Act of 1988, the city has a compelling obligation to protect the lives of its
citizens and provide a safe, efficient working environment for its employees.
Because a single drug-related lapse by any covered employee could have
irreversible and calamitous consequences, the interest of public safety
outweighs any perceived intrusion on a covered employee’s right to privacy. The
Fourth Amendment provides: “The right of the people to be secure in their
persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures
shall not be violated.” Any drug test is acknowledged to constitute a search,
and therefore must be completely justified and necessary to be deemed
reasonable under the Fourth Amendment. The interest of individuals subjected to
a drug test shall be balanced against the right of the city to a drug free work
place.
   (B)   General. The primary objective of this drug testing program shall be
ensuring that public safety is not endangered as a result of city employees
under the influence of drugs or alcohol on the job. This policy is intended to
reflect a high degree of concern for employee privacy interest and is tailored
to assure minimal intrusion. The city recognizes its obligation to provide a
safe, healthful, and efficient working environment for its employees.
Furthermore, all city employees have an obligation to the citizens of Raton to
provide governmental services in the safest, most efficient, and most courteous
manner possible. The city recognizes that its ability to provide vital services
to the citizens of Raton depends upon the physical and psychological health and
well-being of all city employees. Being under the influence of drugs or alcohol
on the job, as well as the use of drugs or alcohol off the job, may severely
impair an employee’s ability to perform the job in a manner consistent with
obligations to the city, fellow employees, and the public. The possession, use,
transfer, distribution, or sale of illegal drugs and the use of alcohol during
working hours poses unacceptable risks to safe and efficient performance of job
duties, places both employees and city residents in danger, and undermines
public confidence in city government. The city hereby initiates an employee
referral program (E.R.P.) to obtain help for employees who seek counseling or
other assistance for problems with drug or alcohol use or other personal
problems.
   (C)   Definitions. For the purpose of this section, the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
      ALCOHOL OR DRUG USE PROBLEM. Use of drugs or alcohol by any city employee
whether on or off the job, to a degree that significantly impairs the
employee’s ability to safely and efficiently perform his or her job duties.
      CITY EMPLOYEE. Any person employed by the city, including the City
Manager and other supervisors, but excluding elected officials and individuals
who by statute or ordinance serve at the pleasure of elected officials.
      ILLEGAL DRUGS. Means:
         (a)   Any drug which is not legally obtainable;
         (b)   Any drug which is legally obtainable, but which has not been
legally obtained; or
         (c)   Any drug which has been legally obtained, but which is being
used for other than the purpose for which it was prescribed.
      LEGAL DRUGS. Prescribed drugs and over-the-counter drugs which are being
used for the purposes for which they were prescribed or manufactured.
      REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT AN EMPLOYEE HAS AN ALCOHOL OR DRUG USE PROBLEM.
Any objectively identifiable and unexplained deterioration in the quality or
quantity of an employee’s normal behavior or normal work performance. Objective
criteria include, but are not limited to, chronic tardiness, excessive
absenteeism, an excessive number of on-the-job accidents, disruptive conduct,
deterioration in productivity, deterioration in work quality, excessive health
problems, failure to meet work schedules, unexplained carelessness in personal
appearance or hygiene, and drastic mood swings.
      REASONABLE SUSPICION THAT AN EMPLOYEE IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF DRUGS OR
ALCOHOL. In the judgment of the employee’s supervisor, the employee exhibits 1
or more of the objective symptoms of being under the influence, enumerated in
this section below.
      UNDER THE INFLUENCE. The employee is affected by use of a drug or alcohol
in an objectively detectable manner. For purposes of this policy, objective
criteria include, but are not limited to, loss of physical coordination,
slurred speech, erratic behavior (e.g. unusual belligerence or excitability),
impaired judgment, or a detectable odor of alcohol on an employee’s breath. In
determining whether an employee’s behavior suggests that the employee is UNDER
THE INFLUENCE of drugs or alcohol, due consideration will be given to the
employee’s normal physical and mental characteristics. Any employee caught
using alcoholic beverages or illegal drugs during working hours will be
presumed to be UNDER THE INFLUENCE of drugs or alcohol irrespective of the
presence or absence of other symptoms of being UNDER THE INFLUENCE.
   (D)   General provisions.
      (1)   All city employees are prohibited from using or being under the
influence of alcohol or illegal drugs during working hours, and a confirmed
positive test indicating either substance will subject the employee to
disciplinary action up to and including termination.
      (2)   All city employees are prohibited from using or being under the
influence of legal drugs during working hours to the extent that the use of any
legal drug may affect the safe and efficient performance of the employee’s job
duties or may endanger the safety of coworkers or members of the public. A city
employee using a legal drug may be required by his or her supervisor to obtain
a letter from the employee’s physician indicating that the employee’s continued
presence on the job while using the legal drug does not pose a threat to the
employee’s safety or the safety of co-employees or members of the public. An
employee using a legal drug who is unable to safely and efficiently perform his
or her job may be required to take sick leave, vacation time, or a leave of
absence for the duration of the time the employee is using a legal drug.
      (3)   All city employees are prohibited from possessing, selling,
transferring, or purchasing illegal drugs during working hours, while on city
property or while operating city-owned vehicles or equipment. Any activity by
city employees involving possession, sale, transfer, or purchase of illegal
drugs will be reported to appropriate law enforcement officials.
      (4)   Any city employee who pleads no contest to, or is convicted of, a
criminal offense involving possession, sale, transfer, or purchase of illegal
drugs during working hours may be subject to disciplinary action up to and
including termination from employment.
      (5)   Any city employee who pleads no contest to, or is convicted of, a
criminal offense involving operating a motor vehicle under the influence of
drugs or alcohol during working hours may be subject to disciplinary action up
to and including termination from employment.
      (6)   The prohibition on consumption of alcohol on city property shall
not apply when the consumption is in connection with city-sponsored and
authorized events during nonworking hours.
      (7)   Refusal to submit to a drug or alcohol test, when the test is
required under this policy, shall be grounds for disciplinary action up to and
including termination from employment.
      (8)   An employee who tests positive for drug or alcohol use pursuant to
a test required by this policy shall be subject to disciplinary action up to
and including termination from employment.
   (E)   Employee referral program. The city will provide an employee referral
program (E.R.P.) to obtain help for employees who suffer from an alcohol or
drug use problem or other problems of a personal nature. It is the sole
responsibility of each employee to seek assistance from the E.R.P. before the
employee’s drug and alcohol use results in discipline or termination from
employment. Once an employee violates this policy, or tests positive for
illegal drugs or alcohol, the employee’s voluntary use of the E.R.P. shall not
necessarily reduce the severity of disciplinary action and may, in fact, have
no bearing on the determination of appropriate disciplinary action. The
employee’s decision to seek prior assistance from the E.R.P. shall not be used
as the basis for any disciplinary action and shall not be used against the
employee in any disciplinary proceeding. Furthermore, no information
voluntarily provided by the employee in seeking assistance from the E.R.P.
shall be used against the employee in any disciplinary proceeding. Nothing in
this policy, however, shall prohibit the use of any information obtained
outside of the E.R.P. in any disciplinary proceeding.
   (F)   Persons to be tested.
      (1)   All employees covered by a written collective bargaining agreement
where drug testing is addressed. Testing frequency and manner (periodic or
random) shall be performed per the agreement;
      (2)   All employees exhibiting symptoms reasonable suspicion that the
employee is under the influence of drugs or alcohol during working hours or has
an alcohol or drug use problem;
      (3)   All city job applicants which are offered a position involving
operation of city vehicles, heavy equipment, filter plant, sewer plant, Police
Department, Fire Department, and the position of City Manager. Any offer of
employment shall be expressly contingent upon the individual taking and passing
a drug screening test;
      (4)   Any employee caught using drugs or alcohol during working hours;
      (5)   Any employee who has sustained or caused another employee to
sustain a personal injury at work or has caused a work-related accident; and
      (6)   Random testing will be done for a 2-year period following the
completion of a rehabilitation program by all employees which have tested
positive for drugs or alcohol during working hours.
   (G)   Testing procedure.
      (1)   This procedure shall strike a balance between individual privacy
and maintaining the integrity of the drug testing program.
      (2)   Prior to any existing employee being given a drug test, the
supervisor shall submit their evidence for review by the City Manager. The City
Manager shall make final determination as to whether a drug test is warranted
based on the evidence.
      (3)   Prior to the drug test, the employee shall be allowed to offer
explanation for their behavior or why they may test positive for drugs.
      (4)   Blood alcohol testing shall be done using a certified intoxilizer
in the privacy of the Raton Police Department.
      (5)   For urinalysis testing, the employee shall remove unnecessary outer
garments such as coats which might conceal items which could be used to tamper
with the urine sample. The employee shall wash and dry hands prior to producing
the urine sample. The sample shall be produced in the privacy of a stall after
toilet water bluing agents have been placed in the toilet basin and tank. The
person overseeing the urine sample production shall stand outside the stall and
verify the sample contains at least 60 millimeters of urine and the sample
temperature is within the proper range. The initial sample testing shall be an
enzyme multiplied immunossary technique (E.M.I.T. test) or equal, and all
positive tests shall be confirmed by a test equal to or exceeding accuracy of
the gas chromatography/mas spectrometry (G.C.M.S. test). Proper chain of
custody shall be maintained and documented prior to shipment of the sample to
the laboratory to ensure that no tampering occurs. Preferably the sample shall
be packaged and shipped in the presence of the employee which produced the
urine sample.
   (H)   Discipline. All discipline shall be conducted with due process in
accordance with the discipline section of this personnel policy. Employees
refusing to submit to drug testing when requested shall be deemed as having
tested positive. Employees refusing to test shall be allowed up to 90 days’
leave without pay to complete a drug rehabilitation program of their choice at
their own expense. Refusal to test or enter a rehabilitation program shall
result in termination. Employees testing positive .04 or higher blood alcohol
shall be suspended for 5 working days and encouraged to consider a
rehabilitation program. Any trace of illegal drugs in the urine sample shall
result in a 30 days’ suspension and up to 90 days without pay to participate in
a rehabilitation program of the employee’s choice at their own expense.
Employees with at least 1 confirmed positive test and/or those completing a
rehabilitation program shall be subject to random testing for 2 years following
the initial positive test. A second confirmed positive test during this period
shall result in termination.
   (I)   Conflicts with existing policies. In case of any conflict with present
or future internal drug and alcohol regulations in the Raton Police Department
or Raton Fire Department, the stricter of the 2 drug policies shall govern.

§ 33.30 SEXUAL HARASSMENT.
   (A)   It is illegal and against the policy of the city for any employee,
male or female, to harass another worker by:
      (1)   Making unwelcome sexual advances or favors or other verbal or
physical conduct of a sexual nature a condition of any employee’s employment,
disciplinary action, or performance evaluation;
      (2)   Using an employee’s submission to or rejection of the conduct as
the basis for or as a factor in any employment decision affecting the
individual; or
      (3)   Otherwise creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working
environment by the conduct.
   (B)   The creation of an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working
environment may include by way of an example, but not by way of limitation, the
actions as persistent comments on an employee’s sexual preferences or the
display of obscene or sexually-oriented photographs or drawings. The City
Manager shall determine whether the conduct constitutes sexual harassment,
based on a review of the facts and circumstances of each situation. The city
will not condone any sexual harassment of its employees. All employees,
including supervisors and managers, will be subject to severe discipline, up to
and including dismissal, for any act of sexual harassment they commit or the
filing of false sexual harassment allegations. Employees who feel victimized by
sexual harassment should report the harassment to their supervisor immediately.
If the employee’s immediate supervisor is the source of the alleged harassment,
the employee should report the problem to the supervisor’s superior or to the
City Manager. Supervisors and managers who receive a sexual harassment
complaint must promptly and carefully investigate the matter, questioning all
employees who may have knowledge of either the incident in question or similar
problems. Both the complaint and investigative steps and findings should be
documented as thoroughly and promptly as possible. Employees who are
dissatisfied with the investigating supervisor’s resolution of a sexual
harassment complaint may file a complaint with the City Manager. No employee
will be subject to any form of retaliation or discipline for pursuing a valid
sexual harassment complaint. In addition to the internal reporting procedures
within the city government, employees who have been subjected to sexual
harassment may report the incidents to the Human Rights Commission of the State
of New Mexico, Santa Fe, New Mexico, or the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission.

§ 51.01 METHODS OF INITIATING IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.
   Improvement projects in the city can be initiated in any 1 of the following
3 methods:
   (A)   At the request of the persons owning the property to be served;
   (B)   By the findings of the City Commission that the improvement is in the
best interests of the city; or
   (C)   Pursuant to the requirement of any federal or state law as to the
necessity to maintain and improve systems for the benefit of the entire
community and provide for the safety, health, and well- being of its residents.
(1981 Code, § 23-1) (Ord. 615, passed 4-30-1973)
§ 51.02 METHODS OF FINANCING IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.
   (A)   Pursuant to the necessity of determining a basis or formula of the
actual cost to the city of an improvement project and subsequently to the
respective property owners benefitted thereby, and the need to assess the
various property owners according to this chapter for improvements to streets,
public grounds, water systems, sewers, sidewalks, and the costs thereof, the
following methods of financing improvement projects are hereby authorized.
      (1)   One manner in which improvement projects can be accomplished is by
private contract by the person or persons owning all of the property to be
served, subject to the City Engineer’s approval as to construction and
conformity. This method would require an engineering fee to be charged to the
respective owners, and an assessment lien therefor in the amount of 5% of the
actual cost. The City Engineer shall design, inspect, and approve the actual
construction project. By this method, financing of any type or nature shall not
be provided by the city or any of its departments, excepting the engineering
fee, which shall be assessed and paid upon completion of the project.
      (2)   Another manner for construction of improvements projects is by the
joint requests of the property owners being served, under which lien notes
would be requested, based upon the following cost formula to determine the cost
of the so-called improvement or extension:
         (a)   The materials at the city’s cost of acquisition, according to
normal bid procedures for purchase;
         (b)   The actual cost for the use of equipment, according to
acceptable standards. The city shall make available a list of the cost of usage
and rental of the equipment, according to customary rates for the area;
         (c)   The actual cost of labor by persons employed in the project,
plus the addition of 20% of only the labor amount, to reimburse the city for
administrative and other costs not theretofore charged for the project; and
         (d)   In addition, an engineering fee of 5% of the total construction
price shall be paid to the city for the actual plans, design, and work
connected with the City Engineer’s supervision and approval of the project.
      (3)   The City Commission, upon determining the necessity to perform any
improvement of any nature specified in this chapter, may apply the same formula
in division (A)(2) above for the improvements. The method and distribution of
costs would be in the same manner provided in division (A)(2) above. By a
majority vote of the City Commission, any improvement project may be performed
with or without the consent of the property owners so affected, subject to
state law.
   (B)   At the discretion of the City Commission, and subject to available
funds, the following financing arrangement with respect to all the previously
described improvements is hereby authorized by this chapter for the payment of
assessments. The property owner so affected shall have the privilege to pay the
assessment by making an initial payment of 20% of the cost, according to the
formula prescribed in division (A)(2) above, and the balance is to be paid in
96 equal monthly installments, together with simple interest at the rate of 6%
per annum of the unpaid balance until the entire balance shall have been paid.
The monthly installments shall be in addition to the water bill, sewer bill, or
other type of bill each month. This would constitute a return to the city of 6%
per annum according to law, and according to acceptable methods of financing
and the return of investment to the city. This method of paying an assessment,
however, shall not be permitted in the event any person elects to use a private
contractor or does the work himself or herself.
(1981 Code, § 23-2) (Ord. 615, passed 4-30-1973)
§ 51.03 MUNICIPAL LIEN FOR IMPROVEMENTS.
   (A)   When an improvement project has been approved under §
51.02(A)(3), a municipal lien shall be filed in the office of the County Clerk.
The contents of the lien shall be as follows:
      (1)   The number of the ordinance or section number of this code under
which the lien is established;
      (2)   The fact that a lien is established;
      (3)   The general purpose of the lien;
      (4)   The name of the owner of the property against which the lien is
established as determined from the records of the County Assessor;
      (5)   A description of the property against which the lien is
established;
      (6)   The amount of the lien; and
      (7)   If the lien is for more than 1 period of time, the dates for which
the lien is established.
   (B)   A lien for charges or assessments which are provided for or fixed by
any 1 ordinance or under authority of law may be included in the same notice of
lien and it shall not be necessary to file separate liens against the separate
properties. The lien shall be attested in the name of the City Clerk/Treasurer
under the seal of the city.
   (C)   The principal amount of any lien imposed for a municipal utility
charge or assessment shall bear interest at the rate of 6% per annum from the
date of filing the notice of the lien unless otherwise provided by law.
   (D)   Thirty days time shall be granted, from the date of the completion of
the project, for any person to pay the cost to be assessed against his or her
property. Notice of this option to pay shall be sent by mail to property owners
affected, according to the records at the County Courthouse.
   (E)   After the filing of the notice of the lien in the office of the County
Clerk, the city shall have a lien upon the property described in the notice of
lien. The filing of the notice of the lien shall be notice to all the world of
the existence of the lien and of the contents of the notice of lien.
   (F)   The City Clerk/Treasurer may release a lien against any specific
property by:
      (1)   Entering and signing a receipt of payment upon the notice of lien
filed in the office of the County Clerk; or
      (2)   Issuing a separate receipt which recites that payment of the lien
with any accrued interest and penalty has been made.

charged a “customer charge” as follows: $11.111 per month (gross) $10.000 per
month (net).
         (b)   As used in this subchapter GROSS refers to the amount of the

hereinafter provided.
      (2)    Distribution rate.  
 
Urban Residential
Gross 7.2032 cents per kWh
Net   5.7600 cents per kWh
 
      (3)   Energy cost adjustment clause.
         (a)   This (net) adjustment, which shall be computed by the following
formula and rounded to the nearest $0.0001, will then be multiplied by the
individual kWh usage for each customer:
            Energy Cost Adjustment ($/kWh) = (F+P)/S
         (b)   Where:
            1.   F = Dollar cost of fuel burned during the most recent month to
supply electric energy to customers;
            2.   P = Dollar cost of purchased power during the most recent
month to supply electric energy to customers;
            3.   S = Total kWh sales to billable customers for the monthly
billing cycle.
         (c)   The General Manager or his or her designee may adjust the energy
cost adjustment for any month to account for any under- or over-collections of
energy related charges.
      (4)   Tax adjustment. Billings under this schedule may be increased by an
amount equal to the sum of the taxes payable under the Gross Receipts and
Compensating Tax Act and of all other taxes, fees, or charges payable by the
utility and levied or assessed by any federal, state, county or city authority
or their agencies on the public utility service rendered, or on the right or
privilege of rendering the service, or on any object or event incidental to the
rendition of the service.
   (D)   Prompt payment discount.  A discount of 10% will be allowed on all
bills if paid on or before the tenth of the month and up to the opening office
hours on the eleventh of the month succeeding the month in which the bills were
incurred, providing the customer has no unpaid balance on previous bills,

may apply to participate in the budget billing plan.
         (b)   Acceptable credit standing is based on the following criteria:
            1.   The applicant must be an existing customer with at least a 12-
month history with Raton Public Service.
            2.   The previous 12-month history must not include any charge-offs
or delinquencies which resulted in a discontinuance of service.
      (2)   The monthly billing amount will be calculated as follows:
         (a)   The average monthly historical billing will be determined by
dividing the sum of the customer’s 12 previous months kWh usage by 11 and then
applying the applicable rate schedule to this average usage. The average
monthly historical billing will be reviewed monthly and, if necessary, adjusted
to minimize any excessive debit or credit balance at the end of the 1-year
period. This adjusted average monthly historical billing will be the monthly
billing amount.
         (b)   The twelfth month’s bill will be calculated based on the sum of
the current 12 months’ actual bills (amount the customer would have been billed
if not on the budget billing plan) minus the amount paid by the customer for
the current 11-month period (11 x calculated payment). Any credit will be
applied to the next 12-month budget billing period. Any debit will be paid by
the customer on or before the last business day of August of the given year.
      (3)   All participants not paying their calculated billing amount by the
tenth of each month will have their prompt payment discount disallowed. The
customer’s budget billed amount will be 11.1% more than it would have been had
the prompt payment discount payment been allowed; however, the customer shall
not receive credit for any such increased amounts when calculating that
customer’s bill for the twelfth month. Participants not paying their billing
amount, whether or not discounted, by the fifteenth of each month will be
issued a discontinuance of service notice. If a customer incurs a
discontinuance of service notice, the customer will be dropped from the plan
and will be required, upon demand, to pay any and all outstanding charges for
power used and not yet paid for by the customer. Once dropped from the plan, a
customer will not be allowed to re-enroll in the plan again until the customer
re-establishes an acceptable credit standing with R.P.S. over a 12-month
period.
      (4)   Any customer wishing to enroll in this budget billing plan must
apply in writing to R.P.S. by June 1 of any given year. The budget billing
period will be the 12-month period from July 1 to June 30 of each year.

applied to the next 12-month budget billing period. Any debit will be paid by
the customer on or before the last business day of August of the given year.
      (3)   All participants not paying their calculated billing amount by the
tenth of each month will have their prompt payment discount disallowed. The
customer’s budget billed amount will be 11.1% more than it would have been had

not receive credit for any such increased amounts when calculating that
customer’s bill for the twelfth month. Participants not paying their billing
amount, whether or not discounted, by the fifteenth of each month will be
issued a discontinuance of service notice. If a customer incurs a
discontinuance of service notice, the customer will be dropped from the plan

period.
      (4)   Any customer wishing to enroll in this budget billing plan must

billing cycle.
         (c)   The General Manager or his or her designee may adjust the energy
cost adjustment for any month to account for any under- or over-collections of
energy related charges.
      (4)   Tax adjustment. Billings under this schedule may be increased by an
amount equal to the sum of the taxes payable under the Gross Receipts and
Compensating Tax Act and of all other taxes, fees, or charges payable by the
utility and levied or assessed by any federal, state, county or city authority
or their agencies on the public utility service rendered, or on the right or
privilege of rendering the service, or on any object or event incidental to the
rendition of the service.
   (D)   Prompt payment discount. A discount of 10% will be allowed on all
bills if paid on or before the tenth of the month and up to the opening office
hours on the eleventh of the month succeeding the month in which the bills were
incurred, providing the customer has no unpaid balance on previous bills,
except as follows:
      (1)   If payment is mailed and postmarked prior to midnight of the tenth
day of each month, the discount will be allowed.
      (2)   Whenever the tenth day of the month falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or
a holiday, the discount will be allowed on the next following regular work day,
and up to the opening office hours the following day.
   (E)   Budget billing plan.
      (1)   (a)   Any commercial customer with an acceptable credit standing
may apply to participate in the budget billing plan.
         (b)   Acceptable credit standing is based on the following criteria:
            1.   The applicant must be an existing customer with at least a 12-
month history with Raton Public Service.
            2.   The previous 12-month history must not include any charge-offs
or delinquencies which resulted in a discontinuance of service.
      (2)   The monthly billing amount will be calculated as follows:
         (a)   The average monthly historical billing will be determined by
dividing the sum of the customer’s 12 previous months’ kWh usage by 11 and then
applying the applicable rate schedule to this average usage. The average
monthly historical billing will be reviewed monthly and, if necessary, adjusted
to minimize any excessive debit or credit balance at the end of the 1-year
period. This adjusted average monthly historical billing will be the monthly
billing amount.
         (b)   The twelfth month’s bill will be calculated based on the sum of
the current 12 months’ actual bills (amount the customer would have been billed
if not on the budget billing plan) minus the amount paid by the customer for
the current 11-month period (11 x calculated payment). Any credit will be
applied to the next 12-month budget billing period. Any debit will be paid by
the customer on or before the last business day of August of the given year.
      (3)   All participants not paying their calculated billing amount by the
tenth of each month will have their prompt payment discount disallowed. The
customer’s budget billed amount will be 11.1% more than it would have been had
the prompt payment discount payment been allowed, however, the customer shall
not receive credit for any such increased amounts when calculating that
customer’s bill for the twelfth month. Participants not paying their billing
amount, whether or not discounted, by the fifteenth of each month will be
issued a discontinuance of service notice. If a customer incurs a
discontinuance of service notice, the customer will be dropped from the plan
and will be required, upon demand, to pay any and all outstanding charges for
power used and not yet paid for by the customer. Once dropped from the plan, a
customer will not be allowed to re-enroll in the plan again until the customer
re-establishes an acceptable credit standing with R.P.S. over a 12-month
period.
      (4)   Any customer wishing to enroll in this budget billing plan must
apply in writing to R.P.S. by June 1 of any given year. The budget billing
period will be the 12-month period from July 1 to June 30 of each year.

and commercial customers, in good standing, taking service under R.P.S.
residential rate schedules (Schedules R-l or R-2) or commercial rate schedules
(Schedules C-l or C-2) and have installed a renewable (wind, solar, geothermal)
generating source on their facilities served by R.P.S. The generating source
must have been approved by R.P.S. for parallel operation with the R.P.S.
electric system. The customer’s generating installation typically shall not
exceed 10 kW for residential customers or 25 kW for commercial customers. This
requirement may be reviewed on a case by case basis by the General Manager in
order to maintain the integrity of the R.P.S. electrical system. This tariff
will be applied in addition to the rate schedule assigned by R.P.S. Service
shall be supplied through 1 meter which will measure kWh delivered by R.P.S.
and kWh received from the customer.
   (B)   Rate schedule.
      (1)   If the electricity supplied by R.P.S. to the customer (kWh
delivered) exceeds the electricity generated by the customer’s system (kWh
received) during a billing period, the customer will be billed for the net
energy supplied by R.P.S. (kWh delivered less kWh received) as outlined in the
appropriate residential or commercial rate schedule. These charges shall
include the customer charge, energy rate, energy cost adjustment clause, tax
adjustment and any other charges outlined in the specific rate.
      (2)   If electricity generated by the customer’s system (kWh received)
exceeds the electricity delivered by R.P.S. (kWh delivered) during a billing
period, R.P.S. will buy back the excess kWh at the current wholesale delivered
energy rate (including transmission costs). The buyback will appear as a credit
on the customer’s bill during the next billing period.
      (3)   At the discretion of R.P.S., credits can be carried forward from
month to month. At the end of 12 calendar months, the account will be trued up
with R.P.S. buying back all credits, as accrued on a month by month basis, at
the current wholesale energy rate. The wholesale energy rate is the total cost
of generated and purchased wholesale energy divided by the net to system kWh
for a given billing period.
   (C)   Minimum billing. The monthly minimum charge under this tariff shall be
the customer charge plus tax adjustment as defined under the applicable rate
schedule. This will be charged on a monthly basis, regardless of when “true-up”
occurs.
   (D)   Budget billing plan. Due to the unknown generation on the customer’s
premises and the inability to accurately determine generation and usage, the
budget billing plan will not be available to customers receiving service under
this tariff.
   (E)   Conditions and type of service. The customer will be required to
comply with interconnection standards for parallel installation and operation
of customer owned electric generating facilities.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 54.01 RESTRICTIONS ON WATER USE DURING DROUGHT OR OTHER EMERGENCY.
   (A)   Whenever, in the judgment of the City Commission, the municipal water
supply of the city shall be endangered from drought or other cause so that it
appears reasonably necessary to apply and enforce restrictions upon the use of
water from the system, the City Commission may, by resolution determining that
an emergency exists, impose restrictions upon the use of water from the
municipal water system of any kind or character, or as to the times when water
may be used for any particular purpose. The resolution shall be published once
in a newspaper of general circulation in the city.
   (B)   Upon the cessation of the need for any restriction imposed by the
Commission under division (A) above, a resolution to that effect shall be
adopted by the City Commission and published 1 time in a newspaper of general
circulation in the city, whereupon it shall be of no further effect.
(1981 Code, § 28-56)
§ 54.02 PRIORITY USERS OF CITY WATER SUPPLY.
   The citizens of the city shall retain priority to the use of all water
produced and distributed by the city. Whenever, in the judgment of the City
Commission, the welfare of the citizens of the city will be jeopardized by the
delivery of water outside of the corporate limits of the city, the delivery of
water shall be restrained or completely discontinued. The delivery of water
shall not again be resumed until the City Commission is satisfied that the
welfare of the citizens of the city will not be jeopardized thereby. (1981
Code, § 28-58)
WATER RATES DURING WATER SHORTAGE EMERGENCY
§ 54.15 PURPOSE.
   From time to time, the water supply of the city may be reduced as a result
of drought, system breakdowns, or other supply limitations. The City Commission
desires to make an equitable allocation of the water as is then available
between residential and commercial water users, having in mind at all times
physical needs for health and sanitation, and also considering the need for
water in the operation of business necessary to the life of the community. At
the times of water shortages, the City Commission must make decisions
concerning the essentiality of various types of water use with respect to the
public welfare and business reasonableness, that is, the relative impact of
restrictions on water use on the quality of life in the city. At certain times,
voluntary conservation is not appropriate to utilize the available water
supply. At those times, as determined by the City Manager and City Commission,
economic incentives to curb water use are the only fair and equitable means to
ensure that available water is used conservatively. It is the purpose of §§
54.15 et seq. to provide the means to accomplish the desired objectives.
(1981 Code, § 28-71) (Ord. 644, passed 1-19-1978)
Statutory reference:
   Authority of city to regulate and restrict the use of water in order to
prevent waste and to conserve the supply of water, see NMSA § 3-53-2
§ 54.16 DEFINITIONS.
   For the purpose of §§
54.15 et seq., the following definitions shall apply unless the context clearly
indicates or requires a different meaning.
   COMMERCIAL NEED (C.N.). Intended to establish the average commercial or
business need for water, shall be computed by averaging the 3 lowest months of
consumption during the next preceding 12-month period before occurrence of the
emergency, at a time when no water restrictions were in effect. The averaging
shall be by class of business, where deemed feasible, and by individual
business where a class average appears inequitable. The classification of
businesses for this averaging shall be established by resolution of the City
Commission implementing a water shortage emergency, as defined in this section.
The classification may be further changed, during the emergency, as inequities
and inadequacies may appear.
   COMMERCIAL SEASONAL PEAK (C.S.P.) and COMMERCIAL SEASONAL ALLOWANCE
(C.S.A.). These terms, as in the case of residential use, are intended to
establish the average maximum monthly commercial use, by classifications or by
individual businesses as aforesaid, and shall be computed similarly as to
residential uses. The percentage of normal use deemed necessary to fairly
allocate the available water supply may vary from class to class, as is deemed
equitable to the City Commission, considering business reasonableness, water
saving necessity, and other relevant factors. Use of water within and above the
COMMERCIAL SEASONAL ALLOWANCE shall have a similar effect upon water rates to
that of residential use.
   CONSERVATION ALLOCATION (C.A.). The sum of the “seasonal allowance” and the
“domestic need.” Use of a greater quantity of water than this amount will
trigger a decupling of the basic “domestic need” rate per thousand gallons
thereafter.
   DOMESTIC NEED (D.N.). This term, intended to establish the average city
household’s monthly water needs for purely domestic purposes, that is,
drinking, washing, toilet, and other sanitary and health requirements, shall be
computed for residential purposes by averaging the monthly consumption of city
households during the months of December, January, and February of the next
preceding period before occurrence of the emergency when no water restrictions
were in effect. It shall be computed by determining the total water use through
residential meters for the 3-month period and dividing that sum by the number
of residential meters and the number of months.
   SEASONAL ALLOWANCE (S.A.). The result of multiplying the “seasonal peak
differential” by the percentage of normal use deemed necessary to fairly
allocate the available water supply among all residential users. Use of water
within this allowance, above the “domestic need,” shall trigger a doubling of
the rate per thousand gallons therefor.
   SEASONAL PEAK (S.P.). This term, intended to establish the average maximum
monthly water use for all purposes, shall be computed for residential or
commercial purposes by averaging their consumption during the single month of
highest use during the next preceding 12-month period before occurrence of the
emergency when no water restrictions were in effect. It shall be computed by
dividing the total water use through residential meters during their month of
greatest use by the number of residential meters.
   SEASONAL PEAK DIFFERENTIAL (S.P.D.). The difference between the quantity of
water used at “seasonal peak” and the quantity at “domestic need.”
   WATER SHORTAGE EMERGENCY (W.S.E.). This term shall apply to any situation,
whether short- or long-termed, where the water available for the use of the
people of the city is deemed insufficient to allow normal consumption and
invocation of the terms of §§
54.15 et seq. is necessary, and the water rate for water usage, commencing with
the next meter reading, shall be that imposed by §§
54.15 et seq.
(1981 Code, § 28-72) (Ord. 644, passed 1-19-1978)
§ 54.17 DECLARATION OF WATER SHORTAGE EMERGENCY.
   (A)   A majority of the members of the City Commission, upon the
recommendation of the City Manager, shall have the power to declare a water
shortage emergency, which shall continue until revoked by action of a majority
of the members of the Commission.
   (B)   The declaration and revocation shall each be made by resolution, which
shall be given the widest possible publicity through newspaper, radio, and
otherwise.
   (C)   The resolution adopted declaring a water shortage emergency shall
include a determination of the domestic need, the seasonal peak, the percentage
of conservation or normal use deemed necessary, and the conservation
allocation.
   (D)   The resolution shall also classify commercial uses, such as multi-
family dwellings, motels, restaurants, service stations, retail and office,
bars and lounges, beauty and barber shops, laundries, churches, schools,
sprinkler systems, or combinations of any of these, as well as a miscellaneous
category.
   (E)   The classification may be as individualized or as general, from class
to class or case to case, as the City Commission shall deem fair and
reasonable, and likely to accomplish the desired result equitably; and any part
thereof may subsequently be changed or modified, as the Commission shall
decide.
(1981 Code, § 28-73) (Ord. 644, passed 1-19-1978)
§ 54.18 BASIC WATER RATE SCHEDULES DURING WATER SHORTAGE EMERGENCY.

   When required by the City Commission, the owner of any property serviced by
a building sewer carrying industrial liquid wastes shall install a suitable
control manhole, together with the necessary meters and other appurtenances in
the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measurement of the
wastes. The manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located,
constructed in a manner as to prevent infiltration of ground and surface
waters, and should be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the City
Commission. The manhole shall be installed by the owner, at his or her expense,
and shall be maintained by him or her so as to be safe and accessible at all
times.
(1981 Code, § 28-171) (Ord. 605, passed 7-11-1972)
Penalty, see § 55.99
§ 55.12 SAMPLING DISCHARGE; MEASUREMENTS; TESTS.
   All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and
wastes shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of “Standard
Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater,” published jointly by the
“American Public Health Association,” the “American Water Works Association,”
and the “Water Pollution Control Federation,” and shall be determined at the
control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at the control
manhole. The control manhole shall be located so that sampling of the
industrial waste will be performed before discharge into the public sewer
system. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to
reflect the effect of constituents upon the wastewater treatment works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular
analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of
a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken.
Normally, but not always, C.O.D., B.O.D., and settleable solids analyses are
obtained from 24-hour composites of all butfalls whereas pH’s are determined
from periodic grab samples.

Penalty, see § 55.99
§ 55.13 COST RECOVERY SYSTEM.
   (A)   Establishment. The City Commission shall take necessary steps to
establish a rate schedule for sewer service that assures an equitable system of
cost recovery. The purpose hereof is that the industrial users shall pay for
the costs incurred by the City Commission in the construction, operation, and
maintenance of that portion of the wastewater facilities related to industrial
wastes.
(1981 Code, § 28-173)
   (B)   Conditions to be satisfied in structuring. The cost recovery system
shall satisfy the following conditions.
      (1)   The apportionment of costs must take into consideration the
individual industrial user’s contribution as related to the total waste load
taking into account the volume and strength of all discharges.
      (2)   The costs to be considered should include, but are not limited to:
         (a)   Amortization of the applicant’s indebtedness for the cost of the
treatment facilities (plant and interceptors);
         (b)   Operation and maintenance of the treatment facilities; and/or
         (c)   Any additional costs which are necessary to assure adequate
treatment on a continuous basis.
      (3)   Substantial prepayment of the capital investment or other financial
commitments will be required from each industry that contributes 30% or more of
the total volume or strength of the waste load to be treated by the project.
(1981 Code, § 28-174)
   (C)   Charges. A charge will be assessed against persons discharging
industrial liquid wastes which are of a greater strength and volume than
normal, untreated domestic wastewater. Normal, untreated domestic wastewater is
defined as having a maximum yearly average biochemical oxygen demand and
chemical oxygen demand not in excess of 200 milligrams per liter and 400
milligrams per liter, respectively. The same sewage is considered to contain
settleable solids not in excess of 5 milliliters per liter.
      (1)   The annual industrial charge will be the largest value which
results from application of the following mathematical relationships:

      (2)   Where:
         (a)   IC = Industrial charge, dollars per year;
         (b)   V = Volume discharge, gallons per year;
         (c)   SS = Settleable solids of a given industrial waste, ml/l;
         (d)   a = That fraction of the total cost which is attributable to
settleable solids removal;
         (e)   b = That fraction of the total cost which is attributable to
either chemical oxygen demand removal or biochemical oxygen demand removal;
         (f)   A = Basic annual charge levied for being connected; whether or
not sewage or other wastewaters are being discharged to the system, dollars per
year;
         (g)   K =Annual charge per unit volume of waste, dollars per million
gallons;
         (h)   COD = Chemical oxygen demand of a waste, mg/l; and
         (i)   BOD = Biochemical oxygen demand of a waste, mg/l.
      (3)   If settleable solids concentration is less than 5 ml/1, chemical
oxygen demand is less than 400 mg/l, and biochemical oxygen demand is less than
200 mg/1, the charge shall be based on volume alone, and the following formula
shall apply, with the terms as defined above:

jump, fly or fall out. Animals left unattended in cars, vans or RVs must have
adequate ventilation to prevent the temperature in the vehicle from rising high
enough such that any reasonable person would know that the animal would suffer
from heat exposure. During the warmer months, no amount of ventilation will
keep the car from getting too hot. If the Animal Control Officer or police
officer determines that an animal in a vehicle is in immediate danger, the
Animal Control Officer or police officer may enter the vehicle by whatever
means necessary, without being liable to the owner of the vehicle, and seize
the animal.
      (4)   Transporting more than 1 animal. In addition to all other
regulations in this chapter, animals should never be overcrowded when being
transported. If the animals are crated or kept in any enclosure, they may be
allowed to share a crate but each animal should be able to stand up, move
around, lie down and stretch out naturally. If crates or enclosures are
stacked, they must be attached securely to prevent the crates or enclosures
from falling or turning over. If crates or other enclosures are stacked, it is
important that no urine or feces are passed between crates and enclosures.

93.105 et seq., as may be necessary to install or repair sewers, mains,
conduits, or other utility installations. In the event any owner of real
property abutting the streets shall fail within the 45 days to perform the
excavation work as may be required to install or repair utility service lines
or service connections to the property lines, any and all rights of the owner
or his or her successors in interest to make openings, cuts, or excavations in
the street shall be barred for a period of 2 years from the date of enactment
of the ordinance or resolution. During the 2-year period no excavation permit
shall be issued to open, cut, or excavate in the street, unless, in the
judgment of the Street Superintendent, an emergency, as described in §§
93.030 et seq.,
93.050 et seq.,
93.070 et seq.,
93.090 et seq., and
93.105 et seq. exists, which makes it absolutely essential that the excavation
permit be issued.
   (C)   Every city department or official charged with responsibility for any
work that may necessitate any opening, cut, or excavation in the street is
directed to take appropriate measures to perform the excavation work within the
45-day period so as to avoid the necessity for making any openings, cuts, or
excavations in the new pavement in the city street during the 2-year period.
(1981 Code, § 24-53)
EXCAVATION PERMITS
§ 93.050 REQUIRED.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to dig up, break, excavate, tunnel,
undermine, or in any manner break up any street or to make or cause to be made
any excavation in or under the surface of any street for any purpose, or to
place, deposit, or leave upon any street any earth or other excavated material
obstructing or tending to interfere with the free use of the street, unless the
person shall first have obtained an excavation permit therefor from the Street
Superintendent.
(1981 Code, § 24-61)
Penalty, see § 93.999
§ 93.051 APPLICATION.
   No excavation permit shall be issued unless a written application for the
issuance of an excavation permit is submitted to the Street Superintendent. The
written application shall state the name and address of the applicant, the
nature, location, and purpose of the excavation, the date of commencement, and
the date of completion of the excavation, and other data as may reasonably be
required by the Street Superintendent.
(1981 Code, § 24-62)
§ 93.052 SURETY BOND.
   (A)   Before an excavation permit is issued under §§
93.050 et seq., the applicant shall deposit with the City Clerk/Treasurer a
surety bond in the amount of $500 payable to the city. The required bond must
be:
      (1)   With good and sufficient surety;
      (2)   By a surety company authorized to transact business in the state;
      (3)   Satisfactory to the City Attorney in form and substance; and
      (4)   Conditioned upon the permittee’s compliance with §§
93.030 et seq.,
93.050 et seq.,
93.070 et seq.,
93.090 et seq., and
93.105 et seq. and to secure and hold the city and its officers harmless
against any and all claims, judgments, or other costs arising from the
excavation and other work covered by the excavation permit or for which the
city, the City Commission, or any city officer may be made liable by reason of
any accident or injury to persons or property through the fault of the
permittee either in not properly guarding the excavation or for any other
injury resulting from the negligence of the permittee, and further conditioned
to fill up, restore, and place in good and safe condition as near as may be to
its original condition, and to the satisfaction of the Street Superintendent,
all openings and excavations made in streets, and to maintain any street where
excavation is made in as good condition for the period of 24 months after the
work shall have been done, usual wear and tear excepted, as it was in before
the work shall have been done. Any settlement of the surface within the 2-year
period shall be deemed conclusive evidence of defective backfilling by the
permittee.
   (B)   Nothing herein contained shall be construed to require the permittee
to maintain any repairs to pavement made by the city, if the repairs should
prove defective. Recovery on the bond for any injury or accident shall not
exhaust the bond, but it shall in its entirety cover any or all future
accidents or injuries during the excavation work for which it is given. In the
event of any suit or claim against the city by reason of the negligence or
default of the permittee, upon the city giving written notice to the permittee
of the suit or claim, any final judgment against the city requiring it to pay
for the damage shall be conclusive upon the permittee and his or her surety. An
annual bond may be given under this provision, which shall remain in force for
1 year conditioned as above, in the amount specified above and in other
respects as specified above, but applicable as to all excavation work in
streets by the principal of the bond during the term of 1 year from the date.
(1981 Code, § 24-63)
§ 93.053 CASH DEPOSITS.

93.050 et seq.,
93.070 et seq.,
93.090 et seq., and
93.105 et seq. shall be accompanied with a cash deposit made to the Street
Superintendent for deposit with the City Clerk/Treasurer. The cash deposit is
to be based upon the value of the surface to be disturbed, whether it be paved
or not, with the value to include the cost of labor. The value shall be
determined by resolution of the City Commission, from time to time, as it may
see fit. No deposit shall be less than the amount established according to
resolution. Any deposit made under this section shall serve as security for the
repair and performance of work necessary to put the street in as good a
condition as it was prior to the excavation, if the permittee fails to make the
necessary repairs or to complete the proper refilling of the opening and the
excavation work under the excavation permit.
   (B)   Upon the permittee’s completion of the work covered by the permit
issued under §§
93.050 et seq., in conformance with §§
93.030 et seq.,
93.050 et seq.,
93.070 et seq.,
93.090 et seq., and
93.105 et seq., as determined by the Street Superintendent, 2/3 of the cash
deposit shall be promptly refunded by the city to the permittee. The balance
shall be retained by the city for the 24-month period following the completion
during which the city may use any or all of the deposit to pay the cost of any
work the city performs to restore or maintain the street as provided in §§
93.030 et seq.,
93.050 et seq.,
93.070 et seq.,
93.090 et seq., and

93.070 et seq.,
93.090 et seq., and
93.105 et seq. shall be compacted to a degree equivalent to that of the
undisturbed ground in which the trench was dug. Compacting shall be done by
mechanical tappers or vibrators, by rolling in layers, or by water settling, as
required by the soil in question and sound engineering practices generally
recognized in the construction industry. The decision as to whether a trench
shall be backfilled by water settling shall be based upon sound engineering
practices. When water is taken from a fire hydrant, the permittee shall assign
1 person to operate the hydrant and shall make certain that the person had been
instructed by the City Water Department in the operation of the hydrant. The
City Water Department shall likewise be notified at both the beginning and the
end of the job so that the condition of the fire hydrant can be checked on both
occasions. Any damage done to the hydrant during the excavation shall be the

§ 93.091 BY WATER SETTLING.
   When backfilling is done by water settling, excavated materials above
utility installations shall be deposited uniformly in layers of not more than 5
feet in thickness and shall be thoroughly flooded. During the flooding, the
water shall be allowed to flow slowly to the trench from high points and shall
be worked down to the full depth of the layer of backfill with bars. All bars
used shall be long enough to extend entirely through the layer being filled and
shall be forced down through the loose backfill material. As the bars are
withdrawn, the water shall be allowed to flow downward around the bar. The
channel or hole formed by the bar shall be kept open and the water kept running
into it until the fill has settled. All work shall be done in a manner as to
obtain a relative compaction through the entire depth of the backfill of not
less than that existing adjacent to the excavation.
(1981 Code, § 24-92)
§ 93.092 DRY BACKFILLING.
   Backfilling up to the first 18 inches above the top of the utility pipes or
similar installations shall be done with thin layers in dry backfilling. Each
layer is to be tamped by manual or mechanical means. Layers that are hand-
tamped shall not exceed 4 inches in thickness. Layers that are power-tamped
shall not exceed 6 inches in thickness. The same requirements shall apply to
the remainder of the backfilling, if tamping is the method used for
backfilling. Backfilling of all pipes of over 24 inches in diameter shall be
carried up to the spring line of the pipe in 3 inch layers, with each layer
moistened and thoroughly tamped with suitable mechanical equipment. The
backfill around all pipes 24 inches or less in diameter shall be flooded or
tamped as specified above to a depth of 18 inches above the top of the pipe
before any additional backfill is placed thereon.
(1981 Code, § 24-93)
§ 93.093 MATERIAL.
   Whenever any excavation for the laying of pipe is made through rock, the
pipe shall be laid 6 inches above the rock bottom of the trench, and the space
under, around, and 6 inches above the pipe shall be backfilled with clean river
sand, noncorrosive soil, or ¼ inch minus gravel. Broken pavement, large stones,
and debris shall not be used in the backfill.
(1981 Code, § 24-94)
Penalty, see § 93.999
§ 93.094 AT THE SURFACE.
   Backfilling shall be completed by placing the backfill material well up over
the top of the trench. For dry backfilling, the material shall be compacted
with a roller of an approved type, or with the rear of a truck carrying at
least 5 tons, until the surface is unyielding. The surface shall then be graded
as required.
(1981 Code, § 24-95)
Penalty, see § 93.999
EXCAVATIONS; RESTORATION OF SURFACE

93.070 et seq.,
93.090 et seq., and
93.105 et seq., to its original condition in accordance with the specifications
of the Street Superintendent. The permittee may be required to place a
temporary surface over openings made in paved traffic lanes. Except when the
pavement is to be replaced before the opening of the cut to traffic, the fill
above the bottom of the paving slab shall be made with suitable material well
tamped into place and this fill shall be topped with a minimum of at least 1
inch of bituminous mixture which is suitable to maintain the opening in good
condition until permanent restoration can be made. The crown of the temporary
restoration shall not exceed 1 inch above the adjoining pavement. The permittee
shall exercise special care in making the temporary restorations and must
maintain the restorations in safe traveling condition until the time as
permanent restorations are made. The asphalt which is used shall be in
accordance with the specifications of the Street Superintendent. If in the
judgment of the Street Superintendent it is not expedient to replace the
pavement over any cut or excavation made in the street upon completion of the
work allowed under the permit by reason of the looseness of the earth or
weather conditions, he or she may direct the permittee to lay a temporary
pavement of wood, or other suitable material designated by him or her, over the
cut or excavation to remain until the time as the repair of the original
pavement may be properly made.
   (B)   Permanent restoration of the street shall be made by the permittee in
strict accordance with the specifications prescribed by the Street
Superintendent to restore the street to its original and proper condition, or
as near as may be.
   (C)   Acceptance or approval of any excavation work by the Street
Superintendent shall not prevent the city from asserting a claim against the
permittee and his or her surety under the surety bond required by §§
93.030 et seq.,
93.050 et seq.,
93.070 et seq.,
93.090 et seq., and
93.105 et seq. for incomplete or defective work, if discovered within 24 months
from the completion of the excavation work. The Street Superintendent’s
presence during the performance of any excavation work shall not relieve the
permittee of his or her responsibilities under §§
93.030 et seq.,
93.050 et seq.,
93.070 et seq.,

which remain vacant and unoccupied for any appreciable period of time have a
negative impact on surrounding properties and the community and contribute to
blight, increase the risk of vandalism and arson in buildings, reduce community
property values and tax base, and require additional public services. It is
also determined that vacant buildings of relatively large area represent
disproportionate adverse impacts to the community relative to smaller
buildings. It is the purpose and intent of the city to protect the public
health, safety and well-being by enactment of this chapter to:
      (1)   Establish a process to address the significant number of vacant,
abandoned, foreclosed, and/or otherwise distressed buildings and structures
located within the city;
      (2)   To identify, register, regulate and reduce the number of vacant,
abandoned or dilapidated primary buildings and structures located within the
city;
      (3)   To create conditions favorable to the general welfare, prosperity
and harmonious development of the city;
      (4)   To establish the responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings and
structures and to acknowledge community impacts resulting from long-term
vacancy of buildings and structures;
      (5)   Reduce, minimize or eliminate the negative impacts on surrounding
properties and neighborhoods from unsupervised vacant, abandoned, and
foreclosed buildings and structures;
      (6)   Provide for administration, enforcement and imposition of fees and
penalties related to this chapter.
   (B)   This chapter shall apply to all vacant, abandoned, and foreclosed
primary residential, commercial, and industrial buildings and structures within
the City of Raton, New Mexico. This chapter shall apply to any such described
building that is fully intact, partially removed, burned, demolished or
destroyed, or a building in which any portion of the structure is remaining in
place or on the site.
   (C)   Further, it is found to be in the public interest for the city to
impose a fee in conjunction with registration of vacant, abandoned, and
foreclosed primary buildings and structures to offset the disproportionate
costs imposed on the city by the presence of these properties.

building is a "vacant building" within the meaning of this chapter. The Officer
may determine that a building which meets any of the criteria set forth in this
chapter is not to be regulated under this chapter for a stated period, if upon
consideration of reliable, substantiated and sufficient evidence, the Officer

the public health, welfare, and safety and makes written findings in support of
his/her decision. Any such determination shall be in writing and shall state
the factual basis for the determination. For buildings the Officer determines
to be "vacant buildings," he/she shall send notice of the written

certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property.

disputes the Code Enforcement Officer's determination, shall set forth specific

and effect to the same extent as if set out at length in this code.
(1981 Code, § 26-131)
Editor’s Note:
   The city’s ordinances imposing the municipal gross receipts tax and
increasing the rate thereof have not been set out at length in this code
inasmuch as that city tax is collected by the Revenue Division of the State
Taxation and Revenue Department in the same manner and at the same time it
collects the state gross receipts tax. Furthermore, the provisions of the
ordinances are duplicative of each other and of provisions of state law
authorizing the tax. Copies of the ordinances are on file in the office of the
City Clerk/Treasurer.
§ 114.03 SUPPLEMENTAL MUNICIPAL GROSS RECEIPTS TAX ORDINANCES NOT AFFECTED BY

the rate thereof, including Ordinance 997 passed by the City Commission on 11-
28-2017, and submitted to a vote of the electors of the city at a special

continuing in full force and effect to the same extent as if set out at length
in this code.

the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood in the
case of Zones Al-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AK B, C, X, and D, ELEVATED BUILDING also
includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter
walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood
waters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE or V,  ELEVATED BUILDING also includes a

purposes, NEW CONSTRUCTION means structures for which the "start of
construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a flood plain
management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent
improvements to the structures.
   NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION. A manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on
which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the
installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective
date of flood plain management regulations adopted by a community.
   RECREATIONAL VEHICLE. A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projections;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck; and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but a
temporary living quarters for recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   START OF CONSTRUCTION. For other than new construction or substantial
improvements under the Coastal Barriers Resources Act, being 16 U.S.C. §§ 3501
et seq., issued, provided the actual start date of construction, repair,
reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was
within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first
placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the
pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a
manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading, or filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main
structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION
means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural
part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external
dimensions of the building.
   STRUCTURE. A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage
tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.
   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT.
      (1)   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement
of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of
the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement.
      (2)   This includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage"
regardless of the actual repair work performed.
      (3)   The term does not, however, include either:
         (a)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
         (b)   Any alteration of an "historic structure," provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as an
"historic structure."
   VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter
when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A VARIANCE,
therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited
by this chapter. (For full requirements see 44 C.F.R. § 60.6 of the National
Flood Insurance Program Regulations).
   VIOLATION.
      (1)   The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with the community’s flood plain management regulations.
      (2)   A structure or other development without the elevation certificate
or other certifications or other evidence of compliance required in 44 C.F.R. §
60.3 is presumed to be in violation until the time as that documentation is
provided.
   WATER SURFACE ELEVATION. The height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (N.G.V.D.) of 1988 (or other datum, where specified), of floods
of various magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains of coastal or
riverine areas.
(1981 Code, § 10-16) (Ord. 641, passed 8-8-1978; Am. Ord. 745, passed 2-24-
1987; Am. Ord. 907, passed 4-10-2001; Am. Ord. 960, passed 7-28-2009; Am. Ord.
971, passed 3-8-2011)
§ 152.03 FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (A)   The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation
which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the
public health, safety, and general welfare.
   (B)   These flood losses are created by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in flood plains which cause an increase in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated,
floodproofed or otherwise protected from flood damage.
(1981 Code, § 10-17) (Ord. 641, passed 8-8-1978; Am. Ord. 960, passed 7-28-
2009; Am. Ord. 971, passed 3-8-2011)
§ 152.04 PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (A)   Protect human life and health;
   (B)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (C)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (D)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (E)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in flood plains;
   (F)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood-prone areas in a manner as to minimize future flood blight
areas; and
   (G)   Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(1981 Code, § 10-18) (Ord. 641, passed 8-8-1978; Am. Ord. 960, passed 7-28-
2009; Am. Ord. 971, passed 3-8-2011)
§ 152.05 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following
methods:
   (A)   Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety, or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
   (B)   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve the uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (C)   Control the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
   (D)   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may
increase flood damage; and/or
   (E)   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

§ 152.26 VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   (A)   The Planning and Zoning Commission as established by the City
Commission shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
   (B)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hear and render judgment on
an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement,
decision, or determination made by the Flood Plain Manager in the enforcement
or administration of this chapter.
   (C)   Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the Planning and
Zoning Commission may appeal the decision in the courts of competent
jurisdiction.
   (D)   The Flood Plain Manager shall maintain a record of all actions
involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Insurance
Administration upon request.
   (E)   Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation, or
restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or
the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set
forth in the remainder of this section.
   (F)   Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, provided the relevant factors in §
152.25 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/
2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (G)   Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
chapter, the Planning and Zoning Commission may attach the conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and
objectives of this chapter.
   (H)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (I)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (J)   Prerequisites for granting variances:
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         (a)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
         (b)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
         (c)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation no more than 2 feet below the base flood elevation, and that the cost
of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
   (K)   Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other developments necessary for the conduct
of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
      (1)   The criteria outlined in this section are met; and
      (2)   The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

elevation is provided, the following provisions are provided:
      (1)   All new construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any structure, including manufactured housing, shall be built or placed on
compacted fill that is at least 2 feet above the highest adjacent grade prior
to any disturbance of the building site. Such fill shall extend at least 10
feet from the walls of the structure before it drops below the 2-foot
elevation. All residential structures shall have positive drainage away from
the buildings. The finished floor of the structure shall be at least 1 foot
above the elevation of the fill. A registered professional engineer, architect,
or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the Flood Plain Administrator
that the standard of this division (A) as proposed in §
152.23 is satisfied.
      (2) Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with areas
below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building
access or storage in an area other than a basement and which is subject to
flooding shall not be enclosed.
   (B)   In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data
has been provided, as set forth in §§
152.07,
152.21, or
152.42, the following provisions are required.
      (1)   All new construction. New construction and substantial improvement
of any structure, including manufactured housing, shall be built or placed on
compacted fill that is at least as high as the base flood elevation. Such fill
shall extend at least 10 feet from the walls of the structure before it drops
below the base flood elevation. All residential structures shall have positive
drainage away from the buildings. A registered professional engineer,
architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the Flood Plain
Manager that the standard of this division (B) as proposed in §
152.23, is satisfied.
      (2)   Residential construction.  New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including
basement), elevated to at least 1 foot above the base flood elevation. A
registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a

      (1)   Letter of credit in the city's name;
      (2)   Performance bond equal to the city's contribution;

development project until adequate assurances are made that the transferee,
assignee or lessee is a qualifying entity and that the terms of the agreement
will be satisfied by the transferee, assignee or lessee. At its discretion, the
city may choose to deny said assignment, lease or transfer, or may negotiate a
new agreement with the new operator, or the city may reclaim the facility and
enter into an agreement with the new qualifying entity.

   (A)   The governing body and the qualifying entity shall enter into a
project participation agreement.
   (B)   The governing body shall require a substantive contribution from the
qualifying entity for each economic development project. Public support
provided for an economic development project shall be in exchange for a
substantive contribution from the qualifying entity. The contribution shall be
of value and may be paid in money, in kind services, jobs, expanded tax base,
property or other thing or service of value for the expansion of the economy.
   (C)   The qualifying entity shall provide security to the governing body for
an economic development project. The security shall secure the qualifying
entity's obligation based on terms stated in the project participation
agreement with the governing body and shall reflect the amount of public
support provided to the qualifying entity and the substantive contribution
expected from the qualifying entity.
   (D)   If a qualifying entity fails to perform its substantive contribution,
the governing body shall enforce the project participation agreement to recover
that portion of the public support for which the qualifying entity failed to
provide a substantive contribution. The recovery shall be proportional to the
failed performance of the substantive contribution and shall take into account
all previous substantive contributions for the economic development project
performed by the qualifying entity, based on the terms stated in the project
participation agreement. The project participation agreement for an economic
development project that uses public support provided by the governing body
shall include a recapture agreement.
   (E)   The project participation agreement at a minimum shall set out:
      (1)   The contributions to be made by each party to the participation
agreement;
      (2)   The security provided to the governing body that provides public
support for an economic development project by the qualifying entity in the
form of a lien, mortgage or other indenture and the pledge of the qualifying
business's financial or material participation and cooperation to guarantee the
qualifying entity's performance pursuant to the project participation
agreement;
      (3)   A schedule for project development and completion, including
measurable goals and time limits for those goals; and
      (4)   Provisions for performance review and actions to be taken upon a
determination that project performance is “unsatisfactory."

§ 153.41 TERMINATION.
   The governing body may terminate this subchapter and the city's economic
development plan and any or all project participation agreements undertaken
under its authority. Termination shall be by ordinance at a public hearing or
in accordance with the terms of the project participation agreement. If an
ordinance or a project participation agreement is terminated, all contract
provisions of the project participation agreement regarding termination shall
be satisfied. Upon termination of the ordinance or any project participation
agreement, any city monies remaining in the city project accounts shall be
transferred to the city's general fund.
(Ord. 959, passed 7-28-2009; Am. Ord. 2015-991, passed 6-23-2015)
§ 153.42 JOINT REGIONAL PROJECTS.
   The city may engage in economic development projects involving one or more
other government entities for projects which encompass more than one
municipality or county. In such instances, the relevant governing bodies shall
adopt a joint powers agreement. This agreement will establish the application
criteria and the terms of all project participation agreements. Criteria
established under a joint powers agreement shall be consistent with the
provisions of this subchapter.

that strict compliance with the requirements of this chapter would result in
extraordinary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography, or
other nonself-inflicted conditions, or that these conditions would result in
inhibiting the achievement of the objectives of this chapter, the City
Commission may vary, modify, or waive the requirements so that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest secured; provided that the
variance, modification, or waiver will not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of this chapter.
   (B)   In no case shall any variation of modification be more than a minimum
easing of the requirements. In no case shall it have the effect of reducing the
traffic capacity of any street below that shown on the comprehensive plan of
the city or be in conflict with any zoning regulation and map.
   (C)   In granting variances and modifications, the City Commission may
require the conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objectives of the requirements so varied or modified.

Procedure shall apply if an off premise sign is to be relocated within the city
limits for any reason.
         (a)   RULE OF FORMAL ABANDONMENT PROCEDURE. If an off-premise sign is
applied for through the formal abandonment procedure, then these signs shall
have a minimum spacing of 1,500 feet. If the spacing interval for the proposed
sign structure is not feasible and if the placement of the proposed sign
structure will be closer than 1,500 feet to only 1 other existing sign, then
this spacing distance may be reduced through the variance procedure. A maximum
of 300 square feet of sign area is allowed. The sign area shall only be 10 foot
high by 30 foot long with no increases for sign area, excluding trim, walkways,
and structure, allowed through the variance procedure. A minimum setback of 10
feet, and a maximum overall height of 35 feet will be enforced, unless
otherwise amended through the variance procedure. New OFF-PREMISE SIGNS are

formal abandonment.
            2.   Formal abandonment is the procedure in which a new off premise
sign site may be established.
            3.   Prior to proposing a new site location, the lot owner shall
put into writing that the owner/applicant intends to abandon the off premise
sign site and propose a new site to locate the OFF- PREMISE SIGN.
            4.   Permit is required.
            5.   The removal of the existing sign structure and site clean up
of all debris and the erection of the new sign must be completed within 120
working days (Monday through Friday) with no extensions allowed.
            6.   This includes signs brought down by acts of God or actions
beyond our control.
            7.   If the OFF-PREMISE SIGN is proposed for property abutting
state right-of-way, the sign has to meet those requirements prior to city
permit issuance.
            8.   Existing OFF-PREMISE SIGNS may not be expanded in any
dimension including stacking.
            9.   The state has jurisdiction over primary highways. Highway 87

§ 156.133 COMPUTATIONS; “AREA” AND “HEIGHT” AND NUMBER OF SIGNS ALLOWED.
   (A)   Sign limits. Individual sign size and total sign area limits addresses
aesthetic and safety reasons as the limits on the number of signs addresses the
issues of clutter prevention.
   (B)   Computation of area of individual signs. The area of a sign face
(which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only 1 face)
shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle,
or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing,
representation, emblem, or other display, together, with any material or color
forming an integral part of the background of this display or used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is
placed, but not including any supporting framework, bracing, or decorative
fence or wall when the fence or wall otherwise meets zoning ordinance
regulations and is clearly incidental to the display itself.
   (C)   Computation of area of multi-faced signs. The sign area for a sign
with more than 1 face shall be computed by adding together the area of all sign
faces visible from any one point. When 2 identical sign faces are placed back
to back, so that both faces can not be viewed from any point at the same time,
and when the sign faces are part of the same sign structure and are not more
that 48 inches apart, the sign area shall be computed by the measurement of 1
of the faces.
   (D)   Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as the
distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest
attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be construed to be the newly
established grade after construction, exclusive of any filling, berming,
mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign. In cases
in which the normal grade cannot reasonably be determined, sign height shall be
computed on the assumption that the elevation of the normal grade at the base
of the sign is equal to the elevation of the nearest point of the crown of a
public street or the grade of the land at the principal entrance to the
principal structure on the lot, whichever is lower. If the sign is located on a
building structure, this structure shall be considered the base of the sign and
shall be included in overall height computation. Maximum height shall be 35
feet unless a variance is approved by the Board of Adjustment.
   (E)   Number. Number of sign strictures per business allowed on property are
3 unless designated elsewhere in these sections or calculated by wall area.

anchors shall be constructed of permanent materials and shall be permanently
attached to the ground, a building or another structure by direct attachment to
a rigid wall, frame, or structure and shall be kept in repair and in proper
state of preservation. The display surfaces of signs shall be kept neatly
painted or posted at all times.

granted by the Board of Adjustment unless and until:
      (1)   A written application for a variance is submitted demonstrating:

reasonable use of the land, building, or structure.

granting of a variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent
of this chapter, and will not be injurious to the neighborhood, or otherwise
detrimental to the public welfare.

appropriate conditions and safeguards in conformity with this chapter.
Violation of the conditions and safeguards, when made a part of the terms under
which the variance is granted, shall be deemed a violation of this chapter and
punishable under §
156.194.
   (D)   Actions of Board concerning appeals; special exceptions. In exercising
the powers set forth in division (A) above and division (C) above, the Board

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 157.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be called the “Raton-Colfax County Extraterritorial
Zoning Ordinance.”
(Ord. 81-1, passed 7-10-1981)
§ 157.002 ADOPTING AUTHORITY.
   This chapter is enacted to establish and carry into effect the several
powers, duties, and privileges conferred upon the municipality known as the
City of Raton, and the County of Colfax, in, under, and by an Act of the New
Mexico State Legislature known as NMSA §§ 3-21-1 through 3-21-14, both
inclusive, being Laws 1965, Ch. 300, together with acts amendatory thereof, and
supplementary thereto, including the designation of the municipality, which
shall be hereinafter referred to as the City of Raton, and the County of
Colfax, as zoning authorities.
(Ord. 81-1, passed 7-10-1981)
§ 157.003 PURPOSES.
   (A)   This chapter is intended to promote health, safety, morals, and the
general welfare, and may regulate and restrict the following:
      (1)   Height, number of stories and size of buildings and other
structures;
      (2)   Percentage of a lot that may be occupied;
      (3)   Size of yards, courts and other open space;
      (4)   Density of population; and
      (5)   Location and use of buildings, structures, and land for trade,
industry, residence and other purposes.
   (B)   For said purposes, this chapter shall:
      (1)   Divide the territory under Joint Raton-Colfax County Zoning
Authority jurisdiction into districts of such number, shape, area and form as
is necessary to carry out the purposes of NMSA §§ 3-21-1 through 3-21-14;
      (2)   Regulate or restrict the erection, construction, reconstruction, or
use of buildings, structures or land in each district. All such regulations
shall be uniform for each class or kinds of buildings within each district, but

      (3)   Provide for the administration and interpretation of said
regulations; and
      (4)   Provide, subject to the restrictions of NMSA § 3-21-6 for the

         (a)   Determined, established and enforced; and
         (b)   Amended, supplemented or repealed.
   (C)   Conformance to comprehensive plan.
      (1)   This chapter is in conformance with recommendations of the City of
Raton 1974 Master Plan Update and the 1979 Raton Extraterritorial Plan, and is
designed to:
         (a)   Lessen congestion in the streets or public ways;
         (b)   Secure safety from fire, flood waters, panic and other dangers;
         (c)   Provide health and general welfare;
         (d)   Provide adequate light and air;
         (e)   Prevent the overcrowding of land;
         (f)   Avoid undue concentrations of population;
         (g)   Facilitate adequate provision for the transportation, water,
sewerage, schools, parks and other public requirements; and
         (h)   Control and abate the unsightly or undesirable use of buildings
or land.
      (2)   Reasonable consideration shall be given, among other things, to the
character of the zoning areas and districts, and their peculiar suitability for
particular uses, and to conserving the value of buildings and land, and
encouraging the most appropriate use of land throughout the jurisdiction.
(Ord. 81-1, passed 7-10-1981)
§ 157.004 JURISDICTION.
   (A)   This chapter covers the territory shown on the official zoning map on
file in the office of the City Clerk. Where any provision contained herein
confers certain legal rights upon a property owner, those rights shall extend
to any property owner according to that provision, regardless of whether or not
the property owner resides within the extraterritorial zoning area.
   (B)   The zoning jurisdiction of this chapter is determined by the Joint
Powers Agreement between the Board of Colfax County Commissioners and the Raton
City Commission dated 2-2-1981, and shall be changed only by Joint Powers
Agreement. Zoning of property included by a boundary change shall be determined
by the Zoning Authority, at the time of boundary change. The location of the
municipal boundary shall be kept current on the official zoning map.
(Ord. 81-1, passed 7-10-1981)
§ 157.005 APPLICATION.
   (A)   All property is governed according to the zone in which it is located.
Any use not designated a permitted or special use in a zone is specifically
prohibited from that zone, except as otherwise provided herein.
   (B)   No building or land shall hereafter be used or occupied and no
building or structure or part thereof shall be erected, moved or structurally
altered except in conformity with the regulations of this chapter or amendments
thereto, for the district in which it is located.
   (C)   No building shall hereafter be erected or altered so as to exceed the
height limit, or to exceed the density regulations of this chapter for the
district in which it is located.
   (D)   No lot, even though it may consist of 1 or more adjacent lots of
record, shall be reduced in size so that the lot width or depth, front, side or
rear yards, lot area per dwelling or other requirements of this chapter are not
maintained.
   (E)   No part of a yard or other open space required about any building for
the purpose of complying with the provisions of this chapter shall be included
as a part of a yard or other open space similarly required for another
building.
   (F)   Only 1 principal building and its customary accessory buildings may
hereafter be erected on any lot, except as authorized in the RM-1 Multi-family
District, nor shall any building be erected on any lot which does not abut at

(Ord. 81-1, passed 7-10-1981; Am. Ord. 97-2, passed 4-24-1997)
§ 157.006 INTERPRETATIONS AND CONFLICTS.
   The regulations of this chapter are held to include the minimum standards
necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter. This chapter is not
intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any easement, covenant or other
agreement between parties or other valid ordinances. Where this chapter imposes
a greater restriction than is imposed by other rules, regulations, easements,
covenants, agreements, or ordinances, the provisions of this chapter control.
(Ord. 81-1, passed 7-10-1981)
§ 157.007 SEVERABILITY.
   If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or part
hereof is declared unconstitutional or invalid, the validation of the remaining
portions shall not be affected, since it is the express intent of the Raton-
Colfax County Extraterritorial Zoning Authority to pass each section,
subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, phrase or provisions, and every part
thereof separately and independently of every other part.
(Ord. 81-1, passed 7-10-1981)
ADMINISTRATION
§ 157.010 EXTRATERRITORIAL ZONING AUTHORITY.
   (A)   Establishment and organization.
      (1)   Pursuant to NMSA § 3-21-2, the City of Raton and the County of
Colfax did enter into an agreement dated 2-2-1981, establishing
extraterritorial zoning, an Extraterritorial Zoning Commission, and a Joint
Municipal-County Zoning Authority which shall hereafter also be known as the
Extraterritorial Zoning Authority.
      (2)   The Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall consist of 2
Commissioners from the Board of Colfax County Commissioners and 1 member of the
Raton City Commission.
      (3)   The members of the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall serve at
the pleasure of the body appointing them.
      (4)   Members of the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall disqualify
themselves from participation or voting on any matter which would result in
substantial change in the value of their real estate interest, or the real
estate interest of any person related to them, or would, in any other way, be a
conflict of interest.
   (B)   Powers and duties. Pursuant to NMSA §§ 3-21-1 through 3-31-11, the
Extraterritorial Zoning Authority receives certain powers and duties, including
that to:
      (1)   Adopt and enforce this chapter;
      (2)   Hear and take appropriate action on variances and appeals; and
      (3)   Appoint a commission to administer this chapter and recommend
action to the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority.
   (C)   Meetings.
      (1)   Meetings of the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall be held at
the call of the Chairman, and at such other times as the Extraterritorial
Zoning Authority may determine. The Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall
keep minutes of its proceedings showing the vote upon each question and shall
keep records of its examination and other official actions, all of which shall
be filed in the office of the Extraterritorial Zoning Enforcement Officer.
      (2)   Meetings of the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall be open to
the public as required by state law, with the news media being properly
notified.
   (D)   Appeals to the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority.
      (1)   The Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall provide by resolution
the procedure to be followed in considering appeals allowed by this section.
      (2)   Any aggrieved person or any officer, department, board or bureau of
the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority affected by a decision of an
administrative officer, commission or committee in the enforcement of NMSA §§
3-21-1 through 3-21-14 or ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation adopted
pursuant to these sections may appeal to the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority.
An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action appealed
unless the officer, commission or committee from whom the appeal is taken
certifies that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause
imminent peril of life or property. Upon certification, the proceedings shall
not be stayed except by order of district court after notice to the official,
commission or committee from whom the appeal is taken and a due cause shown.
      (3)   When an appeal alleges that there is error in any order,
requirement, decision or determination by an administrative official,
commission or committee in the enforcement of NMSA §§ 3-21-1 through 3-21-14 or
any ordinance, resolution, rule or regulation adopted pursuant to these
sections, the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority by a majority vote of all its
members may:
         (a)   Authorize, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate
conditions and safeguards, special exceptions to the terms of this chapter:
            1.   Which are not contrary to the public interest;
         2.   Where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of this
chapter will result in unnecessary hardships; and
            3.   So that the spirit of this chapter is observed and substantial
justice done; or
         (b)   In conformity with NMSA §§ 3-21-1 through 3-21-14:
            1.   Reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of
an administrative official, commission or committee;
            2.   Decide in favor of the appellant; or
            3.   Make any change in any order, requirement, decision or
determination of an administrative official, commission or committee.
   (E)   Variances.
      (1)   Every property owner within the extraterritorial zoning area shall
have the right to apply to the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority for a variance
from this chapter when the property owner can show an exceptional situation or
condition relating to the property such that the strict enforcement of this
chapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship upon the owner of such
property.
      (2)   Prior to granting any variance from this chapter, the
Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall hold a public meeting and shall
determine that:
         (a)   The granting of the variance will not be injurious to the public
health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community;
         (b)   The use or value of the area adjacent to the property included
in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;
         (c)   The need for the variance arises from some conditions peculiar
to the property involved and such condition is not due to the general
conditions of the neighborhood;
         (d)   The literal interpretation of the provisions of this chapter
would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other properties in
the same district under the terms of this chapter; and
         (e)   The grant of the variance would be within the spirit, intent,
purpose and general plan of this chapter. Absent a showing of extreme hardship
or a complete loss of any financial benefit in the property, the
Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall not approve a request for a variance
where the applicant purchased the property after the effective date of this
chapter and the condition requiring the variance was in existence at the time
of the purchase.
      (3)   The Extraterritorial Zoning Authority shall by resolution adopt and
set forth the procedures to be followed on all variance applications.
      (4)   Following the denial of any application for a variance from this
chapter, the applicant for the variance shall not reapply to the
Extraterritorial Zoning Authority for the same variance on the same property
for a period of 1 year. This restriction on reapplying for a variance from this
chapter does not in any way limit or restrict the right of the applicant to
appeal the denial by the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority of his or her
request for a variance to the District Court, said procedure for appeal as
hereinafter set forth.
   (F)   Appeals to district court. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the
Extraterritorial Zoning Authority or any officer, department, board or bureau
of the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority may present to the district court a
petition, duly verified, setting forth that the decision is illegal, in whole
or in part, and specifying the grounds of illegality. The petition shall be
presented to the court within 30 days after the decision is entered in the
records of the Clerk of the Extraterritorial Zoning Authority.
(Ord. 81-1, passed 7-10-1981)
§ 157.011 EXTRATERRITORIAL ZONING COMMISSION.
   (A)   Establishment and organization.
      (1)   Pursuant to an agreement dated 2-2-1981, the City of Raton and the
County of Colfax did enter into an agreement establishing an Extraterritorial
Zoning Commission, which shall hereafter be also known as the Raton-Colfax
County Extraterritorial Zoning Commission, consisting of 2 members appointed by
the City Commission and 2 members appointed by the Board of Colfax County
Commissioners.
      (2)   The 4 Extraterritorial Zoning Commission members appointed by the
City Commission and the County Commissioners, as required, did appoint 1
additional member from an area of the county not within the zoning jurisdiction
of the municipality or within the area of the county affected by the proposed
extraterritorial zoning ordinance. Said member was and must be appointed by a
majority vote of the members appointed by the Board of County Commissioners and
the City Commission.
      (3)   The members of the Extraterritorial Zoning Commission shall serve
at the pleasure of the body appointing them and shall be appointed for terms as
follows. Of the 2 members of the Extraterritorial Zoning Commission initially
appointed by the city, 1 member shall be appointed for a 2-year term and 1
member shall be appointed for a 1-year term, in order that the members have
staggered terms with holdover members for the purposes of continuity. The 2
members of the Extraterritorial Zoning Commission initially appointed by the
county shall be appointed under the same arrangement involving staggered terms

§ 157.081 SPECIAL USE PERMITS FOR NON-RESIDENTIAL OFF-STREET PARKING IN
RESIDENTIAL ZONES.
   (A)   After the following design standards have been met and approved by the
Zoning Commission, the Zoning Authority shall hold a public hearing before
making a final decision in relation to the issuance of the special use permit
for non-residential off-street parking in residential areas:
      (1)   All off-street parking facilities shall be designed with
appropriate means of access to a street or alley, as well as maneuvering areas.
      (2)   A parking space shall be determined as the space required to park 1
car and shall be not less than 200 square feet.
      (3)   Parking areas shall be used for parking of automobiles only, with
no sales, storage, repair work, dismantling, or service of any kind permitted.
      (4)   Parking areas shall have adequate drainage, and shall be provided
with bumper guards.
      (5)   Where setback lines are required from the street, the setback area
shall not be considered as part of the parking lots, but shall be properly
seeded and landscaped.
      (6)   All required parking shall be of such design and located so as to
be convenient and readily usable by the patrons.
      (7)   Sufficient area shall be provided within the property lines so that
all vehicles may enter and leave in a forward motion.
      (8)   A screen shall be required whenever a parking lot abuts or is
opposite a residential zone. The design and material of a fence or screen not
less than 3 feet nor more than 6 feet in height shall be approved by the Zoning
Commission for the purpose of giving sufficient protection to the residential
property owners from physical hazards and unsightliness.
      (9)   All parking lots shall be constructed in such a manner that
contamination by dust will not exist.
      (10)   If nighttime parking is to be permitted, it shall be lighted, with
the provision that the lights shall be shielded so as to prevent direct glare
into adjacent residential property.
   (B)   The duration of a special use permit issued under this section shall
be from 1 to 5 years. Actual time limit is to be determined by the Zoning
Authority after review of the applicant’s plans for improvement. This permit
may be revoked by the Zoning Authority after just cause is presented to the
special use permit holders.
(Ord. 81-1, passed 7-10-1981)
§ 157.082 LOADING AND UNLOADING REQUIREMENT.
   (A)   The number of off-street loading berths required by this section shall

   (B)   Off-street loading berths shall have a minimum planned dimension of 12
feet by 25 feet and 14 feet overhead clearance with adequate means for egress
and ingress.
   (C)   (1)   Retail business: One space of 300 square feet for each 5,000
square feet of floor area.

occupy more than 30% of the rear yard.
      (2)   Accessory buildings which are to be used for storage purposes only
may be erected upon a lot prior to the construction of the main buildings, but
no accessory building shall be used for a dwelling purpose except by domestic
or farm and ranch servants employed on the premises.

§ 157.091 NONCONFORMING USES.
   (A)   Continuation of nonconforming uses. Any land, building, structure or
legal use of land, building or structure which does not meet the area, height
or use requirements for the district in which it is located at the effective
date of this chapter shall be deemed nonconforming and shall be subject to the
following provisions:

no buildings shall be terminated within 5 years of the effective date of this
chapter (7-10-1981).

      (3)   Nonconforming use of building or structure. Any building or
structure nonconforming as to use requirements may be continued subject to the
following provisions:
         (a)   No structure housing a nonconforming use may be structurally
altered, extended or enlarged.
         (b)   Repairs to structures housing nonconforming uses are limited to
those required by a proper authority to render an unsafe structure safe, to
replace portions deteriorated by everyday use and activity and the repair of
damage caused by an act of God, fire, explosion of the public enemy, when such
damage is equal to less than 50% of the structure’s value in place.
         (c)   Any nonconforming use of a building or structure may be
continued provided that such use is not extended to other portions of the
building occupied by conforming uses at the effective date of this chapter.
Change of any nonconforming use shall be of a non-reverting nature. Change from
one nonconforming use to another nonconforming use shall not be permitted.
   (B)   Abandonment. If a nonconforming use involving a structure is
discontinued from active use for a period of 1 year, further use of the
structure shall be for a conforming use. If a nonconforming use not involving a
structure is discontinued from active use for a period of 6 months, further use
of the property shall be for a conforming use.
   (C)   Construction in progress. Nothing in this chapter shall require
changes in the plans, construction or designated use of a building for which a
lawful permit has been heretofore issued or which has been otherwise lawfully
authorized, and the construction of which shall have been actually begun within

the public interest.
   (B)   Appropriate conditions and safeguards. In granting any special use,
the Zoning Authority may prescribe appropriate conditions and safeguards in
conformity with this chapter. Violation of such conditions and safeguards, when
made a part of the terms under which the special use is granted, shall be

that the person making the application is authorized to make such an
application.
      (3)   Such application shall contain the full names and addresses of the
applicant and the owner (and if the owner is a corporate body, of its
responsible officers).
      (4)   Such application shall describe briefly the proposed use and shall
give such additional information as may be required by the Enforcement Officer
for an intelligent understanding of the proposed use.
   (C)   Plans. Application for permits shall be accompanied by such drawings
of the proposed work, drawn to scale, including such flood plains, sections,
elevations and structural details as the Enforcement Officer may require.
   (D)   Plot diagrams. There shall also be filed a plot diagram showing the
lot in a form and size suitable for filing permanently within the permit
record, drawn to scale, with all dimension figures, showing accurately by the
size and exact location of all proposed new construction or in the case of
demolition, of such construction as is to be demolished and of all existing
buildings and structures that are to remain.
   (E)   Amendments. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the filing of
amendments to an application or to a plan or other record, accompanying the

ordinances applicable thereto, he or she shall approve such application and
issue a permit for the proposed use as soon as practicable. If his or her
examination reveals otherwise, he or she will reject such application, noting
his or her findings in a report to be attached to the application and
delivering a copy to the applicant.

plat of which a plat diagram has been filed and has been used as basis for a
permit, unless a revised plat diagram showing the proposed change in conditions
shall have been filed and approved, providing that this shall not apply when
the lot is reduced by reason of a street opening or widening or other public
improvement.
   (I)   Signature required. Every use permit issued by the Extraterritorial
Zoning Enforcement Officer under the provisions of this chapter shall have his
or her signature affixed thereto.

construction of the Project or Reliability Project be commenced; and, if the
Authority determines that the Project or Reliability Project is still feasible,
it may proceed with the issuance, sale and delivery of bonds.
         c.   If any Municipality disapproves a Project or Reliability Project,
and the Authority thereafter proceeds with the issuance of bonds as provided
above in Subsection 2.4.4.b, then the Municipality which failed to approve the
Project or Reliability Project shall be required to, within sixty (60) days of
being notified by the Authority that it will proceed with the issuance, sale
and delivery of bonds for such Project or Reliability Project, elect which of
the two options, described below, that will govern with respect to its pre-
existing obligations to the Authority and its future responsibilities to and
relationship with the Authority.
            (i)   Option One. If a Municipality elects Option One, it will
continue to remain a constituent member Municipality of the Authority and it
will be entitled to participate in all future Projects or Reliability Projects
approved by the Authority, subject, however, to the provisions of this Section
2.4. A Municipality selecting Option One will continue to be obligated to pay
to the Authority its proportionate share of all expenses incurred by the
Authority, including debt service, for all Projects, Reliability Projects,
Planning, Operation and Maintenance Expenditures and all other proper and
appropriate expenses for which the Authority has become obligated up to the
time of the effective date of the selection by the Municipality of Option One.
Further, the disapproving Municipality electing Option One shall be obligated
to pay its proportionate share of all other expenses incurred by the Authority
subsequent to its selection of Option One, except those costs, including debt
service, directly allocated to the disapproved Project or Reliability Project,
as determined by generally accepted accounting principles and the Uniform
System of Accounts.
            (ii)   Option Two. If a Municipality elects Option Two, it will
sever its future relationship with the Authority and will not be entitled to
participate in any future Projects or Reliability Projects approved by the
Authority. A Municipality selecting Option Two will be entitled to receive
power from any Project or Reliability Project that it participated in prior to
the selection of Option Two and will continue to be obligated to pay to the
Authority its proportionate share of all expenses incurred by the Authority,
including debt service, for all Projects, Reliability Projects, Planning,
Operation and Maintenance Expenditures and all other proper and appropriate
expenses for which the Authority has become obligated up to the time of the
effective date of the selection by the Municipality of Option Two.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that all other Municipalities
unanimously agree to assume the pre-existing obligations as described above,
the disapproving Municipality shall be relieved of any other financial
obligations to the Authority.
         The foregoing options described in Subsection 2.4.4.c. may be modified
if, and to the extent that, such modification is approved by bond resolutions
or other agreements subsequently entered into by and between the Authority and
the Municipalities.
      2.5   BOARD OF DIRECTORS: The governing body of the Authority shall be a
Board of Directors in which all legislative power of the Authority is vested.
         2.5.1   Number: Each Municipality which becomes a party to this
Contract or any amendment or modification thereof shall have two (2)
representatives on the Board of Directors. The initial Board of Directors shall
consist of twelve (12) members.
         2.5.2   Appointment: The governing body of each of the Municipalities
(acting alone, or with the concurrence of its Utilities Board, Power Board, or
other appropriate local agency, in the discretion of the governing body, unless
such concurrence be required by home rule charter or other applicable law)
shall appoint two (2) members to the Board of Directors. Each Director so
appointed shall be a citizen and resident of the appointing Municipality, or a
customer receiving electric service within the appointing Municipality’s
service area.
         The City Council or City Commission may seek the advice of its Power
Board or Utilities Board prior to making the appointments required hereunder.
Further, the City Council or Commission may, but shall not be required to,
request that its Power Board or Utilities Board submit a list of qualified
candidates to the City Council or Commission to assist the members thereof in
making the appointments to the Board of Directors.
         Each Director shall file with the Board of Directors a certified copy
of the appropriate action taken by the Municipality evidencing his appointment.
The initial appointments to the Board and the term of office of the Directors
shall be made in accordance with Section 2.5.3.

representatives to serve on the initial Board of Directors in the following

appointed and written notice thereof has been received by the Authority.
         b.   The second representative appointed to the initial Board by each
Municipality shall serve a term to expire on December 31, 1983 and until his
successor is appointed and written notice thereof has been received by the
Authority.
APPOINTMENTS SUBSEQUENT TO EXPIRATION OF TERM OF INITIAL BOARD OF DIRECTORS
         Successive representatives on the Board of Directors shall be
appointed for a period of four (4) years and until their successors are

Authority.
         2.5.4   Removal: Any Director appointed by a Municipality may be
removed at any time by such Municipality, with or without cause.
         2.5.5   Vacancies: A vacancy occurring on the Board of Directors,
whether such vacancy be the result of resignation, death, removal or
disability, shall be filled by the appointment of a successor Director by the
Municipality which appointed the Director whose office has become vacant. Any
such successor Director so appointed shall serve the unexpired remainder of the
term of the Director causing the vacancy.
         2.5.6   Compensation: Directors shall not receive compensation for
their services, but the Board of Directors may, by resolution, provide for
reimbursement to Directors of their actual expenses for attendance at meetings
of the Board of Directors and for expenses otherwise incurred on behalf of the
Authority.
         2.5.7   Annual meetings: An annual meeting of the Board of Directors
shall be held on the second Tuesday in January in each year at such time and
place as shall be designated in the notice of the meeting, for the purpose of
electing officers, passing upon reports for the preceding fiscal year and to
transact such other business as may come before the Board. If the day fixed for
the annual meeting shall fall on a legal holiday, the annual meeting shall be
held on the next succeeding business day. Failure to hold the annual meeting at
a designated time, or failure to hold the annual meeting in any year, shall not
cause a forfeiture or dissolution or otherwise affect the Authority.
         2.5.8   Regular meetings: The Board of Directors may, from time to
time, provide by resolution for the time and place for the holding of any
regular meetings without notice to Directors other than such resolution. The
Secretary shall provide each Director with a written agenda of matters intended
to be considered at said regular meeting at least five (5) days prior to the
meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may transact any
business properly before it at such meeting, whether or not listed on the
written agenda.
         2.5.9   Special meetings: Special meetings of the Board of Directors
may be called by the President or any two Directors; provided, however, that
the two Directors desiring the special meeting are not representatives of the
same Municipality. It shall thereupon be the duty of the Secretary to cause
notice of such meeting to be given as hereinafter provided. Under circumstances
wherein the President is unable to act by reason of absence, disability or any
other reason, the Vice President shall assume the authority of the President
herein provided. Special meetings of the Board of Directors shall be held at
such time and place as shall be fixed by the President (or Vice President) or
the Directors calling the meeting.
         2.5.10   Notice of meetings: Written notice of the annual or of any
special meeting of the Board of Directors shall be delivered to each Director
not less than five (5) nor more than thirty-five (35) days before the date
fixed for such meeting, either personally or by mail, by or at the discretion
of the Secretary, or, upon his default, by the person calling the meeting. If
mailed, such notice shall be deemed to be delivered when deposited in the

the records of the Authority, with postage thereon prepaid. The written notice
shall include an agenda of matters to be considered at the annual or special
meeting.
         2.5.11   Waiver of notice: Whenever any notice is required to be given
to any Director of the Authority under the provisions of law or this Contract,
a waiver thereof in writing signed by such Director, whether before or after
the time stated therein, shall be equivalent to the giving of such notice.
Attendance of a Director at any meeting of the Board of Directors shall
constitute a waiver by such Director of notice of such meeting except when such
Director attends such meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the
transaction of any business because the meeting is not lawfully called or
convened.
         2.5.12   Quorum: A majority of the number of the voting Directors then
in office and present at a meeting in person and representing a majority of the
constituent Municipalities shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business; provided that, if less than a quorum is present at a meeting, a
majority of the Directors present may adjourn the meeting from time to time;
and, provided further, that the Secretary shall notify any absent Directors of
the time and place of such adjourned meeting.
         2.5.13 Voting: Subject to the conditions hereinafter provided, the act
of a majority of the Directors voting at a meeting at which a quorum is present
shall be the act of the Board of Directors. If any one Director from a
Municipality is not in attendance at any meeting, the other Director from the
same Municipality as the absent Director may cast two votes for that particular
Municipality.
         If, however, on any question coming before the Board at least forty
(40) per cent of the votes are cast in the minority with respect to said
question, then in such event, and notwithstanding the provision stated above
regarding majority voting, any Director voting in the minority shall have the
right to request a “weighted vote.” The act of a majority of the weighted vote
cast at the meeting shall be determinative of the question before the Board.
Voting under the provisions for a weighted vote shall be by constituent
Municipality; provided, however, that if the individual Directors present at a
meeting from a constituent Municipality are unable to agree on a collective
vote for their Municipality, then, in that event, each Director from the
Municipality shall cast a vote equal to fifty (50) per cent of the weighted
vote accorded to that Municipality. If any one Director from a Municipality is
not in attendance at a meeting, the other Director from the same Municipality
as the absent Director may cast the entire weighted vote assigned to that
particular Municipality.
         The weighted vote for each Municipality shall be determined as
follows:
         (A)   The percentage which the KWH sold by a Municipality for the
preceding calendar year bears to the total KWH sold by all the constituent
Municipalities during the same period; said percentage shall then be expressed
in numerical form in proportion to the total number of votes on the Board of
Directors,
   and
         (B)   To the weighted figure determined in accordance with paragraph
(A) immediately above, two votes shall be added thereto, the result thereof
being the weighted vote of the Municipality.
         2.5.14   Vote in case of a deadlock: In the event the Board of
Directors is deadlocked and unable to obtain a majority vote of the Directors
at a meeting at which a quorum is present either in favor of or in opposition
to a matter being considered by the Board for action, any Director may require
a weighted vote. A weighted vote shall then be taken in accordance with the
weighted vote provisions of Section 2.5.13. The act of a majority of the
weighted vote shall be the act of the Board of Directors.
         2.5.15   Advisory members of the board: Each Municipality shall be
entitled, if it so desires, to have in attendance at any meeting of the Board
of Directors, as a non-voting member of the Board, in an advisory capacity, any
designated representative of the Municipality involved.
         2.5.16   Duties: The duties of the Board of Directors shall be:
         (i)   To govern the business and affairs of the Authority.
         (ii)   To exercise all power of the Authority.
         (iii)   To comply with the provisions of law, including, without
limitation, parts 1, 2, 5 and 6 of Article I of Title 29 of C.R.S. 1973.

         2.6.1   Initial election of officers: At the first meeting of the
Board of Directors, the members of the Board of Directors shall elect officers.

not be required for the office of General Manager.
         2.6.2   Regular elections and term of office: With the exception of
the General Manager, the officers shall be elected annually by the Board of

may be filled at any meeting of the Board of Directors. Except as to the
provisions governing removal of officers, each officer shall hold office until
the next succeeding annual meeting of the Board of Directors and until his
successor is elected.
         2.6.3   Removal: Any officer or agent elected or appointed by the
Board of Directors, including the General Manager, may be removed by majority
vote of the Board of Directors, with or without cause, unless otherwise
controlled by the terms and conditions of any employee agreements entered into

such bond shall be an expense payable by the Authority.
         2.6.6   Compensation: The President, Vice President, Secretary and

Directors may, by resolution, provide for reimbursement of their actual
expenses for attendance at meetings of the Board of Directors and for expenses
otherwise incurred in carrying out their duties on behalf of the Authority. The
General Manager shall receive a salary for the services rendered to the
Authority and the compensation for such services shall be fixed from time to

expenses actually and necessarily incurred by him in connection with the
defense of any action, suit or proceeding in which he may be involved or to
which he may be made a party by reason of his being or having been such
Director or officer, except in relation to matters as to which he shall be
finally adjudged in such action, suit or proceding to be liable for negligence
or misconduct in the performance of duty. Such costs and expenses shall include
amounts reasonably paid in settlement for the purpose of curtailing the costs
of litigation, but only if the authority is advised in writing by its counsel
that in his opinion the person indemnified did not commit such negligence or
misconduct. The foregoing right of indemnification shall not be exclusive of
other rights to which he may be entitled as a matter of law or by agreement.
      2.8   TERM OF CONTRACT: This Contract shall continue in force and effect
until December 31, 2024, and until thereafter terminated by any Municipality,
following not less than six (6) months written notice to the other
Municipalities of its intention to terminate; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this
Contract may be amended, modified, rescinded or terminated at any time by a
written document approved and executed by each and every Municipality which, at
such time, is a party to this Contract; PROVIDED FURTHER, HOWEVER, that this
Contract may not in any event be rescinded or terminated so long as the
Authority has bonds, notes or other obligtaions outstanding, unless provision
for full payment of such obligations, by escrow or otherwise, has been made
pursuant to the terms of such obligations.
      2.9   PROPERTIES: All assets and properties of the Authority shall be
held in trust for the purposes herein mentioned, including the payment of
liabilities of the Authority.
         2.10   DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS UPON TERMINATION: In the event of the
rescission or termination of this Contract and the dissolution of the
Authority, all the assets of the Authority shall be distributed by the Board of
Directors. In distributing the assets, the then governing Board of Directors
shall have the power and obligation to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of
the assets of the Authority. Said disposition may be to any person, firm or
corporation, including any contracting Municipality or combination of such
Municipalities, upon such terms and conditions as may be deemed appropriate by
the then governing Board of Directors of the Authority. All sales proceeds or
other revenues obtained as a result of transfers upon termination, and all
assets of the Authority shall be distributed to each contracting Municipality,
including the distribution of assets in kind, on the basis of the proportion
which the total dollar amount of electric power and energy purchased and paid
for by such Municipality from the Authority during its existence bears to the
total dollar amount of all electric power and energy committed to be purchased
and paid for by the Municipalities from the Authority during its existence;
provided further, however, that in the event that the Authority is dissolved
prior to the actual delivery and purchase of electric power and energy by the
Municipalities from the Authority, then, in that event, the assets of the
Authority shall be distributed on the basis of the pro rata share that each
contracting Municipality contributed in money or property to the Authority when
compared to the total contribution in money or property made by all contracting
Municipalities during the existence of the Authority.
      For the purposes of this section, the term “assets” shall not include any
assets held or set aside for full payment of the Authority’s bonds, notes or
other outstanding obligations as set forth in Section 2.8 hereof.
      The determination made by the Board of Directors of the Authority in
calculating the manner in which the assets shall be distributed to the
contracting Municipalities, including distribution of assets in kind, shall be
in good faith.
      In the event that there shall be a dispute concerning the distribution of
assets to the Municipalities upon termination of the Authority, any
Municipality so desiring shall have the right to refer the dispute to
arbitration. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following
shall be considered disputes for the purpose of arbitration:
      (1)   all questions relating to the manner in which the assets of the
Authority are to be distributed to the Municipalities;
      (2)   all questions relating to the determination and application of the
distribution formula hereinabove stated;
      (3)   all questions relating to the valuation of assets under
circumstances where distribution, in whole or in part, is to be made in kind.
      It is the intent and purpose of the parties hereto to make the submission
to arbitration of any controversy, claim or demand relating to the distribution
of assets upon termination, as stated above, a condition precedent to any
action at law, suit in equity or court proceeding of any nature. Any judicial
proceeding instituted with respect to any dispute arising out of the
distribution of assets upon termination shall be stayed or dismissed pending
resolution thereof by arbitration.
      Any Municipality desiring to elect to proceed to arbitration hereunder
shall first provide thirty (30) days’ written notice of its intention to so
proceed to the Board of Directors of the Authority and all contracting
Municipalities. Said written notice shall specify the reasons under which said
Municipality believes the distribution so determined by the Board to be
erroneous or improper. Upon receipt of the aforesaid written notice, the Board
shall thereupon call a special meeting for the purpose of reconsidering its
decision concerning the distribution of assets in light of the reasons
specified in the written notice of the moving party. The Board shall review the
entire distribution formula in the reconsideration of its decision as
hereinabove provided.
      Said special meeting of the Board shall be held no earlier than five (5)
days nor later than fifteen (15) days after receipt of the written notice of
intent to proceed to arbitration. If the Board of Directors shall, upon
reconsideration, determine that its decision governing the distribution of
assets should not be modified, then the moving party shall have the right to
proceed to arbitration. The right to submit a dispute to arbitration shall
arise upon the expiration of the thirty (30) days’ notice or the decision of
the Board made after reconsideration in the special meeting provided above,
whichever is earlier. All other contracting Municipalities shall have the right
to intervene and fully participate in any such arbitration proceeding. If, upon
reconsideration of its initial decision as set forth above, the Board modifies
said decision, then any contracting Municipality shall thereafter have the
right to proceed to arbitration without the necessity of requesting
reconsideration by the Board.
      Any Municipality desiring arbitration shall, upon satisfaction of the
conditions stated above, forward a written request for selection of a competent
arbitrator to the Chairman of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission. The
parties agree to abide by the decision of the Commission Chairman in selecting
the arbitrator. It is also agreed that the Commission Chairman, in making his
selection of an arbitrator, may seek the advice and counsel of the other
Commissioners of the Colorado Public Utilities Commission.
      If the Commission Chairman fails to act in the selection of an arbitrator
within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written request, or if the
arbitrator selected fails or is unable to act, a panel of three arbitrators
shall be selected, one by the Municipality requesting arbitration, one by the
Board of Directors of the Authority and the third by the two so chosen, and the
decision of any two of said arbitrators shall be the decision of the
arbitration panel.
      No one shall be qualified to act as an arbitrator who is a resident of
any member Municipality, or who has, directly or indirectly, any financial
interest in the Authority, or who has, directly or indirectly, any business
relationship with the Authority.
      The arbitration proceeding shall be held within forty-five (45) days
following the selection and qualification of the arbitrator or arbitration
panel. Notice of the time and place of the arbitration hearing shall be
provided by the Secretary of the Authority to each contracting Municipality at
least thirty-five (35) days prior to the hearing.
      The fees and expenses of the arbitration and the assessment thereof shall
be determined by the arbitrator or arbitration panel and included in the award.
      Arbitration of any dispute under this section shall be conducted in
accordance with the Colorado Uniform Arbitration Act, C.R.S. 1973, § 13-22-201
et seq., and the then current rules and practices of The American Arbitration
Association, except that if such rules and practices shall conflict with the
Colorado Uniform Arbitration Act or Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure or any
other provision of Colorado law then in force, such Colorado law and rules
shall govern. Arbitration may proceed in the absence of any party if notice of
the proceedings has been given to such party. Appearance at the hearing waives
any defect in the notice thereof unless said appearance is made for the express
purpose of objecting to the commencement of the arbitration proceeding on the
grounds that proper notice was not provided as required herein.
      The procedures governing the confirming, vacating, correction,
modification and appeal of the award of the arbitrator or arbitration panel
shall be as set forth in the Colorado Uniform Arbitration Act, C.R.S. 1973, §
13-22-201 et seq., or any amendments thereto.
      It is specifically agreed and understood that any party hereto may seek
judicial review of the decision of the arbitrator or arbitration panel, and
pending said judicial review, the moving party may obtain a stay of execution
on the judgment or award. Said stay of execution shall remain in full force and
effect until all remedies for judicial review have been exhausted.
      The parties hereto agree that the award of the arbitrator or arbitration
panel may be filed with the Clerk of the District Court in the judicial
district wherein the principal place of business of the Authority is located,
as a basis of judgment and the issuance of execution thereon, and, at the
election of the party making such filing, with the Clerk of one or more courts,
state or federal, having jurisdiction over the parties herein.
      The parties hereto agree that the foregoing provision regarding
arbitration shall be severable and, if any court having jurisdiction thereof
determines that the said arbitration provision is invalid or void, such
determination shall not render the entire contract invalid.
         2.11   SEAL: The Corporate Seal of the Authority shall be in the form
of two concentric circles and shall have inscribed thereon “SEAL, ARKANSAS
RIVER POWER AUTHORITY, COLORADO.”

manner as shall from time to time be determined by resolution of the Board of
Directors.
         2.15   DEPOSITS: All funds of the Authority shall be deposited from
time to time to the credit of the Authority, pursuant to law, in such bank or
banks as the Board of Directors may select, provided that any such deposits
shall be secured by a surety bond or pledge of collateral security as required
under the provisions of C.R.S. 1973, § 32-1-701, as amended.

electric power and energy requirements of the Municipalities.
   4.   POLITICAL SUBDIVISION: The Authority shall be a political subdivision
and a public corporation of the State of Colorado, separate from the
contracting Municipalities, and shall be a validly created and existing
political subdivision and public corporation of the State of Colorado,
irrespective of whether a contracting Municipality, including a city or town of
an adjoining state, withdraws (whether by operation of law or otherwise) from
such governmental entity subsequent to its creation, and it is hereby agreed
that such withdrawal shall not itself result in the rescission or termination
of this Contract, or any amendments thereto. The Authority shall have the
duties, privileges, immunities, rights, liabilities and disabilities of a
public body politic and corporate.
   5.   DEBT NOT THAT OF MUNICIPALITIES: The bonds, notes and other obligations

other obligations pursuant to the terms, conditions and authorization contained
in C.R.S. 1973, § 29-1-204(7), and all laws hereafter adopted amendatory
thereof or supplemental thereto, except as such amendments or supplementation,
if applied, would result in an impairment of contract in violation of state or
federal constitutions.
   7.   LIMITATIONS ON FUNDS: In addition to any other requirements or
limitations with respect to funds of the Authority, the limitations imposed by
C.R.S. 1973, § 32-1-701, and all acts amendatory thereof or supplemental

shall be the successor to the Non-Profit Corporation, and the Authority is and
shall be entitled to all rights and privileges and shall assume all obligations
and liabilities of the Non-Profit Corporation under contracts to which the Non-
Profit Corporation is a party and which contracts are existing on the date the
Authority is established. As soon as practicable after the Authority has been
established, and the approvals, if any are required, of the Colorado Public
Utilities Commission, lenders, joint participants or others, as the case may
be, have been obtained, the Non-Profit Corporation shall assign, transfer and
convey all of its properties, whether real or personal, tangible or intangible,
to the Authority and the Authority shall assume all obligations and liabilities
of the Non-Profit Corporation. After such succession and transition has been
completed, the Non-Profit Corporation shall be dissolved.
   9.   DELINQUENCY: Subject to the terms, conditions or limitations set forth
in other sections of this Organic Contract, each Municipality may be assessed,
from proprietary funds, for its proportionate share of the expenses incurred or
budgeted by the Authority. Said proportionate share shall be determined on the
basis of each Municipality’s KWH sales in the preceding calendar year to the
total KWH sales of all the Municipalities in the preceding calendar year. The
Authority shall bill each Municipality for its proportionate share of the
Authority’s expenses, as described above, on a monthly basis. If a Municipality
fails to make any payment within sixty (60) days following the date of receipt
of the bill from the Authority, the remaining Municipalities which are current
in the payment of their bills may, by unanimous approval, terminate the
delinquent Municipality’s further participation in the activities of the
Authority and under this Organic Contract. Said sixty (60) day period may be
extended by unanimous consent of the Municipalities upon request by a
delinquent Municipality.
   10.   FILING OF CONTRACT: A copy of this Organic Contract, and any amendment
or modification thereof, shall be filed with the Division of Local Government
of the State of Colorado as soon as practicable following its execution by the
Municipalities and in all events within ten (10) days after its execution by
the Municipalities. On or before February 1 of each year, the Authority shall
file, with the Colorado Division of Local Government, an informational list of
all contracts in effect with other political subdivisions, pursuant to the
requirements of C.R.S. 1973, § 29-1-205, and all laws amendatory thereof or
supplemental thereto.

ELECTRIC FRANCHISE
   Editor’s note: Material enclosed in brackets [] has been added for clarity.
ORDINANCE NO. 731
AN ORDINANCE RELATING TO THE RATON PUBLIC
SERVICE COMPANY AND GRANTING A UTILITY
FRANCHISE TO SAID COMPANY
[PREAMBLE]
   WHEREAS, the Raton Public Service Company (hereinafter called the company),
a New Mexico corporation, has for many years operated a utility in the City of
Raton, New Mexico, acting under franchise from the city, the existing franchise
being set forth in Ordinance No. 512 of the City of Raton, adopted and approved
September 10, 1960, and subsequently ratified and approved at a special
election conducted for that purpose, which franchise expired, by its terms, on
June 30, 1985, but, which has been extended temporarily; and
   WHEREAS, the City of Raton, (hereinafter called the city), is the beneficial
owner of all of the capital stock of the company, which stock (except for
qualifying shares of other directors) is presently held in the names of John H.
Lackey, Larry Stolarczyk and Curtis L. Keeler as trustees; and
   WHEREAS, the city is the absolute owner of the electric utility system
heretofore operated and managed by the company pursuant to said Ordinance No.
512, together with the right to furnish service within a service area allowed
by law; and
   WHEREAS, the city is a member of the Arkansas River Power Authority (ARPA),
a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, under authority of contract
ordinance, and law (in particular, section 3-24-14, NMSA 1978), with which it
has various contractual obligations and from which the city is currently
purchasing wholesale power, in addition to the power generated locally, at a
substantial saving over what it might otherwise be required to pay for
purchased power, and the day-to-day coordination with ARPA requires the
delegation of administrative and operational responsibility comparable to that
required for the generation of electricity; and
   WHEREAS, it is considered desirable both by the company and by the city that
the operation and management of the city’s now owned or hereafter acquired
energy production, services, sources, generation, and distribution systems and
plants (“utility system”) and the handling of the financial operations of the
utility be continued in a manner similar to that heretofore established by
Ordinance No. 512, except as hereinafter modified; and
   WHEREAS, the company has made written application to the city commission of
the City of Raton requesting the due enactment of this ordinance and
specifically consenting to all of the terms and provisions of this ordinance,
and the said John H. Lackey, Larry Stolarczyk and Curtis L. Keeler have
likewise requested and consented to all of the terms and provisions of this
ordinance.
   NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the city commission of the City of Raton,
New Mexico:
Section 1: Grant of franchise.
   From and after the effective date of this ordinance, and subject to all the
terms and provisions herein contained, the city does hereby grant to the
company the right, privilege and franchise, for a term ending December 31,
2010, to maintain and operate within the city and within all future additions
to the city and within the city’s lawful utility service area as the same may
exist from time to time hereafter, the city’s electric utility system,
including its generating plant and distribution system and such other energy
utility systems as may be transferred to the company, and the rights,
privileges and facilities available through ARPA (as may be determined from
time to time by the company), for the furnishing of utility services to the
city, and as may lawfully be furnished to others. Throughout the term of this
ordinance the company shall have the right to the free use of the rights-of-
way, streets, avenues, alleys and public places of the city and all future
additions thereto, for the purpose of erecting and maintaining poles or other
supports or otherwise emplacing utility systems, and for wires, transformers,
pipes, lines, appliances, and other equipment, and for the laying and
maintaining of conduits, pipes, lines, appliances, wires and other equipment
for the transmission and distribution of energy and energy sources; provided,
however, that the same shall be placed in such reasonable locations as may be
permitted by the city commission, and in such manner as not to interfere with
traffic or other necessary public uses.
Section 2: Fixing of rates.
   The company shall at all times furnish an ample supply of its owned,
generated or acquired energy to the city, its inhabitants and to others as may
be lawful. The city commission shall, from time to time, set, fix, determine,
and alter the rate schedules and the rates, charges and rate classifications
pertaining to all service to be rendered by the company. It shall be the duty
of the city to maintain rates at such a level and with such reasonable
classifications as shall permit the funding requirements set forth in paragraph
[section] 20 of this ordinance. Such rate tariffs shall be sufficient to meet
the efficient and long term operation of the utility by the company and also
provide for the city a sufficient net income to meet all debt service,
operational expense and reserve requirements of this ordinance and of
obligations of the city in respect of energy utility system bonds, or other
similar energy utility system obligations as the city may issue from time to
time. Until changed by the city, the existing rate schedules, rates, charges
and rate classifications shall remain in effect. The company may recommend to
the city commission, from time to time, such changes in rate schedules and
rates as appear necessary and desirable.
Section 3: Discounts.
   The company shall allow such discounts for prompt payment of bills as may be
from time to time required by the city commission. No such discount shall in
any event be allowed to any customer who shall at the time of payment be, and
remain in default in the payment of, any previous bill. Until the establishment
of some different rule by the city commission, the company shall allow a ten-
percent (10%) discount on all bills paid on or before the tenth day of the
month succeeding the month for which such bills were incurred.
Section 4: Discontinuance of service.
   Payment for all service furnished by the company shall be made by customers
at the office of the company on or before the tenth day of the month succeeding
the month in which the service was rendered; and in default of such payment the
company may, at its option, discontinue the service.
Section 5: Meter deposits.
   The company may require an advance deposit from any customer, which deposit
shall cover all meters installed and all energy to be furnished to such
customer. The deposit required by the company shall not exceed the estimated
bill for a two-month period. Each deposit shall be considered as a guaranty
fund to assure to the company the payment of all bills to become due from the
customer and ultimate return of the meter or meters concerned in good
condition, reasonable wear excepted. Upon the customer’s request for
termination of service, his meter deposit (less appropriate deduction, if any)
shall be refunded to him. The company may, at its election, waive the
requirement of a deposit in any particular case or accept in lieu of a deposit
such other security as may be acceptable to the company.
Section 6: Municipal uses.
   The company shall furnish to the city all electric energy needed by the city
for the lighting of its municipal offices, for street lighting, and for general
municipal purposes within the city’s electric utility service area, all without
requiring payment therefor from the city. For all power and electric energy
taken by the city and its departments for its proprietary purposes, including
but not limited to water treatment and pumping and sewage treatment and
disposal purposes, the city shall pay to the company the actual cost thereof,
computed as the rolling three-month average of fuel and purchased energy costs
of the energy furnished.
Section 7: Rules and regulations of the company.
   The company may make reasonable rules and regulations specifying and
controlling the types of equipment, appliances, devices, connections, easements
and operating practices which may be required in order for a customer to
receive service from the company or in order to entitle customers to the
several rate classifications now or hereafter in force. The company shall not
be required to make any service connection unless its reasonable requirements
have been complied with. The current such rules and practices of the company
are herewith approved and ratified by the city. The company may hereafter adopt
and file with the city clerk additional such regulations with the city and,
unless within thirty (30) days of such filing the city shall disapprove of such
regulationss adopted by the company under this section, then such regulations
shall be deemed to be approved and enacted by the city and in effect. Within
such thirty-day period the city commission shall have the power to require
modifications or may set aside such newly filed regulation and establish in its
stead such regulation as the city commission may consider proper and a copy of
such city enacted regulation shall then be filed with the city clerk within
thirty (30) days of its adoption.
Section 8: Internal operations.
   The company shall be solely responsible for governing its internal
operations, personnel, billing, and operational activities, and the company
shall from time to time establish policies and procedures concerning such
internal matters as it deems necessary and appropriate. The city adopts,
confirms and ratifies the existing policies and procedures of internal matters.
Section 9: Discrimination forbidden.
   The company shall never commit, practice or permit any unfair discrimination
between its customers. All rates and charges shall be applied fairly to the end
that there shall always be a uniform charge for like service under like
conditions.
Section 10: Power and authority of the company.
   The company is granted, and shall have, exercise, enjoy and use, all powers
and authority set forth under sections 3-24-1 through [3-24]-18, NMSA 1978, as
amended and as may be amended, except that reserved to the city commission in
this ordinance, and except as lawfully exercised only by the city commission.
Section 11: Police power of city.
   The city commission of the city shall adopt and enforce all such ordinances,
rules and regulations as may be necessary for the protection of the company and
the lawful conduct of its operations. The rights and privileges granted to the
company by this ordinance shall at all times be subject to the police power and
reasonable dominion of the city as the same may be exercised by general
ordinance, not destructive, however, of the rights and privileges hereby
granted.
Section 12: Company’s duty to repair.
   Whenever the company shall enter upon any street or public place for the
purpose of constructing or maintaining any portion of the transmission or
distribution system, it shall be the duty of the company to repair any damage
done by it and to remove all debris resulting from its operations.
Section 13: Agreement concerning corporate management of the company.
   In consideration of the right, privilege and franchise granted to the
company by this ordinance, and in consideration of the fact that the city is
the beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
company, it is mutually agreed by the city and the company that the corporate
management of the company is herewith transferred and vested in the board of
directors of the company, except as is otherwise retained or reserved by this
ordinance or the laws of New Mexico to the city commission. Such corporate
management and the ownership and control of its capital stock and the
disposition of the utility system earnings shall in all respects be governed by
the terms and provisions of this ordinance, including particularly sections 14
through 20, inclusive, hereinafter set forth.
Section 14: Capital stock held in trust.
   It is recognized that the present holders of all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the company hold the same as trustees for the use
and benefit of the city, and it is agreed that the city is and shall always
continue to be the beneficial owner of all the capital stock of the company
which is now, or at any time hereafter may be, issued and outstanding. The
legal holders (trustees) of said stock shall have the right, power and duty to
vote the same, but they shall always hold the same for the use and benefit of
the city. The capital stock shall carry with it no attribute, privilege or
power other than the right to vote the same, in due and proper time and manner,
for the election of three (3) of the directors of the board of directors of the
company, and for other corporate purposes not inconsistent with this franchise.
Section 15: Trustees.
   As soon as this ordinance becomes effective, all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the company (except the necessary qualifying
shares to be issued to and to stand in the names of the respective directors of
the company, not more than one such qualifying share for each director) shall
be issued to and thereafter be held equally by those persons named hereinafter
as trustees, each of whom shall serve until the date specified for the
expiration of his term. Thereafter, the city commission shall have the duty to
appoint or re-appoint a trustee or successor trustee for an additional term of
six (6) years. The terms of the trustees being staggered, one such regular
appointment or re-appointment will occur every two (2) years during the life of
the franchise. The persons serving initially as trustees are John H. Lackey,
for a term expiring June 30, 1987, Larry Stolarczyk, for a term expiring June
30, 1989, and Curtis L. Keeler, for a term expiring June 30, 1991. Each of the
trustees shall vote the shares held by him in the election of three (3) of the
corporate directors. Each of the trustees shall continue to hold his said stock
until such time as his appointed term may expire or until such time as he may
die or resign or be removed from office as hereinafter provided.
Section 16: Removal of trustees.
   A trustee may be removed from office by the city commission during his or
her appointed term for one or more of the following reasons:
   (a)   Legal incapacity;
   (b)   Willful neglect of duty or willful failure to comply with the terms of
this franchise or the laws governing the operation of a municipal utility;
   (c)   Malfeasance in office;
   (d)   Conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude; or
   (e)   Failure of the trustee to maintain his or her status as a resident of
Raton, New Mexico, or of its lawful utility service area.
   The power of removal shall be vested in a majority of the commission. The
trustee shall be entitled to a full evidentiary hearing after reasonable notice
and upon a written specification of the charges against him or her. The vote of
each member shall be announced openly and shall be recorded in the minutes, and
the concurring vote of the majority of the members of the whole commission
shall be necessary to accomplish a removal.
Section 17: Appointment of successor trustees.
   Upon the expiration of the appointed term of each such trustee, and in case
of the death, resignation or removal of any of the trustees above named or of
any successor trustee, a successor shall be appointed by the city commission;
and thereupon all of the capital stock previously held by the former trustee
shall be promptly transferred to such successor trustee and shall thereafter
stand in his or her name and be voted in like manner as if he or she were
specifically named in this ordinance as one of the trustees. Any successor
trustee appointed by the commission must be a resident of the City of Raton,
New Mexico, or of its lawful utility service area.
Section 18: Directors.
   The directors of the company shall be five (5) in number. The mayor of the
city and one other member of the city commission (to be selected by the city
commission) shall be directors of the company. The remaining three (3)
directors shall be elected by the trustees, and must be residents of the City
of Raton or of its lawful utility service area. Except as hereinabove expressly
provided, the qualifications of the directors, the method of selecting them,
and the powers of the entire board of directors shall be governed by the
ordinary business corporation laws of the State of New Mexico. Each director of
the company may receive such compensation for his services as the company may
determine, not to exceed a maximum of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month;
except that said maximum amount may be increased with the consent and approval
of the city commission. No director shall serve as manager of the company or as
an employee of the company (except as a corporate officer). No trustee or
director of the company, whether acting as an officer of the company or not,
shall receive any other compensation than that above mentioned.
Section 19: Manager.
   The company shall employ a competent manager and such other help, technical
or otherwise, as may be necessary to assure the efficient and economical
operation of the City’s energy utility system. The compensation of such manager
and other employees shall be a proper operation and maintenance charge against
the gross revenues of the system.
Section 20: Rate and income requirements and disposition of system revenues.
   (a)   The company shall set aside the entire gross income and revenues of
the utility system into a special fund to be known as the “City of Raton
Utility System Gross Income Fund,” hereafter sometimes designated as the
“income fund,” from which fund the board shall make the operational, reserve
and debt payments below described. After payment of such monies in
subparagraphs [subsections] 20(B)(1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6), then the
company each year shall transfer and pay over to the city treasurer all
remaining income and revenues derived from the operation of the system for any
lawful purpose or purposes then required or permitted under the constitution
and laws of the State of New Mexico and the bond ordinances and other
ordinances of the city.
   (b)   So long as this franchise shall remain in force and effect, the city
shall set the utility system rates in an amount designed to achieve the
following income, and the income shall be expended in the following priorities,
to wit:
      (1)   The company shall first set aside each month into a fund called
“operation and maintenance fund,” monies sufficient to pay current expenses of
the operation of the utility system, excluding depreciation and amortization
expenses, as they become due and payable;
      (2)   From any remaining income the company shall next set aside funds as
required for debt service and bond reserves, under any ordinances of the city
creating and issuing energy utility system bonds for improvements,
replacements, or expansion of the city’s energy utility system. The city shall
continue to retain full authority to create and issue system bonds and to enact
such ordinances and revenue guarantees as shall be appropriate and lawful for
such system bonds.
      (3)   From any remaining income the company shall next set aside each
month into a reserve fund called “operation reserve fund,” an accumulation of
cash reserves adequate to permit the payment of the average cash expenses
(exclusive of fuel and purchased power and energy capacity) required for a
sixty-day period. Upon execution of this ordinance, the sum of seventy five
thousand dollars ($75,000.00) shall be set aside into such fund, for the amount
of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1985. Thereafter, this reserve is to be
maintained at an amount determined to be a sixty-day average of the preceding
year’s cash expenses (exclusive of fuel and purchased power and energy
capacity) or seventy five thousand dollars ($75,000.00), whichever is greater.
      (4)   From any remaining income the company shall next set aside, each
month, one twelfth (1/12) of two and one-half (2½) per cent of the immediately
preceding fiscal year’s gross annual revenues into the “reserve for annual
overhaul, inspection and repair of boilers and generation equipment” reserve.
As used throughout this ordinance, “gross annual revenues” shall mean all
revenues paid to the company by rate payers for the retail sale of energy, and
earned interest, but shall not include (1) taxes or surcharges; (2) insurance
proceeds; (3) payments from other utilities, cogenerators, producers or
transmitters of energy; (4) damage awards; (5) proceeds from sale of assets;
(6) payments from the City of Raton for energy consumed; or (7) other revenues
received from sources other than sales to rate paying customers and earned
interest. Amounts in said fund shall be used to pay, in whole or in part,
periodic repairs, inspection, and overhaul costs of the boilers and generation
equipment; provided, however, that such fund shall be stabilized when the
accumulated balance of the amounts set aside equals four and one-half (4½) per
cent of the gross annual revenues for the immediately preceding fiscal year.
Upon execution of this ordinance, the sum of seventy five thousand dollars
($75,000.00) shall be set aside into such fund for the amount of the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1985.
      (5)   From any remaining income the company shall next set aside in
monthly payments of one-twelfth each, to the “City of Raton Utility System,
Capital Improvement and Replacement Fund,” a cash reserve as will be equal
during each fiscal year to ten (10) per cent of the gross annual revenues for
the immediately preceding fiscal year. The monies in the company’s present
capital improvement reserve shall be transferred to such fund. Amounts in said
fund shall be available to pay, in whole or in part, periodic inspection,
overhaul and repair, and the costs of additions, extensions and improvements to
the energy utility system; provided, however, that such fund shall be
stabilized when the amounts in the reserve fund equal fifty (50) per cent of
the gross annual revenues of the company for the preceding fiscal year.
Thereafter, the maximum amount in such fund may be increased by the city, from
year to year, by resolution of the city commission.
      (6)   From any remaining income the company shall next pay to the city,
in monthly payments of one-twelfth (1/12) each, an amount equal to three (3)
per cent of the immediately preceding fiscal year’s gross annual revenues, as
defined above.
      (7)   The residue of revenues of the company shall be paid to the city,
annually.
Section 21: Use of city property.
   Throughout the life of the franchise granted by this ordinance, the company
shall have the use and possession of all of the physical assets, including
generation facilities and transmission and distribution lines, pipes and
appliances, belonging to the city’s utility system, all for the purpose of the
operation of the system by the company under the terms of this ordinance.
Section 22: Reports and audits.
   (a)   On or before April 25 of each year the company shall prepare and
deliver to the city a report containing an estimate of its anticipated revenue,
expenses, payments to the city, reserve set-asides and its bond requirements
(if any, for the succeeding fiscal year).
   (b)   The fiscal year of the company shall be from July 1 to June 30 of the
succeeding year, this arrangement to be changed only with the consent of the
city commission. The company shall make written reports to the city, at least
quarterly, showing the balance sheet, statement of profit and loss, and
statement of costs. Following the end of each fiscal year, the company shall
also cause an audit to be made of the utility system by a reputable auditor
covering that fiscal year and shall furnish a copy of the audit to the city.
The books and records of the company shall at all times be open for inspection
by the city commission or any representative designated by it.
Section 23: Actions of the city commission.
   The expression “city commission,” wherever used in this ordinance, shall be
interpreted to mean the governing body of the city, regardless of the
particular form of government which may be in effect. Any action, consent,
approval or permission to be taken or given by the city commission pursuant to
this ordinance may be accomplished by a simple motion of the city commission.
Section 24: Transition provisions.
   From and after the effective date of this ordinance, this ordinance shall
immediately supersede and replace Ordinance No. 512; and the franchises granted
by said Ordinance No. 512 shall no longer be of any force or effect except as
to acts previously done and performed in pursuance thereof. Upon the effective
date of the ordinance, the company shall retain the funds necessary for the
initial funding of the reserves set forth in paragraphs [subsections] 20(B)(3),
(4) and (5).
Section 25: Ordinance treated as contract.
   This entire ordinance shall be considered as a solemn and binding contract
between the city and the company.
Section 26: Severability and interpretation.
   If any section, paragraph, clause or provision of this ordinance shall for
any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any such section, paragraph, clause or provision shall not
effect any of the remaining provisions of this ordinance. In the event of
inconsistency, the titles to the sections shall not be deemed a part of the
enactment.
Section 27: Effective date.
   This ordinance shall become effective on the thirty-first day after its
enactment; provided, however, that if an election should be required pursuant
to a sufficient petition presented within the time and manner provided by
section 3-42-1 NMSA 1978, then the effective date of this ordinance shall be
postponed until the result of the election is known.
   ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 14th day of January, 1986.

   A.   All transmission and distribution structures, poles, other lines, and
equipment installed or erected by the Grantee pursuant to the terms hereof
shall be located so as to cause a minimum of interference with the proper use
of Public Ways and with the rights and reasonable convenience of property

   B.   All poles and conduit within the system’s Service Area shall be made
available for attachment or use by the Grantee at just and reasonable rates
comparable to those rates established under the federal pole attachment statute
and applicable FCC regulations.
   5.2   Access for Franchised System. In case of new construction or property
development where utilities are to be placed underground, the developer or
property owner shall give the Grantee reasonable notice of not less than 30
days prior to such construction or development, of the particular date on which
open trenching will be available for the Grantee’s installation of conduit,
pedestals and/or vaults, and laterals to be provided at Grantee’s expense. The
Grantee shall also provide specifications as needed for trenching. Cost of
trenching and easements required to bring service to the development shall be

construction, operation, or maintenance of the System there occurs a
disturbance of any Public Way by the Grantee, it shall, at its expense, replace
and restore such Public Way to a condition reasonably comparable to the
condition of the Public way existing immediately prior to such disturbance.
   5.4   Relocation at Request of the Franchising Authority. Upon its receipt
of reasonable advance notice, not to be less than five business days, the
Grantee shall, at its own expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect,
relocate in the Public Way, or remove from the Public Way, any property of the

cost of any of the foregoing, the Franchising Authority shall make application
for such funds on behalf of the Grantee.
   5.5   Relocation at Request of Third Party. The Grantee shall, on the
request of any person holding a building moving permit issued by the
Franchising Authority, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the
moving of such building, provided: (a) the expense of such temporary raising or

Grantee, making such payment in advance; and (b) the Grantee is given not less
than 10 business days advance written notice to arrange for such temporary wire
changes.
   5.6   Trimming of Trees and Shrubbery. The Grantee shall have the authority
to trim trees or other natural growth overhanging any of its System in the
Service Area so as to prevent branches from coming in contact with the
Grantee’s wires, cables, or other equipment. The Grantee shall reasonably
compensate the Franchising Authority for any damages caused by such trimming,
or shall, in its sole discretion and at its own cost and expense, reasonably
replace all trees or shrubs damaged as a result of any construction of the
System undertaken by the Grantee. Such replacement shall satisfy any and all
obligations the Grantee may have to the Franchising Authority pursuant to the
terms of this Section.
   5.7   Safety Requirements. Construction, installation, and maintenance of
the System shall be performed in an orderly and workmanlike manner. All such
work shall be performed in substantial accordance with applicable FCC or other
federal, state, and local regulations and the National Electric Safety Code.
The System shall not unreasonably endanger or interfere with the safety of
persons or property in the Service Area.
   5.8   Aerial and underground Construction. In those areas of the Service
Area where all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the respective
public utilities providing telephone communications and electric services are
underground, the Grantee likewise shall construct, operate, and maintain all of
its transmission and distribution facilities underground; provided that such
facilities are actually capable of receiving the Grantee’s cable and other
equipment without technical degradation of the System’s signal quality. In
those areas of the Service Area where the transmission or distribution
facilities of the respective public utilities providing telephone
communications, and electric services are both aerial and underground, the
Grantee shall have the sole discretion to construct, operate, and maintain all
of its transmission and distribution facilities, or any part thereof, aerially
or underground. Nothing contained in this Section shall require the Grantee to
construct, operate, and maintain underground any ground-mounted appurtenances
such as subscriber taps, line extenders, system passive devices (splitters,
directional couplers), amplifiers, power supplies, pedestals, or other related
equipment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section,
in the event that all of the transmission or distribution facilities of the
respective public utilities providing telephone communications and electric
services are placed underground after the effective date of this Franchise, the
Grantee shall only be required to construct, operate, and maintain all of its
transmission and distribution facilities underground if it is given reasonable
notice and access to the public utilities’ facilities at the time that such are
placed underground.
   5.9   Required Extensions of Service. The System, as constructed as of the
date of the passage and final adoption of this Franchise, substantially
complies with the material provisions hereof. Whenever the Grantee shall
receive a request for service from at least 15 residences within 1320 cable-
bearing strand feet (one-quarter cable mile) of its trunk or distribution
cable, it shall extend its system to such Subscribers at no cost to said
Subscribers for System extension, other than the usual connection fees for all
Subscribers; provided that such extension is technically feasible, and if it
will not adversely affect the operation, financial condition, or market
development of the System, or as provided for under section 5.10 this
Franchise.
      5.10   Subscriber Charges for Extension of Service. No Subscriber shall
be refused service arbitrarily. However, for unusual circumstances, such as a
Subscriber’s request to locate his cable drop underground, existence of more
than 150 feet of distance from distribution cable to connection of service to
Subscribers, or a density of less than 15 residences per 1320 cable bearing
strand feet of trunk or distribution cable, service may be made available on
the basis of a capital contribution in aid of construction, including cost of
material, labor, and easements. For the purpose of determining the amount of
capital contribution in aid of construction to be borne by the Grantee and
Subscribers in the area in which service may be expanded, the Grantee will
contribute an amount equal to the construction and other costs per mile,
multiplied by a fraction whose numerator equals the actual number of residences
per 1320 cable-bearing strand feet of its trunks or distribution cable, and
whose denominator equals 15 residences. Subscribers who request service
hereunder will bear the remainder of the construction and other costs on a pro
rata basis. The Grantee may require that the payment of the capital
contribution in aid of construction borne by such potential Subscribers be paid
in advance.
      5.11   Service to Public Buildings. The Grantee shall, upon request,
provide without charge, one outlet of Basic Service to those Franchising
Authority offices, fire station(s), police station(s), and public school
building(s) that are passed by its system.
SECTION 6. REGULATION BY THE FRANCHISING AUTHORITY
   6.1   Franchise Fee.
   A.   The Grantee shall pay to the Franchising Authority a franchise fee
equal to four percent (4%) of Gross Revenues (as defined in Section 3.1 of this
Franchise) received by the Grantee from the operation of the System on an
annual basis; provided, however, that the Grantee may credit against any such
payments: (i) any tax, fee, or assessment of any kind imposed by the
Franchising Authority or other governmental entity on a cable operator, or
Subscriber, or both, solely because of their status as such; (ii) any tax, fee
or assessment of general applicability which is unduly discriminatory against
cable operators or Subscribers (including any such tax, fee, or assessment
imposed, both on utilities and cable operators and their services), and (iii)
any other special tax, assessment, or fee such as a business, occupation, and
entertainment tax. For the purpose of this Section, the 12-month period
applicable under the Franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall
be a calendar year, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the Franchising
Authority and the Grantee. The increased franchise fee will be payable by the
Grantee to the Franchising Authority after a thirty (30) day written notice to
Grantee of the increase and the collection of the increase in franchise fees by
Grantee from its subscribers. The franchise fee payment shall be due and
payable ninety (90) days after the close of the preceding calendar year. Each
payment shall be accompanied by a brief report from a representative of the
Grantee showing the basis for the computation.
   B.   Limitation on Franchise Fee Actions. The period of limitation for
recovery of any franchise fee payable hereunder shall be five years from the
date on which payment by the Grantee is due. Unless within seven years from and
after such payment due date the Franchising Authority initiates a lawsuit for
recovery of such franchise fees in a court of competent jurisdiction, such
recovery shall be barred and the Franchising Authority shall be estopped from
asserting any claims whatsoever against the Grantee relating to any such
alleged deficiencies.
   6.2   Rates and Charges. The Franchising Authority may regulate rates for
the provision of Basic Cable and equipment as expressly permitted by applicable
law.
   6.3   Renewal of Franchise. The Franchising Authority and the Grantee agree
that any proceedings undertaken by the Franchising Authority that relate to the
renewal of the Grantee’s Franchise shall be governed by and comply with the
provisions of Section 626 of the Cable Act, as amended, unless the procedures
and substantive protection set forth therein shall be deemed to be preempted
and superseded by the provisions of any subsequent provision of federal or
state law.
      In addition to the procedures set forth in said Section 626(a), the
Franchising Authority agrees to notify the Grantee of all of its assessments
regarding the identity of future cable-related community needs and interests,
as well as, the past performance of the Grantee under the then current
Franchise term. The Franchising Authority further agrees that such a
preliminary assessment shall be provided to the Grantee promptly so that the
Grantee has adequate time to submit a proposal under Section 626(b) of the
Cable Act and complete renewal of the Franchise prior to expiration of its
term. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section, the
Grantee and the Franchising Authority agree that at any time during the term of
the then current Franchise, while affording the public appropriate notice and
opportunity to comment, the Franchising Authority and the Grantee may agree to
undertake and finalize informal negotiations regarding renewal of the then
current Franchise and the Franchising Authority may grant a renewal thereof.
The Grantee and the Franchising Authority consider the terms set forth in this
Section to be consistent with the express provisions of Section 626 of the
Cable Act.
   6.4   Conditions of Sale. If a renewal or extension of the Grantee’s
Franchise is lawfully denied or the Franchise is lawfully terminated, and the
Franchising Authority either lawfully acquires ownership of the System or by
its actions lawfully effects transfer of ownership of the System to another
party, and such acquisition or transfer shall be at the price determined
pursuant to the provisions set forth in section 627 of the Cable Act.
      The Grantee and the Franchising Authority agree that in the case of a
final determination of a lawful revocation of the Franchise, at the Grantee’s
request, which shall be made in its sole discretion, the Grantee shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its System to a qualified
third party. The Franchising Authority further agrees that during such a period
of time, it shall authorize the Grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the
terms of its prior Franchise; however, in no event shall such authorization
exceed a period of time greater than six months from the effective date of such
revocation. If, at the end of that time, the Grantee is unsuccessful in
procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its System which is reasonably
acceptable to the Franchising Authority, the Grantee and the Franchising
Authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal
or state law; it being further agreed that the Grantee’s continued operation of
its System during the six-month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor
an extinguishment of, any rights of either the Franchising Authority or the
Grantee.
   6.5   Transfer of Franchise. The Grantee’s right, title, or interest in the
Franchise shall not be sold, transferred, assigned, or otherwise encumbered,
other than to an entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control
with the Grantee, without the prior consent of the Franchising Authority, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld. No such consent shall be required,
however, for a transfer in trust, by mortgage, by other hypothecation, or by
assignment of any rights, title, or interest of the Grantee in the Franchise or
System in order to secure indebtedness. Within 30 days of receiving the request
for transfer, the Franchising Authority shall, in accordance with FCC rules and
regulations, notify the Grantee in writing of the information it requires to
determine the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the transferee.
If the Franchising Authority has not taken action on the Grantee’s request for
transfer within 120 days after receiving such request, consent by the
Franchising Authority shall be deemed given.
SECTION 7 COMPLIANCE AND MONITORING
   7.1   Testing for Compliance. The Franchising Authority may perform
technical tests of the System during reasonable times and in a manner which
does not unreasonably interfere with the normal business operations of the
Grantee or the System in order to determine whether or not the Grantee is in
compliance with the terms hereof and applicable state or federal laws. Except
in emergency circumstances, such tests may be undertaken only after giving the
Grantee reasonable notice thereof, not to be less than two business days, and
providing a representative of the Grantee an opportunity to be present during
such tests. In the event that such testing demonstrates that the Grantee has
substantially failed to comply with a material requirement hereof, the cost of
such testing shall be borne by the Grantee. In the event that such testing
demonstrates that the Grantee has substantially complied with such material
provisions hereof, the cost of such testing shall be borne by the Franchising
Authority. Expect in emergency circumstances, the Franchising Authority agrees
that such testing shall be undertaken no more than once a year, and that the
results thereof shall be made available to the Grantee.
   7.2   Books and Records. The Grantee agrees that the Franchising Authority
upon reasonable notice to the Grantee may review such of its books and records
at the Grantee’s business office, during normal business hours and on a
nondisruptive basis, as is reasonably necessary to ensure compliance with the
terms hereof. Such records shall include, but shall not be limited to, any
public records required to be kept by the Grantee pursuant to the rules and
regulations of the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein, the Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it
reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature. The Franchising
Authority agrees to treat any information disclosed by the Grantee as
confidential and only to disclose it to employees, representatives, and agents
thereof that have a need to know, or in order to enforce the provisions hereof.
The Grantee shall not be required to provide Subscriber information in
violation of Section 631 of the Cable Act.
SECTION 8. INSURANCE AND INDEMNIFICATION
   8.1   Insurance Requirements. The Grantee shall maintain in full force and
effect, at its own cost and expense, during the term of the Franchise,
Comprehensive General Liability Insurance in the amount of $1,000,000 combined
single limit for bodily injury, and property damage. The Grantee shall provide
a Certificate of Insurance designating the Franchising Authority as an
additional insured. Such insurance shall be noncancellable except upon 30 days
prior written notice to the Franchising Authority.
   8.2   Indemnification. The Grantee agrees to indemnify, save and hold
harmless, and defend the Franchising Authority, its officers, boards and
employees, from and against any liability for damages and for any liability or
claims resulting from property damage or bodily injury maintenance of its
System, including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs,
provided that the Franchising Authority shall give the Grantee written notice
of its obligation to indemnify the Franchising Authority within 10 days of
receipt of a claim or action pursuant to this Section. If the Franchising
Authority determines that it is necessary for it to employ separate counsel,
the costs for such separate counsel shall be the responsibility of the
Franchising Authority.
SECTION 9. ENFORCEMENT AND TERMINATION OF FRANCHISE
   9.1   Notice of Violation. In the event that the Franchising Authority
believes that the Grantee has not complied with the terms of the Franchise, it
shall notify the Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged
noncompliance.
   9.2   Grantee’s Right to Cure or Respond. The Grantee shall have 30 days
from receipt of the notice described in Section 10.1:(a) to respond to the
Franchising Authority, contesting the assertion of noncompliance, or (b) to
cure such default, or (c) in the event that, by the nature of default, such
default cannot be cured within the 30 day period, initiate reasonable steps to
remedy such default and notify the Franchising Authority of the steps being
taken and the projected date that they will be completed.
   9.3   Public Hearing. In the event that the Grantee fails to respond to the
notice described in Section 10.1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 10.2, or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within
30 days of the date projected pursuant to 10.2(c) above, the Franchising
Authority shall schedule a public hearing to investigate the default. Such
public hearing shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Franchising Authority which is scheduled at a time which is no less than five
business days therefrom. The Franchising Authority shall notify the Grantee in
writing of the time and place of such meeting and provide the Grantee with an
opportunity to be heard.
   9.4   Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event
the Franchising Authority, after such meeting, determines that the Grantee is
in default of any provision of the Franchise, the Franchising Authority may:
   A.   Seek specific performance of any provision, which reasonably lends
itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages;
   B.   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable
relief; or
   C.   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the
Franchise, declare the Franchise Agreement to be revoked in accordance with the
following:
The Franchising Authority shall give written notice to the Grantee of its
intent to revoke the Franchise on the basis of a pattern of noncompliance by
the Grantee including one or more instances of substantial noncompliance with a
material provision of the Franchise. The notice shall set forth the exact
nature of the noncompliance. The Grantee shall have 90 days from such notice to
object in writing and to state its reasons for such objection. In the event the
Franchising Authority has not received a response satisfactory from the
Grantee, it may then seek termination of the Franchise at a public meeting. The
Franchising Authority shall cause to be served upon the Grantee, at least 10
days prior to such public meeting, a written notice specifying the time and
place of such meeting and stating its intent to request such termination.
At the designated meeting, the Franchising Authority shall give the Grantee an
opportunity to state its position on the matter, after which it shall determine
whether or not the Franchise shall be revoked. The Grantee may appeal such
determination to an appropriate court, which shall have the power to review the
decision of the Franchising Authority “de novo” and to modify or reverse such
decision as justice may require. Such appeal to the appropriate court must be
taken within 60 days of the issuance of the determination of the Franchising
Authority.
The Franchising authority may, at its sole discretion, take any lawful action
which it deems appropriate to enforce the Franchising Authority’s rights under
the Franchise in lieu of revocation of the Franchise.
   9.5   Impossibility of Performance. The Grantee shall not be held in default
or noncompliance with the provisions of the Franchise, nor suffer any
enforcement or penalty relating thereto, where such noncompliance or alleged
defaults are caused by strikes, acts of God, power outages, or other events
reasonably beyond its ability to control.
SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.
   10.1   Actions of Parties. In any action by the Franchising Authority or the
Grantee that is mandated or permitted under the terms hereof, such party shall
act in a reasonable, expeditious, and timely manner. Furthermore, in any
instance where approval or consent is required under the terms hereof such
approval or consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.
   10.2   Equal Protection. In the event the Franchising Authority enters into
a franchise, permit, license, authorization, or other agreement of any kind
with any other person or entity other than the Grantee to enter into the
Franchising Authority’s streets and public ways for the purpose of constructing
or operating a cable system or providing cable service to any part of the
Service Area, the material provisions thereof shall be reasonably comparable to
those contained herein, in order that one operator not be granted an unfair
competitive advantage over another, and to provide all parties equal protection
under the law.
   10.3   Theft of Service. In addition to those criminal and civil remedies
provided by state and federal law, it shall be a misdemeanor for any person,
firm, or corporation to create or make use of any unauthorized connection,

any part of the System without the express consent of the Grantee. Further,
without the express consent of the Grantee, it shall be a misdemeanor for any
person to tamper with, remove, or injure any property, equipment, or part of
the System or any means of receiving services provided thereto. Subject to
applicable federal and state law, the Franchising Authority shall incorporate
into its criminal code, if not presently a part thereof, criminal misdemeanor
law which will enforce the intent of this Section 10.3.
   10.4   Notice. Unless expressly otherwise agreed between the parties, every
notice or response required by this Franchise to be served upon the Franchising
Authority or the Grantee shall be in writing, and shall be deemed to have been

CONNECTION THEREWITH.
   WHEREAS, the City of Raton, New Mexico (the “City”) is a member of the
Arkansas River Power Authority, a separate governmental entity and political
subdivision of the State of Colorado (the “Authority” or “ARPA”), having
heretofore executed and delivered the “Organic Contract Creating and

Colorado; the City of La Junta, Colorado; the City of Lamar, Colorado; the City
of Las Animas, Colorado; the Town of Springfield, Colorado; and the City of
Trinidad, Colorado (collectively the “Member Municipalities” or individually
each a “Member Municipality”) to plan, develop and acquire the electric power
resources needed by the Member Municipalities to reliably serve their
respective electricity customers; and
   WHEREAS, Section 2.4 of the Organic Contract provides that the Authority
must request the approval of the Member Municipalities prior to issuing any
bonds in connection with a Project (as said term is defined in the Organic
Contract); and
   WHEREAS, Section 2.4.2 of the Organic Contract provides that written notice
of the Authority’s intention to provide funds (through the issuance of bonds)
for a Project must be submitted to each Member Municipality and that the notice
must contain a description of the Project, the projected sources and uses of
funds for all aspects of the construction and testing of the Project, and a
statement that, in the opinion of the Authority, the Project is economically
feasible and is necessary for the Authority to meet its commitment to supply
the wholesale power and energy requirements of the Municipalities, together
with an explanation of the Authority’s basis for this opinion; and
   WHEREAS, each Member Municipality, including the City, has received a
written “Notice of Intent to Commit Funds” (the “Notice”) from the Authority

“Bonds”) to finance the repowering of the existing 25 megawatt steam generating
unit owned by the Lamar Utilities Board from a natural gas-fired operation to a
coal-fired operation with a resulting increase in net output rating to
approximately 38.5 megawatt, all as more specifically described in the Notice
(the “Lamar Repowering Project”); and
   WHEREAS, in order for the Authority to issue the Bonds, the Notice states
that revisions must be made to the Organic Contract and to the “Agreement For
The Supply of Electric Power and Energy to Municipal Members of the Arkansas

the base terms of both documents; (b) clarifying the power supply commitments
between the Authority and the Member Municipalities and the Member

Agreement First Amendment”), both of which have been approved by the ARPA Board
of Directors and the City Commision of the City (the “Governing Body”); and

its approval or disapproval of (i) the financing of the Lamar Repowering
Project from proceeds of the Bonds, (ii) the Organic Contract Third Amendment
and (iii) the Power Sales Agreement First Amendment within a period of time
specified in Section 2.4.3 of the Organic Contract, and it was intended by the
Governing Body that the adoption of Ordinance No. 935 on October 26, 2004
constitute such approval by the City; and
   WHEREAS, representatives of ARPA appeared before the Governing Body prior to
the adoption of Ordinance No. 935 to present the details of the Lamar
Repowering Project and respond to questions of the Governing Body; and
   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of The Raton Public Service Company, prior
to the adoption of Ordinance No. 935, considered and recommended to the
Governing Body that it approve the Lamar Repowering Project, the issuance of
the Bonds, the Organic Contract Third Amendment and the Power Sales Agreement
First Amendment; and
   WHEREAS, in connection with the development of the Lamar Repowering Project
and subsequent to the adoption of Ordinance No. 935, the Authority, the City of
Lamar and the Lamar Utilities Board entered into a Joint Operating Agreement
for the Development of the Lamar Repowering Project and Operations and
Maintenance in Support of the Lamar Repowering Project (the “Joint Operating
Agreement”); and
   WHEREAS, the purpose of this Ordinance (the “Ordinance”) is to reaffirm
Ordinance No. 935, to clarify its intended purposes, and to provide other

   Section 1.   Approval of Organic Contract Third Amendment and Power Sales

through the issuance of the Bonds.
   (a)   The financing of the Lamar Repowering Project from the proceeds of the
Bonds, which was intended through the adoption of Ordinance No. 935, is in all
respects approved and authorized. In accordance with the terms of the Notice,

incorporate and be subject to the following parameters:
      (i)   The principal amount of the financing for the engineering,
equipment procurement, and construction of the Repowering Project shall not

financing, including, but not limited to, capitalized interest, the creation of
a bond reserve fund, underwriting discount, legal costs, and bond insurance
premiums;
      (ii)   The term of the Bonds (maturity) shall be for a period which, in
the best judgment of the Authority after obtaining the advice and counsel of
the Authority’s expert financial advisors, does not exceed the useful life of
the Repowering Project and results in annual debt service payments which enable
the Authority to provide a long term supply of baseload energy at reasonable
cost to the Member Municipalities; provided, however, that the maturity of the
initial issue shall not extend beyond forty (40) years from the bond issuance
date;
      (iii)   The Authority shall use its best efforts to obtain the lowest net
effective interest rate on the Bonds, through a public or negotiated sale,
giving due consideration to the length of the financing and market conditions
at the time of closing; and

shall be deemed to also give its approval to the placement by the Authority of
interim financing for the Repowering Project, as determined by the Authority’s
Board of Directors to be necessary or desirable prior to closing on the Bonds.
   (b)   The Bonds shall not be considered a debt, liability, or obligation of
the City and are collectible only from the proper pledged revenues and the
bondholders may not look to any municipal fund of the City for the payment of
the principal and interest on the Bonds.
   Section 3.   Findings and Determinations. The Governing Body hereby finds
and determines as follows:
   (a)   the Notice, in form and content, meets the requirements established
pursuant to Section 2.4.2 of the Organic Contract for written notice to Member
Municipalities;
   (b)   at least one Member Municipality requested an extension to the sixty
(60) day notice period provided in Section 2.4.3 of the Organic Contract and

original sixty (60) day period, and the City consented to an extension of time
for thirty (30) days;
   (c)   all Member Municipalities have, by action of the Member Municipalities
within the meaning of Section 2.4.3 of the Organic Contract, approved and
authorized the financing of the Lamar Repowering Project from proceeds of the
Bonds, and approved and authorized the Organic Contract Third Amendment and the
Power Sales Agreement First Amendment;
   (d)   the Authority has provided the City with written notification that the
Joint Operating Agreement has been executed by all parties to said agreement;
and
   (e)   Ordinance No. 935 shall constitute action by the City within the
meaning of Section 2.4.3 of the Organic Contract.
   Section 4.   City Cooperation and Execution of Certificates and Instruments.
The Mayor, City Clerk and other officials and employees of the City are hereby
authorized to execute and deliver for and on behalf of the City any and all

absence of the Mayor the Mayor Pro Tem, shall be authorized to certify to the
Authority that all conditions and parameters established pursuant to this
Ordinance have been met and such certification shall be deemed to conclusively
establish on behalf of the City that all conditions and parameters have been
met.

are not a part of this Ordinance, and shall not be used in any manner to
interpret this Ordinance.

all actions heretofore taken by the City and its officers in connection with

ELECTRIC FRANCHISE
   ORDINANCE NO. 942
   AN ORDINANCE RELATING TO THE RATON PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY AND GRANTING A
UTILITY FRANCHISE TO SAID COMPANY
   WHEREAS, the Raton Public Service Company (hereinafter called the Company),
a New Mexico Corporation, has for many years operated a utility in the City of
Raton, New Mexico, acting under franchise from the City, the existing franchise
being set forth in Ordinance No. 731 of the City of Raton, adopted and approved
January 14, 1986; and
   WHEREAS, the City of Raton, (hereinafter called the City), is the beneficial
owner of all of the capital stock of the Company, which stock (except for
qualifying shares of other directors) is presently held in the names of Kathy
McQueary, Charles Miller and Steve Cunico as trustees; and
   WHEREAS, the City is the absolute owner of the electric utility system
heretofore operated and managed by the Company pursuant to said Ordinance No.
731, together with the right to furnish service within a service area allowed
by law; and
   WHEREAS, the City is a member of the Arkansas River Power Authority (ARPA),
a political subdivision of the State of Colorado, under authority of contract
Ordinance and law (in particular, Section 3-24-14 NMSA 1978), with which it has
various contractual obligations and from which the City is currently purchasing
wholesale power, in addition to the power generated locally, at a substantial
saving over what it might otherwise be required to pay for purchased power, and
the day-to-day coordination with ARPA requires the delegation of administrative
and operations responsibility comparable to that required for the generation of
electricity; and
   WHEREAS, it is considered desirable both by the Company and by the City that
the operation and management of the City's now owned or hereafter acquired
energy production, services, sources, generation and distribution systems and
plants ("utility system") and the handling of the financial operations of the
utility be continued in a manner similar to that heretofore established by
Ordinance No. 731, except as hereinafter modified; and
   WHEREAS, the Company has made written application to the City Commission of
the City of Raton requesting the due enactment of this Ordinance and
specifically consenting to all of the terms and provisions of this ordinance,
and the said Kathy McQueary, Charles Miller and Steve Cunico have likewise
requested and consented to all of the terms and provisions of this Ordinance.
   NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the City Commission of the City of Raton,
New Mexico:
Section 1: Grant of Franchise.
   From and after the effective date of this ordinance, and subject to all the
terms and provisions herein contained, the City does hereby grant to the
Company the right, privilege and franchise, pursuant to N.M.S.A. 1978, Section
3-42-1 for a term ending November 11, 2030, to maintain and operate within the
City and within all future additions to the City and within the City's lawful
utility service area as the same may exist from time to time hereafter, the
City's electric utility system, including its generating plant and distribution
system and such other energy utility systems as may be transferred to the
Company, and the rights, privileges and facilities available through ARPA (as
may be determined from time to time by the Company), for the furnishing of
utility services to the City, and as may lawfully be furnished to others.
Throughout the term of this ordinance the Company shall have the right to the
free use of the rights-of-way, streets, avenues, alleys and public places of
the City and all future additions thereto, for the purpose of erecting and
maintaining poles or other supports or otherwise emplacing utility systems, and
for wires, transformers, pipes, lines, appliances and other equipments, and for
the laying and maintaining of conduits, pipes, lines, appliances, wires and
other equipment for the transmission and distribution of energy and energy
sources; provided, however, that the same shall be placed in such reasonable
locations as may be permitted by the City Commission, and in such manner as not
to interfere with traffic or other necessary public uses.
Section 2: Fixing of Rates.
   The Company shall at all times furnish an ample supply of its owned,
generated or acquired energy to the City, its inhabitants and to others as may
be lawful. The City Commission shall from time to time set, fix, determine and
alter the rate schedules and the rates, charges and rate classifications
pertaining to all services to be rendered by the Company. It shall be the duty
of the City to maintain rates at such a level and,with such reasonable
classifications as shall permit the funding requirement set forth in Section 19
of this ordinance. Such rate tariffs shall be sufficient to meet the efficient
and long term operation of the utility by the Company and also provide for the
City a sufficient net income to meet all debt service, operational expense and
reserve requirements of this Ordinance and of obligations of the City in
respect of energy utility system bonds, or other similar energy utility system
obligations as the City may issue from time to time. Until changed by the City,
the existing rate schedules, rates, charges and rate classifications shall
remain in effect. The Company may recommend to the City Commission, from time
to time, such changes in rate schedules and rates as appear necessary and
desirable.
Section 3: Discounts. 
   The Company shall allow such discounts for prompt payment of bills as may be
from time to time required by the City Commission. No such discount shall in
any event be allowed to any customer who shall at the time of payment be, and
remain in default in the payment of, any previous bill. Until the establishment
of some different rule by the City Commission, the Company shall allow a ten
percent (10%) discount on all bills paid on or before the tenth (10th) day of
the month succeeding the month for which such bills were incurred.
Section 4: Discontinuance of Service. 
   Payment for all services furnished by the Company shall be made by customers
as directed by the Company; and in default of such payment the Company may, at
its option, and subject to applicable laws, discontinue the service.
Section 5: Municipal Uses.
   In consideration for this franchise agreement, the Company shall furnish to
the City all electric energy needed by the City for the lighting of its
municipal offices, for the street lighting and for general municipal purposes
within the City's electric utility service area, all without requiring payment
therefor from the City, as a franchise fee. For all power and electric energy
taken by the City and its departments for its proprietary purposes, including
but not limited to water treatment and pumping and sewage treatment and
disposal purposes, the City shall pay to the Company the actual cost thereof,
computed as the rolling three-month average of fuel and purchased energy costs
of the energy furnished.
Section 6: Rules and Regulations of the Company. 
   The Company may make reasonable Rules and Regulations specifying and
controlling the type of equipment, appliances, devices, connections, easements
and operating practices which may be required in order for a customer to
receive service from the Company or in order to entitle customers to the
several rate classifications now or hereafter in force. The Company shall not
be required to make any service connection unless its reasonable requirements
have been complied with. All current Rules and practices of the Company are
herewith approved and ratified by the City. The Company may hereafter adopt and
file with the City Clerk additional such Regulations with the City and, unless
within thirty (30) days of such filing the city shall disapprove of such
Regulations adopted by the Company under this Section, then such Regulations
shall be deemed to be approved and enacted by the City and in effect. Within
such thirty (30)-day period the City Commission shall have the power to require
modifications or may set aside such newly filed Regulation and establish in its
stead such regulation as the City Commission may consider proper and a copy of
such City enacted Regulation shall then be filed with the City Clerk within
thirty (30) day of its adoption.
Section 7: Internal Operations.
   The Company shall be solely responsible for governing its internal
operation, personnel, billing and operational activities, and the Company shall
from time to time establish polices and procedures concerning such internal
matters as it deems necessary and appropriate. The City adopts, confirms and
ratifies the existing policies and procedures of internal matter.
Section 8: Discrimination Forbidden. 
   The Company shall never commit, practice or permit any unfair discrimination
between its customers. All rates and charges shall be applied fairly to the end
that there shall always be a uniform charge for like service under like
conditions.
Section 9: Power and Authority of the Company. 
   The Company is granted, and shall have, exercise, enjoy and use all powers
and authority set forth under Section 3-24-1 through 18, NMSA 1978, as amended
and as may be amended, except that reserved to the City Commission in this
Ordinance, and except as lawfully exercised only by the City Commission.
Section 10: Police Power of the City. 
   The City Commission of the City shall adopt and enforce all such ordinances,
rules and regulations as may be necessary for the protection of the Company and
the lawful conduct of its operations. The rights and privileges granted to the
Company by this ordinance shall at all times be subject to the police power and
reasonable dominion of the City as the same may be exercised by general
ordinance, not destructive, however, of the rights and privileges hereby
granted.
Section 11: Company's Duty to Repair. 
   Whenever the Company shall enter upon any street or public place for the
purpose of construction or maintaining any portion of the transmission or
distribution system, it shall be the duty of the Company to repair any damage
done by it and to remove all debris resulting from its operations.
Section 12: Agreement Concerning Corporate Management of the Company.
   In consideration of the right, privilege and franchise granted to the
Company by this ordinance, and in consideration of the fact that the City is
the beneficial owner of all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the
Company, it is mutually agreed by the City and the Company that the corporate
management of the Company is herewith transferred and vested in the Board of
Directors of the Company, except as is otherwise retained or reserved by this
Ordinance or the laws of New Mexico to the City Commission. Such corporate
management and the ownership and control of its capital stock and the
disposition of the utility system earnings shall in all respects be governed by
the terms and provisions of this ordinance, including particularly Sections 13
through 19 inclusive, hereinafter set forth.
Section 13: Capital Stock Held in Trust. 
   It is recognized that the present holders of all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company hold the same as Trustees for the use
and benefit of the City, and it is agreed that the City is and shall always
continue to be the beneficial owner of all the capital stock of the Company
which is now, or at any time hereafter may be, issued and outstanding. The
legal holders (Trustees) of said stock shall have the right, power and duty to
vote the same, but they shall always hold the same for the use and benefit of
the City. The capital stock shall carry with it no attribute, privilege or
power other than the right to vote the same, in due and proper time and manner,
for the election of three of the Directors of the Board of Directors of the
Company, and for other corporate purposes not inconsistent with this franchise.
Section 14: Trustees. 
   As soon as this Ordinance becomes effective, all of the issued and
outstanding capital stock of the Company shall be issued to and thereafter be
held equally by those persons named hereinafter as trustees, each of whom shall
serve until the date specified for the expiration of his term. Thereafter, the
City Commission shall have the duty to appoint or re-appoint a trustee or
successor trustee for an additional term of six years; provided, however, no
trustee shall be re-appointed to serve more than two complete, consecutive six
year terms. The terms of the trustees being staggered, one such regular
appointment or reappointment will occur every two years during the life of the
franchise. The persons serving initially as trustees are Kathy McQueary, for a
term expiring June 30, 2009, Steve Cunico, for a term expiring June 30, 2011,
and Charles Miller, for a term expiring June 30, 2007. Each of the trustees
shall vote the shares held by him or her in the election of three of the
corporate directors. Each of the trustees shall continue to hold his or her
said stock until such time as his appointed term may expire or until such time
as he may die or resign or be removed from office as hereinafter provided.
Section 15: Removal of Trustees. 
   A trustee may be removed from office by the City Commission during his or
her appointed term for one or more of the following reasons:
   (a)   Legal incapacity;
   (b)   Willful neglect of duty or willful failure to comply with the terms of
this franchise or the laws governing the operation of a municipal utility;
   (c)   Malfeasance in office;
   (d)   Conviction of a crime involving moral turpitude; or
   (e)   Failure of the trustee to maintain his or her status as a resident of
Raton, New Mexico, or of its lawful utility service area.
   The power of removal shall be vested in a majority of the Commission. The
trustee shall be entitled to a full evidentiary hearing after reasonable notice
and upon a written specification of the charges against him or her. The vote of
each member shall be announced openly and shall be recorded in the minutes, and
the concurring vote of the majority of the members of the whole Commission
shall be necessary to accomplish a removal.
Section 16: Appointment of Successor Trustees. 
   Upon the expiration of the appointed term of each such trustee, and in case
of the death, resignation or removal of any of the trustees above named or of
any successor trustee, a successor shall be appointed by the City Commission;
and thereupon all of the capital stock previously held by the former trustee
shall be promptly transferred to such successor trustee and shall thereafter
stand in his or her name and be voted in like manner as if he or she were
specifically named in this Ordinance as one of the trustees. Any successor
trustee appointed by the Commission must be a resident to the City of Raton,
New Mexico, or of its lawful utility service area.
Section 17: Directors.
   The directors of the Company shall be five (5) in number. The mayor of the
City and one other member of the City commission (to be selected by the City
Commission) shall be directors of the Company. The remaining three (3)
directors shall be elected by the trustees, and must be residents of the City
of Raton or of its lawful utility service area. Except as hereinabove expressly
provided, the qualifications of the Directors, the method of selecting them,
and the powers of the entire Board of Directors shall be governed by the
ordinary Business Corporation laws of the State of New Mexico. No director who
is not a trustee of the Company shall be issued any qualifying shares. Each
director of the Company may receive such compensation for his services as the
Company may determine, not to exceed a maximum of $100.00 per month; except
that said maximum amount may be increased with the consent and approval of the
City Commission. No director shall serve as a manager of the Company or an
employee of the Company (except as a corporate officer). No trustee or director
of the Company, whether acting as an officer of the Company or not, shall
receive any other compensation than that above mentioned.
Section 18: Manager.
   The Company shall employ a competent manager and such other help, technical
or otherwise, as may be necessary to assure the efficient and economical
operation of the City's energy utility system. The compensation of such manager
and other employees shall be a proper operation and maintenance charge against
the gross revenues of the system.
Section 19: Rate and Income Requirements and Disposition of System Revenue.
   (A)   The Company shall set aside the Gross Annual Revenues of the utility
system into a special fund to be known as the "City of Raton Electric Utility
System Gross Income Fund" hereinafter sometimes designated as the "Income Fund"
from which fund the Board shall make the operational, reserve and debt payments
below described. As used throughout this Ordinance, "Gross Annual Revenues"
shall mean all revenues paid to the Company by rate payers for the retail sale
of energy, and earned interest, but shall not include (1) taxes or surcharges;
(2) insurance proceeds; (3) payments from other utilities, co-generators,
producers or transmitters of energy; (4) damage awards; (5) proceeds from sale
of assets; (6) payments from City of Raton for energy consumed; or (7) other
revenues received from sources other than sales to rate paying customers, and
earned interest.
   (B)   So long as this franchise shall remain in force and effect, the City
shall set the utility rates in an amount designed to achieve the following
income, and the income shall be expended in the following priorities, to-wit:
      (1)   The Company shall first set aside each month in the Gross Income
Account monies sufficient to pay one month average expenses of the operation of
the utility system, excluding depreciation and amortization expenses, as they
become due and payable. Upon execution of this Ordinance, the sum of
$339,000.00 shall be set aside in the Gross Income fund, for the amount of the
fiscal year ending June 30, 2005. Thereafter, this reserve's maximum allowable
balance is to be maintained at an amount determined by an independent annual
audit to be a one month average of the preceding year's cash expenses of the
operation of the utility system, excluding depreciation and amortization
expenses. No transfers will be made until such time as the "Gross Income
Account" balance exceeds the calculated maximum allowable balance;
      (2)   From any remaining income, the Company shall next transfer into a
reserve fund called "Debt Service Reserve" funds as required for debt service
and bond reserves, under any ordinances or resolutions of the City creating and
issuing energy utility system bonds or approving other lawful means of
borrowing monies for improvements, replacements, or expansion of the City's
energy utility system. The maximum allowable balance of the "Debt Service
Account" is not to exceed one half of the annual debt service requirements,
including principal, interest and other costs associated with said debt. The
City shall continue to retain full authority to create and issue system bonds
and to enact such ordinances and revenue guarantees as shall be appropriate and
lawful for such system bonds or the repayment of other approved loans. No
additional transfers will be made until such time as the maximum allowable
balance of the "Debt Service Account" has been attained;
      (3)   From any remaining income the Company shall next transfer into a
reserve fund called "Operation Reserve Fund" an accumulation of cash reserves
adequate to permit the payment of the average cash expenses (exclusive of fuel
and purchased power and energy capacity) required for a sixty-day period. At no
time shall the "Operation Reserve Fund" balance exceed the maximum allowable
balance, as determined by an independent annual audit. Upon execution of this
Ordinance, the monies in the Company's present Operation Reserve Fund shall
remain in such fund and the maximum allowable balance shall remain in force.
Thereafter, this reserve's maximum allowable balance is to be determined, by an
independent annual audit, to be a sixty-day average of the preceding year's
cash expenses (exclusive of fuel and purchased power and energy capacity). No
additional transfers will be made until such time as the maximum allowable
balance of the "Operation Reserve Fund" has been attained;
      (4)   From any remaining income, the Company shall next transfer, for the
current month, an amount not to exceed the "maximum allowable transfer" equal
to one-twelfth (1/12) of two and one-half percent (2 1/2%) of the immediately
preceding fiscal year's gross annual revenues into the "Reserve for Annual
Overhaul, Inspection, and Repair of Boilers and Generation Equipment" reserve.
In addition, if in any prior month, within the current fiscal year, funds were
not adequate for the maximum allowable transfer, those funds shall also be
transferred into the "Reserve for Annual Overhaul, Inspection, and Repair of
Boilers and Generation Equipment" reserve. Amounts in said fund shall be used
to pay, in whole or in part, periodic repairs, inspection, overhaul costs of
the boilers and generation equipment, and closure and retirement costs of the
generation facility or facilities. The balance of such fund shall not exceed
the maximum allowable balance equal to four and one-half percent (4 1/2%) of
the gross annual revenues of the Company, as determined annually by an
independent audit, for the preceding fiscal year. Upon execution of this
Ordinance, the monies in the Company's present "Reserve for Annual Overhaul,
Inspection, and Repair of Boilers and Generation Equipment" reserve shall
remain in such fund and the maximum allowable balance and maximum allowable
transfers shall remain in force. If in the event all municipally owned power
generation is retired from service, all remaining funds in the "Reserve for
Annual Overhaul, Inspection, and Repair of Boilers and Generation Equipment"
reserve following retirement and closure of such municipally owned generation
shall be transferred to the "City of Raton Electric Utility System, Capital
Improvement and Replacement Fund". No additional transfers will be made until
such time as all maximum allowable transfers for the current fiscal year or the
maximum allowable balance of the "Reserve for Annual Overhaul, Inspection, and
Repair of Boilers and Generation Equipment" has been attained;
      (5)   From any remaining income the Company shall next transfer, for the
current month, an amount not to exceed the "maximum allowable transfer" equal
to one-twelfth (1/12) of ten percent (10%) of the immediately preceding fiscal
year's gross annual revenues into the "City of Raton Electric Utility System,
Capital Improvement and Replacement Fund". In addition, if in any prior month,
within the current fiscal year, funds were not adequate for the maximum
allowable transfer, those funds shall also be transferred into the "City of
Raton Electric Utility System, Capital Improvement and Replacement Fund". Upon
execution of this Ordinance, the monies in the Company's present "City of Raton
Electric Utility System, Capital Improvement and Replacement Fund" shall remain
in such fund and the maximum allowable balance and maximum allowable transfers
shall remain in force. Amounts in said fund shall be available to pay, in whole
or in part, periodic inspection, overhaul and repair, and the costs of
additions, extensions and improvements to the electric utility system.
Additionally, amounts in said fund shall be available, without restriction, to
pay or prepay current and future principal and interest on any debt owed by the
Company. The balance of such fund shall not exceed the maximum allowable
balance equal to two hundred percent (200%) of the gross annual revenues of the
Company, as determined annually by an independent audit, for the preceding
fiscal year.
      (6)   All residual funds shall remain in the "Gross Income Account" until
June 30 of each year, at which time, after payment of such monies in
subparagraphs 19(B)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5), then the Company shall transfer
and pay over to the City Treasurer all remaining income and revenues derived
from the operation of the system for any lawful purpose or purposes then
required or permitted under the constitution and laws of the State of New
Mexico and the bond and other ordinances of the City.
Section 20: Use of City Property.
   Throughout the life of the franchise granted by this ordinance, the Company
shall have the use and possession of all of the physical assets, including
generation facilities and transmission and distribution lines, pipes and
appliances belonging to the City's utility system, all for the purpose of the
operation of the system by the Company under the terms of this Ordinance.
Section 21: Reports and Audits.
   (A)   On or before June 1st of each year the Company shall prepare and
deliver to the City a report containing an estimate of its anticipated revenue,
expenses, payment to the City, reserve set-asides and its bond requirements (if
any, for the succeeding fiscal year).
   (B)   The fiscal year of the Company shall be from July 1 to June 30 of the
succeeding year, this arrangement to be changed only with the consent of the
City Commission. The Company shall make written reports to the City, at least
quarterly, showing the balance sheet, statement of profit and loss, and
statement of costs. Following the end of each fiscal year, the Company shall
also cause an audit to be made of the utility system by a reputable auditor
covering that fiscal year and shall furnish a copy of the audit to the City.
The books and records of the Company shall at all times be open for inspection
by the City Commission or any representative designated by it.
Section 22: Action of the City Commission.
   The expression, "City Commission", wherever used in this Ordinance, shall be
interpreted to mean the governing body of the City, regardless of the
particular form of government which may be in effect. Any action, consent,
approval or permission to be taken or given by the City Commission pursuant to
this Ordinance may be accomplished by a single motion of the City Commission.
Section 23: Transition Provisions. 
   From and after the effective date of this Ordinance, this Ordinance shall
immediately supersede and replace Ordinance No. 731; and the franchise granted
by said Ordinance No. 731 shall no longer be of any force or effect except as
to acts previously done and performed in pursuance thereof. Upon the effective
date of the Ordinance, the Company shall retain the funds necessary for the
initial funding of the reserves set forth in paragraphs 19(B) (1), (2), (3),
(4) and (5).
Section 24: Ordinance Treated as Contract.
   This entire Ordinance shall be considered as a solemn and binding contract
between the City and the Company.
Section 25: Severability and Interpretation. 
   If any section, paragraph, clause or provision of this Ordinance shall for
any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any such section, paragraph, clause or provision shall not
affect any of the remaining provisions of this Ordinance. In the event of
inconsistency, the titles to the Sections shall not be deemed a part of the
enactment.
Section 27: Effective Date.
   This Ordinance shall become effective on the thirty-first (31st) day after
its enactment; provided, however, that if an election should be required
pursuant to a sufficient petition presented within the time and manner provided
by Section 3-42-1 NMSA 1978, then the effective date of this Ordinance shall be
postponed until the result of the election is known.
   ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 11th day of October, 2005.

ORDINANCE NO. 975
   An Ordinance granting a franchise, with certain rights incident thereto, to
Baca Valley Telephone Company, Inc., its successors and designees, in the City
of Raton, Colfax County, New Mexico, and providing that the City shall receive
cash payments and other considerations therefore.
   SECTION 1. Grant of Authority. There is hereby granted by the City of Raton,
hereinafter called the "City", to Baca Valley Telephone Company, Inc., its
successors and assigns, hereinafter called the "Company", the nonexclusive
right and privilege to construct, erect, operate and maintain, in, upon, along,
across, above, over and under the streets, alleys, public ways and public
places now in use or dedicated, and all extensions thereof, and additions
thereto, in said City, poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and
other telecommunications fixtures and/or facilities necessary or proper for the
maintenance and operation in said City of the Company's telecommunications
business; provided, however, that no poles or other fixtures and/or facilities
shall be placed where the same will interfere with any street, roadway, or
traffic control fixture or with any existing utility fixtures and/or
facilities, the operation, maintenance, or replacement of any electric fixtures
and/or facilities including, but not limited to transformers, poles, overhead
conductors, pedestals, junction boxes, conduit, light standards, water hydrants
or water mains. In the event of the Company's fixtures and/or facilities are
deemed by the City to be causing an interference, the Company will remove or
relocate the fixtures and/or facilities to eliminate any interference, at their
cost. In addition, all poles and other fixtures shall be placed where the same
will cause a minimum interference with the rights of reasonable convenience, of
property owners who adjoin any of said streets, alleys or public ways and
places, and all such poles or other facilities and/or fixtures placed in any
street shall be placed in any street shall be placed on the outer edge of the
sidewalk and inside the curb lines, and those placed in the alleys shall be
placed close to the line of the lots abutting on said usual travel on said
streets, alleys and public ways, and shall not require the City for the change
in any street, roadway or traffic control fixture and/or facility caused by the
change of the locations by the company. The cost thereof shall be paid by the
Company. Additionally, approval, prior to making any pavement cuts, and the
location thereof shall be by prior approval of the City, and all cuts shall be
restored with like material, at Company's expense.
   SECTION 2. Company Liability. The Company shall, at all times during the
life of this franchise, be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power
by the City and to such regulations as the City may, by resolution or
ordinance, hereinafter provide. It is expressly understood and agreed by and
between the Company and the City that the Company shall save the City harmless
from all loss sustained by the City on account of any suit, judgment,
execution, claim or demand whatsoever, resulting from negligence on the part of
the Company in the construction or maintenance of its telecommunications system
in the City.
   SECTION 3: Use of System by Municipality. The City shall have the privilege,
during the life of this franchise, free of charge, where aerial construction
exists, of maintaining upon the poles of the Company within the City limits
wire and pole fixtures necessary for a police and fire alarm and utility
control system, such wires and fixtures to be placed and maintained under the
supervision of the Company. The City in its use and maintenance of such wires
and fixtures shall at all times comply with the rules and regulations of the
Company and the provisions of the latest edition of the National Electrical
Safety Code, so that there may be minimum danger of contact or conflict between
the wires and fixtures of the Company and the wires and fixtures of the City.
It is further agreed, in order to avoid danger to life and property, that the
above privilege is granted on condition that no such police or fire alarm wires
or fixtures of the City shall be placed on poles carrying electric light or
power wires, so that said police or fire and utility control alarm wires or
other fixtures shall not be exposed, without the consent of the Company, to the
danger of contact with any conductor carrying a voltage greater than the normal
telephone voltage. The City shall be solely responsible for all injury to
persons or damage to property arising out of the construction or maintenance of
said police and fire alarm fixtures, or arising out of the attachment,
maintenance or removal of said wires and fixtures to the poles of the Company.
In cases or rearrangement of the Company's plant, or removal of poles or
fixtures, the City shall care for or remove, at its own cost and expense, its
own fixtures, and shall save the Company harmless from any damage or injury to
persons or property, including property of the City, arising out of the removal
or construction of its wires or other fixtures.
   SECTION 4: Repair of Streets. In case of any disturbance of pavement,
sidewalk, driveway or other surfacing, the Company shall, at its own cost and
expense and in a manner entirely satisfactory to the City, and subject to the
jurisdiction of said City respecting the subject, replace and restore all
paving, sidewalk, driveway or surface of any streets or alleys disturbed, in as
good a condition as before said work was commenced. This requirement shall
apply to all construction, surfaced or unsurfaced and in the case of
disagreement, as to the prior condition, the Company agrees that the City shall
determine what the prior condition was. The Company will abide by the "one-
call" doctrine (otherwise known as the "calling before you dig" doctrine) as
established by the City before commencing any construction or repair. The
Company shall comply with any NEC (National Electrical Code), NESC (National
Electrical Safety Code), ANSI (American National Standards Institute) and any
other Federal, State, County or Municipal requirements or regulations, whether
now in existence, or hereinafter enacted. This Section as to costs shall apply,
except to the extent reimbursement is provided for by Section 67-8-18 NMSA,
1978, Comp. or any successor statute governing reimbursement for such costs. If
requested by the City, in order to accomplish construction and maintenance
activities directly related to improvements for the health, safety, and welfare
of the public, the Company shall remove its facilities from the public right of
way or shall relocate or adjust its facilities within the public right of way
at no cost to the City. Such relocation or adjustment shall be completed as
soon as reasonably possible within the time set forth in any request by the
City for such relocation or adjustment. Any damages suffered by the City or its
contractors as a result of the Company's failure to timely relocate or adjust
its facilities shall be borne by the Company. Any relocations, shall be
performed with thirty (30) days of written notice for the projects, unless a
longer period of time is allowed by the City. If the Company fails to complete
such removal or arrangement and in the absence of any extension negotiated by
the parties, the Company shall pay liquidated damages in the amount of $100.00
per day until the completion of said removal or rearrangement. The parties
agree that the liquidated damages represent their best estimate of the actual
damages incurred by the City.
   SECTION 5: Removal of Trees or Shrubbery. The right, license, privilege and
permission is hereby granted to the Company, its successors, and designees to
trim trees upon and overhanging in streets, alleys, sidewalks and public places
of the City, so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming contact
with the wires or cables of the Company, and when so ordered by the City, said
trimming shall be done under the supervision and direction of the City, or its
designee. All trimming shall follow ISA’s Tree Pruning Guidelines or most
recent ANSI A300 Pruning Standards, and ANSI Z133.1 Safety Standards, or their
successors, or any other Federal, State, County or Municipal Regulations that
may then exist or thereafter be enacted.
   SECTION 6: House Moving and Other Unusual Use. Any person or corporation
desiring to move a building or other structure along, or to make any unusual
use of, the streets, alleys and public ways of the City which shall interfere
with the poles, wires or fixtures of the Company, shall first give notice to
said Company, and shall pay to the Company a sum sufficient to cover the
expense and damage incident to the cutting, altering and moving of the wires or
other fixtures of said Company and before a permit is given by the City
therefore, the applicant shall present a receipt from the Company showing said
payment. Thereupon the Company, upon presentation of said permit, shall within
a reasonable time thereafter provide for and do such cutting, altering and
moving of said wires and fixtures as may be necessary to allow such moving or
other unusual use of the streets, alleys and public ways of the City.
   SECTION 7: Consideration. As a further consideration for this franchise, the
Company shall pay to the City an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the
monthly recurring gross revenues, exclusive of all federal and state excise
taxes, received for basic local exchange telecommunications services and
internet furnished to subscribers of the Company within the City of Raton.
Payment shall be made in quarterly installments within sixty (60) days after
the end of each calendar quarter during the term of this franchise. The Company
shall submit a report of Gross Revenues, if question arises by City as to
payments tendered, within thirty (30) days after a written request is made.
   SECTION 8: Annexation. Upon any annexation of territory to the City of
Raton, monthly, recurring local exchange revenues received from subscribers
located within the annexed area shall be included in the base for computation
of payments due the City hereunder, effective thirty (30) days following such
annexation. The City shall notify the Company of all annexations and shall
furnish to the Company copies of all annexation ordinances and maps. The
recurring local exchange revenues for services shall include those listed in
appendix A attached hereto, which list is not inclusive, nor intended to be,
the list being able to be modified based upon technology developed after the
adoption of this Ordinance.
   SECTION 9: Payment in Lieu of Other Taxes. In consideration of the franchise
payments herein above provided for, it is expressly understood and agreed by
the Company and the City that these payments shall be in lieu of any and all
other franchise, license, occupation, or other forms of excise or revenue taxes
based upon or measured by the revenues, employees, payroll, property,
facilities or equipment of the Company, excepting, however, general ad valorem
property taxes, special assessments for local improvements and sales or gross
receipts taxes (all hereinafter referred to as "excepted taxes"). The franchise
payments shall continue only so long as the Company is not prohibited from
making the payments by any lawful authority having jurisdiction in the
premises. Furthermore, if the City does levy, charge or collect or attempt to
levy, charge or collect any other franchise, license, occupation or other form
of excise or revenue taxes of the type above specified in this paragraph (other
than excepted taxes), the obligation to make franchise payments hereunder shall
be abated to the extent such other taxes are levied, charged or collected by
the City.
   SECTION 10: Non-Waiver of Other Rights: It is expressly understood and
agreed by and between the City and the Company that neither the grant nor
acceptance of this franchise shall constitute a waiver, either upon the part of
the Company or the City, of any rights or claims had or made by either with
respect to the occupancy of the streets, alleys, and public places of the City,
under the Constitution and general statutes of the State of New Mexico, nor
shall anything herein in any way prejudice or impair any rights or claims
existing independently of this franchise of the City or the Company, or its
predecessors or successors, with respect to the construction, operation, and
maintenance, either before or after the life of this franchise of a
telecommunications system in the City.
   SECTION 11: TERM OF FRANCHISE. The franchise and rights herein granted shall
continue in force and effect for a term, ten (10) years after the effective
date of this franchise.
   SECTION 12: SEVERABILITY. If any section, paragraph, subdivision, clause,
phrase or provision of this franchise shall be adjudged invalid or
unconstitutional, the same shall not affect the validity of this ordinance as a
whole or any part of the provisions hereof, other than the part so determined
to be invalid or unconstitutional.
   SECTION 13: DAMAGES AND REMEDIES. Any damages caused to any City fixtures
and/or facilities, of any nature whatsoever that may occur, through the
Company's digging through a waterline, sewer tap, knocking over a pedestal, or
any other damages, shall include not only the replacement of said fixtures and/
or facilities, but any liquidated damages that may be attributable thereto from
the loss of any fixtures and/or facilities that cannot be replaced, or for any
claims made against the City for the actions of the company.
   SECTION 14: Prior Approval before Attachment. Any attachment to City
fixtures and/or facilities will require prior approval from the City, and any
attachments to utility poles, or water conduits, connections or sewer
connections, if applicable, will require a separate pole attachment agreement
with the Raton Public Service Company, or the Raton Water Works Company, as the
case may be.
   SECTION 15: Default and Remedies. In the event of breach of this franchise
by either party, the prevailing party shall enjoy all rights and remedies
allowed in law or equity and shall recover reasonable attorney's fees in any
suit arising from breach or enforcement of this franchise.

thirty (30) days after its passage and approval; provided the Company, within
said thirty (30) days, shall have filed with the City Clerk of the City of
Raton an unconditional acceptance thereof. Within ten (10) days after the
filing of said acceptance the City Clerk shall acknowledge in writing the

since that time, operated the Water Works and Sewer Systems of the City; and
   WHEREAS, the Raton Water Works, hereinafter called the "Water Department",
now has almost twenty (20) employees and an annual budget of approximately two
million dollars; and
   WHEREAS, the Water Department is comprised of a complex history of water
rights, litigation, and court decrees, as well as, aging diversion structures,
distribution/collection system, and water treatment facility; and
   WHEREAS, numerous expensive improvements are needed from time to time to
maintain the integrity of the Water and Sewer System; and
   WHEREAS, the Safe Drinking Water Act and Wastewater Discharge Regulations
are only a small fraction of the complicated maze of laws, policies and
regulations which affect the Water Department; and
   WHEREAS, such a utility network must be managed as a business oriented
enterprise, free of influence from the ever changing political climate; and
   WHEREAS, The Board has successfully managed the complex utility system in
compliance with New Mexico Environment Department (NMED) and Environmental
Protection Agency (EPA) regulations as a cooperative component entity for the
City for approximately twenty-two (22) years; and
   WHEREAS, the granting of a twenty-five (25) year franchise extension to the
Raton Water Board would allow the continuity essential to the proper operation
and management of a municipal water system; and
   WHEREAS, it is considered desirable by both the Board and the City of Raton,
hereinafter called "City", that a twenty-five (25) year franchise extension be
granted to the Raton Water Board Franchise.
   NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED by the governing body of the City of Raton,
New Mexico:
   Section 1: Grant of Franchise Extension.
      From and after the effective date of this Ordinance, and subject to all
the terms and provisions herein contained, the City does hereby grant to the
Raton Water Board the right, privilege and franchise, for a term of twenty-five
(25) years beginning July 1, 2013 ending June 30, 2038 to maintain and operate
within the City and within all future additions to the City and within the
City's lawful utility service area as the same may exist from time to time
hereafter, the City's complete water and sewer utility system.
      Throughout the term of this Ordinance the Board shall have the right to
the free use of the rights-of-way, streets, avenues, alleys and public places
of the City and all future additions thereto.
      Provided, however, that the same shall be placed in such reasonable
locations as may be permitted by the City Commission, and in such manner as not
to interfere with other necessary public uses.
   Section 2: Fixing of Rates.
      The City Commission shall from time to time set, fix, determine, and
alter the rate schedules and the rates, charges and rate classifications
pertaining to all services to be rendered by the Board.

operation of the utility by the Board and also provide for the City a
sufficient net income to meet all debt service, operational expense, reserve
requirements, and obligations of the City with respect to necessary revenue
bonds or other similar water and sewer system obligations as the City may issue
from time to time. Until changed by the City, the existing rate schedules,
rates, charges and rate classifications shall remain in effect. The Board may
recommend to the City Commission, from time to time, such changes in rate
schedules and rates as appear necessary and desirable. The City shall retain
full exclusive authority to set rates and issue revenue bonds necessary for
improvements, replacement or expansion of the City water and sewer system.

sewer or refuse service was rendered; and in default of such payment the Board
may, at its option, discontinue the service.
   Section 4: Municipal Uses and Franchise Fee.
      In addition to the Franchise Fee specified in Section 14(B) 3, the Board
shall also furnish to the City all water and sewer services needed by the City
for its municipal offices, and for general municipal purposes within the City's
service area, all without requiring payment therefore from the City.
   Section 5: Rules and Regulations of the Board.
      The Board may make reasonable Rules and Regulations specifying and
controlling the types of equipment, appliances, devices, connections, meter
deposits, easements and operating practices which may be required in order for
a customer to receive service from the Board or in order to entitle customers
to the several rate classifications now or hereafter in force. The Board shall
not be required to make any service connection or main extension unless it's
reasonable requirements have been complied with. The current such Rules and
practices of the Board are herewith approved and ratified by the City. The
Board may hereafter adopt and file with the City Clerk additional such
Regulations with the City and, unless within thirty (30) days of such filing
the City shall disapprove of such Regulations adopted by the Board under this
Section, then such Regulations shall be deemed to be approved and enacted by
the City and in effect. Within such thirty (30) day period the City Commission
shall have the power to require modifications or may set aside such newly filed
Regulation and establish such Regulation as the City Commission may consider
proper and a copy of such City enacted Regulation shall then be filed with the

and regulations as may be necessary for the protection of the Board and the
lawful conduct of its operations. The rights and privileges granted to the

   Section 14: Rate and Income Requirements and Disposition of System
Revenues. 
      OPERATING FUND:
         A.   The Board shall set aside the entire gross income and revenues of
the utility system into a special fund to be known as the "Water Board Gross
Income Fund", hereinafter sometimes designated as the "Water Operating Fund",
from which fund the Board shall make the operational, reserve and debt payments
below described. After such payments the Board each year shall transfer and pay
over to the City Treasurer all remaining income and revenues derived from the
operation of the utility for any lawful purpose or purposes then required or
permitted under the constitution and laws of the State of New Mexico and the
bond ordinances and other ordinances of the City.
         B.   So long as this franchise shall remain in force and effect, the
City Commission shall set the utility system rates in an amount designed to
achieve the following income, and the income shall be expended in the following
priorities, to-wit:
            1.   Monthly Operating Expenses: The Board shall first pay current
expenses of the operation of the utility system, excluding depreciation and
amortization expenses, as they become due and payable from the "Water Operating
Fund". Upon execution of this Ordinance, the sum of $200,000.00 shall be set
aside into such fund. Thereafter, this fund is to be maintained at an amount
determined to be a thirty (30) day average of the preceding year's cash
expenses or $250,000, whichever is greater.
            2.   Bond Fund: All outstanding water revenue bonds issued for
utility system improvements shall be paid from revenue from the "One Cent
Supplemental Water" gross receipts tax. Should the one cent tax be repealed,
the Board shall set aside necessary funds and recommend the necessary water and
sewer rate increase as required for debt service and bond reserves, under any
ordinances of the City creating and issuing utility system bonds for
improvement, replacements, or expansion of the City's water and sewer utility
system. All outstanding sewer revenue bonds issued for utility system
improvements shall be paid from revenue from the "Water Operating Fund" as per
Section 14(A). The City shall continue to retain full authority to create and
issue system bonds and to enact such ordinances and revenue guarantees as shall
be appropriate and lawful for such system bonds.
            3.   Franchise Fee: From any remaining income the Board shall next
pay to the City, in monthly payments of one-twelfth (1/12) each, an amount
equal to four percent (4%) of the immediately preceding fiscal year's gross
annual revenues, as defined above.
            4.   Capital Improvement Fund:
               a.   With One Cent Supplemental Gross Receipts Tax: From any
remaining income, the Board shall set aside in monthly payments of one-twelfth
(1/12) each, to the "Water Board Capital Improvement Fund" a cash reserve as
will be equal during each fiscal year to ten percent (10%) of the gross annual
revenue for water and sewer capital improvements, based upon the total revenues
for the immediately preceding fiscal year. The monies in the Board's present
Water and Sewer Capital Improvements Reserve shall be transferred to such fund.
The funds shall be limited to a combined total cap of fifty percent (50%) of
the gross annual revenues of the Board for the preceding fiscal year, and the
maximum amount in such fund may be increased by Resolution of the City
Commission. Amounts in said fund shall be available to pay, in whole or in
part, the costs of equipment purchases, for the utility system.
                  Revenue from the "One Cent Supplemental Water" gross receipts
tax shall be used for all the costs of water additions, extensions,
improvements and line replacements for the utility.
               b.   Without One-Cent Supplemental Gross Receipt Tax: Should the
one cent supplemental tax be repealed, the Board shall increase payments to the
Water Board Capital Improvement Fund to fifteen percent (15%) of the gross
annual revenues from the immediately preceding fiscal year. The Water Board
Capital Improvement Fund cap shall also be increased to 100% of the previous
fiscal year's gross annual revenue. Once the one cent fund is gone, costs of
all equipment, additions, extensions, improvements, expansions, filter plant
improvements and repairs, sewer plant improvements and repairs, new line costs,
line replacements and all new fire hydrants shall be paid from Water Department
revenues by way of the Water Board Capital Improvement Fund.
                  The Board shall determine and recommend the rate increases
necessary to accomplish aforesaid repairs and capital improvements. The maximum
amount in the Water Board Capital Improvement Fund may be increased by
Resolution of the City Commission.
         5.   Annual Payment to the City: The residue of revenues of the Board
shall be paid to the City, annually, at the end of the fiscal year.
   Section 15: Use of City Property.
      Throughout the life of the franchise granted by this Ordinance, the Board
shall have the use and possession of all of the physical assets, including
reservoirs, transmission and distribution lines, pipes and appliances,
belonging to the City's utility system, all for the purpose of the operation of
the system by the Board under the terms of this Ordinance. The franchise shall
also be granted use of operational space in City Hall.
   Section 16: Reports and Audits.
      The Board shall prepare an annual budget and submit quarterly reports in
a timely manner to the City Commission to be incorporated into the City budget
and quarterly reports respectively.
      The Water Department shall be audited as part of the City audit each
year.
   Section 17: Actions of the City Commission.
      The expression "City Commission", wherever used in this Ordinance, shall
be interpreted to mean the governing body of the City, regardless of the
particular form of government which may be in effect. Any action, consent,
approval or permission to be taken or given by the City Commission pursuant to
this Ordinance may be accomplished by a simple motion of the City Commission.
   Section 18: Transition Provisions.
      From and after the effective date of this Ordinance, this Ordinance shall
immediately supersede and replace Ordinance Numbers 685, 824 and 895 and are
hereby repealed.
   Section 19: Ordinance Treated as Contract.
      This entire Ordinance shall be considered as a solemn and binding
contract between the City and the Board.
   Section 20: Severability and Interpretation.
      If any section, paragraph, clause or provision of this Ordinance shall
for any reason be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the invalidity or
unenforceability of any such section, paragraph, clause or provision shall not
affect any of the remaining provision of this Ordinance. In the event of
inconsistency, the titles to the Sections shall not be deemed a part of the
enactment.

relocate its facilities and at any time at which the City determines that it

Grantee of such City project or material modification of such City project and
offer to meet and confer with Grantee on date(s) and at time(s) and location(s)
that are mutually acceptable to the City and Grantee. The purpose of such
meeting(s) is to seek Grantee's input and explore means of reducing the costs
to the Grantee or, as applicable, to the City, and to provide the City with a
timetable within which the involved Grantee facilities will be relocated,
including anticipated start date, so as to facilitate coordination with the
timetable to be established by the City for completion of the City project. The

project on the Grantee.

Grantee shall provide to the City telephone numbers and e-mail addresses of the
Grantee's management personnel responsible for utility service in the City and
shall, upon request, provide the City with status reports on a twenty-four hour
basis concerning interruptions of the supply of utility service in any portion
of the City.
B.   Inspections and As-Built Work
   1.   Work performed by Grantee maybe subject to municipal ordinances
requiring inspections of work to ensure that the work has been performed in
accordance with the requirements of the laws, ordinances, and regulations of
the City. Such inspection may include, but not be limited to, the following
matters: location of facilities in streets; cutting and trimming of trees and
shrubs; disturbance of pavements, sidewalks, and surfaces of streets. Grantee
shall promptly perform reasonable remedial action required by the City pursuant
to said inspections. If no such ordinances, the Grantee shall be required to
perform pursuant to the provisions, less the language "subject to municipal
ordinances."
   2.   It shall be a condition of the City's approval that for any major
facility installed, renovated, or replaced after the effective date of this
franchise, Grantee shall provide the City with as-built drawings of each such
facility in such formats and providing such details as reasonably requested by
the City.
   3.   Location - All above-ground fixtures shall be so placed as to not
interfere with the usual travel on said rights-of-way. Underground facilities
may be located under the traveled portion of rights-of way provided the surface
of such right-of-way is restored as hereunder provided.
   4.   Restoration - If, while installing, repairing or maintaining its
facilities, the Company disturbs the surface of any right-of-way or public
place, the Company shall, at its own cost and expense, and in a manner approved
by the City, replace and restore all paving, sidewalk, driveway or surface so
disturbed in as good condition as before said work was commenced.
   5.   Specifications and Standards - All fixtures installed, repaired,
maintained or operated shall be done so in compliance with all applicable City,
State and Federal specifications and standards.
   6.   Relocation of Facilities - In the event that any time during the period
of this franchise, the City shall elect to alter or change the grade or
location of any publicly owned utility, street, easement, alley or other public
way for the purpose of sewer or street improvement, the Company, upon
reasonable notice by the City of the necessity, and after due consideration
being given to Company's seasonal load requirements, shall remove, relay or
relocate, at Company's determination, its underground pipelines, manholes and
other related fixtures. Such relocation shall be at Company's own cost and
expense if required by public necessity, health, or safety, but shall be at the
City's expense if the change made by the city is based only on considerations
of aesthetics or convenience, and may be at the State's expense if eligible
under Sections 67-8-15 to 67-8-21, N.M.S.A. 1978 Comp., or successor statutes.
   7.   Maps - Grantee shall prepare and submit to the City a map showing any
addition to or change in the location of its distribution system, showing
location and size, as applicable, of lines, valves, gates and all appurtenances
incident to the distribution system, so far as the location of such facilities
can reasonably be projected. This map will be provided to the City thirty (30)
days prior to any actual construction of new facilities or relocation of
existing facilities.
   8.   Permits - Grantee shall be responsible for obtaining all applicable
permits, including any excavation or tree cut permits, in the manner required
by the laws, ordinances, and regulations of the City.
   9.   Extensions of Service - Grantee shall make such reasonable extensions
of its mains from time to time as may be required to furnish service within the
City to consumer(s) making application therefore, in accordance with the rules,
regulations, and orders of the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission.
Section VIII. Franchise Fees
In consideration of the rights and privileges herein granted, the Grantee shall
pay to the City, effective the first complete billing cycle after this
franchise becomes effective, a franchise fee or fee equivalent to 4 percent
(4%) of monthly gross receipts exclusive of all taxes derived from gas utility
services within the corporate limits of the City that is billed by Grantee.
Payments to the City shall be made quarterly within 60 days after the end of
each calendar quarter and each such payment shall be accompanied by a statement
supporting the payment. The City may on each five (5) year anniversary of this
franchise request review and prospective adjustment of the franchise fees to be
billed to Company's customers and paid to the City consistent with the amounts
charged to other utilities that have a franchise with the City or with the
amounts charged to Grantee by other New Mexico municipalities with which
Grantee has a franchise, but in no event will the city be required to take less
than the amount provided in this Ordinance so long as that amount is lawful.
To assure proper payment as herein provided, the books of the company shall be
open to inspection by the City at all reasonable times, but shall nevertheless
remain confidential, unless disclosure is agreed to by the parties hereto,
court order, or governmental or administrative order.
Such payment shall be in lieu of any and all other fees, charges, licenses,
taxes or assessments which said City may impose for the rights and privileges
herein granted for the use of the rights of way, and in the event any such fee,
charge, license, tax or assessment shall be imposed by said City; the payment
to be made in accordance with the provisions of this section shall be refunded
in an amount equal to the annual burden of such fee, charge, license tax or
assessment imposed upon the Grantee. Ad Valorem property taxes imposed
generally upon all real and personal property within said City shall not be
deemed to affect the obligation of the Grantee under this section.
If at any time during the term of this franchise the manner in which a
franchise fee specified herein is calculated, collected or paid is changed,
whether by action of the Grantee, the PRC, or any entity having jurisdiction
thereof, the Grantee agrees to cooperate with the City in modifying the
franchise to assure that the Grantee collects and the City receives an amount
in franchise fees or some other form that is consistent with the intent of this
franchise to the extent permitted by law.
Section IX. Term
This franchise and the rights, privileges, and franchises hereby granted shall
be and remain in full force and effect for a period of twenty-five (25) years
from the effective date of this franchise as set forth below.
Section X. Termination of Franchise
A.   Upon the termination of this franchise if the Grantee shall not have
acquired an extension or renewal thereof and accepted same, Grantee may have
and is hereby granted the right to enter upon the streets, alleys, bridges,
viaducts, roads, lanes and other public places of the City, for the purpose of
removing there from any or all of its plants, structures, pipes, mains or
equipment pertaining thereto, at any time after the City has had ample time and
opportunity to purchase, condemn or replace them. In so removing said pipes,
mains or other property, the Grantee shall, at its own expense and in a
workmanlike manner, refill any excavations that shall be made by it in the
graveled or paved streets, alleys, bridges, viaducts, roads, lanes and other
public places after the removal of its mains, pipes or other structures, and
repair all surfaces to the condition prior to such removal.
B.   If any payment herein provided to be paid is not paid when due after
thirty (30) days written notice from city to company of such non-payment (which
period of 30 days commences with the day after receipt of such notice), this
franchise may be terminated by the City. If the Company substantially fails to
comply with any of the other provisions of this franchise and fails to cure the
same or is unable to provide justification for such non-compliance within sixty
(60) days after it has received written notice from the City claiming such non-
compliance with any of the terms and provisions of this franchise, the City
shall give Company an additional written notice that this franchise will be
terminated effective ninety (90) days after receipt of said notice to Company,
unless the Company corrects such non-compliance within said period of time. If
the City and company disagree over whether Company has substantially failed to
comply with any of the other provisions of this franchise or has failed to cure
an alleged non-compliance, the franchise shall continue until agreement is
reached between the City and company resolving the matter or until the matter
has been litigated through the Courts to final judgment. Non-compliance by
company of any terms and provisions of this franchise due to force majeure or
any cause beyond its control does not constitute reason for termination of this
franchise.
Section XI. Assignment
The Grantee may assign this franchise, or the rights granted hereunder by
providing prior written notice to the City Manager, and by first obtaining the
written consent of the City, and upon any necessary approval by the New Mexico
Public Regulation Commission. The City's consent to such an assignment shall
not be unreasonably withheld, and this section shall not be construed to
restrict or prevent the issuance of bonds, debentures, or other evidence of
indebtedness, needed or useful for the purpose of financing the system or any
portion thereof.
Section XII. Ordinance Repealed
Ordinance No. 836 enacted on September 22, 1992, is hereby repealed and of no
further force or effect.
Section XIII. Successors and Assigns
The rights, powers, limitations, duties and restrictions herein provided for
shall insure to and be binding upon the parties hereto and upon their
respective successors and assigns
Section XIV. Police Power
Grantee shall, at all times during the term of this franchise, be subject to
all lawful exercises of the police power of the City. The right is hereby
reserved to the City to adopt, in addition to the provisions herein contained
and any other existing applicable ordinances, such additional applicable
ordinances as it shall find necessary in the exercise of its police power,
provided that such additional ordinance shall be reasonable, shall not conflict
with or alter in any manner the rights granted herein, and shall not conflict
with the orders, rules and regulations of the New Mexico Public Regulation
Commission, the laws of the State of New Mexico or the laws of the United
States of America.
Section XV. Miscellaneous Provisions
A.   No waiver of governmental immunity nothing herein shall be in any way
construed as a waiver on behalf of the City of any of the protections and
provisions of the New Mexico Governmental Immunity Act.
B.   Captions. The captions to Sections contained herein are intended solely to
facilitate the reading hereof. Such captions shall not affect the meaning or
interpretation of the text herein.
C.   Continuing Jurisdiction. This franchise and the ordinance approving the
same and the respective rights and obligations of the parties hereunder are
subject to all present and future valid governmental legislation or regulation,
whether federal or state, of duly constituted authorities which have
jurisdiction over this franchise, one or both of the parties, or any
transaction hereunder.
D.   Venue. Venue for all judicial actions shall be in Colfax County, New
Mexico.
E.   No Waiver. Neither the City nor Grantee shall be excused from complying
with any of the terms and conditions of this franchise by any failure of the
other, or any of its officers, employees, or agents, upon one or more
occasions, to insist upon or to seek compliance with any terms and conditions.
F.   Representatives. Both parties shall designate from time to time in writing
representatives for the Grantee and the City who will be persons to whom
notices shall be sent regarding any action to be taken under this franchise.
Notices shall be in writing and forwarded by certified mail or hand delivered
to the person and address stated, unless the person and address are changed at
the written request of either party, delivered in person or by certified mail.
Until such change shall hereafter be made, notices shall be sent as follows:

To the Grantee:

(or such other address as may be designated, from time to time)
G.   Severability. Should any one or more provisions of this franchise be held
invalid, void, unconstitutional or to be illegal or unenforceable by any court
of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed separate and distinct
from the balance and such declaration shall not affect the validity of the
remaining provisions herein; provided, however, the parties shall forthwith
enter into good faith negotiations and proceed with due diligence to draft a
substitute term for each such provision held to be illegal or unenforceable
that will achieve the original intent of the parties hereunder, if possible.
H.   Payment of Expenses Incurred by City in Relation to Approval of this
Franchise Agreement. Grantee shall reimburse the City for expenses incurred in
publication of notices and publication of ordinances.
Section XVI. Acceptance and Effective Date
