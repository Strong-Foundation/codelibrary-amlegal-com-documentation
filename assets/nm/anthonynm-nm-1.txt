      (2)   If any single-family properties are to be rehabilitated,
weatherized, converted, leased, repaired, constructed or otherwise are to
benefit from affordable housing funds, and if the qualifying grantee intends to
rent the single-family property out, those single-family properties shall be
leased to persons of low- or moderate-income at the time of any such award.
Grantees also shall agree that the persons of low- or moderate-income who are
tenants of those apartments shall be allowed to remain tenants for so long as
there are no uncured defaults by those tenants under their respective leases,
which must be compliant to the state’s Uniform Owner–Resident Relations Act
(NMSA §§ 47-8-1 through 47-8-52), and provided that there is no just cause (as
outlined in NMSA § 47-8-33) for the landlord or landlady to terminate any lease
agreement with those tenants.
   (B)   Multi-family properties.
      (1)   Regarding single apartments within a multi-family property,
qualifying grantees shall agree that, if any single apartments are to be
rehabilitated, weatherized, converted, leased, repaired, constructed or
otherwise are to benefit from affordable housing funds, those apartments shall
be leased to persons of low- or moderate-income at the time of any such award.

Qualifying grantees also shall agree that the persons of low- or moderate-

for so long as there are no uncured defaults by those tenants under their
respective leases, which must be compliant to the state’s Uniform
Owner–Resident Relations Act (NMSA §§ 47-8-1 through 47-8-52), and provided
that there is no just cause (as outlined in NMSA § 47-8-33 NMSA) for the
landlord or landlady to terminate any lease agreement with those tenants.
      (2)   Regarding multiple apartments, qualifying grantees shall agree that
if multiple apartments or an entire multi-family property are to be acquired,
rehabilitated, weatherized, converted, leased, repaired, constructed or
otherwise are to benefit from affordable housing funds, including, but not
limited to, any loans which have been repaid with affordable housing funds, and
which loans previously were secured by such properties, they shall maintain not
less than 60% of the housing units as affordable housing for so long as any or
all of the affordable housing funds which have been awarded, loaned or
otherwise conveyed to the qualifying grantee are unpaid and outstanding or the
affordability period, whichever is longer.
   (C)   Non-residential properties. Qualifying grantees shall agree that they
shall maintain any non-residential property which has been acquired,
rehabilitated, weatherized, converted, leased, repaired or constructed, or

housing funds, and which loans previously were secured by such properties, as a
facility which provides housing related-services to persons of low- or

moderate-income in accordance with division (C) above (as applicable) for the
duration of the affordability period. Qualifying grantees shall agree that they
shall maintain any land or buildings for which they have received the costs of
infrastructure as a housing assistance grant as either single-family or multi-
family affordable housing or as a facility which provides housing related-
services to persons of low- or moderate-income (as applicable) for the duration
of the affordability period. In calculating the affordability period for
housing assistance grants of either land or buildings, the fair market value of
the land or buildings or the costs of infrastructure at the time of the
donation by the city shall apply.
   (E)   Affordability period.
      (1)   The city, in its discretion, may increase the affordability period
in any contracts, notes, mortgages, loan agreements, land use restriction
agreements, restrictive covenant agreements and/or any other agreements which

GENERAL PROVISIONS
§ 150.001 TITLE.
   This chapter shall be known and titled as the “City of Anthony, New Mexico,
Land Use Regulations and Zoning Ordinance” and shall be referred to as “this
chapter”.
(Ord. 2010-018, passed - -)
§ 150.002 AUTHORITY AND INTENT.
   (A)   This chapter is created pursuant to the authority set forth in NMSA §§
3-21-1 et seq., 3-21-5 and 4-57-1 et seq., and this chapter is intended to
create orderly, harmonious and economically sound development in order to
promote the health, safety, convenience and general welfare of the citizens of
the city. These regulations are necessary to provide adequate open spaces for
light and air; avoid undue concentrations of population; preserve the city’s
environmental resources; secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; help
control congestion in the streets and public ways; facilitate adequate
provisions for community utilities and facilities such as transportation,
water, sewer, schools and parks; encourage the location of compatible uses of
land; provide for proper floodwater runoff; and enhance the appearance of the
landscape, as specifically referenced in the city’s master plan.
   (B)   The regulations are intended to achieve the following goals in the
master plan:
      (1)   Protect city residents from possible hazardous effects of
uncontrolled land uses;
      (2)   Allow the entrepreneur and investor the options to select areas and
locations suitable for their intended purposes with the understanding that
standards and regulations are necessary to protect the environment and the
properties of others;
      (3)   Allow the community of the city, which is in an advanced state of
development, to adopt more conventional zoning processes for land use by
forming zoning districts; and
      (4)   Permit developers the opportunity to permanently designate land
uses within their developments and to set standards for those land uses.
(Ord. 2010-018, passed - -)
§ 150.003 OVERVIEW.
   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to achieve land use policies and
actions delineated in the 2010 City Master Plan. This chapter implements the
2010 City Master Plan actions that recommend mapped zoning districts for
Community Districts as well as Village Districts. Mapped districts are intended
for communities that are experiencing rapid growth and will use traditional
zoning districts, while historic communities will be able to continue their
unique character with standards to maintain traditional development patterns in
Village Districts.
   (B)   These district standards recognize the need and desirability of
allowing for diversity in land use patterns to accommodate rural, suburban and
urban development; and to encourage entrepreneurship and creativity in new
development and economic growth.
(Ord. 2010-018, passed - -)
§ 150.004 LAND USE DESIGNATIONS.
   The following terms and their meanings are used throughout this chapter:

establishment of a Community District as provided in this chapter.
   (C)   ZONING DISTRICT. A zoning category used in the Community District or
Village District, such as R-1, single-family residential uses. A zoning
district must have specific boundaries.
   (D)   PERFORMANCE DISTRICT. Areas outside the mapped zoning districts: in
the Performance District, land uses are permitted, provided the land use meets
specific development standards, including buffer requirements. Some uses will
require a public hearing via the planned unit development process.
   (E)   PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS. Overlay zones that may be created
using the planned development process outlined in §
150.156
   (F)   VILLAGE DISTRICT. Zones that are created in communities that have
historical significance and are townsites platted prior to 1930; special

§ 150.026 VARIANCES.
   (A)   Any development proposed that does not conform to any of the
“standards of development” in this chapter must obtain a variance. A variance
shall not be granted unless the variance is found to meet the requirements of

property within the area of notification or on the city generally.
   (B)   (1)   An application for a variance shall be submitted to the city by
the owner of the property that is the subject of the variance request or by the
owner’s agent. A completed copy of the application, an appropriate site plan
that meets the criteria set forth in this chapter and a non-refundable filing
fee shall be submitted to the Zoning Administrator.
      (2)   The Zoning Administrator may grant an administrative variance
request. The governing body may grant administrative variances for clear sight
triangle variances only, under the following circumstances.

variance requested and shall also state that, if no written objections to the
variance are received within 15 calendar days of the date of the notice, the
variance may be granted administratively without a hearing, and that if written
objections are received within that 15-day period, the variance request will be
submitted to the Planning and Zoning Commission for a public hearing upon
payment of the variance fee.
         (d)   A denial by the Zoning Administrator under this division (B)(2)
(d) may be appealed to the Planning and Zoning Commission.

appealed to the governing body of the city.
      (5)   The following findings are required for approval of any variance:
         (a)   Granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety or welfare, or be materially injurious to properties or
improvements in the area of notice;
         (b)   Granting of the variance is justified because there is a
physical hardship or extraordinary economic hardship for the applicant
resulting from the size, shape, existing structures or topographical or other
physical conditions on the site or in the area of notice; and
         (c)   Granting the variance will uphold the spirit and intent of this
chapter and accomplish substantial justice.

PERFORMANCE DISTRICT
§ 150.055 PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Performance Zone District is to allow flexibility for
land use activities in the rural areas of the city, while protecting residents
and property values. In the Performance Zone District, any use may be approved
provided that all standards for that particular use are met and the use is
consistent with the character of the surrounding areas. Standards for land uses
are based on the intensity of the primary use of a parcel of land. The most
intense uses with a potential impact on a larger area of the city, or its
resources, than the residential or commercial uses will require approval
through the planned unit development process (PUD).
(Ord. 2010-018, passed - -)
§ 150.056 LAND USE INTENSITIES.
   (A)   Specific classifications in the land use classification matrix in §
150.205 are controlling over the general descriptions of intensity
classifications below. Standards for a particular land use are based on the
intensity of that use. Land use intensity refers to relative measure of
development impacts defined by characteristics, such as the number of dwelling
units per acre and amount of site coverage.
   (B)   Land uses are categorized into the following activities:
      (1)   Low intensity:
         (a)   Residential; and
         (b)   Non-residential.
      (2)   Medium intensity:
         (a)   Residential; and
         (b)   Non-residential.
      (3)   High intensity:
         (a)   Residential;
         (b)   RMP – residential mobile home park;
         (c)   RMS – residential mobile home subdivision; and
         (d)   Non-residential.
      (4)   Planned unit development overlay zone:
         (a)   Type 1: mixed-use residential; and
         (b)   Type 2: non-residential (commercial and industrial).
(Ord. 2010-018, passed - -)
§ 150.057 DETERMINATION OF LAND USE INTENSITY.
   The classification of a particular land use must first be determined as a
residential or non-residential use. The use must go through the intensity
review. The review asks questions that look at potential impacts created by the
proposed land use.
(Ord. 2010-018, passed - -)
§ 150.058 INTENSITY FOR RESIDENTIAL AND NON-RESIDENTIAL LAND USES.

§ 150.063 PC-1, LOW-INTENSITY NON-RESIDENTIAL USE.
   The purpose of the low-intensity non-residential classification is to
provide standards for non-residential land uses and agriculture that are
categorized as having little or no impact on surrounding residential uses.
Permitted uses include: agriculture, agricultural packing and warehousing,
neighborhood commercial and personal services. Such uses are intended to serve
the parking and shipping needs of farms and ranches nearby and to provide
retail goods and services as well as institutional uses to a neighborhood or a
small area of the county.

LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERING REQUIREMENTS
§ 150.080 PURPOSES.
   Buffer plantings are intended to provide transition between contrasting land
uses and architectural styles, to reduce the impact of building scale and to
generally mitigate incompatible or undesirable views. They are used to soften
rather than block viewing and, where required, a mix of plant materials shall
be used to achieve the desired effect. Screening is used where unsightly views
or visual conflicts must be obscured or blocked and where privacy and security
are desired. Fences and walls for screening may be constructed of wood,
concrete, stone, brick and wrought iron, or other commonly used fencing/wall
materials. Acoustically designed fences and walls are also used where noise
pollution requires mitigation.
(Ord. 2010-018, passed - -)
§ 150.081 LANDSCAPING AND BUFFERS.
   (A)   (1)   The buffer yard is a designated unit of yard or open area
together with any plant materials, barriers or fences required thereon. Both
the amount of land and the type and amount of landscaping specified are
designated to lessen impacts between adjoining land uses. By using both
distance and landscaping, potential nuisances, such as noise, glare, activity,
dirt, unsightly parking areas and so forth, will be minimized. Where a non-
residential use that is hereafter developed abuts a residential (even if
vacant) or agricultural land use, buffer landscaping is required to minimize
noise, lighting and sight impact of the non-residential activities in the
residential area. Where a medium- or high-intensity residential use is
hereafter developed next to and abutting low-intensity residential or
agricultural land use, buffer landscaping is required.
      (2)   Landscaping and buffer landscaping will be required within the
following districts:
         (a)   Performance medium-intensity residential (PR-2);
         (b)   Performance high-intensity residential (PR-3);
         (c)   Community medium-intensity residential (CR-2);
         (d)   Community high-intensity residential (CR-3);
         (e)   Village residential; multi-family (VR-2);
         (f)   Performance low-intensity non-residential (PC-I);
         (g)   Performance medium-intensity non-residential (PC-2);
         (h)   Performance high-intensity non-residential (PC-3);
         (i)   Community Commercial and Industrial (CC-1, CR-2, CR-3 and CI-1,
CI-2 and CI-3);
         (j)   Village Commercial (VC-1, VC-2 and VMU); and
         (k)   Planned unit development overlay zones.
   (B)   Low intensity residential (PR-I, CR-l, CR-IM, VR-J, VR-IM) land uses
are exempt from this section.
   (C)   Unless otherwise indicated, landscaping will consist of a minimum of
15% of the total area of the proposed developed portion of the lot.
   (D)   Buffers shall be provided and maintained as set forth below in the
landscaping buffer matrix in §
150.085.
   (E)   For non-residential uses, a solid wall or a solid fence at least six
feet high shall be erected on sides abutting or adjacent to a low-, medium- or
high-intensity residential use (PR-l, PR-2, PR-3, CR-l, CR-IM, CR-2, CR-3, VR-
1 and VR-2), except for those sides abutting public rights-of-way or private
roads.
      (1)   In order to allow for unobstructed vision, such wall or fence shall
be three feet high in the area within 11 feet of a public way or planned public
way.
      (2)   If the wall, plus retaining wall, has an effective height of over
eight feet on the residential side, the Zoning Administrator, or his or her
designee, shall decide the acceptable height.
   (F)   Lighting shall be placed to reflect the light away from adjacent
residential districts.
   (G)   No noise, odor or vibration shall be emitted by uses outside the
boundaries of a non-residential use. Such determination shall be made at the
boundary of the non-residential use.
   (H)   Parking lot landscaping is intended to break up large expanses of
pavement, create shade, buffer views of parking lots from adjacent streets and
developments and enhance the overall appearance of each project. Landscaping of
the parking area shall consist of a minimum of 15% of the total landscape area
required in division (C) above and shall include a minimum of one tree per five
parking spaces. All parking lots and repaving projects of existing parking lots
consisting of ten or more required spaces shall be subject to these
requirements.
   (I)   Trees, shrubs and other drought tolerant plant species that require
minimal water should be used.
   (J)   The trees and/or shrubs shall form a largely opaque screen; however,
within a clear sight triangle, the trees and shrubs shall be maintained to a
height of not higher than three feet.
   (K)   The landscape buffer between any residential and non-residential use
shall not eliminate the applicable requirements for a fence or wall if parking
is adjacent to the landscaping strip.
   (L)   A landscape plan indicating the type, size and location of landscaping
along with topography and an irrigation plan showing the type and size of pipes
and heads shall be submitted in conjunction with the application for the
building permit.
   (M)   The irrigation system and the landscaping shall be installed before
the completion of building construction and prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy unless a written agreement has been approved by the
Zoning Administrator.
   (N)   The owner of the landscaped property shall be responsible to maintain
it in a healthy, clean, trimmed, weed-free and litter-free condition. Dead
plant material shall be replaced with new plant material immediately. All plant
growth in required landscaped areas shall be controlled by pruning or trimming
so that it will not interfere with the installation, maintenance or repair of
any public utility, nor restrict pedestrian or vehicular traffic, nor
constitute a traffic hazard.
   (O)   The Zoning Administrator, or his or her designee, may approve an
alternative landscaping plan that locates the buffer landscaping away from the
site plan boundary line if they find that all of the following apply.
      (1)   Noise, lighting and sight buffering of the residential district can
be accomplished at least as well with the alternative plan.
      (2)   The alternative landscaping plan does not result in less landscaped
area than would have been required with the normal buffer landscaping strip
specified in the landscaping/buffer matrix in §
150.085.
      (3)   A solid wall or solid fence at least six feet high is provided
along all segments of the site plan boundary line that does not have the
standard buffer landscaping strip.

   The purpose of this subchapter is to set forth standards and procedures for
special overlay zones. The overlay zones may be applied in any district:
Performance District, Community District or Village District. The standards are
intended to provide for specific land use impacts and special environmental
considerations, such as flood protection.
(Ord. 2010-018, passed - -)
§ 150.156 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONE.
   (A)   The PUD overlay zone is intended for those land uses that will, by
their nature, have a greater impact on the environment and will affect larger
areas of the city. This classification is intended to provide an alternative to
the conventional approach to land use regulations by permitting flexibility and
innovation in design, placement of buildings, use of open spaces and off-street
parking areas and to encourage a more creative approach to the utilization of
the land.
   (B)   (1)   PUD classifications. Types of PUD classifications:
         (a)   Type 1. When an applicant, for whatever reason, wishes to
deviate from the standard regulations or when an applicant proposes to use
different land use classifications within the same site, such as a variety of
residential housing types and some retail or commercial; and
         (b)   Type 2. When a commercial or industrial land use is proposed
that will have the potential to create negative impacts on the environment,
infrastructure or adjacent and nearby properties. Such uses include:
            1.   Performance District:
               a.   Adult entertainment; provided that such uses must be
located a minimum of 1,000 feet from a property line of a school, church,
public park or recreational facility, residential zoning district or
residential use:
                  i.   Adult entertainment;
                  ii.   Agricultural processes;
                  iii.   Airports and heliports;
                  iv.   Automobile garages; and
                  v.   PUD, Type 2 uses.
               b.   Truck repair sales and service (trucks with three axles and

               m.   Fat rendering plants;
               n.   Feedlots;
               o.   Fertilizer plant manufacturing;
               p.   Foundries;
               q.   Ground transportation terminals;
               r.   Hazardous materials or hazardous waste facilities,
including, but not limited to, storage, manufacturing or repackaging of
hazardous waste or materials;
               s.   Hospitals;
               t.   Industrial, light and heavy uses;
               u.   Junk yards and dismantling;
               v.   Landfills;
               w.   Manufacturing;

               kk.   Similar uses may be included based on interpretation by
the Zoning Administrator.
            2.   Community District zone:
               a.   All uses listed for Performance District PUD, Type 2,
except agricultural processing, borrow pits, batching plants and asphaltic mix
plants; and
               b.   Land uses listed under PUD, Type 2, are permitted only upon
approval of the PUD by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Other land uses may
be included in a PUD if the applicant includes them in the PUD site plan.
      (2)   Procedures, requirements and standards. An applicant for a PUD
shall meet the same procedures, requirements and standards as a zone change;
however, the P&Z will make a final determination unless its decision is
appealed to the city’s governing body, and the final decision shall be made in
the form of an order and recorded in the office of the City Clerk.
         (a)   Land. The tract of land is under unified ownership or control
and shall be planned as a whole. If the tract is to be developed in phases, a
phasing schedule shall be provided and each phase shall be reviewed on its own
merits.
         (b)   Comprehensive plan. The PUD shall be in harmony with the city’s
comprehensive plan goals and policies.
         (c)   Lot size. A Type 1 PUD, proposed residential PUD or a
residential PUD mixed with commercial and/or industrial uses shall consist of
an area that is not less than five acres.
         (d)   Density, for residential uses in a Type 1 PUD. Where a variety
of housing types may be provided, the total number of dwelling units allowed
shall be determined by either the density standard of the original zoning
district classification of the area that is now proposed for the planned unit
development or the density standard as recommended by the city’s land use
section of the comprehensive plan. The planned unit development may exceed
these maximum density standards by 10% if it can be demonstrated by the
applicant that such an excess will not adversely affect public infrastructure
such as roads, water, sewer or drainage facilities.
         (e)   Setback regulations. Building setbacks from all property lines
that form the perimeter of the total area devoted to the planned unit
development shall result in a development that will blend well with adjacent
developments by matching the setback requirements or buffer, as set forth
elsewhere in this chapter, of the original zoning district classification of
the area that is now proposed for the planned unit development; or the setback
requirements applicable to the adjacent zoning districts, whichever is greater.
         (f)   Height regulations. Heights of buildings and structures shall
result in a development that will blend well with adjacent developments by
matching the height requirements, as set forth elsewhere in this chapter, of
the original zoning district classification of the area that is now proposed
for the planned unit development; or the height requirements applicable to the
adjacent zoning districts. Height standards for antenna and communication
towers or electric transmission lines shall meet standards set in division (B)
(2)(k) below.
         (g)   Open space. Common open space, varying in amount and location,
shall be provided to offset any substantial increase in dwelling unit density
or building height or any substantial decrease in building setback distances
within the site.
         (h)   Streets, utilities, services and public facilities. Because of
the uniqueness of each PUD proposal, the specifications and standards for
streets, utilities, services and public facilities may be different from those
normally required in this chapter and other ordinances if it can be
demonstrated by the applicant that such modification of specifications and
standards will not adversely affect the interests of the general public. In
addition, the PUD proposal shall illustrate how the streets, utilities,
services, public facilities and traffic circulation will function and serve the
entire development. All proposals shall meet the applicable development
standards in §§
150.055 through
150.065 unless otherwise justified by engineering analysis.
         (i)   Off-street parking. The PUD and the land use therein shall
provide the necessary amount of off-street parking areas and shall illustrate
how such areas will adequately serve the entire development.
         (j)   Access. Adequate vehicular and pedestrian access must be
provided. A traffic impact analysis will be required to project auto and truck
traffic generated by the uses proposed. Improvements to adjacent streets may be
required, such as acceleration and/or deceleration lanes, widening of
intersections, signs and prorata costs of traffic signals. The capacity of
adjacent streets to accept the projected increase in traffic must be stated as
part of the traffic impact analysis.
         (k)   Towers and antennas.
            1.   Commercial freestanding or guyed towers. A tower is commercial
in nature unless its use is exclusively incidental to another primary legal use
existing on the property. A bond to ensure the removal of the tower upon
abandonment of use shall be required for all commercial towers. Any public
hearing required under this section shall be in conformity with §
150.025.
               a.   Application procedures. A site plan, and structural design
plans prepared by a licensed engineer, shall be submitted for any proposed
commercial tower or antenna structure. Any commercial tower and antenna with a
combined height of 300 feet or more shall require a public hearing to determine
whether the proposed height is appropriate for the proposed location.
               b.   Location. Commercial towers up to a height of 300 feet
shall be allowed by right on a parcel zoned or approved for industrial use (not
to include a legal non-conforming use), and in areas where all properties
within the applicable area of notice contain or are zoned or approved for
commercial and industrial uses, are vacant or contain only agricultural uses
unless residential zoning has been applied to one or more properties (such as
through Community District or Village District zoning). Commercial towers shall
not be allowed where all existing zoning or uses within the area of notice,
including the property at issue, are residential. Properties included within a
residential subdivision for which a completed application package is pending,
or for which a final plat has been approved within two years prior to the
application for a commercial tower or antenna use, shall be considered existing
residential uses. If the area of notice is an area of mixed residential and
non-residential uses, a public hearing shall be held to determine whether the
proposed location is appropriate for the height proposed for the tower and
antenna structure.
               c.   Setbacks and buffering. Towers and antennas shall be
considered a high-intensity non-residential use for determining the appropriate
setback and buffering requirements (see § 150.083); however, a tower or antenna
next to another high-intensity non-residential use shall only be required to
meet minimum setbacks and to provide secured opaque fencing of at least eight
feet in height around the base of the tower, including any guy wires. Where a
public hearing is required to determine whether the proposed tower is
appropriate for the proposed location, setbacks and buffering may be increased
to further diminish the negative impacts of the structure on the surrounding
area.
               d.   Co-location. Co-location of multiple antennas on a single
tower structure shall be encouraged, consistent with the following guidelines.
A plan to add an additional antenna to a previously approved tower shall be
prepared by a licensed engineer. An additional antenna shall not increase the
width of the tower beyond the approved design for a monopole structure, or
beyond the base width of the original tower structure, and shall not increase
the overall tower height of a site located in a mixed use area more than 20
feet.
            2.   Commercial antennas mounted to existing structures. Commercial
antennas may be mounted on or attached to any existing non-residential
structure. A copy of the written document granting permission from the owner of
the structure must be submitted with the site plan for review before a building
permit may be issued. Any additional superstructure that will be added to
accommodate any and all antenna arrays must meet Uniform Building Code
requirements.
            3.   Personal (private) freestanding or guyed towers. One personal
tower with antennas (to be used exclusively for purposes incidental to an
existing legal use of the property) shall be allowed by right on each parcel if
the following conditions are met.
               a.   Height. For use on a residential structure for residential
purposes, the total height shall be limited to 75 feet from the ground; and for
use on a non-residential structure for non-residential purposes, the total
height shall be limited to 90 feet from the ground.
               b.   Design. The Zoning Administrator, prior to new construction
or modification of a tower or antenna structure, must approve an informal site
plan. All engineering data for the tower shall be submitted if requested. All
structures shall be constructed to meet the Uniform Building Code, and shall be
designed and constructed to withstand a minimum of 80 mph wind loads.
               c.   Setbacks. The structure shall meet the applicable setbacks
from the property lines, or a minimum setback of ten feet, whichever is
greater, and shall be located behind the front line of the foremost dwelling
unit located on the parcel.
            4.   Private antennas mounted to existing structures. Private
antennas may be mounted to existing buildings which meet the Uniform Building
Code standards; provided that the total height of any tower and antenna
structure does not exceed 75 feet from ground level for residential use, and 90
feet from ground level for non-residential use, and the tower and antenna
structure meets all applicable setbacks from the property line.
         (l)   Other information. Any other information that the Community
Development Department deems necessary to properly assess the request for the
PUD district.
      (3)   Requirements prior to construction.
         (a)   A detailed site development plan shall be submitted either
concurrently with the requirements necessary when applying for a PUD district,
as set forth hereinabove, or separately or in phases, prior to the actual
construction of the development. The detailed site development plan submittal
shall meet and follow the same procedures, requirements and standards as that
of a zone change request.
         (b)   The required development plan shall be substantially the same as
that submitted for the initial PUD classification request. In addition to the
information previously submitted, the development plan shall include specific
details, such as, but not limited to, type and placement of buildings and
structures, internal building setbacks and separation of structure distances;
building and structure heights; location, number and operation of off-street
parking spaces; street construction, performance and maintenance standards and
operations; traffic circulation patterns; pavement and right-of-way widths;
utility and facility types, location and service; easement types, location and
service; size and location of open space areas; dwelling unit densities; and
any other information that the Community Development Department deems necessary
to properly assess the request.
      (4)   Decisions and conditions.
         (a)   Approval. The PUD zone request shall be approved after a public
hearing has been held where additional conditions may be imposed to ensure the
public interest; and where the site development plan, submitted in accordance
with the procedures, requirements and standards set forth herein, has been
presented to prescribe the general and/or specific uses, placement of buildings
and structures, amount and locations and performances, off-street parking areas
and other previously described items essential to the development’s operation
and performance.
         (b)   Building permit. A building permit shall be issued only if the
building or structure for which the permit is to be issued is in conformance
with the approved development plan and only if all site and facility
improvements are in place adjacent to and in front of the location of the
building or structure.
         (c)   Term. An approved detailed site development plan shall remain in
effect for three years. If no construction has taken place within the area of
the site plan within three years, the owner/applicant shall resubmit the site
plan, or a revised site plan for public hearings by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, for review and approval.
      (5)   Major and minor revisions to PUD site plans.
         (a)   Minor revisions.
            1.   A minor revision to a site plan includes rearrangement of
buildings, walks or parking and landscaped areas that do not affect the access
points, internal or external traffic circulation; does not increase the number
of parking spaces required; does not increase the number or size of buildings;
does not affect the drainage and grading plans. The Zoning Administrator may
approve a minor revision of a site plan after review by the Building Inspection
and Engineering Departments.
            2.   The approved revision to a site plan shall be filed with the
original site plan case file, and copies shall be provided to Building
Inspection, Engineering and other appropriate state agencies.
         (b)   Major revisions.
            1.   A major revision is any change in land use or building use
from the approved site plan and/or zone change request; any increase in the
number of buildings or number of parking spaces required; any change in access
points; internal or external circulation; any increase in the amount of storm
water drainage retention required; any change in grading that would affect
drainage capacity or adjacent properties.
            2.   The Zoning Administrator shall submit copies of the major
revision to all affected agencies and to the Planning and Zoning Commission for
review and approval. Public notice and public hearing procedures required for
zone change shall apply to hearings for major revisions to a site plan. The
approved revised site plan shall be placed in the PUD/site plan case file, and
copies shall be distributed to all affected agencies.

§ 150.157 SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA.
   (A)   The flood insurance rate map (FIRM) identifies areas of special flood
hazard areas (SFHA). Development may take place within the SFHA; provided the
requirements of the County Flood Damage Prevention Ord. 161-95 is followed. For
development occurring in an area outside of an identified SFHA, but experiences
similar flooding hazards, it is highly recommended that the same development
criteria of Ord. 161-95 be followed. Additional information regarding flooding
may be found on FEMA’s website, www.fema.gov.

flood elevation. A state-registered professional engineer or land surveyor
shall submit an elevation certificate of flood proofing certificate, or both,
to the County Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   Manufactured homes. Manufactured homes shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at
or above the base flood elevation and is securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
The manufactured home chassis shall be supported by reinforced piers or other
foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are not less than 36
inches in height above grade and are securely fastened to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement.
      (4)   Recreational vehicles. Recreational vehicles shall be located on a
site for fewer than 180 consecutive days, are fully licensed and ready for
highway use or meet elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured

enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and are
subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls by allowing entry and exit of floodwaters.
         (b)   Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by
a state- registered professional engineer or land surveyor to meet or exceed
the following minimum criteria:
            1.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall
be provided;
            2.   The bottom of all openings shall be not higher than one foot

§ 150.172 ACCESS TO PUBLIC WAY AND PRIVATE ROADWAY EASEMENTS.
   (A)   No new development or construction that requires a permit under the
International Building Code, as adopted by ordinance, shall be allowed on any
lot unless it has legal access. All development shall include a minimum of 50%
of the necessary additional right-of-way to conform to the required width, as
defined in this chapter, if property is adjacent to the road right-of-way or
road easement.
   (B)   All development shall include a minimum of 50% of the necessary
additional right-of-way to conform to the required width, as defined in this
chapter, if property is adjacent to the road right-of- way or road easement.
   (C)   Development connecting to or adjacent to a county arterial or
collector shall provide adequate acceleration/deceleration lanes using standard
engineering design practices based on the American Association of State Highway
and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) regulation “A Policy on Geometric Design
of Highways and Streets” or other appropriate/approved methods. The Zoning
Administrator and Compliance Coordinator shall determine what an adequate
design for acceleration/deceleration access lanes shall be, or other
improvements, based on appropriate engineering standards.
   (D)   Other than construction of a single-family dwelling on an existing
lot, all development, including the creation of a lot through the claim of
exemption process, shall require that roads linking the development to a
county- or state-maintained road shall be a minimum of 50 feet of right-of-way
or road and utility easement with a minimum width of 24 feet of improved
roadway unless a lesser width is approved by the Zoning Administrator. Based on
an analysis by a professional engineer, the Zoning Administrator may reduce the
required width to not less than 30 feet of right-of-way or road and utility
easement and 20 feet of improved roadway if it is determined the lesser
standard is sufficient for the potential traffic based on the potential number
of lots served by the right-of-way and allowed uses under current zoning.
Composition of the road surface shall be by design to withstand the proposed
loading. Width and design may vary depending upon the use. Drainage swales and
drainage structures shall be part of the road design.
   (E)   Driveways shall be spaced a minimum of 150 feet from an intersection
or a driveway used for off-street parking. For lots where this is not possible,
driveways shall be spaced as far from the intersection as practical. Conflicts
with adjoining driveways, exits and entrances will be spaced to create the
safest possible conditions for traffic movement and shall be justified by
engineering analysis. Driveways linking residential development to a county- or
state-maintained road or private easement shall meet the following standards:
the drivable width shall be 25 feet wide for two-way traffic and 20 feet for
one-way traffic, the maximum length shall not exceed 150 feet and shall serve
not more that driveway and/or four dwelling units unless the site plan is
approved by the County Fire Marshal.
   (F)   Private roadway easements shall be maintained by adjacent property
owners. New private roadway easements shall include a statement that adjacent
property owners area responsible for maintenance. Such road maintenance
agreements must be filed when a building permit or mobile home permit is
issued.
   (G)   Existing substandard road easements in designated “colonias” are
subject to the requirements for maintenance as outlined in division (F) above.
   (H)   All development shall provide for a clear sight triangle at all
intersections with or between all public and private roads; and off-street
multiple parking area entrances, exits; driveways to and from public and
private roads; and at any unique geometrical situation involving horizontal,
vertical and skewed intersections or driveways (see example in Appendix E,
attached to the ordinance incorporated herein). The County Transportation
Department may rely upon the American Association of State Highway and
Transportation Officials (AASHTO) publication “Policy on Geometric Design of
Highways and Streets”, dated 1990 (and amendments thereto), in determining the
appropriate design requirements for the particular intersection at issue.
      (1)   A clear sight triangle (as shown in Appendix E, attached to the
ordinance incorporated herein) shall be an area of unobstructed vision,
beginning at a point three feet above the finished grade of the road at the
lowest adjacent point on the edge of the pavement, and bounded by one of the
following:

connecting points 30 feet from the intersections of the property or roadway
easement lines of the lot;
         (b)   The front and side lines of a private driveway, exit or entrance
and a line connecting points 15 feet from the intersection of the corner of the
lines of the private driveway, exit or entrance; or
         (c)   The front and side lines of a public or off-street multiple
parking area driveway, exit or entrance and a line connecting points 30 feet
from the intersection of the corners of the lines of the public or off-street
multiple parking are driveway, exit or entrance.
      (2)   Within the clear sight triangle, no structure, including, but not
limited to, signs or walls, shall be constructed or erected higher than three
feet from the edge of the pavement, except that barbed wire or other fences
that do not obstruct the view of the roadway shall be allowed. No trees, shrubs
or other vegetation that would normally grow to a height of three feet from the
edge of the pavement shall be planted within the clear sight triangle.

within 45 days or the sign shall be removed. If structural elements of the sign
structure separate, or collapse, or fall into severe disrepair, the sign shall
be replaced within 45 days or the sign shall be removed. This section shall not
be considered an alteration of the prohibition on the replacement of a non-
conforming sign.

danger of falling, or it is damaged, destroyed, taken down or removed for any
purpose other than copy change, the sign must be removed or repaired and made
to comply with all standards in the Sign Code.
      (6)   Non-conforming signs.
         (a)   A non-conforming sign may not be altered, changed in shape or

an object, person, institution, business, product, service, event or location
that is no longer in existence or no longer relevant; also, no such sign shall
be left bearing a message that is illegible in whole or part. Such conditions
must be remedied within 90 days of notice to the sign owner by the city. If
such condition is not remedied within 90 days of such notice to the owner by
the city, the sign shall be considered abandoned and it shall be removed by the
sign owner, property owner or city. Reusing a sign declared abandoned according
to this section is illegal.
         (e)   If any sign is installed, displayed or maintained in violation
of the Sign Code, or the applicable code it was erected under, or if a sign is
in need of repair, alteration or removal, a notice will be sent to the sign
owner, lessee or property owner. If such notice is not acted on within seven
days, the city may initiate proceedings to revoke the sign permit (if any was

satellite lot is to be used for off-street parking, the applicant for a
building permit shall submit with his or her application an instrument duly
executed and acknowledged that subjects the satellite lot to parking in
connection with the principal building or use. If a building permit is
authorized, the Building Inspector shall cause the same instrument to be
recorded in the office of the County Clerk. The recording fee shall be paid by
the applicant.

§ 150.183 FLEXIBILITY IN ADMINISTRATION REQUIRED.
   (A)   (1)   In view of the unique need of any given development, the
inflexible application of the parking standards set forth in §§
150.181 et seq. may result in a development either with inadequate parking
space or parking space far in excess of its needs.
      (2)   Therefore, the Zoning Administrator may permit deviations from the
requirements of §§
150.181 et seq. or may require more parking or allow less parking whenever it
finds that such deviations are more likely to satisfy the standards set forth
in this section.
   (B)   The Zoning Administrator may allow deviations from the parking
requirements set forth in §§
150.181 et seq. when the Administrator finds that:
      (1)   A residential development is primarily oriented toward the elderly;
and
      (2)   A business is primarily oriented to walk-in trade.
   (C)   Whenever the Zoning Administrator allows or requires a deviation from
the parking requirements set forth in §§
150.181 et seq., the Administrator shall enter on the face of the permit the
parking requirement that it imposes and the reasons for allowing or requiring
the deviation.

without backing onto a public street. This requirement does not apply to
parking areas consisting of driveways that serve one or two dwelling units.
   (B)   The parking area of all developments shall be designed so that
sanitation, emergency and other public service vehicles can serve such
developments without the necessity of backing unreasonable distances or making
other dangerous or hazardous turning movements.
   (C)   Every parking area shall be designed so that vehicles cannot extend
beyond the perimeter of such area onto adjacent properties of public rights-of-
way. Such area shall also be designed so that vehicles do not extend over
sidewalks or tend to bump against or damage any wall, vegetation or other
structure.

§ 150.188 JOINT USE OF REQUIRED PARKING SPACES.
   (A)   One parking area may contain required spaces for several different
uses; except as otherwise provided in this section, the required spaces
assigned to one use may not be credited to any other use.
   (B)   To the extent that developments agreeing to make joint use of the same
parking spaces operate at different times, the same spaces may be credited to
both uses. For example, if a parking lot is used in connection with an office
building on Monday through Friday, but is generally 90% vacant on weekends,
another development that operates only on weekends could be credited with 90%
of the spaces on that lot. If a church parking lot is generally occupied to
only 50% capacity on days other than Sunday, another development could make use
of 50% of the church lot’s spaces on those other days.
   (C)   If the joint use of the same parking spaces by two or more principal
uses involves satellite parking spaces, then the provisions of §
150.179 are also applicable.
   (D)   A written agreement between the affected property owners is required
for all joint uses of parking areas, thereby assuring retention for such
purposes and stating hours of operation. The agreement is to be approved as to
content and form by the City Attorney and Planning Director and filed with the
building permit application, if one is to be issued.

and thereafter comply with the parking requirements set forth herein. Whenever
a building is enlarged in floor area less than 30% of the original floor area,
additional spaces shall be provided on the basis of only the enlargement.
   (B)   Whenever there is a change of use of the lot or the building that
increases parking requirements, the parking standards in this chapter must be
met.

§ 150.191 FIRE LANE REQUIREMENTS.
   (A)   Authority to design; maintenance responsibility. The Fire Marshal, or
his or her designee, is authorized to designate fire lanes on the property of
shopping centers and other private or public property, as defined in this
section, where such areas must be kept free of parked vehicles and other
obstructions to provide ready access in such areas in case of fire or other
emergency. The designation by the Fire Marshal of such fire lanes shall never
be held to make the city responsible for the maintenance of such fire lanes on
private property, but the owner of such property shall continue to be
responsible for the maintenance of such area. The official records of the
designation and location of any such fire lanes shall be kept in the office of
the Fire Marshal.
   (B)   Construction on private property; shopping center construction. Before
site plans of proposed shopping center construction or construction on private
property, as defined in this chapter, are submitted to the Building Inspection
Department for issuance of building permits, such plans shall be submitted to
the Fire Marshal for his or her review and approval of the adequacy of the fire
lanes provided therefor. The specific requirements of this section as
applicable to a specific structure may be modified by the Fire Marshal in
recognition of varying occupancies, size and a hazard of buildings and the
provision of other means of access or fixed fire protection.
   (C)   Submission of site plan to Fire Marshal. The Fire Marshal, or his or
her designee, may require the owners of existing shopping centers and existing
facilities on private property, as defined in this chapter, to submit site
plans for his or her use in determining whether to designate fire lanes on the
property. The Fire Marshal may require that the fire lane for existing
buildings be established to provide access for fire suppression operations by
improving existing conditions. Fire lanes established for new and existing
structures shall conform to fire lane requirements applicable at the time of
construction. If no fire lane requirements were applicable at the time of
construction, the Fire Marshal, or designee, may require establishment of fire
lanes to conform with the requirements of this section, insofar as is
practicable without requiring any construction, structural modification or
substantial financial hardship.
   (D)   Parking signs - posting required; parking in posted area prohibited;
exemption. Upon the designation of a fire lane pursuant to this section, the
Fire Marshal, or his or her designee, shall give notice of such designation to
the owner of such shopping center and other areas, as defined in this section,
directing the owner to cause signs to be posted, at the expense of the owner,
at designated locations, littered, “No Parking At Any Time - Fire Lane (Tow
Away Zone)”. Such signs shall be of a standard size and color, of standard
lettering and mounting, conforming to specifications established by the Traffic
Engineer and Fire Marshal, and their designees. It is unlawful to park any
vehicle other than authorized emergency vehicles in a designated fire lane when
such signs are in place.
   (E)   Unlawful to park; exemption. It is unlawful to park any vehicle other
than an authorized emergency vehicle in any fire lane established pursuant to
this section except as may be specifically permitted by the Fire Marshal, or
his or her designee (i.e., an armored vehicle may park in the fire lane for
brief periods of time during the performance of his or her duty after obtaining
a permit from the Fire Marshal’s office).
   (F)   Towing authorized. Unauthorized vehicles parked in designated fire
lanes that block Fire Department or other emergency vehicle’s access may be
towed at owner’s expense to a designated storage facility by the authority of
the Fire Marshal, or his or her designee City Police Department.
   (G)   No parking signs - removal declared unlawful. It is unlawful for any
person, without lawful authority, to attempt to remove any signs designating a
fire lane established pursuant to this section.
   (H)   Display of unauthorized signs unlawful; declaration of nuisance. It is
unlawful for any person to place, maintain or display any unauthorized sign
that purports to be or is an imitation of or resembles an official sign
designating a fire lane. Every such prohibited sign is declared to be a public
nuisance, and the Fire Marshal is empowered to remove the same or cause it to
be removed. Undesignated fire lanes in compliance with the fire lane
requirements shall meet the stipulations of other sections and of this section.
Failure to comply with proper fire lane establishment procedures shall, in
addition to this section, be prosecuted according to the limitations of this
chapter.
   (I)   Fire lane standards. Fire lanes designated by the City Police

greater than 100 feet.
            3.   The fire lane sign shall be securely fastened to a suitable

PROCEDURE
§ 151.020 PRE-APPLICATION PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Prior to the filing of an application for approval of a preliminary
plat, the subdivider is requested to confer with the planning staff and other
city departments so as to become acquainted with these regulations.
   (B)   The pre-application conference with the planning staff does not
require a formal application, fee or the filing of a plat and is considered an
advisable step in the procedure rather than mandatory. The planning staff does
not assume any responsibility for a lack of understanding of these regulations
on the part of the subdivider, and any advice or opinion as to the feasibility
of the proposed subdivision expressed by the planning staff shall not bind any
subsequent actions of the Planning and Zoning Commission or the Board of
Trustees relative to the proposal.
   (C)   The subdivider shall then submit to the Planning and Zoning Commission
a preliminary plan and supporting data. This step does not require formal
application or filing of a plat with the Planning and Zoning Commission.
   (D)   Within 35 business days, the Planning and Zoning Commission shall
inform the subdivider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or
do not meet the objectives of these regulations, and it shall express its
reasons therefor.
(Ord. 2013-02, passed 3-19-2013)
§ 151.021 PRELIMINARY PLAT PROCEDURE.
   (A)   Application for subdivision approval shall be submitted to the
planning staff on prescribed forms. Application forms are available at City
Hall.
   (B)    All completed applications and plats shall be submitted not later
than 15 business days prior to the day of the regular meeting of the Planning
and Zoning Commission at which time it is to be considered. All applicants
should submit plats as early as possible to ensure that required review can be
accomplished. At this time, all preliminary plat review fees shall have been
paid in full prior to placing the application on the Planning and Zoning
Commission agenda.
   (C)   Eight copies of the preliminary plat and supplemental material will be
submitted by the subdivider with the written application. The planning staff
shall review the preliminary plat and supplemental material.
   (D)   The application and preliminary plat of the subdivision shall be
placed on the Planning and Zoning Commission agenda. The subdivider, or his or
her representative, shall be notified by mail to the address on the plat of the
time, place and date of the public hearing not less than five business days
before the day of the hearing.
   (E)   The subdivider shall notify, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, all owners of property located in whole or in part within 300 feet,
exclusive of streets, of the parcel to be subdivided, notifying said property
owners of the time, place and date of the public hearing at which the
preliminary plat is to be considered and describing the proposed subdivision.
The subdivider shall further provide the Planning and Zoning Commission with
return receipts as evidence of the subdivider’s efforts to notify said property
owners. Where a proposed subdivision faces an existing public street, the
measurement of 300 feet shall be made from points on either side of the street,
excluding the street from the 300 foot measurement.
   (F)   The subdivider shall be responsible for providing preliminary plats
and other information determined to be necessary for the purpose of describing
the subdivision. Signs will be posted on the property with subdivision
application forms, plats and supporting data by planning staff. Signs will be
posted at intervals of 150 feet across the front lot line of the tract proposed
to be subdivided.
   (G)   It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider, or his or her
representative, to make the presentation before the Planning and Zoning
Commission. Action taken by the Planning and Zoning Commission shall be
recorded in the minutes of the public hearing. A copy of said minutes shall be
furnished to the subdivider. Approval of a preliminary plat shall not
constitute approval of the final plat. Preliminary approval shall confer upon
the subdivider the rights and guarantee, during the two-year period from the
date of approval, that the general terms and conditions under which the
preliminary approval was granted will not be affected by any changes and/or
amendments to these regulations. Approval of a preliminary plat shall be
effective for two years. The Planning and Zoning Commission may approve a plat
as submitted or it may require certain conditions for approval. When these
conditions are met and confirmed by the Planning and Zoning Commission, it
shall be considered approved as a preliminary plat.
   (H)   If the preliminary plat is denied by the Planning and Zoning
Commission, the subdivider, or his or her representative, has the right to
appeal the decision. The appeal shall be submitted in writing to the City
Clerk, and it shall then be placed on the agenda of the Board of Trustees for
its consideration.

(Ord. 2013-02, passed 3-19-2013) Penalty, see §
151.999
§ 151.083 STREET AND ALLEY STANDARDS.
   (A)   When rights-of-way for public streets and alleys are needed, they
shall be provided in accordance with the standards and requirements described
as follows:
      (1)   Major thoroughfare: 120 feet;
      (2)   Secondary thoroughfare: 80 feet;

continuation of an existing street, the proposed street shall have the name of
the existing street. The use of the suffix “street”, “avenue”, “boulevard”,
“drive”, “lane”, “place” or “court” shall not be a distinction sufficient to
avoid confusion; therefore, duplicates with different suffixes shall not be

   (B)   The subdivider shall be required to prove that materials supplied and
items constructed meet these regulations. Certifications and test results shall
verify such factors, including, but not limited to, asphalt grades, aggregate
gradations, mix design, application rates and compaction percentages.
   (C)   The city has the right to require materials that will enhance
economics and facilitate operations associated with long-term maintenance
efforts. Materials that meet state and the above- referenced standards without
having city approval for utilization within a particular street section might
not be acceptable per se.
   (D)   In new subdivisions, the city will require maximum safety and
efficiency of traffic flow by minimizing the number of automobile access points
along arterials or collectors. Lots with private drives fronting on arterials
or collectors are discouraged. In no case shall an access road in a newly
platted subdivision be permitted which is closer than 300 feet from the
intersection of two arterial streets, an arterial and a collector street or two
collector streets.
   (E)   (1)   Accompanying the preliminary plat, a road construction plan
shall be submitted. It will be of similar size and format to the preliminary

utilities to be located within the rights-of-ways;
         (h)   Obstruction-clearing widths;
         (i)   Existing and proposed contours;
         (j)   Adequate curve data to allow construction as intended;
         (k)   Survey markers and ties; and
         (l)   Professional engineer stamp will be required on road plans.
      (3)   The review of the preliminary plat shall include a review of the
road construction plan and related information.
   (F)   Preliminary acceptance is an initial approval of the roads by the
city. It shall follow an official inspection and written report of findings by
the City Engineer. Accompanying the subdivider’s written request for such an
inspection shall be an updated version of the road construction plan. It shall
contain a statement from the subdivider’s engineer that the information
contained thereon is as constructed. Such inspection and report shall verify
and certify that the dedicated roads have been constructed according to and
meet design standards of these regulations.
   (G)   The subdivider shall maintain the accepted roads in good repair for a
test wear period of 24 months from the date the roads pass preliminary
acceptance. During such time, the city shall advise the subdivider to take
those actions necessary to keep the roads in the same general condition that
they were in for the preliminary inspection. If, in the opinion of the city,
the subdivider does not adequately maintain the roads or if unusual or
excessive reconstruction or maintenance obligations seem evident, the city
reserves the right to extend the test wear period.

   (G)   A storm drainage system adequate to serve the needs of the proposed
new streets and the entire subdivision will be required in new subdivisions.
Where an adequate public storm sewer main is available at the platted
subdivision boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm drainage system
and connect with such storm sewer main of adequate size. Drainage improvements
shall maintain any natural watercourse insofar as practical and shall prevent
the collection of water in any low spot unless it is to be specified as a
ponding area in the drainage plan. At a minimum, developers shall design and
construct a drainage pond for the proposed subdivision to handle the water flow
of the land being developed.
   (H)   The developer shall be required to install underground utilities in
all new developments. New installations of overhead utility poles and lines
will not be permitted. The use of existing overhead utility poles is permitted
at the sole discretion of the Board of Trustees.
   (I)   Subdivisions shall base all required utility lines on the maximum
population density allowed by the zoning district in which the subdivision is
located.
   (J)   The subdivider shall be responsible for all the costs associated with
the extending of utilities, roadways or other necessary infrastructure from
existing improved development to the site proposed for development according to
the city’s capital improvement plan and master plan.
