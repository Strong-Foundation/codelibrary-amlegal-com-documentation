a trustee for the city with respect to the funds.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The vendor shall file reports and make payments of the occupancy tax
proceeds to the Clerk monthly on forms provided by the Clerk. The report and
payment shall be due not later than the 25th day of the month following the end

a "zero" report must be filed.

the vendor for three years. These records and other relevant information will

account properly for any lodging and the tax proceeds pertaining thereto will
be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine of up to $500 and up to 90
days imprisonment or both.

applicable lodgers taxes and remitting the same to the city. The marketplace
provider shall be considered an agent of the vendor for the purposes of
lodgersâ€™ tax collections and remittance responsibilities as set forth in this
section.

residential or commercial users. If the Manager finds that the charges are
fair, no change in rates shall be made.

against him or her and with the leave of the chief elected official, which
shall be granted whenever it would be reasonable and fair to do so, may amend
his or her answer at any time. Both complaints and answers shall be verified.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â If within 30 days after a complaint is filed with the chief elected

thereafter, file a complaint with the Secretary of the Department of Housing
and Urban Development. The chief elected official will assist in this filing.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â If the chief elected official has been unable to obtain voluntary
compliance within 30 days of the complaint, the aggrieved person may, within 30
days thereafter commence a civil action in any appropriate court, against the
respondent named in the complaint, to enforce the rights granted or protected
by this chapter, insofar as the rights relate to the subject of the complaint.

about to occur, the court may enjoin the respondent from engaging in the
practice or order the affirmative action as may be appropriate.

Â§ 93.11 INVESTIGATIONS, SUBPOENAS, AND GIVING OF EVIDENCE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â In conducting an investigation, the chief elected official shall have
access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals and
other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record and copy
the materials and take and record the testimony or statements of the persons as
are reasonably necessary for the furtherance or the investigation: provided,
however, that the chief elected official first complies with the provisions of
the Fourth Amendment relating to unreasonable searches and seizures. The chief
elected official may issue subpoenas to compel his or her access to, or the
production of, the materials, or the appearance of the persons and may issue
interrogatories to a respondent, to the same extent and subject to the same
limitations as would apply if the subpoenas or interrogatories were issued or
served in aid of a civil action in the United States District Court for the
district in which the investigation is taking place. The chief elected official
may administer oaths.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Upon written application to the chief elected official, a respondent
shall be entitled to the issuance of a reasonable number of subpoenas by and in
the name of the chief elected official to the same extent and subject to the
same limitations as subpoenas issued by the chief elected official. Subpoenas
issued at the request of a respondent shall show on their face the name and
address of the respondent and shall state that they were issued at his or her
request.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Witnesses summoned by subpoena of the chief elected official shall be
entitled to the same witness and mileage fees as are witnesses in proceedings
in United States District Courts. Fees payable to a witness summoned by a
subpoena issued at the request of a respondent shall be paid by the respondent.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Within 5 days after service of a subpoena upon any person, the person
may petition the chief elected official to revoke or modify the subpoena. The
chief elected official shall grant the petition if he or she finds that the
subpoena requires appearance or attendance at an unreasonable time or place,
that it requires production of evidence which does not relate to any matter
under investigation, that it does not describe with sufficient particularity
the evidence to be produced, that compliance would be unduly onerous, or for
other good reason.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena the chief elected
official, or other person at whose request it was issued, may petition for its
enforcement in the municipal or state court for the district in which the
person to whom the subpoena was addressed resides, was served or transacts
business.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Any person who willfully fails or neglects to attend and testify, or
to answer any lawful inquiry, or to produce records, documents or other
evidence, if in his or her power to do so, in obedience to the subpoena or
lawful order of the chief elected official shall be fined not more than $1,000
or imprisoned not more than 1 year or both. Any person who, with intent thereby
to mislead the chief elected official, shall make or cause to be made any false
entry or statement of fact in any report, account, record or other document
submitted to the chief elected official pursuant to his or her subpoena or
other order, or shall willfully neglect or fail to make or cause to be made
full, true and correct entries in the reports, accounts, records or other
documents, or shall willfully mutilate, alter or by any other means falsify any
documentary evidence, shall be fined not more than $1,000 or imprisoned not
more than 1 year, or both.

which the chief elected official participates as a party or as amicus pursuant
to this chapter.

93.06 may be enforced by civil actions in the appropriate United States
district, state or local court. A civil action shall be commenced within 180
days after the alleged discriminatory housing practice occurred: provided,
however, that the court shall continue the civil case brought pursuant to this
section or Â§
93.10(D) from time to time before bringing it to trial if the court believes
that the conciliation efforts of the chief elected official are likely to
result in satisfactory settlement of the alleged discriminatory housing
practice complained of in the complaint made to the chief elected official and
which practice forms the basis for the action in court; and provided, however,
that any sale, encumbrance or rental consummated prior to the issuance of any
court order issued under the authority of this chapter and involving a bona
fide purchaser, encumbrancer or tenant without actual notice of the filing or a
complaint or civil action under the provisions of this chapter shall not be
affected.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The court may grant as relief, as it deems appropriate, any permanent
or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order or other order and may
award to the plaintiff actual damages and not more than $1,000 punitive
damages, together with court costs and reasonable attorney fees in the case of

Â Â Â Â Â Â DISTRIBUTE. The actual construction or attempted transfer, delivery, or
dispensing to another of an imitation controlled substance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â IMITATION CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE. A substance that is not a controlled
substance which by overall dosage unit, appearance, including color, shape,
size, and markings, or by representations made would lead a person to believe
that the substance is a controlled substance. In those rare cases where the
appearance of the dosage unit is not reasonably sufficient to establish that
the substance is an imitation controlled substance for example, in the case of
powder or liquid, the court or authority concerned should consider, in addition
to all other logically relevant factors, the following factors as related to
representations made in determining whether the substance is an imitation
controlled substance:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Statements made by an owner or anyone else in control of the
substance concerning the nature of the substance or its use or effect;

resold for consideration greatly in excess of the market value of the

control of the substance to avoid detection by law enforcement authorities;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Prior convictions, if any, of the owner, or anyone in control of
the object, under state or federal law related to controlled substances or
fraud, provided that this factor alone shall not be sufficient to support a
conviction under the ordinance; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Whether the physical appearance of the substance is
substantially identical to a controlled substance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â MANUFACTURE. The production, preparation, compounding, processing,
encapsulating, tableting, packaging or repackaging, or labeling or relabeling
of an imitation controlled substance.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Manufacture and/or distribution of imitation controlled substance.  It
is unlawful for any person to knowingly, or under circumstances where a person
should know, manufacture, distribute, or possess with intent to distribute an
imitation controlled substance.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Defenses. In any prosecution for unlawful distribution or possession
with intent to distribute an imitation controlled substance, it is no defense
that the defendant believed the imitation controlled substance to be a
controlled substance.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Immunity. No criminal liability shall be imposed by this article on
any person who may lawfully manufacture or distribute controlled substances
under NMSA Â§ 30-31-12, who manufactures , distributes, or possesses with intent
to distribute an imitation controlled substance for use as a placebo by a
registered practitioner in the course of professional practice or research.

fee but in no event shall the company be required to implement the access line
fee on a date other than the first calendar date of any month. Interest will

fees on those access lines. Upon written request, the company will make the
signed statements from telecommunication service providers available for the

Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Planning Commission review. The Planning Commission shall conduct its
consideration of the preliminary plat as a quasi-judicial hearing. The
subdivider or his or her duly authorized representative shall attend the
meeting. In the event of the absence of the subdivider or his or her duly
authorized representative, the Planning Commission may postpone consideration
of the matter, and the subdivider shall be deemed to have consented to the
delay and to have waived the time requirements of NMSA 1978, Â§ 3-20-7. All
interested or affected parties shall be allowed to present testimony at the
hearing. The planning commission may approve, conditionally approve, disapprove
or postpone its decision in order to obtain additional information. If
postponed in order to permit the subdivider the opportunity to present
additional information, or if the subdivider otherwise agrees to postponement,
the subdivider shall be deemed to have consented and to have waived the time
requirements of NMSA 1978, Â§ 3-20-7. In accordance with the provisions of NMSA
1978, Â§ 3-20-7, the plat shall be deemed approved if not approved or

event of postponement as specified herein.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Appeal. The Clerk shall provide written notification of the Planning
Commission's action to the applicant and any other interested party who has
requested notification. The applicant and any other aggrieved person may appeal
the decision to the City Council according to the appellate provisions of Â§
155.007 of this title. Upon approval by the Planning Commission, or by the City
Council if appealed, the applicant may proceed as provided herein. Approval of
a final plat shall be effective for 18 months.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Filing final plat. The final plat shall not be filed until all
construction improvements have been completed, inspected and approved or
accepted by the city, or until a form of security as provided for herein has
been submitted and approved. It shall be the Clerk's responsibility to obtain
the necessary signatures of city officials after final plat approval and the
subdivider's responsibility to obtain signatures of non-municipal utility
companies. Upon obtaining all required signatures, receipt of the filing fee
from the subdivider, and completion and acceptance of all improvements or the
acceptance of adequate security in lieu thereof, the Clerk shall file the final
plat in the office of the County Clerk.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Development agreement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Upon approval of the final plat by the Planning Commission, the
subdivider shall enter into a development agreement with the city providing for

type of guaranty to be provided, and such other information as may be required
by the city that is necessary for completion of the improvements.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â Guaranty of improvements. The final plat shall not be filed until all
improvements have been completed and accepted or provision made for security in
lieu thereof. In lieu of completion of improvements, the subdivider may provide
any of the forms of security listed herein in such amount as to cover the
projected cost of all required improvements. The amount shall be based on the
projected costs, as identified or approved by the City Engineer, that the city
would incur at the time the improvements are scheduled for completion. The
following types of securities are acceptable in lieu of completion of
improvements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Surety bond;

Â§ 151.10 ENGINEERING AND DESIGN STANDARDS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Permanent markers. All subdivision boundary corners and the
intersections of street centerlines shall be marked with a permanent monument.
A permanent monument shall be deemed to be concrete with a minimum dimension of
4 inches in diameter, extending 3 feet below the surface of the ground, or
steel pipe firmly imbedded in concrete which extends at least 3 feet below the
surface of the ground. Either configuration shall have a brass cap permanently
attached at the surface. Should conditions prohibit the placing of monuments on
line, offset marking will be permitted, provided, however, the offset courses
and distances are shown on the plat. A permanent bench mark shall be accessibly
placed within the subdivision, the elevation of which shall be referred to the
U.S.C. and G.S. datum and accurately noted on the subdivision plat.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Street improvements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Conformity to Comprehensive Plan. The location and width of all
streets shall conform to the latest Comprehensive Plan and to the provisions
herein. Streets and alleys in any subdivision adjoining a municipality shall be
continuous with and correspond in direction and width to the streets and alleys
of the municipality.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Right-of-way. The minimum street right-of-way width shall be shown
on the Comprehensive Plan map, or, if not shown on the plan, shall be not less
than 50 feet wide. Subdivisions that adjoin existing or planned streets shall
dedicate the right-of-way as necessary to meet the minimum street width
requirements set forth in this section as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The entire additional right-of-way shall be provided where the
subdivision is on both sides of the street; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â When the subdivision is located on only 1 side of an existing or
planned street, as shown on the Comprehensive Plan, half of the required
additional right-of-way shall be provided which shall not be less than 30 feet.
In no case shall the resulting eventual right-of-way width be less than 50
feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Grades. Grades on a major thoroughfare shall not exceed 5%. Grades
on other streets shall not exceed 10%.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right
angles as is possible and no intersection shall be at an angle of less than 60
degrees. Four-way intersections shall be discouraged in residential areas.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Street jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125
feet shall not be allowed, whether between 2 proposed streets or between an
existing and a proposed street.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Cul-de-sacs. Residential streets that are dead end streets, also
called cul-de-sacs, shall be provided at the closed end with a turnaround
having an outside roadway diameter of at least 80 feet and a street right-of-
way diameter of 100 feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Naming of streets. A proposed street which is in alignment with and
joins an existing and named street shall bear the name of the existing street.
In no case shall the proposed name of a street duplicate the name of an
existing street within the area covered by this chapter. Use of a suffix such
as "street," "avenue," "boulevard," "drive," "place," "court," and the like
shall not be a distinction sufficient to constitute compliance with this
chapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Access. When a subdivision or portion thereof adjoins an arterial
road, no single-family residential lot shall have direct access thereto. The
lots shall be provided with frontage on a marginal access street. Lots with
double frontage shall be avoided except where necessary when single-family
residential development abuts arterial streets.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â Grading and paving. All streets shall be graded and the roadway
improved by paving subject to the approval of the City Engineer. Curbing,
gutter, and sidewalks shall be subject to approval of the City Engineer.
Layouts for local, collector and arterial streets shall be those shown in and
have as minimum dimensions those dimensions shown in Appendix A, Appendix B,
and Appendix C. Minimum paving for local streets shall have 4 inches subgrade,
4 inch aggregate base and 1-1/2 inch asphalt. No paving is to be installed
unless all utility lines have been placed and stubbed out under the areas to be
paved.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Alleys. Alleys 20-feet wide shall be provided to the rear or side of
all lots to be used for commercial or industrial uses. Alleys may be required
for apartment or multi-family subdivisions. Dead-end alleys shall not be
allowed.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Sidewalks. Sidewalks shall have a minimum width of 4 feet, shall be
ADA approved, shall be constructed as indicated in Appendices A, B, and C, and
subject to the approval of the City Engineer. Alternatively, a single, 6 foot
wide lane contiguous to and level with the paved roadway may be designated as a
walkway. This walkway will be constructed of the same material as the paved
roadway. Curbing is required when this alternative is chosen. Design is subject
to the approval of the City Engineer.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Easements for utilities. Except where alleys are provided for the
purpose, utility easements not less than 10 feet in width shall be provided
along rear or side lot lines where necessary for use in erecting, constructing
and maintaining poles, wires, conduits, storm sewers, sanitary sewers, gas
mains, water mains, electrical lines and other public utilities reasonably
required for an urban structure. Whenever practical, utilities shall be placed
underground. No building shall be erected on the easement. All final plats
should be accompanied with evidence that all utilities concur, and that
easements indicated on the plat are suitable for servicing the area.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Water lines. The subdivider shall make necessary arrangements to serve
each lot within the corporate limits from a water system that is approved by
the State Engineer and the State Environment Department to supply potable water
for domestic needs and for fire protection. Water lines shall be installed to
at least the back side of proposed sidewalks before any paving is installed.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Sanitary sewers. The subdivider of land within the city limits shall
connect with a sanitary sewer system, private or public, if one is available,
and provide adequate sewer lines accessible to each lot. Sewers to be
constructed to service lots shall be constructed under the supervision of and
subject to the approval of the City Engineer. All lines which lie under paving
shall be installed prior to paving.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Drainage. Adequate provision shall be made for drainage of storm water
including easements and for the installation of storm sewer conduit.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Drainage improvements shall maintain any natural water course and
shall prevent the collection of water in any low spot. No lot shall be platted
to obstruct natural water flow. Storm water drainage shall not combine with
sanitary sewer. Drainage channels must be designed and installed subject to the
approval of the City Engineer.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A grading, drainage and development plan may be submitted together
with the preliminary plat, and shall be submitted no later than such time as
may be specified in the development agreement. The plan shall be prepared at a
scale of 1 inch equals 100 feet or larger showing rights-of-way, easements,
walkways, parks, common areas, roadways, water lines and reservoirs, sewer
lines, manholes and treatment facilities, curbs and gutters, culverts, drains,
storm water detention and retention basins, swales, ditches and other drainage
devices, spot top of curb elevations, high and low street points, drainage
arrows, street plans, all drainage areas and acreage, all 100-year storm flows
(Q 100's) adjacent to and/or flowing onto the development and on-site at each
surface flow junction storm water pickup and take-off points designed to handle
100-year flow on the surface, and cross sections and high water elevations for
all 100-year flows. Spot elevations shall be given for all inverts, low points
and flowing entry and exit points.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The following standards shall be used in preparation of the
grading, drainage, and development plan: 100-year storm flows shall not exceed
200 CFS per half street when feasible; pipes into which surface water flows
will have a minimum diameter of 15 inches; and a capability for handling all
Q100's on the surface within the roadway. Exceptions and variations to these
standards must be recommended by a licensed engineer and approved by the City
Engineer or acting City Engineer.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Street signs. A four-way metal street sign shall be installed at each
street intersection at the expense of the developer. Letters on the signs must
be at least 4 inches high. Style, color and material must be approved in
advance by the city. Signs on state highways shall meet the standards of the
State Highway Commission.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â Recreational areas. Design consideration shall be given to the
allocation of areas suitably located and of adequate size for playgrounds and
parks for local or neighborhood use as well as public service areas.
Consideration shall be given to locations designed for school bus loading
purposes. Where proposed open space for recreation is shown on the
Comprehensive Plan and is located in whole or in part in the proposed
subdivision, a condition of final plat approval is that the subdivider shall
dedicate the land or a part thereof in the city without charge for recreational
purposes. The subdivider may propose and the Council negotiate payment of a fee
to be held in trust by the city for use in maintaining or improving
recreational facilities for the benefit of residents of the proposed
subdivision as an alternative to dedication of land.
Â Â Â (K)Â Â Â Construction plans and details. Construction plans and details must be
prepared by a registered professional engineer in the State of New Mexico and
shall provide for all improvements indicated on the grading, drainage and
development plan, and as otherwise provided for in the development agreement,
including right- of-way and easement cross sections showing construction and
placement of streets, walks, curbs, gutters, medians, ditches, utilities,
planting strips and property lines; details of fire hydrants, valves, manholes,
pipe junctions, pumps, catch basins and the like; street profiles showing
natural and finished grades, centerlines and both curbs, with a recommended
minimum vertical scale of 1 inch equals 50 feet; sanitary sewer line and
manhole profiles with natural and finished grades, showing area under drains,
if applicable, and the location of gravity outfall lines; storm drainage system
profiles showing natural and finished grade; erosion control and re-vegetation
details; and other details as necessary to adequately convey the design intent.

Â§ 151.11 ALTERNATE SUMMARY PROCEDURE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Summary procedure authorized. An applicant may apply for subdivision
approval by the alternate summary procedure for:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A subdivision of property that does not result in more than two
parcels of land; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â A re-subdivision, where the combination or recombination of
portions of previously platted lots will not increase the total number of lots.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Limitations on use.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The alternate summary procedure shall not be available for a
submittal of a series of two-lot subdivisions in a given tract or block.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Lots resulting from a subdivision by the alternate summary
procedure shall not thereafter be approved for additional subdivision by such
procedure.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Procedure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Standard for plans. An application for subdivision or re-
subdivision by alternate summary procedure shall contain a plat or survey
prepared by a licensed New Mexico surveyor that is in substantial conformity
with the requirements of this chapter. The planning official shall review the
plat to determine whether all requirements of this code applicable to
individual lots have been met, and whether the proposed subdivision alters the
granting or reservation of easements, dedications and other conditions of the
original plat.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Format. The form and number of copies of the plat and related
materials shall be as determined by the planning official for adequate review
and filing. The plat shall identify the name of the subdivision, and shall
identify the resulting properties by lot and block number, using the larger lot
number together with a letter designation. Example: Lot 21 and 22 after
combination would be identified as Lot 22A.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Review and approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The completed application shall be presented to the Chair of the
Planning and Zoning Commission or a member of the Commission designated by the
Chair, and by the City Manager or a staff member designated by the Manager, who
may act to approve or deny the application, or may refer it to the full
Commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A summary plat application that requests a variance or waiver
from the requirements of this chapter shall be referred to the Planning and
Zoning Commission.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A denial of a summary plat application by the persons designated
herein may be appealed as provided herein.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Resubdivision by description. The resubdivision of already platted
tracts that are less than one acre and which are contiguous with each other,
for the purpose of increasing or reducing the size of the contiguous tracts,
but not less than the minimum standard size required by the city, shall not
require a plat of the resubdivision, provided that a certificate of survey
setting forth the legal description of tracts resulting from the resubdivision
shall be filed with the Commission, the County Clerk and the County Assessor of
Sierra County and the filing shall be considered as a rededication of the
described lots in all respects. The certificate of survey shall be submitted
for approval and signature by the Chair of the Planning and Zoning Commission
or a member of the Commission designated by the Chair, and by the City Manager
or a staff member designated by the Manager.

Â§ 151.12 VARIANCE, MODIFICATION OR WAIVER.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Where in the case of a particular proposed subdivision it can be shown
that strict compliance with the requirements of the ordinance would result in
unnecessary hardship to the subdivider because of unusual topography or other
conditions, or that these requirements would result in inhibiting the
achievement of the objectives of this chapter, the Commission, subject to
Council approval as otherwise provided herein, may vary, modify, or waive the
requirements so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured; provided that the variance, modification, or waiver will not have the
effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this chapter or any utility
regulations or other requirements of the city or interfere with carrying out
the Comprehensive Plan.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Application and approval of variance requests shall be a part of the
preliminary plat approval process. Requests made subsequent to approval of the
preliminary plat shall require an amendment to the preliminary plat prior to
approval of the final plat.

Commission of the City of Elephant Butte.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â In approving the vacation or partial vacation of a plat, the City
Council of the City of Elephant Butte shall consider if the vacation or partial
vacation of a plat will adversely affect the interests or rights of persons in
contiguous territory or within the subdivision being vacated. In approving the
vacation or partial vacation of a plat, the Planning and Zoning Commission may
require that streets dedicated to the city in the original plat shall continue
to be dedicated to the municipality. The owners of lots on the vacated plat or
on the portion of the plat being vacated may enclose in equal portions the
adjoining streets and alleys which are authorized to be abandoned by the
Planning and Zoning Commission.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The statement declaring the vacation or partial vacation of a plat and
having the proper endorsements shall be filed in the office of the County Clerk
wherein the original plat is filed. The County Clerk shall mark the applicable
words â€œVacatedâ€ or â€œPartially Vacatedâ€ across the plat and shall refer on the
plat to the volume and page on which the statement of vacation or partial
vacation is recorded.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â The rights of any utility already existing shall not be affected by
any vacation or partial vacation of a plat.

manner that increases the nonconformity with this chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â The nonconforming sign was intended to be temporary; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â The nonconforming sign is unsafe or a hazard to the public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Any sign approved by a variance and any sign approved as part of a
comprehensive signage plan, or any other sign protected from such provisions by
New Mexico law are exempt from the provisions in this section.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â When ownership of property changes, nonconforming signs shall
obtain a city permit and be brought into compliance or apply for an extension
to continue the nonconformance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â If questions are raised as to whether a nonconforming sign exists,
it shall be a question of fact decided by the Land Use Administrator, and
subject to appeal to the City Council.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â When seeking protection for a lawful nonconforming sign, the
property owner(s), sign owner(s), sign user, or other person will bear the
burden of proof and must provide legally recognized documentation stating:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â A photograph of the sign;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â The signs' installation date;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Proof that the sign fully conformed to the sign ordinance in
effect at the time of installation;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â That the person installing the sign obtained all necessary
permits for the installation of the sign; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â That any changes to the sign have been made in accordance with
the requirements of the sign ordinance and is in compliance with all applicable
permit requirements.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Variance application. The City Council may grant variances from the
regulations contained in this chapter to permit a setback for a sign or street
graphic that is less than the required setback, and to permit the area or
height of a street graphic to be increased more than the maximum height or area
allowed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Approval standards. The City Council may grant a variance
authorized by this section if it finds the variance requested is required by
special or unique hardship because of:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of the premises on
which a street graphic is located; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Exceptional topographic conditions or physical features uniquely
affecting the premises on which a street graphic is located.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Additional requirements. The City Council shall grant a variance
only if it also finds that the variance is consistent with the comprehensive
plan and there are no other reasonable alternatives for displaying a sign or
street graphic permitted by this chapter if the variance is not granted.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The City Council shall not grant a variance solely because the
display of a sign or street graphic would be more profitable if the variance
were granted.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Appeal process.

Â§ 152.09 SIGN STANDARDS.
Â Â Â This section contains the standards for signs and street graphics. These
standards are intended for use by the public, Land Use Administrator, Code
Enforcement Officer, and City Council in evaluating how a sign user will
display signage and street graphics on a property, to ensure that the sign and
sign structure are safe and secure, and to uphold professional standards.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Design. The design of each sign, street graphic, or advertising
structure should be a product of professional quality and be compatible with
similar type business signs and advertising structures.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Construction standards. Supports for signs or sign structures should
be placed in or upon private property, should be securely built and constructed
of weather resistant materials, and be able to withstand high winds that are
prevalent in this area. The construction, installation, safety and maintenance
of all signs must comply with the State Building Code and all of the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Signs and sign structures must be structurally sound, located, and
secured so as to pose no reasonable threat to pedestrian or vehicular traffic.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All permanent freestanding signs must have self-supporting
structures installed on, or permanently attached to, concrete foundations.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â If possible, signs should not be in locations that obscure
architectural features such as pilasters, arches, windows, cornices, etc.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â The signs should not be in locations that interfere with safe
vehicular and pedestrian circulation or public safety signals and signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â No signs may be installed, constructed or maintained so as to
obstruct any fire escape, required exit, window, or door opening used as a
means of egress.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Signs on buildings should be permanently mounted to a building
facade or roof.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â All signs that require a construction permit under applicable codes
must be installed by a qualified contractor licensed in the State of New
Mexico.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Sign location. Signs should be positioned so that no maintenance has
to be performed from the road right-of-way. No sign may be placed so as to
block the view of motorists or interfere with traffic or pedestrians in any
way. Signs are prohibited from hanging over any property line.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Setbacks.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Side and rear setback. Unless otherwise noted in this chapter,
signs have a minimum side and rear setback of ten feet from the property line.
However, sign owners may apply for a zero to ten foot side or rear setback
through review and public hearing before the City Council. Through the review
process, the Land Use Administrator and the City Council will determine whether
a shorter setback will negatively impact adjacent property. Illuminated signs
must be setback sufficiently to prevent light from infringing on neighboring
property and may require a setback greater than ten feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Front setback. Signs (except ground signs which require a ten foot
minimum setback) are allowed to have zero front setback from the right-of-way
or easement.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Reflective signs. On-premise and off-premise reflective signs are
permitted.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Illuminated signs. Illuminated signs should be designed, located and
constructed to reduce glare and must not be placed to permit focused light to
be directed or beamed upon a public right-of-way so as to cause a traffic
hazard, or adjacent premises not under the same ownership and control, so as to
create a nuisance. Illuminated signs must be shielded so that no light is
emitted directly upward. Illuminated signs must comply with the city's outdoor
lighting ordinance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Electrical standards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â All electrical and service lines to freestanding permanent
outdoor advertising devices are required to be located underground.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Illuminated signs must comply with standards set forth in the
State Building Code, City Code, and are subject to city inspection and
enforcement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Prohibited in residential zones and off-premise. Illuminated signs
are prohibited in residential zones, are allowed as on-premise signs, and are
prohibited as off-premise signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Hours of illumination. Electrical illumination of on-premise signs
during nighttime hours is permitted subject to approval by the Land Use
Administrator in compliance with the city's outdoor lighting ordinance.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â General on-premise sign types. The on-premise sign types or
classifications referenced within this chapter are illustrated in the Figures
below, which are from the United States Sign Council, Inc. Guideline Code for
Regulation of On-Premise Signs (2018 ed.).

Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Additional limitations for signage on CSU lots.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Consistent with Â§
152.08(A)(2), above, signs and street graphics that are greater than 220 square
feet of total combined signage requiring a city permit on lots 2,200 square
feet or larger and signs and street graphics that exceed 10% of the square
footage of a lot that is less than 2,200 square feet require a CSP approved by
the Land Use Administrator.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Sign area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Sign cabinets. The area of a sign enclosed in a frame or cabinet
is determined based on the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet surrounding
the sign face.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Multi-sided signs. Only one side of a double-sided sign is
counted in determining the area of sign faces. Where the two sides are not of
equal size, the larger of the two sides is used for the determination of sign
area. The area of multiple-faced signs in which the interior angle formed by
the faces is greater than 91Â° shall be expressed as the sum of the areas of all
the faces, except for multiple-faced signs containing faces that are configured
back-to-back, in which case the area of the faces configured back-to-back will
be calculated according to the rule for double faced signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Round, oval and irregularly shaped signs. To be measured based
on the appropriate mathematical formula to obtain the sign area for a circle,
an oval or irregularly shaped sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Sign height. Sign height is measured as the vertical distance from
the base of the sign or support structure at its point of attachment to the
ground to the top of the highest component of the sign or sign structure. When
located on a man-made base, including a graded earth mound, berm, or fill, a
freestanding sign height should be measured from the grade at the edge of the
adjacent right-of-way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Additional on-premise sign criteria.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Free standing signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Pole signs. Pole signs may be located at the front property
line but must observe side and rear setbacks. No part of the sign structure or
sign face should encroach on adjacent property or obstruct view of traffic. A
minimum eight foot clearance from the ground to the bottom of the sign face or
any projecting equipment or elements on the sign structure or pole is required.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Monument, blade, and pylon signs. These signs must be located
outside of the clear site line triangle of streets and driveways and must not
restrict view of traffic. These signs may be located at the front property line
but must observe side and rear setbacks. No part of the sign structure or sign
face should encroach on adjacent property.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Wall or fascia signs. Wall or fascia signs attached to a
building must be permanently mounted to the building facade and designed to be
complimentary to the building's architectural features, fenestration, color,
texture, and orientation to the public right-of-way. Wall signs should project
no more than two feet perpendicular from the wall and should not project
outside or above the building facade.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Hanging signs. The distance from the ground or sidewalk to the
bottom of a hanging sign should be a minimum of eight feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Roof signs. All roof signs must be permanently affixed to the
roof of a structure. The supporting design should be structurally sound and the
roof must be sound. Roof signs are allowed on flat roofs and sloping roofs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Canopy sign on freestanding canopy. Signs may not project from
the canopy wall a distance greater than 12 inches. Any canopy sign should be
centered a minimum of six inches from the top and six inches from the bottom of
the canopy face.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Projecting signs. The minimum height to the bottom of a
projecting sign should be not less than eight feet above the ground or
sidewalk.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Marquee signs. Marquees are roof-like structures that project
beyond the building face and are permanently attached to and supported by the
building. Marquees may not project over the public right-of-way and should be a
minimum height of eight feet above the ground or sidewalk. Flat signs and v-
shaped signs may be mounted on a marquee and may not exceed the total allowable
sign area for the property.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Regulation of off-premise signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Purpose. By regulating off-premise signs, the city seeks to enhance
its scenic qualities, promote a safe and calming visual environment for
residents and tourists by preventing clutter and blight, and support local
businesses. In accordance with the State of New Mexico Highway Beautification
Act of 1978 [NMSA Â§Â§ 67-12-1 and 67-12-3] the city regulates the construction
and maintenance of outdoor advertising in order to promote public safety,
health, welfare, convenience and enjoyment of public travel, to protect the
public investment in public highways, and to preserve and enhance the scenic
beauty of lands bordering public highways.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â State Highway 195 designated as scenic byway. State HWY 195 is a
portion of the Geronimo Trail National Scenic Byway. The 2008 Corridor
Management Plan states the following regarding outdoor advertising on scenic
byways. â€œErecting new billboards on a designated scenic byway is prohibited
except in legitimate commercial and industrial areas. Areas identified as
lacking the unusual or distinctive features (intrinsic values), included in the
New Mexico State Scenic and Historic Byways program criteria, may be excluded
or segmented from existing or future byways designation, in accordance with the
intent of Public Law 102-240 (ISTEA), section 1046 and 1047. These segmented
areas of the byway would not be eligible for scenic byway funds.â€
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Off-premise signs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Size and design. Off-premise signs must be constructed of
durable materials, must be maintained in good repair and condition, and are
allowed no more than two sign faces. Permanent free-standing off-premise signs
that are not located on building walls or poles must be framed with either a
metal or aluminum frame or treated wood frame. Free-standing off-premise signs
are encouraged to use natural materials that reflect the city's rural and
rustic desert character such as treated wood, rock, stone, or dull metal
finishes. Free-standing off-premise signs should utilize high contrast between
background and copy to improve readability. Backgrounds should use muted colors
that blend with the desert environment. Text and graphics on off premise sign
faces should be designed to be large enough and legible by passing motorists.
The sign-face of off-premise signs may not exceed 48 square feet per sign face.
Cutouts or extensions are not permitted outside of or in excess of the
permitted sign area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Permitted zones. Off-premise signs are permitted only in
agricultural, commercial, and industrial zones and must be installed only in
compliance with all regulations for signs in this code.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Businesses without road frontage. Businesses located in the
city's agricultural, commercial, or industrial zones that do not have immediate
road frontage may install one off-premise one-sided or double-sided pole sign
or locate a sign on an existing sign pole or building wall on an adjacent or
nearby commercial or industrial property with road frontage. This type of off-
premise sign may not exceed 48 square feet per sign face. Legally permitted
non-conforming off-premise signs installed and inventoried by the city prior to
the effective date of this chapter are considered legal and are required to
apply for a sign permit and an extension to continue the nonconformance. The
addition of an off-premise sign for another business entity does not count
against the total permitted sign area for the on-premise business.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Setback requirements. Off-premise signs must be set back a
minimum of 25 feet from all property lines and placed so as not to pose a
visibility or other hazard to vehicular traffic in the vicinity of the sign.
Off-premise signs must be setback a minimum of 25 feet outside the right-of-
way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Sign area allowances. Business establishments located in the
city are allowed no more than four signs totaling 96 square feet of off-premise
signs. Business establishments located outside the city limits are allowed no
more than two signs totaling 48 square feet of off-premise signs. Business
establishments located in the city's agricultural and residential zones are
permitted one off-premise sign to be located in an agricultural, commercial, or
industrial zone not to exceed 48 square feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Sign faces. Off-premise signs may be single facing or double
facing. Both sides of double facing signs must be of equal size and facing in
opposite directions, where the backs are parallel or the interior angle between
the two display surfaces forms a touching 'V' with an angle that does not
exceed 30Â°.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (g)Â Â Â Distance requirements. All freestanding off-premise signs must
be located a minimum of 300 feet from of any other off-premise sign or on-
premise sign on the same side of the road.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (h)Â Â Â Height. Off-premise signs in undeveloped corridors may not
exceed 12 feet in height from the highest component of the sign measured from
the ground under the sign. Signs in developed areas cannot exceed the height of
any building facade adjacent to it. The lowest point of a freestanding off-
premise sign face(s) must not obstruct intersection clear site triangles.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (i)Â Â Â Multiple advertisers. Off-premise signs advertising multiple
businesses on one sign face are allowed. The total sign face may not exceed 48
square feet.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (j)Â Â Â Prohibitions. The following off-premise signs are prohibited
within the city limits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1.Â Â Â Digital off-premise signs with a changing sign face, multi-
prism signs, trivision signs, movable parts, side-by-side signs, and vertical
stacked signs are prohibited within the city limits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Additional signs attached to an off-premise sign or sign
structure and cutouts exceeding the permitted sign face area are prohibited.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 3.Â Â Â Off-premise signs may not be illuminated by any means.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4.Â Â Â Off-premise signs are prohibited in residential zones. Off-
premise signs are not permitted within 300 feet of a residential zone.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 5.Â Â Â Off-premise signs are prohibited on fences.

the right-of-way or easement.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â CEVMS are prohibited in residential sign districts and as roof
signs.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Operational limits. When in view of motorists on a public right-of-
way:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â CEVMS may contain static messages, movement or the appearance or
optical illusion of movement, animation, or videos.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â There should be no appearance of flashing or sudden bursts of light
or scintillating light. Illumination intensity or contrast of light level must
remain constant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The time interval used to change from one complete message/display
to the next complete message/display should be a maximum of one (1.0) second.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Display time and intervals between messages. The display time of
messages shall not be so fast, nor the interval time between messages so slow,
as to cause confusion or distract drivers. CEVMS displays violating this
section must be turned off or changed to a single, static message.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â There may be an appearance of a visual dissolve or fading, in which
any part of one electronic message/display appears simultaneously with any part
of a second electronic message/display.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Letter height should be large enough for messages to be legible and
easily read by passing motorists.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Audio speakers are not allowed with the exception that the sign
serves a governmental purpose.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â CEVMS should be designed so that the height, dimensions, angle, and
design features are compatible with the site and surrounding area.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (9)Â Â Â A maximum of one primary sign per premise with a single entrance
may contain a CEVMS that can be viewed from the public right-of-way. A CEVMS

to exceed a 30Â° angle.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (10)Â Â Â Additional CEVMS viewed from the right-of-way may be approved as
part of a Comprehensive Signage Plan for large scale developments and
properties with one than one entrance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (11)Â Â Â CEVMS must be equipped with a default mechanism that shuts off or
freezes the sign to static mode to prevent flashing if a malfunction occurs.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (12)Â Â Â CEVMS must be equipped with an automatic ambient light dimming
mechanism to adjust the display intensity according to the natural ambient
light conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (13)Â Â Â Light levels should not exceed 0.1 foot-candles 20 feet from the
abutting property line, and no lamp can create disability glare on adjacent
properties or the public right-of-way. Disability glare is defined as any
source producing greater than 2,500 nits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (14)Â Â Â As measured from the sign's face at maximum brightness, no sign
may display an illuminative brightness exceeding 500 nits (candelas per square
meter) during the night beginning one-half hour before sunset and 2,000 nits
during daylight beginning one-half hour after sunrise as published by the
National Weather Service for the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (15)Â Â Â CEVMS must have an automatic dimmer control to produce a distinct
illumination change from a higher illumination level to a lower level for the
time period between one-half hour before sunset and one-half hour after
sunrise.
(Ord. 208, passed 5-24-2023)
Â§ 152.11 TEMPORARY SIGNS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Temporary signs may be posted in any sign district of the city and
will not count toward the total signage allowed on a property, subject to the
following requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â A temporary sign may be posted only with the consent of the
property owner or occupant.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All temporary signs must be constructed and designed of materials
durable enough to withstand the elements to which the sign is to be subjected.
No temporary sign shall be illuminated or painted with light-reflecting paint.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â No additions, tag sign streamers, attention-getting devices or
other appurtenances shall be attached to any temporary sign.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â No temporary sign shall be located in the clear sight triangle,
obstruct or impair access to a public sidewalk, public or private street or
driveway, traffic control sign, bus stop, fire hydrant, or any other type of
street fixtures, or otherwise create a hazard, including a tripping hazard.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Signs in the right-of-way may not be located or posted on medians,
trees, utility poles, or other utility structures located in the right-of-way.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Nuisances. If any temporary sign becomes a nuisance as defined
elsewhere in the city code, such signs may be subject to removal, relocation,
or other actions to eliminate the nuisance.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â A temporary sign that remains in place for more than 90 days is
considered permanent sign that requires a new permit and that counts toward the

Â§ 152.99 PENALTY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The city Land Use Administrator shall initially determine compliance
with this chapter. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with
any of its requirements, shall be subject to a penalty. The city is hereby
authorized to require removal of any illegal sign, revoke any permit
authorizing the installation of a sign that has been constructed or is being
maintained in violation of the permit, enforce this chapter, and to make all
inspections required to ensure such enforcement.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â First offense will result in a written warning issued by the Land Use
Administrator in the form of a notice issued personally on the owner and/or
permitee, or by certified letter, return receipt requested addressed to the
owner and/or permittee at the address specified in the permit or the last known
address. The notice shall state the violation charged, and the reasons and
grounds for removal, specifying the deficiencies or defects and what repairs,
if any, will make the sign conform to the requirements of this chapter, and
specify that the sign must be removed or made to conform with the provisions of
this chapter within the notice period stated. The notice period for permanent
signs shall be 30 calendar days. The notice period for temporary signs shall be
48 hours. Failure to respond to the warning within 30 calendar days for
permanent signs and within 48 hours for temporary signs will result in the
issuance of a citation. Subsequent offenses will result in the issuance of a
citation without a written warning.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The owner and/or permittee of the permit may appeal in writing the
city's decision to revoke the permit to the City Council within 15 calendar
days from the date when the notice was served.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â If the sign is not removed or brought into compliance with the
provisions of this chapter and the sign review guidelines to the satisfaction
of the city and no appeal has been submitted at the end of 15 calendar days,
the permit is revoked. The city may then initiate the process for the removal
of the illegal sign and impose penalties.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Second and subsequent violations will result in a suspension of the
privilege to obtain a sign permit for a minimum period of six months up to a
maximum period of one year and a fine not to exceed $500 for each offense.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Re-installation of any sign or substantially similar sign on the same
premises after a violation notice has been issued shall be deemed a
continuation of the original violation.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Upon revocation of any permit the sign and/or sign structure shall be
removed by the owner within 30 calendar days or will be subject to removal by
the city at the owner's expense through action for recovery that may be brought
by the city.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Notwithstanding the above, the city may cause the immediate removal or
repair (without notice to the owner of the sign, or of the property on which it
is located) of any unsafe or defective sign that creates an immediate hazard to
persons or property. The city shall document its actions and avoid acts that
are arbitrary or capricious.

GENERAL PROVISIONS
Â§ 153.01 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
Â Â Â The Legislature of the State of New Mexico has in NMSA Â§Â§ 3-18-1-31 and 3-
21-1 delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to minimize flood losses. In addition, all regulations of
44 CFR, Section 59.1 through 60.3 et seq. are adopted by reference. Therefore,
the City of Elephant Butte, New Mexico does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 76, passed 11-17-2004; Am. Ord. 102, passed 5-2-2007)
Â§ 153.02 FINDING OF FACT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The flood hazard areas of the City of Elephant Butte are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and
extraordinary public expenditures of flood protection and relief, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by
occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to
other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise
protected from flood damage.
(Ord. 76, passed 11-17-2004)
Â§ 153.03 STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
Â Â Â It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Protect human life and health;
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
floodplains;
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future blight
areas; and
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood
area.
(Ord. 76, passed 11-17-2004)
Â§ 153.04 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
Â Â Â In order to accomplish its purposes, this subchapter used the following
methods:
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or
property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or
velocities;
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood
waters;
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may
increase flood damage; and
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
(Ord. 76, passed 11-17-2004)
Â§ 153.05 DEFINITIONS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
subchapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common
usage and to give this subchapter its most reasonable application.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â For the purpose of this subchapter, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context indicates or requires a different meaning.

date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction,
repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other
improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site,
such as the pouring of a slab or footing, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the state of excavation; or the
placement of a multi-section manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent
construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and
filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor
does it include excavation for basement, footing, piers or foundations or the
erection of temporary forms; nor does it include excavation for basement,
footing, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it
include the installation on the property of accessory building, such as garages
or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For
a substantial improvement the actual START OF CONSTRUCTION means the first

the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal
or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Â Â Â Â Â Â SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT. Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or
other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals 50% of the market
value of the structure before start of construction of the improvement. This
includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the
actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are
the minimum necessary conditions; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structureâ€™s continued designation as a
historic structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â VARIANCE. A grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this
subchapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A
variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise
prohibited by this subchapter. (For full requirements see Â§ 60.6 of the
National Flood Insurance Program regulations.)
Â Â Â Â Â Â VIOLATION. The failure of a structure or other development to be fully

Â§ 153.06 GENERAL PROVISIONS.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Lands to which this subchapter applies.  This subchapter shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of
Elephant Butte.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a
scientific and engineering report entitled, â€œThe Developed Conditions and
Analysis Report, Drainage Master Plan for the City of Elephant Butteâ€ dated
October 14, 2004 with accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood
Boundary-Floodway Maps (FIRM and FBFM) and any revisions thereto are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be part of this subchapter. FIRM dated
July 16, 1996 of Sierra County, Panel 485.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be
required to ensure conformance with the provisions of this subchapter.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, altered,
or have its use changed without full compliance with the terms of this
subchapter and other applicable regulations.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Abrogation and greater restrictions. This subchapter is not intended
to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easement, covenants, or deed
restrictions. However, where this subchapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
subchapter, all provisions shall be:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Considered as minimum requirements;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State Statutes.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Warning and disclaimer or liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this subchapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. On rare occasions
greater floods can and will occur and flood heights may be increased by manmade
or natural causes. This subchapter does not imply that land onside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within the areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This subchapter shall not create liability on the
part of the community or any official or employee thereof for any flood damages
that result from reliance on this subchapter or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.

improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to
and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base
flood level, providing the relevant factors in Â§
153.22  of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this
subchapter, the Appeal Board may attach the conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of the
ordinance (Â§
153.03 ).
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Variance may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â Prerequisites for granting variances:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Variances shall only be issued upon:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Showing a good and sufficient cause;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood height, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
Â Â Â (K)Â Â Â Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of
a functionally dependent use provided that:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The criteria outlined in Â§
153.23 (A) through (I) are met; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats
to public safety.

way or easements shall be granted to the City of Elephant Butte for the arroyo
up to the LEE line.
(Ord. 77, passed 1-5-2005)
Â§ 154.26 FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â  The City of Elephant Butte may participate in the construction of
permanent drainage and erosion control facilities to the extent that public
benefits are derived from the facilities and are consistent with Capital
Improvement Program (CIP) priorities.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Drainage facilities for crossing of major arroyos by arterial and
collector streets (major streets) shall be at public expense. Drainage
facilities for crossings of arroyos by streets other than arterial and
collector streets (minor streets) shall be at developer expense and shall meet
the design standards established by the City Engineer.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â All temporary crossings required for access, including those on major

channel crossing structures for major streets which are required for sole
access to a development.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â  The City of Elephant Butte shall not participate in the funding of
drainage and erosion control facilities in which the sole intent is the
reclamation of undeveloped land located within a flood hazard area for private
development purposes.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â The dedication of land for public purposes does not relieve a
developer of responsibilities for the construction of drainage and erosion
control facilities that would otherwise be necessary. The dedication of rights-
of-way or easements for drainage or erosion control facilities does not relieve
a developer of responsibilities that would otherwise exist for the construction
of other public infrastructure.
(Ord. 77, passed 1-5-2005; Am. Ord. 194, passed 12-16-2020)
Â§ 154.27 MULTIPLE USE OF RIGHTS-OF-WAY AND EASEMENTS.

Â§ 154.28 MAINTENANCE RESPONSIBILITY.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Except as otherwise noted herein, all permanent major facilities shall
be maintained by the city or other public body. The maintenance of multiple use
facilities to which the general public is denied access shall be the
responsibility of the owners and shall be performed to standards prescribed by
the City Engineer. The City Engineer may allow private maintenance within
public rights-of-way or easements, provided that adequate guarantees and
indemnifications are supplied.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Minor facilities, including driveway culverts, shall be maintained by
their owners to the City Engineers standards.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The maintenance of temporary facilities constructed at private expense
is the responsibility of the developer until permanent facilities are in place
and accepted by the city.
(Ord. 77, passed 1-5-2005)
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
Â§ 154.45 GENERAL ADMINISTRATION.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â  The design, construction, and maintenance of all drainage, natural,
and erosion control facilities within the City of Elephant Butte shall be
performed in accordance with procedures, criteria, and standards formulated by
the City Engineer and in accordance with the policies established by this
chapter.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â  All construction activities within the jurisdiction of the City of
Elephant Butte shall conform to the requirements of the City Engineer with
respect to drainage and erosion control. Original construction and
modifications and or additions to existing structures or facilities
constituting less than 500-square feet in plain view are excluded.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Construction, grading, or paving on any lot within the jurisdiction
of the City of Elephant Butte shall not increase the damage potential to
upstream, downstream, or adjacent properties or public facilities. Damages
shall be defined as those caused by flooding from the 100-year design and all
smaller storms and from erosion and sedimentation resulting from the 10-year
design storm and all smaller storms.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Any grading within or adjacent to a major water course shall
provide for erosion control and the safe passage of the 10-year design storm
runoff during the construction phase.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â  Grading, cut, fill or importation of materials in excess of 500-
cubic yards or grading of any area of 1 acre or more shall conform to drainage
and erosion control policies and to standards, criteria, and procedures
established by the City Engineer. A grading permit, issued by the City
Engineer, shall be required for projects involving more than 500-cubic yards of
material or 1 acre or more in area. Applications for development of areas known
to have been sanitary landfills shall be accompanied by a report which
discusses potential health and soil mechanics problems and their solutions. The
reports shall be prepared by a registered New Mexico professional engineer,
competent in soil mechanics and related health hazards.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Paving or repaving an area larger than 1,000 square feet shall
require a paving permit. Applications for a paving permit shall be accompanied
by a drainage plan, except for repaving of existing paved areas in which no
grading is planned.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â The City Engineer shall not issue a grading or paving permit unless
the proposed grading or paving is in compliance with the policies and standards
of this subchapter or other criteria established as good practices by the
industry or the City Engineer.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The city may participate with the private sector, other public bodies,
and agencies operating within the jurisdiction of this policy, in order to
accomplish the goals and implement the policies adopted in the subchapter. This
includes, but shall not be limited to, the development and adoption of master
plans, participation in the construction of projects, and exercising control
through the planning, platting, zoning, and permitting processes. Projects
involving city funding shall be prioritized, funded and scheduled within the
guidelines of the CIP and with CIP projects.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â It shall be the responsibility of the City Engineer to produce,
approve, make, and retain records of all drainage plans, drainage reports,
design analysis, design drawings, as-built drawings, and maintenance schedules
related to all drainage control, flood control, and erosion control facilities
constructed within city rights-of-way or easements.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Applications for all land use changes shall address drainage and
erosion control in terms of the interactions of these parameters with other
requirements and needs produced by the proposed land use changes.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Requests for the platting of land for the purpose of subdivision or
development shall be accompanied by appropriate drainage and erosion control
information.
Â Â Â (G)Â Â Â Storm drainage is a critical element in the planning and development
of the city and the following measures are to be taken to insure controlled
drainage.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The City Engineer shall not approve any plan or report pertaining
to proposed construction, platting, or other development where the proposed
activity or change in the land affected would result in downstream capacity
being exceeded.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Downstream capacity is determined based on the assumption of fully
developed watersheds. This assumption prevents â€œthe first come, first servedâ€
approach where downstream development unduly constrains upstream development.
Parameters used in the determination of downstream capacity include, but are
not limited to:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Channel-stability;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Crossing hydraulic capacity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â Retention pond capacity;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Hydraulic capacity of street, drainage ditches, or channels;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Public safety: and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â Maintenance constraints.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Planned public storm drainage facilities are assumed as in place in
determining downstream capacity, only if construction funds are available and
design has progressed to the point where capacity can be ascertained.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Temporary facilities are only allowed and/or required on a case by
case basis as determined by the City Engineer. The level of protection provided
by temporary facilities shall be determined by considering:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The likelihood and consequences of a failure;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Length of time until permanent facilities will be in place: and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â The acceptance of maintenance responsibilities and legal
liabilities.
Â Â Â (I)Â Â Â Requests for approval of development and/or platting proposals to the
City Engineer shall be accompanied by drainage and erosion control information
and/or commitments. The particular nature, location and scope of the proposed
development defines the degree of detail. One or more of the following levels
of submittal may be required based on the following:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Conceptual grading and drainage plan. A graphic representation of
existing and proposed grading, drainage and erosion control information. The
information should be of sufficient detail to determine project feasibility.
The purposes of this plan are to check the compatibility of the proposed
development within grading, drainage, flood hazard, and erosion control
constraints as dictated by on-site physical features as well as adjacent
properties, streets, alleys, and channels. Modifications to the Comprehensive
Plan and the development of area plans, sector plan, site development plans,
and landscaping plans on tracts of 5 acres or more are appropriate applications
of conceptual grading and drainage plans.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Drainage plans. A detailed presentation required for approval of
small, simple development approvals. Drainage plans are prepared in combination
with the detailed grading plan and address both on-site and off-site drainage
and erosion control issues. Drainage plans are required for building permits,
site development plans, and landscaping plans for developments involving less
than 5 acres.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Drainage report. A drainage report is a comprehensive analysis of
the drainage and erosion control constraints and impacts resulting from a
proposed planning, development, or construction project. Drainage reports are
required for subdivisions containing more than 10 lots or constituting 5 acres
or more, platting or construction within a designated flood hazard area and for
any platting or development adjacent to a major arroyo.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Erosion control plan. An erosion control plan is usually
incorporated into the drainage plan or drainage report. Erosion control plans
address all phases of each project from initial grading through and including
final occupancy. Phased projects require special attention. All construction
projects, both public and private, within the jurisdiction of this chapter,
unless specifically excluded, require an approved erosion control plan prior to
start of construction.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â Drainage control considerations shall specifically address safety,
convenience, and economics for both private property and public facilities.
Â Â Â (K)Â Â Â Design criteria is as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The Elephant Butte 10-year design storm is the 10-year, 24-hour SOS
TYPE 11-60 rainfall distribution such that the 1 hour rainfall is set at 60% of
the 24-hour rainfall.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â All detention and retention basins shall be designed in accordance
with the New Mexico State Engineers requirements with respect to maximum
retained volumes and evacuation times.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Design circumstances may require that other design storms be
considered. The source for rainfall data are current NOAA publications. When
the need for other design storms is apparent, the City Engineer will provide
requirements concerning appropriate storms, frequencies, and durations.
Â Â Â (L)Â Â Â The City Engineer shall, within 6 weeks after the submission of a
written request for the approval of a plat, development plan, drainage
submittal, or exemption, approve or deny the request and mail a copy of his or
her decision to the applicant. If the request is denied, the reasons for the
denial shall be stated in writing. Appeal of the decisions is as provided for
in Â§
154.47 of this chapter.
Â Â Â (M)Â Â Â Grading or paving permits issued by the City Engineer or approvals by
the City Engineer of drainage plans, erosion control plans or other improvement
plans within the context of this chapter shall expire by limitation and become
null and void if the work or improvements authorized is not commenced within 12
months of the approvals. In the event the authorized work or improvement is
suspended or abandoned for a period of 8 months after the work or improvement
is commenced, the permit or approval shall expire and become null and void.
Before the work or improvement is recommenced re-submittals must be made for
approval by the City Engineer.

of the provisions of this chapter:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of this chapter, any official representative of the city may enter
the premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or to perform any duty
imposed upon him or her by this chapter, provided that, if the premises be
occupied, he or she shall present proper identification and request entry. If
the premises be unoccupied, he or she shall first make a reasonable effort to
locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the premises and
request entry. If entry is refused or if the owner or other responsible person
is not found, the city representative shall proceed to obtain a search warrant
through the Municipal Court or district court, upon oath or affirmation.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â The complaint shall:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Set forth the particular premises, or portion thereof, sought to
be inspected;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â State that the owner or occupant of the premises has refused
entry;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (c)Â Â Â State that inspection of the premises, or portion thereof, is
necessary to determine whether it complies with the requirements of this
chapter;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (d)Â Â Â Set forth the particular provisions of this chapter sought to be
enforced;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (e)Â Â Â Set forth any other reason necessitating the inspection
including knowledge or belief that a particular condition exists on the
premises, or portion thereof, which constitutes violation of this chapter; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (f)Â Â Â State that the complainant is authorized by the city to make the
inspection.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Each inspector shall be furnished with an identification card
indicating his or her authority and must present same to the court for the
purpose of this division and to other persons, when requested to do so during
the performance of his or her duties. No owner or occupant or any other person
having charge or control of any premises shall fail or neglect, after proper
demand is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the
authorized inspector for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to
this chapter.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â When, after investigation, an order has been issued by the City
Engineer or inspector to the owner of the property on which a violation has
occurred and the order is not complied with, within the reasonable time as may
be prescribed by the City Engineer, or if the responsible party or violator
cannot be found or determined, the City Engineer may cause the remedies as are
necessary to be made. The reasonable cost of the remedies shall constitute a
lien against the property on which the violation occurred and was remedied. The
lien shall be imposed and foreclosed in the manner provided for in NMSA Â§Â§ 3-
36-1 through 3-36-6, as amended.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Any person or persons failing to comply with the provisions of this
chapter shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $500 or up to 90 days
imprisonment or a combination thereof. Each day the violation is allowed to
continue may be considered a separate offense.

Â§ 154.48 WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
Â Â Â  The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be

Â§ 155.006 ADMINISTRATION OF THE CODE.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â The Zoning Commission. There is hereby created a Zoning Commission for
the City of Elephant Butte.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Purpose. The Zoning Commission is tasked with holding public
hearings for requested variances, special use permits, and with hearing appeals
of certificates, permits, or licenses denied by the Land Use Administrator. The
Zoning Commission is further tasked with providing written recommendations to
the City Council as to the approval, denial, or modification of a request for
annexation, proposed subdivision platting or re- platting, zoning, allotted
time extension, amendment of this code, or any other land use consideration
within the zoning jurisdiction of the city based upon evidence received or
information provided from city staff and the public.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Membership. The Zoning Commission shall consist of three members
and one alternate each to be appointed by the Mayor with the approval of the
City Council. Each member of the Zoning Commission shall be a qualified elector
within the city.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Terms. Members shall serve staggered terms of two years each.
The earliest appointed alternate shall fill the earliest vacancy. Incumbents
who wish to remain on the Board must submit a letter of interest one month
prior to the expiration of their term.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Voting. A simple majority vote of a quorum of the Zoning
Commission is required for approval on all Zoning Commission actions. A quorum
requires not less than three members of the Commission present. An alternate
member may vote only if filling a spot of an absent member. In order for a vote
to be valid on a particular issue, a quorum must vote regarding the issue. A
member who abstains from voting on an issue is deemed to not have voted on the
issue. A member may only abstain from voting if he or she has a conflict of
interest. A Planning and Zoning Commission shall follow the Conflict of
Interest Statute for municipal officials, set forth in NMSA Â§ 3-10-5. Any
member of the Zoning Commission having a financial interest or possible
interest in the outcome of any policy, decision or determination before the
Zoning Commission shall disclose to each of the other members of the Commission
the nature of his or her financial interest or possible interest. The financial
interest or possible interest shall constitute a conflict of interest and the
member shall recuse himself or herself from voting or participating in the
discussion of that issue as a Commissioner. However, nothing herein shall
disqualify the member of the Zoning Commission from participating in public
comment in the same manner as any other citizen addressing the Zoning
Commission on the issue.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â General responsibilities.Â 
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Meetings. The Zoning Commission shall meet regularly on a

brought before the City Council.

flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This section does
not imply that land outside the areas of erosion envelopes, special flood
hazards, or uses permitted within the areas will be free from drainage or
erosion damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the
community or any official or employee thereof for any drainage, erosion or
flood damages that result from reliance on this section or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.

Administrator, upon consulting the City Engineer, shall examine the plans and
administer the provisions of this section as described within the section and
Chapter 154 and render a determination of compliance or non-compliance to the
Zoning Administrator. Cost for engineering services will be an additional cost

Â§ 155.053 FINDINGS OF FACT.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Flood hazards. The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to
periodic inundation which could result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of tax base, all
of which adversely effect the public health, safety and general welfare.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Flood losses. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect
of urbanization which increases flood frequency, flood heights, and velocities,
and/or the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses that are vulnerable to
floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately flood-
proofed, elevated, or otherwise protected from flood damage.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Erosion hazard. There exists within the city, areas which are subject
to soil erosion caused by flowing water which results in loss of property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental service,
public expenditures for erosion protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely effect the public health, safety and general
welfare.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Erosion losses. These erosion losses are caused by the cumulative
effects of urbanization, by inadequately treated flood and drainage facilities,
and by uses that allow construction of facilities in areas of erosion hazard.

Â§ 155.078 PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONE.
Â Â Â The PUD Overlay Zone is intended for those land uses that will by their
nature, have a greater impact on the environment and will affect larger areas
of the City of Elephant Butte. This classification is intended to provide an
alternative to the conventional approach to land use regulations by permitting
flexibility and innovation in design, placement of buildings, use of open
spaces, and off-street parking areas and to encourage a more creative approach
to the utilization of the land.
Â Â Â (A)Â Â Â Types of PUD Overlay Zones. The PUD Overlay Zone shall be classified
as follows:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Type 1. When an applicant, for whatever reason, wishes to deviate
from standard regulations or when an applicant proposes to use different land
use classifications within the same site such as a variety of residential
housing types.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Type 2. When a commercial or industrial land use is proposed that
will deviate from standard regulations or the applicant proposes to use
different land use or has the potential to create negative impacts on the
environment, infrastructure or adjacent and nearby properties. These include:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Community commercial;
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Neighborhood commercial;

Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Type 3.Â Mixed Use Planned Unit Development. The purpose of the
Mixed Use is to provide developers with a tool whereby tracts of land outside
of the Type 1 or Type 2 districts may be developed for multiple uses provided
the development is compatible with the needs of the residents. This makes
possible a mixture of land uses in such a manner that residential, commercial,
and industrial land uses may be juxtaposed if they are both internally and
externally compatible and complementary with the remainder of the community.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Total or phased development. A PUD Overlay Zone applicant may submit a
development plan for the entire area based on a Conceptual Site Plan for the
entire development, with development plans for areas within the overlay to be
developed as districts, in phases. If the district method is used then all

utilities, shall be submitted for evaluation.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â Procedures, requirements and standards for PUD Overlay or Districts. A
PUD District applicant shall meet and follow the procedures, requirements and
standards of the Subdivision Ordinance and all subsequent amendments except
that the Planning and Zoning shall consider flexibility and innovation in the
submittal recommendation. Site development shall meet the following
requirements:
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Land. The tract of land is under unified ownership or control and
shall be planned as a whole. If the tract is to be developed in phases, a
phasing plan shall be provided and each phase shall be reviewed on its own
merits.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Comprehensive plan. The PUD shall be in harmony with the City of
Elephant Butte Comprehensive Plan goals, policies and any complementary
reports.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Density. For residential uses in a Type 1 PUD where a variety of
housing types may be provided, the total number of dwelling units allowed shall
be determined by a density standard as
recommended by the Planning and Zoning Commission. Density will blend well with
adjacent zoning district.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Setback regulations. Due to the flexibility of the PUD concept it
is impractical to define an exact pattern for the arrangement of group
dwellings. Actual setbacks shall be established through PUD adoption and shall
compliment adjacent development.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â HeightsÂ regulations. Heights of building and structures shall
result in a development that will blend well with adjacent developments. Height
standards for antenna and communication towers or electric transmission lines
shall meet standards set in Â§
155.033 (G)(23) which are incorporated herein by reference as though fully set
forth and are adopted as a portion of this subchapter.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Open space. Common open space, varying in amount and location,
shall be provided to offset any substantial dwelling unit density, building
height or building setback within the districts:
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â Dedication of the land as a public park or parkway system; or
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â Granting to the City of Elephant Butte a permanent, open space
easement on and over the private open spaces so that it remains perpetually in
recreational use, with ownership and maintenance being the responsibility of
Owners' Association established with articles of association by laws which are
satisfactory to the City Council of the City of Elephant Butte.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (7)Â Â Â Streets, utilities, services, and public facilities. Because of the
uniqueness of each PUD proposal, the specifications and standards for streets,
utilities, services, and public facilities may be different from those normally
required in the Subdivision Chapter and all subsequent amendments if it can be
demonstrated by the applicant that the modification of specifications and
standards will not adversely affect the interests of the general public. In
addition, the PUD proposal shall illustrate how the streets, utilities,
services, public facilities, and traffic circulation will function and serve
the entire development. All proposals shall meet the applicable development
standards in the Subdivision Chapter and all subsequent amendments unless
otherwise justified by engineering analysis.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (8)Â Â Â Other information. Any other information that the Planning and
Zoning Commission deems necessary to properly assess the request for the PUD
district.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Phasing plan and performance bonding. A phasing plan for any district
within the PUD Overlay must identify the district and be submitted in
accordance with the Subdivision Ordinance and all subsequent amendments. A
performance bond executed by the developer and his or her surety company is
required prior to construction.
Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â Flood hazard zone requirements.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The maps used in identifying Flood Hazard Zones and in implementing
the provisions of City of Elephant Butte Flood Control Chapter
153. shall be the Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) produced by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) July 16, 1996, with any subsequent
revisions, and any floodplain study accepted by the Sierra County Flood
Commissioner.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â An approved development permit shall be required for all uses in a
Flood Hazard Zone. Application for a Development Permit shall be submitted to
the City of Elephant Butte Engineer for any and all development proposed within
a Flood Hazard Zone (as identified above) in conformance with Chapter
153 and
154 of this Code of Ordinances.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â All other applicable City of Elephant Butte, state and federal
permits are secured.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â Decisions and conditions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Approval. The PUD Overlay Zone request may be approved after a
public hearing has been held where additional conditions may be imposed.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Zoning permit. A zoning permit shall be issued only if the PUD
district site and/or structure, for which the permit is to be issued, are in
conformance with the approved development plan and only if all site and
facility improvements are in place adjacent to and in front of the location of
the building or structure.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Term. An approved detailed district site development plan shall
remain in effect for 1 year. If no construction has taken place within the area

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â Minor revisions.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â A minor revision to a district site plan includes rearrangement
of buildings, walks or parking and landscaped areas that do not affect the
access points, internal or external traffic circulation; does not increase the
number of parking spaces required; does not increase the number or size of
buildings; does not affect the drainage and grading plans. The City Engineer
may approve a minor revision of a district site plan.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The approved revision to a district site plan shall be filed
with the original site plan case file.
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Major revisions. A major revision is any change in land use or
buildings use from the approved district site plan; any increase in the number
of buildings, or number of parking spaces required; any change in access
points; internal or external circulation; any increase in the amount of storm
water drainage retention required; any change in grading that would affect
drainage capacity or adjacent properties.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (a)Â Â Â The developer/owner shall submit 12 copies of the major revision
to the Planning and Zoning Commission for review and approval.
Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â (b)Â Â Â The approved revised site plan shall be placed in the PUD/site
plan case file and a copy will be filed with the Sierra County Clerk.
Â Â Â (H)Â Â Â Finalization of development plan. Once the plan is finalized and the
developer receives approval to begin construction, the development plan will
become an ordinance for posting and passage by the City Council of the City of
Elephant Butte. Any changes or corrections will be made as an amendment to the
ordinance.

Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Short-term residential rentals are not commercial but are strictly a
residential use of the property.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â The provisions of this section are necessary to prevent a burden on

responsibility of property owners to ensure compliance within the applicable
neighborhood.
Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â Subject to the permit requirement above, nothing herein shall prohibit

compliance with the notifications. If the managing agent opts out to perform
this task, the $25 fee will not be charged.
Â Â Â (J)Â Â Â The owner or managing agent/agency shall attest that they have met
these requirements in each property registered as part of the initial rental
registration and each successive renewal registration. The form utilized to

Â Â Â Â Â Â (1)Â Â Â The number and type of jobs to be created, both temporary
construction jobs and permanent jobs (by New Mexico Department of Labor job
category);
Â Â Â Â Â Â (2)Â Â Â Pay scale of jobs;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (3)Â Â Â Determination of which jobs are expected to be filled locally and
which will be filled by transfers from other facilities or recruited from
outside the Elephant Butte area;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (4)Â Â Â Total payroll expected at start-up and after one year;
Â Â Â Â Â Â (5)Â Â Â Anticipated impact on local tax base; and
Â Â Â Â Â Â (6)Â Â Â Anticipated impact on local school systems.
Â Â Â (C)Â Â Â All applicants for economic development projects requesting economic
assistance from the city shall require review. This review shall focus on
environmental and community impacts of proposed projects. Special attention
shall be given to job training and career advancement programs and policies.
Projects shall demonstrate a strong commitment to providing career
opportunities for Elephant Butte area residents. Cultural impacts of projects
shall also be considered.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Any qualifying entity seeking assistance shall prepare and make

Â Â Â (E)Â Â Â All applicants for economic development projects requesting economic
assistance from the city shall clearly demonstrate the benefits, which will
accrue to the community as a result of the donation of public resources. The
city has considerable flexibility in determining what is considered as adequate
benefits. Benefits such providing components or production capabilities, which
enhance a targeted industry cluster, or addressing critical deficiencies in
regional economy, may be recognized. The benefits claimed of any proposal will
receive careful scrutiny. However, it is the intent of this chapter to be
flexible in the evaluation of these benefits, and to recognize the qualitative
as well as quantitative impact of a proposal.
Â Â Â (F)Â Â Â All applicants for economic development projects requesting assistance
from the city shall clearly demonstrate how the qualifying entity is making a
substantive contribution. The contribution shall be of value and may be paid in
money, in-kind services, jobs, expanded tax base, property or other thing or
service of value for the expansion or improvement of the economy. The city
retains flexibility in defining the substantive contributions. The benefits
identified in the previous paragraphs may be accepted as adequate contributions
on their own, or as cash donations may be required. Assistance in providing
affordable housing to its employees or the community at large may also qualify.
Determination of what constitutes an acceptable contribution for a given
project shall be at the discretion of the governing body.
(Ord. 101, passed 3-21-2007)
Â§ 156.008 PUBLIC SAFEGUARDS.

development project by provisions set forth in the agreement, which terminates
the agreement and specifies the disposition of all assets and obligations of

Â Â Â (B)Â Â Â The city shall retain a security interest, which shall be specific in

interest in the economic development project before the expiration of the
project participation agreement, the city retains the right to deny any and all
assignments, sales, leases or transfers of any interests in the economic
development project until adequate assurances are made that the transferee,
assignee or lessee is a qualifying entity and that the terms of the agreement
will be satisfied by the transferee, assignee or lessee. At its discretion, the
city may choose to deny said assignment, lease or transfer or may negotiate a
new agreement with the new operator, or the city may reclaim the facility and
enter into an agreement with the new qualifying entity.
Â Â Â (D)Â Â Â Any qualifying entity seeking assistance from public resources shall
commit to operate in accordance with its project participation agreement for a
minimum of 10 years from the date the chapter is adopted and the project
participation agreement is passed by the governing body.

approval by the governing body at a public hearing.

Development Plan and any or all project participation agreements undertaken
under its authority. Termination shall be by ordinance at a public hearing or
in accordance with the terms of the project participation agreement. If an
ordinance or a project participation agreement is terminated, all contract

be satisfied. Upon termination of the ordinance or any project participation
agreement, any city monies remaining in the city project accounts shall be
transferred to the cityâ€™s general fund.

criteria and the terms of all project participation agreements. Criteria
established under a joint powers agreement shall be consistent with the
provisions of this chapter.
