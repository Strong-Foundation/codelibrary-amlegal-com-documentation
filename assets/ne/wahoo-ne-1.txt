§ 11.02 REDISTRICTING STANDARDS.
   As provided in Neb. RS 17-102, the Council of the City of Wahoo, Nebraska,
has the responsibility for establishing not less than two nor more than six
wards within the corporate limits of the City of Wahoo, Nebraska, each ward to
contain, as nearly as practical, an equal portion of the population. The City
Council has established the following goals as a guide for determining the
distribution of population between the wards:
   (A)   Determining one person, one vote distribution of population among
wards. This concept shall be defended by limiting the difference in the
population between the ward with the smallest population and the ward with the
largest population to no more than 10%. The aforenoted deviation shall be
determined using the following process:
      (1)   Divide the total population of the City of Wahoo, Nebraska by the
number of wards. This establishes the “ideal ward” population.
      (2)   Calculate the “absolute deviation” by subtracting the proposed ward
population from the “ideal ward” population. This number represents the
difference between the “ideal ward” population and the ward's proposed
population.
      (3)   Calculate the “relative deviation” by dividing the “absolute
deviation” by the “ideal ward” population for each ward. This number represents
the percentage of deviation for a ward from the “ideal ward” population.
      (4)   Add the absolute deviation for the ward with the smallest
population and the absolute deviation for the ward with the largest population
and if the sum of these two percentages does not exceed 10%, the goal of one
person, one vote shall have been met.
   (B)   Establishing ward boundaries that are easy to describe to residents
(i.e. following streets in a straight line, or following geographical
boundaries).
   (C)   Limiting the number of ballots for other political subdivision
elections that must be created per ward.
   (D)   Obtaining a population of each ward that is as close to the “ideal
ward” population as possible.

   (A)   (1)   Any public body may hold a closed session by the affirmative
vote of a majority of its voting members if a closed session is clearly

the reputation of an individual. Such challenge shall be overruled only by a
majority vote of the members of the public body. Such challenge and its
disposition shall be recorded in the minutes.
   (D)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require that any meeting

all sureties are endorsed in writing on the said instrument by the Mayor and
City Clerk pursuant to the said approval of the City Council. The premium on
any official bond required to be given may be paid out of the general fund or
other proper city fund, upon a resolution to that effect by the City Council at

herein, shall be filed with the City Clerk for his of her official records, and
it shall be the duty of the City Clerk to furnish a certified copy of any bond
so filed upon the payment of a fee, which shall be set by resolution of the
City Council. In the event that the sureties on the official bond of any
officer of the city, in the opinion of the City Council, become insufficient,
the City Council may, by resolution, fix a reasonable time within which the
said officer may give a new bond or additional sureties as directed. In the
event that the officer should fail, refuse, or neglect to give a new bond or
additional sureties to the satisfaction and approval of the City Council, then
the office shall, by such failure, refusal, or neglect, become vacant, and it
shall be the duty of the City Council to appoint a competent and qualified
person to fill the said office. Any official who is re-elected to office shall
be required to file a new bond after each election.

§ 33.02 PLANNING COMMISSION.
   (A)   The Planning Commission shall consist of nine regular members who
shall represent, insofar as is possible, the different professions or
occupations in the city and shall be appointed by the Mayor, by and with the
approval of a majority vote of the members elected to the City Council. Two of
the regular members may be residents of the area over which the city is
authorized to exercise extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation. When
there is a sufficient number of residents in the area over which the city
exercises extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation, one regular
member of the Commission shall be a resident from such area. If it is
determined by the City Council that a sufficient number of residents reside in
the area subject to extraterritorial zoning and subdivision regulation, and no
such resident is a regular member of the Commission, the first available
vacancy on the Commission shall be filled by the appointment of such an
individual. For purposes of this section, a sufficient number of residents
shall mean 500 residents. The term of each regular member shall be three years,
except that three regular members of the first Commission shall serve for terms
of one year, three for terms of two years, and three for terms of three years.
All regular members shall hold office until their successors are appointed. Any
member may, after a public hearing before the City Council, be removed by the
Mayor, with the consent of a majority vote of the members elected to the City
Council, for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, or other
good and sufficient cause. Vacancies occurring otherwise than through the
expiration of term shall be filled for the unexpired portion of the term by the
Mayor.
   (B)   All regular members of the Commission shall serve without compensation
and shall hold no other city office except when appointed to serve on the Board
of Adjustment as provided in Neb. RS 19-908. All members of the Commission may
be required, in the discretion of the City Council, to give bond in a sum set
by resolution of the Council, and conditioned upon the faithful performance of
their duties. The Commission shall elect its Chairperson and a Secretary from
its members and create and fill such other of its offices as it may determine.
The term of the Chairperson and the Secretary shall be one year, and they shall
be eligible for reelection. No member of the Commission shall serve in the
capacity of both the Chairperson and Secretary of the Commission. It shall be
the duty of the Secretary to keep the full and correct minutes and records of
all meetings and to file them with the City Clerk where they shall be available
for public inspection during office hours. The Commission shall be funded by
the City Council from time to time out of the general fund. The expenditures of
the Commission, exclusive of gifts, shall be within the amounts appropriated
for that purpose by the City Council; and no expenditures nor agreements for
expenditures shall be valid in excess of such amounts. A number of
Commissioners equal to a majority of the number of regular members appointed to
the Commission shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business.
The Commission shall hold at least one regular meeting in each calendar
quarter, except the City Council may require the Commission to meet more
frequently and the Chairperson of the Commission may call for a meeting when
necessary to deal with business pending before the Commission. Special meetings
may also be held upon the call of any three members of the Commission. The
Commission shall adopt rules and regulations for the transaction of business
and shall keep a record of its resolutions, transactions, findings, and
determinations, which shall be a public record. The Commission shall make and
adopt plans for the physical development of the city, including any areas
outside its boundaries which, in the Commission's judgment, bear relation to
the planning of the city, and shall carry out the other duties and exercise the
powers specified in section Neb. RS 19-929. All actions by the Commission shall
be subject to the review and supervision of the Mayor and City Council. The
Commission shall make its recommendations to the City Council so that they are
received by the City Council within 15 days after the Commission begins
consideration of a matter relating to the comprehensive development plan,
capital improvements, building codes, subdivision development, the annexation
of territory, or zoning. The Commission shall be responsible for making such
reports and performing such other duties as the City Council may, from time to
time, designate.
   (C)   The Mayor, with the approval of a majority vote of the elected members
of the City Council, shall appoint one alternate member to the Commission. The
alternate member shall serve without compensation and shall hold no other city
office. The term of the alternate member shall be three years, and he or she
shall hold office until his or her successor is appointed and approved. The
alternate member may be removed from office in the same manner as a regular
member. If the alternate member position becomes vacant other than through the
expiration of the term, the vacancy shall be filled for the unexpired portion
of the term by the Mayor with the approval of a majority vote of the elected
members of the City Council. The alternate member may attend any meeting and
may serve as a voting and participating member of the Commission at any time
when less than the full number of regular Commission members is present and
capable of voting.

the regular members is unable to attend for any reason. Each member of the
Board shall serve a term of three years, unless reappointed, and shall be
removable only for cause by the City Council upon written charges and after a
public hearing. Vacancies shall be filled for the unexpired term of any member
whose term becomes vacant. One member only of the Board of Adjustment shall be
appointed from the membership of the Planning Commission, and the loss of
membership on the Planning Commission by such member shall also result in his
or her immediate loss of membership on the Board of Adjustment and the
appointment of another Planning Commissioner to the Board of Adjustment. After
the effective date of this section, the first vacancy occurring on the Board of
Adjustment shall be filled by the appointment of a person who resides in the
extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction of the city at such time as more than 200
persons reside within such area. Thereafter, at all times, at least one member
of the Board of Adjustment shall reside outside the corporate boundaries of the
city but within its extraterritorial zoning jurisdiction.
   (B)   The members of the Board shall serve without compensation and may be
required, in the discretion of the City Council, to give a bond in a sum set by
resolution of the City Council, and conditioned upon the faithful performance

each year and elect from its membership a Chairperson and Secretary. It shall
be the duty of the Secretary to keep complete and accurate minutes of all Board
meetings, showing the vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or
failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall keep records of its
examinations and other official actions, all of which shall be immediately
filed in the office of the Board and shall be public record. All meetings of
the Board shall be open to the public and shall be held at such times as the
City Council may designate, or at such other times as the Chairperson may, in
his or her discretion, call a meeting. Special meetings may be also held upon
the call of any three members of the Board. A majority of the Board shall
constitute a quorum for the purpose of doing business. The Board shall adopt
rules in accordance with the provisions of Neb. RS 19-901 to 19-914.
   (C)   It shall be the duty of the Board:
      (1)   To hear and decide appeals where it is alleged there is error in
any order, requirement, decision, or determination made by a city official
based on or made in the enforcement of any zoning regulation or any regulation
relating to the location or soundness of structures;
      (2)   To hear and decide, in accordance with the provisions of the zoning
regulations, requests for interpretation of any map; and
      (3)   Where by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, or shape of
a specific piece of property at the time of the enactment of the zoning
regulations, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition of such piece of property,
the strict application of any zoning regulation would result in peculiar and
exceptional practical difficulties to or exceptional and undue hardships upon
the owner of such property, to authorize, upon an appeal relating to the
property, a variance from such strict application so as to relieve such
difficulties or hardship, if such relief may be granted without substantial
detriment to the public good and without substantially impairing the intent and
purpose of any ordinance or resolution.
   (D)   (1)   No variance shall be authorized by the Board unless it finds
that:
         (a)   The strict application of the zoning regulation would produce
undue hardship;
         (b)   Such hardship is not shared generally by other properties in the
same zoning district and the same vicinity;
         (c)   The authorization of such variance will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent property and the character of the district will not be
changed by the granting of the variance; and
         (d)   The granting of such variance is based upon reason of
demonstrable and exceptional hardship as distinguished from variations for
purposes of convenience, profit, or caprice.
      (2)   No variance shall be authorized unless the Board finds that the
condition or situation of the property concerned or the intended use of the
property is not of so general or recurring a nature as to make reasonably
practicable the formulation of a general regulation to be adopted as an
amendment to the zoning regulations.
   (E)   In exercising the abovementioned powers, the Board may reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination appealed from, and may make such order, requirement, decision, or
determination as ought to be made and to that end shall have all powers of the
officer from whom the appeal is taken. The concurring vote of four members of
the Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision, or
determination of any such city official or to decide in favor of the applicant
on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such regulation or to
effect any variation in such regulation.
(Neb. RS 19-910)
   (F)   The Board shall be responsible for making such reports and performing
such other duties as the City Council may designate. No member of the City
Council shall serve as a member of the Board of Adjustment. No member of the
Board of Adjustment shall serve in the capacity of both Chairperson and
Secretary of the Board.

property included or planned to be included in any project, or in any contract
or proposed contract relating to any housing project. If any such commissioner,
officer, or employee involuntarily acquires any such interest, or voluntarily

adjusted accordingly when such rate is set by the County Board of Equalization
pursuant to Neb. RS 77-1601. The City Council shall pass a resolution or

§ 38.11 DEFINITIONS (ELECTRIC DEPARTMENT).
   For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply to the
Electric Department unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning:
   CUSTOMER. Any and all users typically connected via one or more billing
meters of the electrical system of the Electric Department, including all
persons, firms or corporations whose premises are served thereby and all owners
and tenants of real estate connected to said electrical system of the Electric
Department.
   DEMAND CHARGE. Non-coincident Peak kW and Coincident Peak (CP) kW with
system peak hour will be determined by metering in the current billing period.
Demands shall be determined by interval recording metering using 30 consecutive
minutes of consumption or with other industry accepted billing equipment, at
the option of the utility.
   IRRIGATION SERVICE. Applicable at three-phase services for motor loads of
greater than 10 HP used for pumping non-potable water and applied to the land.
   LARGE GENERAL SERVICE. Applicable to three-phase non-residential accounts
consuming more than 15,000 kWh monthly or 50 kW demand for four months billing
during any 12 month period. All services shall be at the available Electric
Department electric system standards.
   LARGE POWER SERVICE. Applicable at services for loads with any monthly
demand greater than 500 kW. LARGE POWER SERVICE is master metered three-phase
primary voltage. The minimum bill shall be the customer charge plus 500 kW
times the Winter Coincident Peak demand charge. The Power Factor shall be
maintained greater than 92% lagging or leading for the kW coincident with the
Power Generation Service Natural Gas billing period.
   LOAD FACTOR. Percentage ratio of measured kilowatt hours (kWh) to the
product of the maximum demand in kW times the hours during the specific billing
period.
   MUNICIPAL SERVICE. Applicable to facilities owned and/or operated by the
City of Wahoo, Nebraska.
   POWER FACTOR. Customer with demand meters are responsible for maintaining a
minimum power factor of 92% leading or lagging on a system coincident basis as
determined at intervals defined in the then current Power Generation Service
Natural Gas GFPS Rate. When power factor is less than 92% the metered
Coincident (CP) Demand will be adjusted my multiplying such CP Demand by the
difference of 92% minus the metered Power Factor percentage, (i.e CP kW * (92%
- metered power factor %)). In order to allow the customer appropriate time to
correct a low power factor, a customer transferred to or new to power factor
charges will not be billed for power factor adjustments on the first three
bills rendered to the customer after power factor metering has been installed.
   RESIDENTIAL SERVICE. Applicable to all separately metered single-family
living facilities which include cooking, bath and sleeping accommodations, to
include separately metered apartments, mobile  home parks, motel units and
rental units. Residential service shall not be applicable to structures/houses
where commercial business or income generating activity is conducted in the
major part of the premise. All residential service shall be single-phase
electricity. When units are individually metered for some services and other
services are supplied in different metering configurations, the various
services shall be billed in accordance with their individual load
characteristics.
   SMALL GENERAL SERVICE. Applicable to any single-phase or three-phase non-
residential customer with less than 15,000 kWh monthly consumption and less
than 50 kW demand. All services shall be provided at the available Electric
Department electric system standards.
   STREET LIGHTING. Applicable to all municipal street lights.
   WHOLESALE SERVICE. Applicable to any user of the electric system of the
Electric Department pursuant to a contract entered into between the city and

§ 94.55 EXTERMINATION.
   It shall be the duty of the owner, lessee, or occupant of any dwelling or
building to be responsible for the active and continued extermination of any
insects, rodents, or other pests therein, or on the premises. In the event that
the owner, lessee, or occupant of any dwelling or building neglects, fails, or
otherwise refuses to control and actively exterminate the insects, rodents, and
other pests in and about his or her premises, the Board of Health shall issue
notice for that person to do so. If the owner, lessee, or occupant has not made

§ 94.56 OCCUPANT.
   It shall be the responsibility of the occupant in a single dwelling unit,

§ 94.57 OWNER.
   The owner of a multiple dwelling unit shall have the duty to exterminate
therein for rodents and insects when infestation exists in two or more units or
when infestation exists in shared or public areas of a multiple unit structure
when the infestation is due to failure by the owner to maintain the dwelling in
an insect and rodent proof condition. The owner of a single dwelling unit shall
have the duty to exterminate therein notwithstanding the occupancy of a renter
or lessee when the infestation of insects or rodents is due to the said owner's
failure to construct or maintain the premises in such a manner as to make it
reasonably resistant to the entrance and habitability of such pests.

the court may together with the fine or penalty imposed, enter an order of
abatement as a part of the judgment in the case.

§ 95.001 MAINTENANCE AND CONTROL.
   The City Council shall have the care, supervision, and control of all public
highways, bridges, streets, alleys, public squares, and commons within the city
and shall cause the same to be kept open and in repair and free from nuisances.
(Neb. RS 17-567(1)) ('72 Code, § 8-101)
§ 95.002 OPENING, WIDENING, IMPROVING, OR VACATING.
   (A)   (1)   The municipality shall have power to open, widen, or otherwise
improve or vacate any street, avenue, alley, or lane within the limits of the
municipality and also to create, open, and improve any new street, avenue,
alley, or lane. All damages sustained by the citizens of the municipality, or
by the owners of the property therein, shall be ascertained in such manner as
shall be provided by ordinance.
      (2)   Whenever any street or alley is vacated, the same shall revert to
the owners of the abutting real estate, one-half on each side thereof and
become a part of such property, unless the city reserves title in the ordinance
vacating such street or alley. If the title is retained by the city, such
property may be sold, conveyed, exchanged or leased upon such terms and
conditions as shall be deemed in the best interests of the city.
      (3)   When a portion of a street, avenue, alley, or lane is vacated only
on one side of the center thereof, the title to such land shall vest in the
owner of the abutting property and become a part of such property, unless the
city reserves title in the ordinance vacating such street or alley. If title is
retained by the city or village, such property may be sold, conveyed, exchanged
or leased upon such terms and conditions as shall be deemed in the best
interests of the city.
      (4)   When the municipality vacates all or any portion of a street,
avenue, alley, or lane, the Municipality shall, within 30 days after the
effective date of the vacation, file a certified copy of the vacating ordinance
with the Register of Deeds for the county in which the vacated property is
located to be indexed against all affected lots.
      (5)   The title to property vacated pursuant to this section shall be
subject to the following:
         (a)   There is reserved to the city the right to maintain, operate,
repair and renew public utilities existing at the time title to the property is
vacated there; and
         (b)   There is reserved to the city, any public utilities and any
cable television systems the right to maintain, repair, renew and operate water
mains, gas mains, pole lines, conduits, electrical transmission lines, sound
and signal transmission lines and other similar services and equipment and
appurtenances, including lateral connections or branch lines, on, or below the
surface of the ground that are existing as valid easements at the time title to
the property is vacated for the purposes of serving the general public or the
abutting properties and to enter upon the premises to accomplish such purposes
at any and all reasonable times.
(Neb. RS 17-558)
   (B)   The municipality shall have power to create, open, widen, or extend
any street, avenue, alley, off-street parking area, or other public way, or

constructed on any of the streets, alleys, or public grounds. No person shall
drive over or upon or go upon any paving or other public works in any of the
streets, alleys, or public grounds while the same is protected by any signal,
barrier, fence, or railing, or until the same has been removed by the
contractors or by the duly authorized officials of the city. It is hereby
declared to be unlawful for any person to mar, deface, destroy, remove, or
carry away any street sign or highway marker erected either by authority of the
city or by the state of Nebraska, within the corporate limits.
('72 Code, § 8-105) Penalty, see §
10.99
§ 95.004 OBSTRUCTIONS PROHIBITED; PERMITTED EXCEPTIONS.
   (A)   Trees and shrubs growing upon or near the lot line, or upon public
ground, and interfering with the use or construction of any public improvements
shall be deemed an obstruction under this chapter. The roots may be removed by
the city at the expense of the owner of the property upon which the tree is
located should the owner fail, or neglect, after notice, to do so. It shall be
unlawful for any person, persons, firm, or corporation to obstruct, or
encumber, by fences, gates, buildings, structures, or otherwise, any of the
streets, alleys, or sidewalks. The public ways and property shall be considered
to be obstructed when the owner or occupant of the adjacent property shall
permit or suffer to remain on any premises owned or controlled by him or her
any hedge, shrubbery, bush, or similar growth within two feet adjacent to the
lot line whether there is a sidewalk abutting or adjoining such premises or
not. It shall be the duty of owners and occupants to at all times keep trimmed
and pruned all such similar growth. Whenever any such growth is allowed to grow
within two feet of the lot line contrary to the provisions of this chapter, the
City Council may pass a resolution ordering the owner or occupant to remove
such obstructions within five days after having been served with a copy of the
resolution by the city stating that the city will do so and will charge the
costs thereof to the owner or occupant as a special assessment for improvements
as herein provided, or shall collect the same by civil suit brought in the name
of the city against the owner or occupant. It shall be the duty of an owner or
occupant engaged in construction of any building or improvement upon or near
the public ways and property to have all excavations or exposures of any kind
protected and guarded by suitable guards or barricades by day and by warning
lights at night. In the event of failure, neglect, or refusal to comply with
the provisions of this subchapter, it shall be the duty of the city to stop all
work upon the buildings and improvements until suitable guards are erected and
kept in the manner aforesaid. Trees and shrubs growing upon the lot line
partially on public ground and partially upon the abutting property, or wholly
upon the abutting property, but so close to the lot line as to interfere with
the making of any public improvement or so that the roots thereof interfere
with any utility wires or pipe shall be deemed an obstruction, and such trees,
shrubs, and roots may be removed by the city pursuant to the procedure
prescribed above. In the event the property owner is a nonresident of the
county in which the property lies, the city shall, before levying any special
assessment against that property, send a copy of any notice required by law to
be published by means of certified mail, return receipt requested to the last
known address of the nonresident property owner. The last known address shall
be that address listed on the current tax rolls at the time such required
notice was first published.
('72 Code, § 8-106)
   (B)   Persons engaged in the erection, construction, reconstruction,
wrecking, or repairing of any building, or the construction, or repair, of a
sidewalk along any street, may occupy the public street space with such
building material and equipment as long as is necessary if such persons shall
make application to and receive a permit in writing from the city official in
charge of city streets to do so, provided that no permit for the occupancy of
the sidewalk space and more than one-third of the roadway of the public space
adjacent to the real estate on which said building is to be constructed,
erected, reconstructed, wrecked, or repaired shall be granted, and provided
further that a suitable passageway for pedestrians shall be maintained within
the public space included in the permit which shall be protected and lighted in
the manner required by the official issuing the permit.

§ 95.005 WEEDS.
   It is hereby the duty of the Street Commissioner or his or her duly
authorized agent to view and inspect the sidewalk space within the corporate
limits for growing weeds during the growing season, and if rank and noxious
weeds are found growing thereon, he or she shall notify the owner or occupant
thereof to cut down such weeds as close to the ground as can be practicably
done and keep the weeds cut thereon in like manner during the growing season
for weeds, provided that any weeds growing in excess of six inches on any
sidewalk space shall be considered a violation of this section. In the event
that the owner of the lot or parcel of land abutting said sidewalk space within
the city is a nonresident of the city or cannot be found therein, the notice
may be given to any person having the care, custody, or control of such lot or
parcel of land. In the event that there can be found no one within the city to
whom notice can be given, it shall be the duty of the Street Commissioner or
his or her agent to post a copy of the notice on the premises and then to cut
or cause the weeds thereon to be cut as therein provided and report the cost
thereof in writing to the Council. The cost shall then be audited and paid by
the city and the amount thereof shall be assessed against the lot or parcel of
land as a special tax thereon and shall be collected as are other taxes of the
city or may be recovered by civil suit brought by the city against the owner of
the parcel of land. In the event the property owner is a nonresident of the
county in which the property lies, the city shall, before levying any special
assessment against that property, send a copy of any notice required by law to
be published by means of certified mail, return receipt requested to the last
known address of the nonresident property owner. The last known address shall
be that address listed on the current tax rolls at the time such required
notice was first published.

§ 95.006 SALE AND CONVEYANCE OF REAL PROPERTY.
   (A)   Except as provided in division (G) of this section, the power of the
city to convey any real property owned by it, including land used for park
purposes and public squares, except real property used in the operation of
public utilities, shall be exercised by resolution, directing the sale at
public auction or by sealed bid of that property and the manner and terms of
such sales, except that the property shall not be sold at public auction or by
sealed bid when:
      (1)   The property is being sold in compliance with the requirements of
federal or state grants or programs;
      (2)   The property is being conveyed to another public agency; or
      (3)   The property consists of streets and alleys.
   (B)   The City Council may establish a minimum price for real property at
which bidding shall begin or shall serve as a minimum for a sealed bid.
   (C)   After the passage of the resolution directing the sale, notice of all
proposed sales of property described in division (A) of this section and the
terms of such sales shall be published once each week for three consecutive
weeks in a legal newspaper published in or of general circulation in the city.
   (D)   (1)   If within 30 days after the third publication of the notice a
remonstrance petition against the sale:
         (a)   Conforms to Neb. RS 32-628,
         (b)   Is signed by registered voters of the city equal in number to
30% of the registered voters of the city voting at the last regular city
election held therein, and
         (c)   Is filed with the City Council, that property shall not then,
nor within one year thereafter, be sold. If the date for filing the petition
falls upon a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, the signatures shall be
collected within the 30-day period, but the filing shall be considered timely
if filed or postmarked on or before the next business day.
      (2)   Upon the receipt of the remonstrance, the City Council, with the
aid and assistance of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk, shall
determine the validity and sufficiency of signatures on the petition. The City
Council shall deliver the petition to the Election Commissioner or County Clerk
by hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials, or by certified mail,
return receipt requested.
      (3)   Upon receipt of the petition, the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk shall issue to the City Council a written receipt that the petition is in
the custody of the Election Commissioner or County Clerk. The Election
Commissioner or County Clerk shall compare the signature of each person signing
the petition with the voter registration records to determine if each signer
was a registered voter on or before the date on which the petition was filed
with the City Council. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall also
compare the signer's printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and
city or post office address with the voter registration records to determine
whether the signer was a registered voter. The signature and address shall be
presumed to be valid only if the Election Commissioner or County Clerk
determines that the printed name, street and number or voting precinct, and
city or post office address match the registration records and that the
registration was received on or before the date on which the petition was filed
with the City Council. The determinations of the Election Commissioner or
County Clerk may be rebutted by any credible evidence which the City Council
finds sufficient. The express purpose of the comparison of names and addresses
with the voter registration records, in addition to helping to determine the
validity of the petition, the sufficiency of the petition, and the
qualifications of the signer, shall be to prevent fraud, deception, and
misrepresentation in the petition process.
      (4)   Upon completion of the comparison of names and addresses with the
voter registration records, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall
prepare in writing a certification under seal setting forth the name and
address of each signer found not to be a registered voter and the signature
page number and line number where the name is found, and if the reason for the
invalidity of the signature or address is other than the nonregistration of the
signer, the Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall set forth the reason
for the invalidity of the signature. If the Election Commissioner or County
Clerk determines that a signer has affixed his or her signature more than once
to the remonstrance and that only one person is registered by that name, the
Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall prepare in writing a certification
under seal setting forth the name of the duplicate signature and shall count
only the earliest dated signature.
      (5)   The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall certify to the City
Council the number of valid signatures necessary to constitute a valid
remonstrance. The Election Commissioner or County Clerk shall deliver the
remonstrance and the certifications to the City Council within 40 days after
the receipt of the remonstrance from the City Council. The delivery shall be by
hand carrier, by use of law enforcement officials, or by certified mail, return
receipt requested. Not more than 20 signatures on one signature page shall be
counted.
      (6)   The City Council shall, within 30 days after the receipt of the
remonstrance and certifications from the Election Commissioner or County Clerk,
hold a public hearing to review the remonstrance and certifications and receive
testimony regarding them. The City Council shall, following the hearing, vote
on whether or not the remonstrance is valid and shall uphold the remonstrance
if sufficient valid signatures have been received.
   (E)   Real estate now owned or hereafter owned by the city may be conveyed
without consideration to the state for state armory sites or, if acquired for
state armory sites, shall be conveyed strictly in accordance with the
conditions of Neb. RS 18-1001 through 18-1006.
   (F)   Following passage of the resolution directing a sale, publishing of
the notice of the proposed sale, and passing of the 30-day right-of-
remonstrance period, the property shall then be sold. The sale shall be
confirmed by passage of an ordinance stating the name of the purchaser and
terms of the sale.    
   (G)   Divisions (A) through (F) of this section shall not apply to the sale
of real property if the authorizing resolution directs the sale of real
property, the total fair market value of which is less than $5,000. Following
passage of the resolution directing the sale of the property, notice of the
sale shall be posted in three prominent places within the city for a period of
not less than seven days prior to the sale of the property. The notice shall
give a general description of the property offered for sale and state the terms
and conditions of sale. Confirmation of the sale by passage of an ordinance may
be required.

alley, lane, or similar public way. SPECIAL DAMAGES shall not mean those losses
or damages or injuries that a property owner suffers that are in common with
the rest of the city or public at large, even though those losses or damages or
injuries suffered by the property owner are greater in degree than the rest of
the city or public at large.
   (B)   Whenever the City Council decides that it would be in the best
interests of the city to vacate a street, avenue, alley, lane, or similar
public way, the City Council shall comply with the following procedure:
      (1)   Notice. Notice shall be given to all abutting property owners
either by first class mail to their last known address or if there is no known
address then by publishing the notice in a newspaper that is of general
circulation in the city. The content of the notice shall advise the abutting
property owners that the City Council will consider vacating such street,
avenue, alley, lane, or similar public way at its next regular meeting or, if a
special meeting is scheduled for such discussion, then the date, time, and
place of such meeting.
      (2)   Consent; waiver. The City Council may have all the abutting
property owners sign a form stating that they consent to the action being taken
by the City Council and waive their right of access. The signing of such form
shall have no effect on claims for special damages by the abutting property
owners but shall create the presumption that the City Council's action was
proper. If the abutting property owners do not sign the consent/waiver form,
the City Council may still proceed with vacating the street, avenue, alley,
lane, or similar public way under the authority granted by Neb. RS 17-558 and
17-559.
      (3)   Ordinance. The City Council shall pass an ordinance that includes
essentially the following provisions:
         (a)   A declaration that the action is expedient for the public good
or in the best interests of the city.
         (b)   A statement that the city will have an easement for maintaining
all utilities.
         (c)   A method or procedure for ascertaining special damages to
abutting property owners.
   (C)   The Mayor shall appoint three or five or seven disinterested residents
of the city to a special commission to ascertain the amount of special damages
that the abutting property owners are entitled to receive and which resulted
from the City Council vacating the street, avenue, alley, lane, or similar
public way. The appointees of the special commission shall be approved by the
City Council. Only special damages shall be awarded to the abutting property
owners.
   (D)   In determining the amount of compensation to award the abutting
property owners as special damages, the commission shall use the following
rule:
An abutting property owner is entitled to recover as compensation the
difference between the value of the property immediately before and immediately
after the vacating of such street, avenue, alley, lane, or similar public way.
If no difference in value exists, the abutting property owner is entitled to no
compensation.

CURB AND GUTTER
§ 95.080 CUTTING CURB.
   It shall be unlawful for any person to cut into any paving, curb, or
sidewalk for the purpose of constructing a driveway or any other purpose
whatsoever without first having obtained a written permit from the Building
Inspector therefor. Before any person shall obtain a permit, the person shall
inform the City Clerk of the place where such cutting is to be done, and it
shall be the Utilities General Manager's duty to inspect the place of entry
into the paving, sidewalk, or curb, before the same is cut. When cutting into
any paving, it shall be the duty of the party to cut the paving under such
rules and regulations as may be prescribed by the City Council or the City
Engineer. When the applicant is ready to close the opening made, the applicant
shall inform the Street Commissioner, who shall supervise and inspect the
materials used and the work done in closing the opening. It shall be
discretionary with the City Council to order the Street Commissioner, under the
supervision and inspection of the Utilities General Manager or the committee of
the City Council on the streets and alleys, to do the work of cutting and
closing the paving and charge the costs thereof to the party who obtained such
permit. The City Council may consent to the work of cutting and closing the
paving to be done by the party holding such permit. Before any permit is issued
by the City Council the applicant for such permit shall deposit with the City
Treasurer a sum set by resolution of the City Council for all paving, curb, or
sidewalk to be cut. Such sum shall be set on a per square foot cost of
construction basis. The deposit shall be retained by the city for the purpose
of replacing the paving, curb, or sidewalk, in the event that the work is done
by the city. In the event that the city elects to require the applicant to
replace the paving, curb, or sidewalk, the deposit shall be retained by the
city until the work is completed to the satisfaction of the Utilities General
Manager or of the committee of the City Council on streets and alleys. In
addition to making the deposit above set forth, the applicant shall, before any
permit is issued, execute a bond to the city with a good and sufficient surety
or sureties to be approved by the City Council in a sum set by resolution of
the City Council.

under the supervision of the Animal Shelter for a period of not less than ten
days. If upon examination by a veterinarian, the animal has no clinical signs
of rabies at the end of such impoundment, it may be released to the owner, or,
in the case of an unlicensed dog or cat, it shall be dispositioned of in
accordance with the provisions herein. If the owner of the said animal has

otherwise violates the provisions of this section, the city police shall
investigate the complaint and, if in their opinion the situation warrants,
shall notify the owner to silence and restrain such animal. Upon a second

variance to the strict application of this chapter for a period of not to
exceed 15 calendar days. Any person seeking such a variance shall file an
application with the Health Officer. The application shall contain the
information which demonstrates that bringing the source of sound or activity
for which the variance is sought into compliance with this chapter would
constitute an unreasonable hardship on the applicant, on the community, or on
other persons.
   (B)   The Health Officer shall have the authority to grant an extension to
any variance. Any person seeking such an extension shall file an application
with the Health Officer. Notice of an application for an extension shall be

that a sufficient controversy exists regarding an application, a public hearing
shall be held. All such hearings shall be held within five days after the
period for filing claims under this subsection has ended
      (2)   In determining whether to grant or deny any application, the Health
Officer shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the community, and other
persons of not granting the variance or extension against the adverse impact to
the health, safety, and well being of those affected, the adverse impact on
property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the variance or
extension. Applicants for variances or extensions and persons contesting
extensions may be required to submit any information the Health Officer may
reasonably require. In granting or denying an application, Health Officer shall
place on public file a copy of decision and the reasons for denying or granting
the variance or extension and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether
to grant variances and extensions.
      (3)   Variances or extensions shall be granted by notice to the applicant
containing all necessary conditions, including a time limit on the permitted
activity. The variance or extension shall not become effective until all
conditions are agreed to by the applicant. Noncompliance with any condition of
the variance or extension shall terminate such variance or extension and
subject the applicant to those provisions of this chapter regulating the source
of sound or activity for which the variance or extension was granted.
      (4)   The Health Officer may issue guidelines defining the procedures to
be followed in applying for a variance or extension and the criteria to be
considered in deciding whether to grant variances and extensions.

Officer under this chapter may appeal such decision or order to the Planning
Commission by filing a notice of appeal with the Board Secretary within 15 days
from the date of the issuance of such decision or order by the Health Officer.

filed a statement with the Health Officer, in writing of the time and place of
the hearing, which shall, in no event, be more than 15 days from the date of
the filing of the notice of appeal with the Board Secretary. The Planning
Commission shall, within seven days of the concluding date of the appeals
hearing, file with the Health Officer a written final decision, either
affirming the decision of the Health Officer, or modifying or reversing same. A
copy of said decision shall be forwarded to the appellant.

provision of this chapter may issue an order requiring abatement of any source
of sound alleged to be in violation of this chapter within a reasonable time
period and according to the guidelines which the Health Officer may prescribe.
Such abatement orders may be issued in lieu of prosecution for violation, and
failure to comply with any abatement order shall be a violation of this
chapter.
   (B)   The Health Officer shall order an immediate halt to any sound which
exposes any person to continuous sound levels in excess of those shown in
Table 8 below or to impulsive sound levels in excess of those shown in
Table 9 below; provided, that no such order shall be issued if the only persons

§ 116.01 FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.
   (A)   Mobile food vendors provide a beneficial service to the general public
within the city while, due to their distinct manner of operation, also
presenting substantial differences of circumstances from other food retailers
and vehicle users which suggest the expediency of diverse legislation. It is,
thus, desirable to regulate, and require licenses for, mobile food vendors so
that their transitory use of various properties and right-of-way locations can
occur in a fair and safe manner, and so that public safety and welfare can be
protected. The purpose of this chapter is to enact regulations to serve those
goals.
   (B)   While the city wishes to encourage the business of mobile food
vendors, the city also recognizes the benefits of permanent food
establishments. The owners of permanent food establishments make substantial
and long-lasting capital investments in buildings, infrastructure, and the
built environment. These investments benefit the city, improve real property,
and provide consistent locales for the entertainment and enjoyment of city
residents and visitors. The city wishes to cultivate and encourage the creation
and maintenance of permanent food establishments. Accordingly, it is also the
purpose of this chapter to encourage the co-existence of mobile food vendors
and permanent food establishments, to provide appropriate places for each
within the fabric of the city, and to accommodate the interests of each, toward
the goal of achieving a rich and diverse community.

   (A)   (1)   Every outdoor private, residential, or family pool containing at
least 24 inches of water shall be enclosed at ground level by a barrier or
fence with a minimum height of four feet and a maximum height of six feet.
There shall be no opening in the fence that permits passage of an object of

prevent access when not in use. Solid barriers which do not have openings, such
as masonry or stone wall, shall not contain indentations or protrusions, except
for normal construction tolerances and tooled masonry joints.
      (2)   In addition to the above requirement, when the wall of a dwelling
serves as part of the barrier, one of the following conditions shall also be
met:
         (a)   The pool shall be equipped with a powered safety cover in
compliance with ASTM F 1346; or
         (b)   Doors with direct access to the pool through the wall of the
dwelling shall be equipped with an audible alarm; or
         (c)   Other means of protection, such as self- closing doors with
self-latching devices, which are approved by the governing body, shall be
acceptable, so long as the degree of protection afforded is not less than the
protection afforded by divisions (a) and (b) above.
         (d)   Where an above-ground pool structure is used as a barrier, or
where the barrier is mounted on top of the pool structure, and the means of
access is a ladder or steps:
            1.   The ladder or steps shall be capable of being secured, locked
or removed to prevent access; or
            2.   The ladder or steps shall be surrounded by a barrier or fence
with locking hardware to prevent access when not in use.
      (3)   The intent of this barrier requirement is to prevent the
uncontrolled access to a pool or spa from adjacent properties, and from the
home.
   (B)   All fences enclosing private, residential, or family pools shall be
constructed to conform to the requirements of the City Building Code
regulations.
   (C)   All gates or doors opening through such enclosure shall be equipped
with a self-closing and self-latching device for keeping the gate or door
securely closed at all times.
   (D)   This section shall be applicable to all existing outdoor private,
residential, or family pools, and to all new outdoor private, residential, or
family pools hereinafter constructed, other than indoor pools, and shall apply
to all pools which have a minimum depth of 24 inches of water. No person in
possession of land within the city or the jurisdiction of its zoning ordinance,
either as owner, purchaser, lessee, tenant, or licensee, upon which is situated
an outdoor private, residential, or family pool, having a depth of 24 inches or
more, shall fail to provide and maintain such fence or wall as herein provided.
   (E)   Drainage of said swimming pool must not be onto any adjoining
property. There shall be no drainage of said swimming pool into the sanitary
sewer of the city. Drainage may be permitted into the storm sewer provided the
chemicals contained in said swimming pool are first diluted. All chemicals for
said swimming pool must be stored in a secure area.
   (F)   All newly constructed swimming pools must be inspected by the City
Building Inspector prior to being filled with water for the first time.

MOVING OF BUILDINGS
§ 150.030 REGULATION.
   It shall be unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to move any
building or structure within the city without a written permit to do so.
Application may be made to the City Clerk and shall include the present and
future location of the building to be moved, the proposed route, the equipment
to be used, and such other information as the City Council may require. The
application shall be accompanied by a certificate issued by the County
Treasurer to the effect that all the provisions regulating the moving of
buildings have been complied with on the part of the owner of the real estate
upon which the building is presently located. The City Clerk shall refer the
application to the Chief of Police for approval of the proposed route over
which the building is to be moved. Upon approval of the City Council, the City
Clerk shall then issue the permit, provided that a good and sufficient
corporate surety bond, check, or cash in an amount set by motion of the City
Council and conditioned upon moving the building without doing damage to any
private or city property is filed with the City Clerk prior to the granting of
any permit. In the event it will be necessary for any licensed building mover
to interfere with the telephone or telegraph poles and wires, or a gas line,
the company or companies owning, using, or operating the poles, wires, or line
shall upon proper notice of at least 24 hours, be present and assist by
disconnecting the poles, wires, or line relative to the building moving
operation. All expense of the disconnection, removal, or related work shall be
paid in advance by the licensee unless such disconnection or work is furnished
on different terms as provided in the company's franchise. Whenever the moving
of any building necessitates interference with a water main, sewer main, pipes,
or wire belonging to the city, notice in writing of the time and route of the
building moving operation shall be given to the various city officials in
charge of the city utility departments who shall proceed in behalf of the city
and at the expense of the mover to make such disconnections and do such work as
is necessary.

been violated during the operation. Upon a satisfactory report from the city
police, the City Clerk shall return the corporate surety bond, cash, or check
deposited by the applicant. In the event the basement, foundation, or portion
thereof is not properly filled, covered, or in a clean and sanitary condition,
the City Council may apply the money deposited for the purpose of defraying the
expense of correcting the conditions. If the expense of correcting the
hazardous condition is greater than the amount of the deposit set by the City
Council as required herein, the City Council may recover such excess expense by
civil suit or otherwise as prescribed by law.

the powers of a police officer. In accordance with the procedure and with the
approval of the City Council, the Building Inspector may appoint such number of
officers, inspectors, assistants, and other employees as shall be authorized
from time to time. He or she may deputize such employees as may be necessary to
carry out the enforcement functions. Upon presentation of proper credentials,
the Building Inspector or his or her duly authorized representatives may enter
at any reasonable time any building, structure, or premises in the city to
perform any duty imposed upon him or her by this code. Whenever any building
work is being done contrary to the laws of this city, the Building Inspector
may order the work stopped by notice in writing served on any persons engaged
in doing or causing such work to be done, and any such persons shall forthwith
stop work until authorized by the Building Inspector to proceed with the work.
Whenever any structure is being used contrary to the provisions of this code or
the Building Code, the Building Inspector may order such use discontinued and
the structure, or portion thereof, vacated by notice served on any person
causing such use to be continued. Such person shall discontinue the use within
ten days after receipt of such notice to make the structure, or portion
thereof, comply with the requirements of this code except as otherwise
hereinafter provided. The Building Inspector, or any employee acting in good
faith and without malice for the city in the discharge of his or her duties,
shall not thereby render himself or herself liable personally and he or she is
hereby relieved from all personal liability for any damage that may accrue to
person or property as a result of any act required or by reason of any act or
omission in the discharge of his or her duties. Any suit brought against the
Building Inspector or an employee, because of such act or omission performed by
him or her in the enforcement of any provisions of this code or the Building
Code, shall be defended by the legal department until final termination of the
proceedings. The Building Inspector may request, and shall receive so far as
may be necessary in the discharge of his or her duties, the assistance and
cooperation of other officials of the city.
('72 Code, § 3-601)
§ 150.046 UNSAFE BUILDINGS.
   (A)   All buildings or structures or portions thereof, hereafter called
"premises" which are structurally unsafe or not provided with adequate egress,
or which constitute a fire hazard, or which are otherwise dangerous to human
life, or which in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to safety,
health, or public welfare by reason of inadequate maintenance, are hereby
declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated by repair, rehabilitation,
demolition, or removal as set forth herein.
   (B)   The Building Inspector shall examine or cause to be examined every
premise reported to be a public nuisance as defined in division (A) above.
   (C)   If such premise is found to be a public nuisance, the Building
Inspector shall give to the owner of such premises written notice stating the
defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in charge of the
premises to commence within a reasonable time either the required repairs of
improvements or demolition and removal of the premises, and all such work shall
be completed within 90 days from the date of the notice unless otherwise
stipulated by the Building Inspector. If necessary, such notice shall also
require the premises to be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the
required repairs and improvements are completed, inspected, and approved by the
Building Inspector. The notice shall also set forth a date, time, and place of
a meeting of the City Council at which the City Council shall hear the
testimony of all competent persons desiring to testify respecting the condition
of the premise constituting the public nuisance, including the owner thereof,
which testimony shall include the estimated costs of abatement and other
matters which may be pertinent.
   (D)   Proper service of such notice shall be by personal service upon the
owner of record if he or she shall be found within the corporate limits. If he
or she is not found within the city limits, such service may be made upon said
owner by registered mail or certified mail. The designated period within which
said owner or person in charge is required to comply with the order of the
Building Inspector shall begin as of the date he or she receives such notice.
   (E)   The Building Inspector shall cause to be posted at each entrance to
such premises a notice to read:
   "DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE TO OCCUPY.
   City of Wahoo."
Such notice shall remain posted until the required repair, demolition, or
removal is completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written
permission of the Building Inspector, and no person shall enter the premises
except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the
premises.
   (F)   At the conclusion of the hearing of the City Council as set forth in
division (C) above, the City Council shall, by resolution, declare its
findings. If the City Council so concludes, it may declare the condition
existing to be a public nuisance and direct the Mayor and/or the Building
Inspector to proceed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the notice
as set forth in division (C) above or as modified by the City Council and set
forth within said resolution. Further, at the conclusion of the hearing of the
City Council, if the premise poses an immediate danger to the health, safety,
or general welfare of any person or persons, and the City Council so finds and
if the owner fails to remedy the situation in a reasonable time, the City
Council may summarily cause the repair or demolition or removal of such
building or structure. Such determination shall be considered a final order of
the city. The city shall thereafter file a copy of such resolution in the
office of the Saunders County Register of Deeds. No fee shall be charged for
such recording or the release of such recording.
   (G)   In case the owner shall fail, neglect, or refuse to comply with the
notice and/or resolution to repair, rehabilitate, or demolish and remove said
premises, the City Council may order the owner of the premises prosecuted as a
violator of the provisions of this code and may order the Building Inspector to
proceed with the work specified in such notice and/or resolution.
   (H)   If the city/Building Inspector proceeds to abate the nuisance, a
statement of the cost of such work shall be transmitted to the City Council.
Such costs shall be charged to the owner of the premises by the City Council,
after giving notice to the owner of the premises and the opportunity of the
owner to be heard regarding said costs. Such costs shall be charged to the
owner of the premises involved as a special assessment on the land on which the
premises is located and shall be collected in the manner provided for special
assessments and/or collected from the owner of the premises and the city may
enforce the collection by civil action in any court of competent jurisdiction.

therefor shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work;
provided, no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and
specifications for such work; and provided further, that such suspension or
abandonment has not exceeded one year. The Building Inspector may, in writing,
